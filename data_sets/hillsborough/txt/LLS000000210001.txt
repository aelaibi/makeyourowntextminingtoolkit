      Mr.       JUSTICE HIDDEN;                         Just over 15 months ago on Saturday,          15th April,

                1989, a football match was to be played at H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium,

                the ground of Sheffield W e d n e s d a y Football Club.                        T h o u g h it was
B
                their ground the match did not involve their team,                                but was to be

                played between Liverpool and N o t t i n g h a m Forest Football                         Clubs.

                It was a semi final                          of the F.A. Cup,   and therefore h ad      to be

                played on a neutral ground.
C
                           Simply because it was                  a semi    final,   and b e c a u s e of the

                support attracted by the two par t i cu l ar clubs,                         it was a mat c h

                which was bound to attract a great deal of interest.                                  It was a

                sell-out as an all ticket match;                           it was also to be tel ev i se d by

                the B.B.C.               later in the evening.

                           The match that afternoon was begun but not finished.                                     It

                began shortly after 3.00 p.m.                          The players had b e e n on the pitch

 k            for a little under six minutes when the match kic k ed off,                                         and

                ironically they had                         only p l a y e d for just the same per i od - a

                little under six minutes - when the match was stopped.                                   A

                Superintendent of Police, Mr.                         Greenwood,     ran on to the p i t c h to

 p            the referee who brought the game to a halt.

                           The tragic reason for the stopping of the game                           is n o w common

                knowledge.                 The press of peo p l e in the Leppings L a n e pens had

                created such intense pressure that                           some spectators were bec om i ng
                                                                                                          «


 G              trapped.              They were unable to move voluntarily in any direction,

                and were losing the ability to breathe.                              Spectators     in pens             3 and

                 4 were receiving crushing injuries from the forces be i ng exerted                           «




                on their bodies.                         From such injuries the horrifying total of 95

                people were to die, and more than 400 others were to need

               hospital treatment.                         Still more,   to be counted in their

                thousands,               were luckier in that they were not to be injured but

                were, nonetheless,                       caught up in the events as spectators present
B
                at, and involved in, the disaster.

                           Still more - this time to be c o u n t e d in millions who were

                not at the scene - were to witness wh at was happening in live

                broadcasts through the me di u m of th ei r television screens,                            or
C
                were to hear on their radios what was going on at Hillsborough.

                Among those millions were a number w h o were already aware,                               or

                quickly became aware, that they ha d l o ve d ones at the match.

                Some actually knew the position where their loved ones wo ul d be
D
                standing?              some thought they knew.             The knowledge or presumed

                knowledge led them to fear that,                         at best,    their loved ones mig h t

                be having a dreadful time,                       or, at worst,      as the events unfolded,

                that they might be facing the prospect                         of injury, or even of

                losing their lives.

                            The 95 who died, the hundreds who were injured, and the

                thousands who emerged unscathed had m a n y loved ones who obs e r ve d

                what was happening,                       either from their presence elsewhere in the

                ground, their presence outside the ground,                            or their position as

                viewers of television broadcasts e i t h e r simultaneous or recorded.

                 Still others listened to their radios.
                                                                                                     «

                 unscathed,               16 are before the Court as plaintiffs in separate

                         Hillsborough Stadium on the day in question.                    It is against him

                         that each of the 16 plaintiffs by their respective writs,                          allege

                         a cause of action in negligence and/or breach of statutory duty.
           B
                                   The course of these actions has been speedy.               On 14th May of

                         this year it was ordered by Rose J. that each pla in t if f serve an

                         amended Statement of Facts, with a generic medical                   report related

                         to the post traumatic stress disorder,                  and an individual medical
           C
                         report.              The Judge ordered that the trial proceed without

                         pleadings pursuant to Order 18 Rule 21 of the Rules                    of the

                         Supreme Court, and that all 16 actions be consolidated.                           So it

                         was that I began to he a r these 16 actions on Tuesday,                  19th June,
           D
                         and concluded the hearings the following Monday,                   25th June.

                                   Each plaintiff claims damages for personal              injuries and/or

                         physical harm, and consequential                 losses and expenses.     In each

                         plaintiff's case the damages alleged concern what the law has

                         conventionally known as "nervous shock", but is mo re accurately

                         described as "psychiatric illness".                  That is something more than

                         the sad, but inevitable,             human emotions of grief,       sorrow,

                         compassion and anxiety which occur in all bereavements.                           All

                         these emotions are felt as sharply and deeply in such a situation

                         as any human emotion can be.              For these emotions, however,              the

                         law gives no compensation.              It is important to realise that it is
                                                                                                       «


                         only for a defined psychiatric                 illness, which ac t ua l ly causes

                         psychiatric damage, that the law ma y give a recompense,                   and only

                          in certain circumstances at that.

                                    These test cases are brought by the plaintiffs              in order to

A
               seek to establish that in the case of each separate plaintiff the

               circumstances are such that the law permits him or her to obtain

               an award of damages for psychiatric illness which it is asserted

               that he or she has                        suffered.
B
                           Each case is defended by the defendant on the basis that

                there is in law no such liability to compensate the particular

                plaintiff in the particular circumstances.                             The defendant    says

                that either no such damage has,                            in fact/ been proved or,
C
                alternatively,                    if it has been proved,         then it was not foreseeable

                by the defendant and is too remote.

                           For the purposes of these actions                      the defendant has admitted

                negligence - that is to say a b r e a c h of duty of care - in certain
 D
                specific circumstances.                         It was f o r m a l l y admitted on behalf of

                the Chief Constable that he was in b r e a c h of his duty of care to

                those who died,                      or were injured b y crushing at Hillsborough on

  r             15th April,                1989.

                            A further admission was to this effect;                     on production by

                each plaintiff of a medical report to the effect that,                              on or

                after 15th April,                        1989, that pla i nt i ff had suffered some such

  p             psychiatric illness                        which was caused,     at least inpart,     b y the

                plaintiff's                 awareness of the events at Hillsborough,             and,

                provided that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care in

                 relation to nervous shock,                          and that the plaintiff could show

  G             causation,               then the          defendant admits     liability for the breach        of

                 duty of care involved.

                            Other admissions as to evidential matters were made b y the

                 parties,             which h av e reduced the oral             evidence before me to that

                by each plaintiff.                         I was not a s k e d     to make this assumption,    I

                of the actual psychiatric                           illness.

                           Ne x t the plaintiff must e s t a b l i s h that it was the
C
                defendant's actions which caused the                                infliction of that

                psychiatric illness.                         That    is the s e c o n d hurdle wh ic h the

                plaintiff has to surmount,                           namely,    the proof of the chain of

                causation between the de f e n d a n t ' s a c t i o n s and the damage suffered
D
                by the plaintiff.                         Again on the a s s u m p t i o n s I have made,                      that

                second h u r d l e has been cleared by a ll the plaintiffs.

                            It might seem,                 at first,    as t h o u g h a plaintiff who had

                successfully cleared both those h u r d l e s had now proved all that

                was n e c e s s a r y to entitle h i m to s u c c e e d in a claim for da m ag e s in

                n eg li g en c e against the defendant.                         That, however,             is not so.                  It

                 is not e n o u g h in law to pr ov e o n l y                    that damage to a plaintiff has

                been done by the actions of the defendant.                                       If that were so our

                 system of law would call for the p a y m e n t of damages to a

                plaintiff by a defendant against w h o m no fault at all had ever

                been proved.                      The fault w h i c h h a s    to be proved is known in our
                                                                                                                       4


                 system of law as negligence.

A
               guilty of negligence.                        This really means that the plaintiff must

               establish three further things:

                           (i)        that the pl a i n t i f f comes w i t h i n the range of persons to

               whom the defendant ow es a duty of care.
B
                           (ii)         that the defendant has breached that              duty of care to

               the plaintiff#                     and/

                           (iii)           that it was reasonably foreseeable that such a breach

               would cause damage to the plaintiff.
C
                          As to the first,                 that the p l a i n t i f f comes within the range

               of persons to w h o m the defendant owes a duty of care,                          it is vital

               to realise that it is a fundamental' concept of our law that a

               defendant does not o w e a duty of care to the w o r l d at large.                          It
D
               is important to s t r e s s at this stage that none of these

               plaintiffs sues for physical injuries done to their person by

               direct actions of t h e defendant.                        Rather,   they sue in respect of

£             mental injuries d o ne to them as a result of ph ys i ca l                        injuries

               actually inflicted/                       or feared to ha v e been inflicted on someone

               else# wh o m I have d e s c r i b e d as "a loved one".                   It is thus not the

                injury# actual or perceived,                       caused to the ori gi n al victim# but

p             the subsequent and con se q ue n t p s y c h i a t r i c illness of the

               plaintiff which m us t                     fall squarely wi t hi n the ambit of the

               defendant's duty of care to the plaintiff,                           and of his reasonable

                foreseeability of t h e consequences of his actions.

G                          I have tried t o set out these basic pr in c ip l e s of English

                law, which are as fam il i a r to lawyers as they are unfamiliar to

                others,           in order to demonstrate at the outset that a defendant

                does not owe a du ty of care to the world at large,                           but only to a

H              category of persons wh i ch the law strictly defines.

                                                           12

'                  The central question w h i c h a r i s e s              in all of these      16 cases

            is: does the plaintiff fall w i t h i n that ca te g o ry ?                     As the law

            stands at present/                 the co m m on law dr a w s a line between th os e who

            are related by various ties to th e v i c t i m of a defendant's
B
           negligence.               The line is d r aw n in order to decide whether or not

            those so related should be able to c l a i m dam a g es for p sy c h i a t r i c

            illness which they have suffered                    c o n s e q u e n t upon that neg li g e nc e

            to that loved one.
C
                    That line is at present drawn to permit claims which,                               in the

            words of Lord Wilberforce                  "do not ex t e nd bey o n d the spouse or

            children of the plaintiff."                   T h es e    16 c l a i m s seek to ha v e that

            line extended and drawn e l s e w h e r e                in order to include p l a i n t i f f s
D
            in other relationships of the victims.

                    Even with the line drawn, here,                    it is not every spouse or

            parent of such a vic t im w ho can suc c ee d                    in an action for

            psychiatric illness consequent up o n the defendant's negligence.
 L
            The law has evolved slowly over the last                          100 years or so, and I

            shall have later to look,                  I hope r e a s o n a b l y concisely,    at the way

            in which it has progressed,                  and at some of the cases            w h i c h have

 p         been the milestones upon that road.

                    Suffice it to say for the m o m e n t that                   in addition to being

            within the category of the p a r t i c u l a r relationship,                    there h a d to

            be some immediacy of observation by the plaintiff of                              the

 G         infliction of the injury upon the loved                          one,   immediacy of

            observation such as presence at,                     or near t h e scene of injury,            or,

            as the law developed,                  some close    i nv o l v e m e n t with its immediate
                                                                                                    «

'            Again,         in these cases the p l a i n t i f f s      seek to ha v e that line drawn

             elsewhere in order to include awareness,                         not as an eye witness,

             but through the m e d i u m of s i mu l t a n e o u s television of the

              circumstances of the infliction of the injury.                            There are claims
B
              also in relation to p a r t i c i p a t i o n in the events,               by reason of

              live radio bro a dc a s ti n g a n d / o r recorded television.

                        These are, therefore,            in every sense test cases,             and that is

              why I have sought to set out                   in simple terms what I understand
C
              existing law to be,              and w ha t    the pla in t i ff s wou l d wis h it to be

              at the end of this Judgment.                    It will n o w be my task to decide

              where that line should be dr aw n in relation to these                           16 actions.

                        It goes without saying that a l t h o u g h so far I ha v e been

              trying to talk in general               terms about all 16 of the actions,                   no

              two are the same.               Each has      its individual c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s and

              distinctions.             The p l a i n t i f f s differ from each other         in many

 r           different ways, but they di ff e r pa r ti c u l a r l y in three important
 b
              categories in relation to their own particular                           loved one.

                        The first is the fate of the loved one.                      The second is their

              relationship to the loved one,                    and the third is the m e d i u m

 p           through which they became                involved       in the events h a p p e n i n g to

              their loved one.                As to the first category it is a tragic fact

              that in all but three cases the plaintiffs'                         loved ones died;         two

              were injured, and one h a p p i l y emerged safely from the disaster.

 G                      As to the second category,                 the respective relat i o ns h ip s to

                  the loved one,         five fell w i t h i n the closeness of relationships

                  already known to the law,            that is to say within the cat e go r y of

                  spouse or parent:           there w a s a wife,       two mothers,      and two fathers.

               far has not produced a case of a suc c es s fu l claim,                              t h e r e were

               seven different relationships.                          T h e r e were sisters of three

               different victims, brothers of two,                            uncles of two,        a grandfather

               of one, a brother-in-law of one,                         a fia nc e e - un o ff i ci a l as it was
B
               said - of one, and a friend.

                          As to the third category - the m e d i u m through w h i c h the

               events were perceived - here,                      too,       t h e r e were many vari a ti o ns .

               Four plaintiffs witnessed the o c c u r r e n c e as eye w i t n e s s e s sitting
C
               in the West Stand at Hillsborough,                            and   a fifth was s i t t i n g     in a

               coach outside the ground and saw the events,                                or some of them,           on

               the coach's television.                      T h e r e were a further nine p l a i n t i f f s who

               saw the disaster as it evolved,                         not    as eye witnesses at the
D
               scene, but by watching television.                             An o th e r p l a i n t i f f became

               aware of what was happening by .hearing it broadcast

               simultaneously on the radio,                      and la t e r saw it thro u gh the m e d i u m

               of recorded film broadcast on television.                                The final p l a i n t i f f

               was first told in conversation,                         then heard a news it e m bro a dc a s t

               by radio,               and lastly saw it when r e c o r d e d film was p u t out on

               television.

                           It follows that wi t hi n these 16 cases there is a

               multiplicity of permutations of factual                              situations to wh ic h the

                law must be applied.                     I h a v e already      said that the law in

                relation to this particular aspect of the tort of negligence,

                namely that dealing with damages for psychiatric                                 illness in one

                person caused as a result of injury or apprehended injury to

                another,            has evolved gradually over the last 100 yea r s or so.                              I

                must go straight to the leading case on the subject,                                    as the law

                                                              15

                   The leading case in our j u r i s d i c t i o n            is McLoughlin -v-

        O'Brian [ 1983 ] App . Cas. p.                      1 4 0 , in w h i c h the House of Lords

        dealt co mprehensively with the h i s t o r y and development of the

        subject.                I cannot hope to achieve,            nor w o u l d   it be sensible to

        embark upon,                   an equivalent exercise,         and   I expressly do not              seek

        so to do.                 However,         I have to remind m y s e l f that there is no

        reason why the plaintiffs in these cases,                             and the many others

        interested in their outcome, should be f a m i l i a r with the case of

        McLoughlin -v- O'Brian and its p r e d e c e s s o r s .                     Therefore,           for this

        Judgment to be at all comprehensive to t h o s e who are actually

         listening to it today, and for it not to have the effect of being

        given almost                    in a foreign language,        it m i g h t be helpful if I seek

                            That is where the li n e was held to be in 1888.                                 The Court

                 was refusing to extend the                         line for fear that the fl o o d g a t e s

                 in Ireland, a different r e s u l t was achieved.                              The    Ir i sh Court

                 declined to follow the d e c i s i o n of the Privy Council                                 in the

 p              Australian case.

                             The plaintiff in Bell                  -v- The Great Northern R a i l w a y Company

                  1890,        26 L.R.I. 428 was a g a i n a lady and she was u n f o r t u n a t e

                 enough to be a passenger                         in a railway carriage w h i c h ran

                 witnesses testified that                         she was suffering from fright and

                  nervous shock, one of t h e m describing it as "profound                                    impression

      suffered would be a natural cons e qu e nc e of the fright.               Another

      said he was unable to detect any p h y s i c a l damage,           and put down

      her symptoms to nervous shock.                   The Court held that the negligent

      management by the defendants of the c a r r i a g e in which she was

      seated was admittedly the cause of the                  injury she sustained.          The

      Judge said:

               "It a p p e a r s        immaterial w h e t h e r the injuries may be

               called nervous shock, brain disturbance, mental shock,                   or

               bodily       injury."

      Thus, that lady was awarded damages for her "nervous shock",

      although she had suffered no physical da ma g e in the accident.

      The line had been moved on to include a plaintiff who wou l d not

      have succeeded in the earlier A u s t r a l i a n case.

                Back in England,         and moving into this century,      eleven years

       later in 1901 a pregnant lady p l a i n t i f f obtained damages as a

       result of nervous shock occasioned by fright.                  In Dulieu -v-

       White [19011 2 K.B.              6 6 9 , Kennedy J. considered the argument put

       before him "both unreasonable and c o n t r a r y to the weight of

       authority".            That was an argument that fright, where physical

       injury is directly produced by it, ca nn o t be a ground of action

       merely because of the absence of any accompanying impact.                        He

       thought that argument,              as I have indicated, unreasonable and

       contrary to the weight of authority.

                However, he limited the type of sho c k for which damages were

       recoverable to that suffered from fear                  for oneself only.       He

       said,
                                                                                   «

^                          shock which arises fr om a reasonable fear of immediate

                           personal injury to oneself."

               Thus the line had moved,                    but not that far.       On the basis of the

                lav as stated by Kennedy J.                    in 1901 the      16 plaintiffs in the case
 B
                before me would not have be en able to succeed because their

                nervous condition did not arise                       "from a reasonable fear of an

                immediate personal injury to themselves", but from such a fear in

                relation to their loved ones.

                           Nearly a quarter of a century later the lav mov e d on again,

                and the line vas redravn in Hambrook -v- Stokes [1925]                           1 K.B.

                141.          A mother vho sav an empty lorry running dovnhill tovards

                ovn safety, but for the safety of her children.                           The Court held,

                that the damages vere recoverable on the basis that the sh oc k vas

                caused by vhat she sav v i t h her ovn eyes, as distinguished from
 L
                vhat she vas told by bystanders.                        In vhat might be regarded as a

                prophetic passage, Atkin L.J. as he then vas,                         said:

                            "In my opinion it is not necessary to treat this cause of

 p                         action as based upon a duty to take reasonable care to avoid

                            administering a shock to vayfarers.                  The cause of action,       as

                            I have said, appears to be created by breach of the ordinary

                            duty to take reasonable care to avoid inflicting personal
                                                                                                   4


 G                         injuries, folloved by damage,                even though the type of damage

                            may be unexpected - namely,                shock.    The question appears to

                            be as to the extent of the duty,                and not as to remoteness of

                            damage.              If it vere necessary,    h o v e v e r , I should accept the

  H
    v i e w that the duty extended to the duty to take care to

     avoid threatening personal     injury to a child in such

     circumstances as to cause da m a ge by shock to a parent or

     guardian then present,    and that the duty vas owed to the

     parent or guardian;    but I c o n f e s s that upon this view of the

     case I should find it difficult to explain why the duty vas

     confined to the case of parent or guardian and child,           and

     did not extent to other re l at i on s of life also involving

     intimate associations;     and why   it did not eventually extend

     to bystanders."

     The 16 plaintiffs in this case do indeed seek to make the

duty of care   "extend to other r e l a t i o n s of life also involving

intimate associations", but they do not seek to extend it to

bystanders.

     It is important to note exactly vh at vas the shock to Mrs.

Hambrook vhich her counsel vas re ly i n g upon in that case.        He vas

one of the ablest and most loved c o u n s e l of his day, and one of

the Judges quoted him thus:

     "But Serjeant Sullivan, in his a b l e argument before us,

     expressly disclaimed any su g g e s t i o n that the shock to Mrs.

     Hambrook, which is said to have be e n the cause of her

     subsequent death, was due to or aggravated by her finding

     that the little girl vas missing       from the school,     or by her

     afterwards tracing her to and seeing her in the hospital.

     He relied upon the shock oc c a s i o n e d to Mrs.   Hambrook by the

     original apprehension of the imminent danger to her little

     girl,    or rather perhaps of the imminent danger to her three

     children        "

                                                                20

                          So counsel              in that cas e was not seeking to rely on anything

               else that happened after the accident,                       such as going to a

               hospital or matters of that. sort.                      Later on we shall see that the

               law moved on in that direction,                       and matters of that    sort came to
B
               be known as the doctrine of the Aftermath.

                          In Mrs. H a m b r o o k ’s c a s e it should also be noted that that

               particular Judge, who was                    in the minority,    Sargant L.J.,       would

               have sought to keep the line resting on the basis of shock caused
C
               by fear of injury to oneself,                    and not to have extended it to that

               caused by fear of injury to another.                        He said, at p.    163:

                           "In my judgment,             it would be a considerable and unwarranted

                           extension of the duty of owners of vehicles towards others
 D
                           in or near the highway,             if it were held to include an

                           obligation not to do anything to render them liable to harm

                           through nervous shock caused by the sight or a pp r e h e n s i o n of

                           damage to third persons."

                H e would not have allowed Mrs. Hambrook to win; however,                               she did

                win.

                           It is interesting too that he went on to say:

                           "It seems to me that,             when once the requirement is relaxed,

                           that the shock is to be one caused by the plaintiff's

                           apprehension of damage to himself,                the defendant is exposed

                           to liability for a consequence which is only reached by a

                           new and quite unusual link in the chain of causation,                          and

                           which cannot therefore be properly held to hav e be en within

                           his ordinary and reasonable expectation.                 And the extent of

                               this extra liability is necessarily both wide and

                              indefinite,                   inasmuch as it may v a r y with the precise degree

                              of connection between the person injured and the plaintiff,

                And then he asked this question:

                              "For instance,                   should it extend to a shock occasioned to a

                              The ques t io n posed in those last two sentences arise to be

                 answered in the cases before me today,                            both in the relationship

                 of sister to brother,                           and in relation to a plaintiff's loved one

                 who had,               "never been in imminent danger at all."                  And that Judge,

                 disagreeing with the majority of his fel l ow Judges, was using

                 those questions to demonstrate why he believed that the line

                     should stay where it was,                        and not be moved.

                               The questions which were troubling him centred upon,                        "the

                     extent of the duty of the defendant towards the public in or near

                     the highway."                    The next case in point      of time had nothing to do

                 with accidents, whether of the railway or highway variety.                                  It

                          He went on to deal w i t h the no t io n of proximity - an

                important word - which h e expressed                        in the words of Lord Esher in

               Le Li e vr e -v- Gould                   [1893]   1 Q.B.   491:

                          "If one man is near to another,                    or is near to the property

                          of another,                a duty lies upon h i m not to do that which may

                          In the same case A. L.                  Smith L.J. had referred to the

                principle:

                          "            that a duty to take due care did arise when the person

                          Thus,         in a case involving a gi n ge r beer bottle, Lord Atkin

               was h i st o r i c a l l y defining who,                in lav,     was to be regarded as a

               defendant's neighbour,                        and ruling that the principle of proximity

               was not to be confined to mere ph ys i ca l proximity, but was to be

               extended to                 include proximity of relationships between people.

                          That classical                  exposition of the        "neighbour" principle fell
 D
               to b e considered                       in Bourhill -v- Y o u n g    [1942] App. Cas. 9 2 , when

               yet another lady plaintiff, who was pregnant at the time of an

                accident,              sued for damages            in respect of fright resulting in

 £              severe nervous shock occasioned by b e i n g in the vicinity of a

                fatal crash to a motor cyclist.                             She be ca m e immortalised in the

                law reports and the text books,                            somewhat unfairly, as the

                "pregnant fishwife",                        and she failed       in her action.   The reason

 p             she failed was that since she was not within                               the area of

                potential danger arising as a result of the motor cyclist's

                negligence,                 she was not within the ambit of such persons he,                   the

                motorcyclist,                   could reasonably foresee might be injured by             his

                           Lord Porter said at p.                   117:

                          "I think I need say n o more than that                          if the facts of this

 L
                          is clear that a duty was owed by the defendant not only to

                          were, as he knew,                  on the premises,         wi th i n earshot, and

                          It is interesting to note that wh il e it was not necessary

               for the particular Judgment,                         Ormrod L.J. was extending the duty

^          be,   indeed, some hard cases,                    and hard results.         It is often said

           that hard cases ma k e bad law.                      Indeed,    in some States of

           Australia once the Courts have come to th e ir decisions                             in what

           may have been felt to be particularly ha r d cases,                           the

           legislatures of those States have e n a c t e d laws to specify to what

           degrees of rel a ti o ns h ip the law allows                    a remedy.

                   It is not for me to make any c o m m e n t on whether or not that

           firmly, by counsel on b ot h sides that,                        w h a t e v e r I decided in

           for others to con s id e r the questions r a i s e d                    in the House, of Lords

               More than an hour after the a c c i d e n t she was told of it by a

               failed before the High C o u r t , the trial Judge h o l d i n g that the

C
                            The Court of Appeal disagreed,                     ho l di n g that this was

               reasonably foreseeable, but they still dismissed her appeal on

                the basis that it was settled law that a d r i v e r ’s duty of care

               was limited to persons or ow ne r s of property at or near the scene

                of an accident,                       and directly a f f e c t e d b y his negligence.     They

               he l d that considerations of p o l i c y limited the duty of care,                               and

                reguired that it be not extended,                             and that accordingly,      since the

-               plaintiff had been 2 miles                         from the accident and had not hea r d of
E
                it until some time later,                        and had not seen its cons e qu e n ce s until

                still later, she was not e n t i t l e d to recover damages for nervous

                shock.             That was what the Court of Appeal decided.                      The case went

p              to the House of Lords.

                            The House of Lords found                   in h e r favour and allowed the

                appeal,            holding that the ner vo u s            shock assumed to h a v e been

                suffered by her had been the r e a s o n a b l y foreseeable result of the

             ju r i s d i c t i o n s .

                        Three months before the outbreak of th e Second World War,

             the High Court of Australia came to a m a j o r i t y decision in
C
             Chester -v- W a v e r e l y Corporation                     [1939],    62 C.L.R.   p.   1 , which

             denied a plaintiff mother damages.                               Her seven year old son had

             gone out to play and had not returned.                                A long search eventually

             fond his body floating in a trench.                               The s e a r c h had lasted for
D
             some hours, but the mother was only pres e n t                              for the last half

             hour when the b o d y was recovered.                            As a result of her experiences

             she suffered shock which impaired he r health.                                 The majority

             decision of the Court was that the d e f e n d a n t council had no duty

             of care towards her.                           In words w h i c h today,    50 years on, might

              sound a touch unrealistic,                          not to say unfeeling,       L a t h a m C.J.

                of the sudden and d i s t r e s s i n g death of a child,              p r o d u c e s any

                consequence of more t h a n a tem p or a r y nature in the ca se of

                bystanders or even of cl o se relatives who see the b o d y after

                death has taken place."

                A powerful,              and for m y part,   totally convincing J u d g m e n t of

       Evatt J., would have found the other way,                         and have a w a r d e d the

       plaintiff d a m a g e s .

                In Canada in 1967, the Sas k at c he w an Court of Ap pe a l                  dealt    in

       Abramzik -v- Brenner 65, D.L.R.                    (2 d ) wi th the claim of a mo t h er

       who suffered nervous shock and res u lt i ng physical illness on

       being told that two of her chi l dr e n had been killed as a result

       of the d e f e n d a n t ’s driving.           The Court he l d that the d e f e n d a n t

       h a d no duty of care because                 a reasonable man in the d e f e n d a n t ' s

       position would not have fo r es e en nervous shock re s ul t in g to her

        from his conduct.

                 Culliton C.J.S. held that the plaintiff could o n l y re co v er

       damages in respect of ne rv o us                shock      "if it can be p r o v e d   that the

       defendant ought, as a r e a s o n a b l e man,               to have foreseen n e r v o u s

        shock (as opposed to physical                  injury)      to the plaintiff as the

        result of his conduct."

                 However,        in America in       1968 we see a case of m u c h m or e

        importance.            In the case of Dillon -v- Legg,               69 C a l . Rptr.    72 the

        Supreme Court of California decided in favour of a m o t h e r who had

        sustained emotional shock and physical                       injury from w i t n e s s i n g in

               past American decisions had barred the mot h er ' s recovery, but

               after a ma st e rl y                      survey of American,   En g li s h and Commonwealth

               decisions, c o n c l u d e d that:

                          "To deny recovery would be to chain this state to an

                          credence.                 No good reason compels our captivity to

                          indefensible orthodoxy."
C
                          So far as the Californian Courts w e r e concerned,                      the line

               was being firmly redrawn.

                           In Canada in 1971 the case of M a r s h a l l -v- Lionel

               Enterprises,                  25 D.L.R.         (3d),   1 4 1 , decided that where a husband

               suffered grievous                          injury when the cl u tc h on a snowmobile broke,

               and his wife suffered severe nervous shock when she came upon h i m

               badly injured shortly after the accident,                             it could be said that

               nervous shock to the wife was reasonably foreseeable by a
 L
               defendant.

                           Haines J.              in the Ontario High Court he l d that the test must

               be the foreseeability of nervous shock itself,                              and went on to

 F              say:

                           "There should exist a duty not to cau s e nervous shock to

                           others when                   it can be foreseen as the likely result of

                           certain conduct.                    Since our state of knowledge is constantly

G                          broadening,                   the scope of the duty of care must expand

                           accordingly.                    Since it is the kno w le d ge of an average man

                           that is to be attributed to the defendant and since his

                           "In answer to these nagging worries",                   the Judge continued,

                           ”1 can do little better than to quote the statement of Lord

                          Wright in Bourhill and Young:

                                       'The lawyer likes to draw and to fix and de f in e lines

                                      and is apt to ask where the thing is to stop.                   I should

                                      reply it is to stop where in the particular case the

                                      good sense of the Jury or of the Judge decides.'"

~             Haines J. went on:
E
                           "The        'good s e n s e ’ of the Judge or the Jury must,          of course,

                           take into account the k n o w l e d g e of the time.              It is this

                           The following year,              1972,    in Australia, and,     indeed,    in the

               State of Victoria where this historical journey began,                             the case

               of Benson -v- Lee [1972] V.R.                        8 7 9 , dealt with the c l a i m of a

              where she was informed that he was dead.                                 She instituted

                          The Judgment of Lush J.                     in Victoria was expressly approved

              by Lord Wilberforce in the House of Lords                                in McLouqhlin -v-

               Australian Judge in finding the decision based soundly upon:

                           "            direct perception of some of th e events which go to

                           make up the accident as an entire event,                         and this

                           in c lu d es                  the immediate aftermath. ”

                           I shall br ea k off this exercise to point out that one of the

               Benson -v- Lee deserves to be mentioned at this stage.                                     It was

               not referred to in McLouqhlin -v- O ' B r i a n , nor was it cited in

                   argument in the instant case, but it is wo rt h y of note in that it

p                  is the only case that I have been able to discover which deals

                   with the relationship between brother and sister in a claim for

                   nervous shock.                    It is the case of Storm -v- Geeves, T a s . S.R.

                 factual and legal situation in these words:

                             "It needs no imagination to realise how the t e r r i b l e picture

 C
                            hope of quick relief must have burned into the b r a i n s of the

                             child's mother/ brother and sister and the anguish and grief

                             they must have suffered.            But the law wisely stops     short of

                             any attempt to assess hum a n grief and anguish in the terms

                             of money - these things cannot be the subject of

                             compensation in money.            It remains true that deat.h of itself

                             is not a cause of action.            A bereft relative in a case like

 £                             the present is only entitled to damages if it is established

                             by acceptable evidence that he or she has suffered               from some

                             form of medically recognisable neurosis or damage to the

                             mind going beyond ordinary human grief or anguish.                Where

 p                             one begins and the other ends may be a difficult ta sk for

                             the judge or psychiatrist - to say nothing of the              task of

                              attempting to disentangle the two for the purpose of

                              assessing the proper amount of damages."

 G                             The Judge had already found that injury by nervous             shock was

                  reasonably foreseeable,                 as was the fact that:

                              "a mother, brother or sister of a beloved child as a result

                          After a careful review of common law authorities he awarded

D
                          This case is of sign i fi c an c e, not only in demonstrating that

              a Court in a common law jurisdiction has widened the categories

              of relationship where damages can be r e c o v e r e d for nervous shock

n             caused by injury to a loved one beyond the conventional

              relationships of spouse and parent#                           to include also those of

              brother and sister.                         Interestingly,    it is a further demonstration

               that it is not me r el y the fact of the relationship which will

p             suffice to sustain a claim for damages,                          but that there must also

              be proved nervous shock in the sense of psychiatric illness,

P            0'B r i a n in 1982.                     The floodgates argument was central to the

              t h i n k i n g of their Lordships in the                   1888 Privy Council case     in

              r e f u s i n g to award damages:

                         "arising from mere sudden terror unaccompanied by any actual

n                        physical injury, but oc c a s i o n i n g a nervous or mental shock."
Ej


                         Sir Richard Couch had used the words which I have already

              quoted:

                         "The difficulty which n o w often exists in cases of alleged

p                        physical injuries of det er m in i ng whether they were ca u se d by

                         the negligent act wo u ld be greatly increased,                    and a wide

                         field opened for imaginary c l a i m s . ”

                         It was entirely upon that basis that the Privy Council held

G            that the damages were too remote.

                 Tobriner J. in D i l l o n -v- L e q q , which I ha v e recently read,                    and

                 from his remedy and leaving to Parliament to legislate for a

                 change in the law.                            He said this:

p                          "To attempt                   to   draw a line at the furthest point which any

            when facing this problem,                       is entitled not to conclude that a line

            restricting a potential liability of a defendant is already

            firmly and inexorably drawn,                       but,   rather,   is entitled to redraw

            that line where,                      in the par t ic u la r case, the Court,   enlightened

            b y progressive awareness of mental illness, decides.

                       From the speeches of their Lordships in McLo u qh l in -v-

            0 1B r i a n , it is clear that                 it is not only in the p r o x i m i t y of the

            relationship between the plaintiff and the victim of the accident

            that the common law must be free to move on, it is also                             in the

            degree of proximity in time and space to the accident,                             and also

                          If the common lav is entitled to extend the right to

              recovery for damages for nervous shock,                           or rather psychiatric

               illness,            then one is forced to consider the three elements which

              are right for extension,                         namelys
B
                          (i)        the relationship between the plaintiff and the original

              victim of the defendant's negligence - the loved one.

                          (ii)          the relationship in time and space between the

              plaintiff and the scene of the original negligence.
C
                          (iii)          the medium through wh i ch the plaintiff becomes

              conscious of the original negligence.

                          Just as McLouqhlin -v- 0 1Brian shows that the common law

              should not remain frozen but should consider in any given case
D
              whether it is right to extend the line in relation to any of

              these elements,                     so must it in consequence be right to consider

              what and where new limitations should be put upon the right to

              recover damages for psychiatric illness.

                          Lord Wilberforce at p. 418 set out the position in such

              cases.             He said;

                          "As the result of that and other cases,                   assuming that they

                          are accepted as correct, the following position has been

                          reached:

                                   1.                  While damages cannot,   at common law, be awareded for

                          grief and sorrow,                  a claim for damages for   'nervous shock'
                                                                                                »


                          caused by negligence can be made without the necessity of

                          showing direct impact or fear of immediate personal injuries

                            ought,          in my opinion,         to be accepted.     But we have to
B
                            consider whether,                  and how far,    it c a n be applied to such

                            cases as the present."

                Then he went on:

                            "Throughout these developments,                     as can be seen, the courts
C
                            have proceeded                  in the traditional ma nn e r of the common law

                            from case to case, upon a basis of logical necessity.                        If a

                            mother,           w i t h or without accompanying children,         could recover

                            on account of fear for herself, how can she be denied
D
                            recovery on account of fear for her accompanying children?

                            If a father could recover had he seen his child run over by

                            a ba c ki n g car, h ow can he be denied recovery if he is in the

                             immediate vic i ni t y and runs to the child's assistance?                      If a

                            wife and m o t h e r could recover if she had witnessed a serious

                            accident to her husband and children,                     does she fail because

                            she was a short distance away and immediately rushes to the

                            scene                  I think that, unless the law is to draw an

                            arbitrary              line at the point of direct sight and sound, these

                            arguments req u ir e acceptance of the extension mentioned

                            above under principle 4 in the interest of justice."

                            Lord W i l b e r f o r c e then followed the process of logical

                progression,                   and concluded       in the case of Mrs. McLoughlin that

                her claim was                    ’’upon the margin of what the process of logical

                progression wou l d a l l o w ’’.                  He went on to say that:

                           "To argue from one f a c t u a l situation to another and to

                           decide by analagy is a natural tendency of the hu m a n and

                           legal mind.                     But the lawyer has still to inquire whether,              in

                           so doing, he has c r o s s e d some critical line b e h i n d which he

                           Thereafter Lord W i l b e r f o r c e reviewed the vari o us policy

               arguments against a wider extension,                                and accepted that there was

               a real need for the law to place some limitation upon the extent
C
               of admissible claims.                            As    to the degrees of rel at i on s hi p he said

               this:

                            "As regards the class                      of persons,   the possible range is

                           b etween the closest of family ties, of parent and child, or

                            second,            either on the basis that such persons mu s t be

                            assumed to be assessed of fortitude sufficient to enable

                            them to enjoy the c a l a m i t i e s of modern life or that

                            defendants cannot be expected to compensate the world at

                            large.              In my opinion,          these opinions are justifiable,        and

                            since the present case falls within the first class it is

                            strictly unnecessary                      to say more.     I think, however,    that it

                            should follow that o t h e r cases involving less close

                            relationships must b e very carefully scrutinised.                            I cannot

                            say that they should never be admitted.                          The closer the tie,

                            (not merely in r elationship,                      but in care) the greater the

                            claim for consideration.                        The claim,    in any case,   has to be

                            judged            in the light of the other factors, such as proximity

                           As to p r o x i m i t y to the scene in time and place, he accepted

                that:
B
                            "Experience ha s shown that to insist on direct and immediate

                            sight or h e a r i n g would be impractical and unjust and that

                            under what may be called the                  'aftermath'   doctrine, one who,

                            from close proximity comes very soon on the scene,                    should
C
                            not be excluded."

                He went on to include within the scope of sight and duty people

                            "            of w h o m       it could be said that one could expect nothing

                            else than that he or she would come immediately to the scene

                and c o n c l u d e d :

                            "Subject on l y to these qualifications,                 I think that a strict

                            test of pr o x i m i t y by sight or hea r in g should be applied by

                            the courts."

                            Finally,           as to the third element,        namely the manner of

                communication of the shock inducing material,                           Lord Wilberforce

                firmly excluded communication by a third party and said in words

                which have since proved to be tragically prophetic;

                            "The sh oc k must come through sight or hearing of the event

                            or of its             immediate aftermath.       Whether some equivalent of

                            Lord Br i dg e gave similar helpful guidance as to where he saw

                the line to b e at the time he was speaking,                         and as to where it

             m i g h t move in the future.                   At p.    442,    having dealt with the

             liability.                  He said:

                         liability would exclude.                  I accept that the element of

                         uncertainty is an important                  factor.      I believe that the

                         greatly exaggerated.                 On the .other hand,       it seems to me

                   Having set out the problems there,                       Lord Bridge then went on

           to give examples of what might be the p o s i t i o n                      in a particular

           case.        He said:
B
                   "But let me give two examples to illustrate what injustice

                   would be w r o u g h t by any such hard and                   fast lines of policy

                   as have b e e n suggested.                   First,   c o n s i d e r the plaintiff who

                   learned af te r the event of the r e l e v a n t accident.                    Take the

                   case of a m o t h e r who kn o ws that he r husband and children are

                   staying in a certain hotel.                      She r e a d s in her morning

                   newspaper that it has been the scene of a disastrous fire.

                   She sees            in the paper a p h o t o g r a p h of unidentifiable victims

                   trapped on the top floor w a v i n g for help from the windows.

                   She learns              shortly afterwards that all her family have

                   perished.               She suffers an ac ut e psy ch i at r ic       illness.    That

                   her illness                 in these circu m s ta n ce s wa s a reasonably

                   foreseeable consequence of the eve n ts resulting from the

                   fire is undeniable.                   Yet,    is the l a w to deny her damages as

                    against a defendant w h o s e n e g l i g e n c e was responsible for the

                    fire s i m p l y on the ground that an important link in the

                    chain of c a u s a t i o n of her p s y c h i a t r i c      illness was supplied

                    by her         imagination of the ago n i es of mind and body in which

                    her family died,                 rather than by di re c t perception of the

            Mr. Hytner,            for the plaintiffs,            r i g h t l y points out that this is a

                that,         in particular,               they did suffer a form of p sy c h i a t r i c

                 illness consequent upon t he events that befell a loved one                                  in the
 E
                course of the Hil l sb o r ou g h disaster.

                            It follows that if I ma k e that                   assumption at this stage,          I

                must move to the c on s id e r a t i o n of w h e t h e r the r el a t i o n s h i p of the

 p              plaintiff to that loved on e was sufficient in law for the

                 plaintiff to fall within that class of persons entitled to

                 succeed in a claim for d a m a g e s for psychiatric illness.

                             English law, as we h a v e               seen,   permits only those wit h in the

 G               relationship of spouse and parent so to recover.                                 The reasons for

                 this are abundantly clear.                          It is onl y     in cases where the

                 relationship is of the c l o s e s t known to man that it is reasonably

                        I have to ask myself,                    and then answer the question:           "Ought

                        On the basis of where the line                        is at present drawn,       it is

             sensible first to consider the closest r e l a t i o n s h i p which falls

             immediately ou t si d e that line,                       that of b r o t h e r and sister.      For a

             number of reasons                        I have concluded that that line should include

             the brother or sister of the v i c t i m of negligence.                                I can see no

             basis in logic, or                        in law, why that re l at i o n s h i p should be

             excluded.

                        If we take,                 as an example,      a family of four consisting of a

             mother,            father,             son and daughter,       each of the four is already

             within the line for certain purposes.                                The mother and father are

             within that line downward towards their children.                                     They are also

             within that line                        in their r e l a t i o n s h i p as husband and wife.    The

              son and daughter are,                        again,   within that line in that their

              relationship upwa r ds to their par e nt s entitles their parents to

          child had succeeded in a c l a i m          for psychiatric illness occasioned

          by the injury or death of a p a r e n t caused by the d e f e n d a n t ' s

          different.

                   They are, therefore, h u m a n bei n gs         in the r e l a t i o n s h i p of the

          one entity, the family, who for cer t ai n purposes a l r e a d y                  fall
C
          w i t h i n the line drawn by the         law.       W h i l e it is trite to say that

          a family can exist where t h e r e          is only one child,          so s o o n as a

          s econd child is born he b e c o m e s          every bit as much a m e m b e r of the

          n uclear family as the first born.                   The same is true of t h o s e born

           later,    by which use of la n gu a g e        I h o p e to avoid the use of the

          w or d   ’s i b l i n g ’ elsewhere in th i s    Judgment.

                   Once there are two or m o r e c h i l d r e n of a family it            is the

£         normal and hoped for (though r e a l i s t i c a l l y not inevitable)                 course

          of events,       that they grow     up t o g e t h e r through their y e a r s         as tiny

           tots on into their          teens, and    further on into         adulthood.          It is

          the normal course of events t h a t they are extremely co s e within

p         the family.

                   Of course,     as in any f a m i l y situation,       there are      ’’spats"

          b et w ee n one child and another;          so there are in mo st marriages,

               groups in these cases,                 it is all the m o r e true.

                          It goes wi t ho u t saying that a goo d ly proportion of the crowd

               at any major football match will cons i st                     of young unmarried men.

               Those young men there who are ma r ri e d w i l l have known their wives

                a far shorter le ng t h of time than they h a v e known their brothers

                or sisters.                All those young men wil l be at the stage in their

                lives when their ties to their family - the i r original family -

                not just to their fathers and mothers,                     b u t also to their brothers

                and sisters,               will be of the strongest.         They will h a ve had the

                longest number of years to grow into adulthood,                         and the least

                number of years to go their separate w a y s as the fresh and

                competing demands of their own new w o r k i n g and married lives

                develop.

                          To go from the general to the particular,                    it was a sad fact

p             noted in the Taylor Inquiry,                    that   of the 95 people         who were

                killed at Hill s bo r ou g h 38 were under 20 y e a r s of age, and 39 were

                between 20 and 29 years;                that is, 77 w e r e     in their      teens or

             proportion of those attending the mat c h would be yo un g males.                                 I

             consider that it was reasonably foreseeable that the brothers

              and/or sisters of any such victims of the disaster m i g h t be so

              affected by the death or injury of their loved one as to suffer
B
              psychiatric illness.

                         I turn now to other degrees of relationship,                    and   it is right

              that I say at once that I have concluded,                       as a result of my

              deliberations, that the line should not be extended any further.
C
              Once it is extended to include brother and sister,                          I consider it

              has reached the margin of what the process of logical progression

              would allow.

                         I appreciate the closeness,               the fondness,     the love and
D
              affection which can flow in all of the other r el a t i o n s h i p s before

              me.        Such love can be strong and compelling,                  but the va r io u s

              relationships are not so immediate,                     in my view,     as to make it

              reasonably foreseeable to a defendant that psy c hi a tr i c illness,

              rather than grief and sorrow, would                     follow death or damage to the

              loved one.                  I realise this finding may seem ha r s h and hard,              but,

              as I conceive it, the law h as to draw lines of limitation,                                and

              that is the duty of a Judge.

                          It follows that I conclude that the law, as it stands today,

              allows the claim of a sister or a brother,                       but not that of a

              grandfather,                  an uncle, a fiancee,    a brother-in-law or a friend.

               I stress that nobody doubts the love of the latter group.                                 It is

               a question of law, of the reasonable foreseeability of the

               defendant,               of the reasonable phlegm of the individual,             of
                                                                                                     «

                           I turn no w to the question of prox i mi t y of time and place.

                I consider first the four plaintiffs who were actually attending

                the match, and w e re seated                       in the West Stand above the pens at

                the Leppings Lane end.                         I hold that such a position complied in

                this case with the requirements of prox i mi t y of time and space,

                to the scene of the negligence towards t he loved one.                                     However,

                of the four plaintiffs who were in that stand only one, Brian

                Harrison, possessed the required degree o f proximity of

                relationship.                    He was the brother of Gary and Stephen Harrison,

                both of whom sadly died in the disaster.

               minutes before the kick off.                              As a result of what he w a s told

               soon after 3 o'clock, he w a t c h e d the events on the c o a c h

               television, and made the s e a r c h for his son (in the c i r c u m s t a n c e s

               clearly set out in his statement of facts), which was to

               culminate in his identification of the body of his son at the

               temporary mortuary some time after midnight.                                  I will not refer

                further to that statement of facts,                               but I wish to say that       it is
C
                an example of the agonies into which many of these p l a i n t i f f s

               were propelled.                           I conclude    that Mr.    Pemberton is w i t h i n the

                requisite degree of proximity of time and place.

                disaster unfold as it was ha ppening ,                             not as eye witnesses,       but

                through the medium of tel e v i s i o n broadcasts.                          I shall soon come

                to consider their cases, but                            it is convenient first to deal with

 £              the final two plaintiffs.

                           Mr. Kehoe heard the n e w s of the Hillsborough d i s a s t e r on the

                radio during the live br o a d c a s t of another football match.                                 He

                later saw recorded footage of the disaster broadcast on the

 p            television.                   His          grandson,    Tommy,   was at the match,    as was

                Tommy's father, Mr.                         Kehoe's son-in-law.        Sadly both died in the

                disaster.                I have already indicated that I cannot include the

                relationship of grandfather within the line of proximity of

G             relationship.                      I       have to say,    even if I had been able       so to do,       I

                could not find that Mr. Keho e was within the requisite proximity

                of time and place,                         and his    claim accordingly fails.
                                                                                                           i

              trouble at Hillsborough while she was out                          shopping at about      3.30

              p.m. but nothing to indicate that a n y o n e had been injured.                           An

              hour later, while still shopping,                         she h e a r d that there had been

              some deaths.                    She got home about 5.15 p.m.         and listened to the

              radio?          the television was not turned on because she did not wish

              to see the scenes.                        At about 10 o'clock    she saw recorded pictures

              on television.                       She learned of her b r o t h e r ' s death at 5.00 a.m.

              on the Sunday morning,                       from her parents.

                         Her statement of facts sets out that her nervous shock                         is

              consequent upon the scenes she saw on television,                            that is to say,

              recorded television at 10.00 p.m.                         that night,   and knowing that
D
              her brother was in an area of the ground where the death toll had

              risen to 85 by approximately 5.30 p.m.                           I have,   regretfully,       to

              conclude that this plaintiff,                        though as a sister within the

               degree of proximity of relationship,                        is not within the proximity
 L
               of time and space which would give rise to a valid claim.                               It

               follows that her claim too fails.

                          I turn now to consider the cases of the nine plaintiffs who

 p            observed the events through the m e d i u m of their television

               screens.              They were seeing the events as they happened through

               the simultaneous broadcasting of p i c t u r e s                   captured by a

               television camera.                       Do their cases fall with in the necessary

G             degree of proximity in time and space to the events                             at

               Hillsborough which so affected their l o v e d ones ?

              McLouqhlin -v- 0 'Brian, in words I have recently read,                               expressly

              identified the problem as one for the future.                                These tragic

              cases,           however, have made it one for the present.                      It is

              therefore necessary to approac h the new question from old
B
              principles and, therefore,                         to travel back to first principles.

                         From the review of the various authorities whic h I have

              sought to make,                     it can be seen that,       once it was established that

              a claim for damages lay for nervous shock resulting from a fear
C
              not for one's own safety,                         but for that of someone else, the

              courts originally demanded of the plaintiff both presence at the

              scene and sight of the event.                           Gradually those rigid requirements

              were relaxed to extend to presence near the scene without any
D
              actual sight of the accident.                           As time and the law moved on even

              that requirement of presence at or near the accident was relaxed,

              until,           by the time it came to the case of Mrs. McLoughlin,                             she

              was two miles and more than an hour away from the accident when
 E
               she was told of it, and she was still further away from the scene

              of the accident,                         both in time   and space, before she        saw the

              terrible after effects of the                           accident upon her husband and

              children once she got to the hospital.

                          In his speech in McLouqhlin -v- O'Brian Lord Bridge was,

              moreover,               prepared to consider favourably the example of the

              mother to which I have recently referred.                             That hypothetical
                                                                                                       ■


              mother was at a far greater remove                            in both time     and   space than is

               the position in this case.

A               female plaintiff had her first visual av a r e n e s s of the effects of

                the accident on her husband, not at the                     scene of the accident,

                but hours later at a hospital.

                           I would venture to think it beyond               peradventure that the
B
                common law has moved on to the stage w h e r e it no longer requires

                in such cases presence at the scene of the accident and actual

                sight of it.                   The line has been moved to    incorporate into the

                accident its immediate aftermath as defined and explained by Lord
c
                Wilberforce in McLoughlin.                   If that be the case, what guidance

                can that give in a world in which simultaneous television

                transmission of events into the living rooms of that world is now

                an everyday event ?
D
                           Again,          it is necessary to go back to first principles and to

                analyse exactly what it is that is being observed by an eye

                witness,             and what it is that is being observed by a watcher of

                television.                  The eye witness receives images at the back of his

                eye of events that are taking place immediately before him in his

                presence.                The watcher of television does not.        For the eye

                witness those images are seen as life size,                     for the television

                viewer they are not.                    The eye witness can change those images by

                 altering his field of vision, by the turn of a head or the

                movement of his body by, for instance,                  moving closer to the

                 scene.            The watcher of television is unable to do that,          for,
                                                                                            i


                 whichever way he moves, the images on the screen will be the

                 same, albeit seen at a different angle.

                            The eye witnes s is seeing something which is taking place

                 actually where he is.                   The television watcher is enhancing his

                                                                       56

          sight by "borrowing" the images collected by the lens of a camera

          somewhere else.                            That camera lens, metaphorically,   transpor ts him

          from his actual physical p o s i t i o n to the different                      location of

          the camera, and allows him to receive at the back of his eyes the

          images he would receive w e r e he standing in the p o s i t i o n of the

          camera.              He may,               in fact, metaphorically be, slightly nearer than

          the camera when one makes allowance for the power to focus.                                  In a

          sense his metaphorical feet are mid-way between the camera and

          the image.

                      His is a similar situ ation to that of the w a t c h e r through

          binoculars,                  or a telescope,          whose metaphorical feet have been

          moved closer to the object than his actual feet, and who is

           seeing a picture which he could not possibly receive                             from his

           actual position.                           I accept at once that in the case of the

           watcher through binoculars,                          or a telescope,    it may be said that

           it is only the detail of w h a t he is seeing which he could not see

           from his actual position.                           That detail, however, may disclose to

           his sight something which h e could not see without the

           binoculars,                 such as the concealed figure of a man.              Hence,

           binoculars,                 like television, may allow a person to see something

           in a distant position w h i c h he could not have seen with his own

           unaided eyesight.

                       If the television watch er has set up or switched on that

               shoplifters or intruders.                The tele vision watcher's brain will

               have the same             information about the immediacy of what       is being

               seen by his eyes, whether it comes from the brain's own

               knowledge,          as in the instance of the security camera,          or from the
B
               brain's perception of a statement by a commentator that,                   for

                instance,         "These pictures are coming live from Hillsborough".                 In

                either case the brain of the watcher will tell him that what he

                is watching is what is h a p p e n i n g at the time he watches.
C
                         Thus,     the television watcher in those circumstances is aware

                that he is augmenting his own eyesight by the lens of a camera in

                a distant position,              but that his eyes are receiving, through the

                intervention of that camera lens,                  images of what is actually
    D
                happening as he sees them.                Just as the store detective sees the

                goods being put in the pocket and not, in the basket, although he

                is not physically present at the scene of the theft, so it is

                that the television watcher see the crowds surge forward in pen 3

                         I note,        in passing, the way in w h i c h the criminal law has

                approached the problem of the value and effect of observation of

    p           events on a video screen.                In Taylor and the Chief Constable of

                Cheshire 1987 AER p. 2 2 5 , it was h eld that there was no effective

                distinction for the purpose of admissibility between a direct

                view of the actions of an alleged offender by a witness,                      and a

    G          view of        those actions on a visual display unit of a camera,               or on

                a video recording,               of what the camera recorded, provided        that

                what was seen on the visual display unit or video recording was
                                                                                          i




                 connected by sufficient evidence to the alleged action of the

    H          accused        at the time and place in question.

                           The Court referred to the c a s e of Regina -v- Maqsud Ali

               before me, these cases are                           inter esting examples of the approach

               of the criminal law.

                           It is argued by Mr. Wo o d w a r d ,                 on behalf of the defendant,

                that what              is transmitted,           even w h e n    it is transmitted live,      is

                not what             is ha ppening at the scene,                 and not what the observer

                there would have observed.                           He submits that perception via a
 D
                tel evision broadcast/ t h o u g h it be live,                        is not the direct

                per c e p t i o n of the event by the plaintiff, but is as seen through

                the eye of a third party - the cameramen.                               He says   it may be

                enhanced or rendered present able                          and interesting by close-up or

                by panning shots,                       and is likely to be attended by extraneous

                com mentary which can colour the vis ual impression.

                            He submits further,                  that the reception of such a broadcast

                is in a context outside the control of a tortfeasor.                                 He argues

                that the plaintiff must s how both a sudden and direct sensory

                 involvement with the event,                         or its     immediate aftermath,   for such

                 engagement of his senses and emotions arising from his close

                 family relationship                       (parent or spouse) with the v i c t i m of the

                 event,           and from his own phy sical               involvement therein.

                            He argues that,                th erefore th ere is a distinction between the
                                                                                                       ■

                                                                  59

       on television or through another medium.                               He points out that a

       radio broadcast might, on the one hand,                              represent the matter in a

       more graphic f o r m than it really justified,                            or might,

        alternatively,                     sanitise it so as to m a k e      it bland.

                   He further                argues that since the lav allows no recovery of

        damages for n e r v o u s                  shock induced by m e r e l y hearing of the death

        or injury of a loved one from a messenger,                              then the same

        considerations                     should apply to h e a r i n g the message from a radio

        broadcast,               since what is broadcast goes               from the mouth of a

        reporter or newsreader.

                    He goes on from there to make the further jump to apply the

        same principle as                         to what is br o a d c a s t on television,   and to

        conclude that the                         law should not afford a remedy in such

        circumstances.

                    So far as simultaneous television                      is concerned I am not

         impressed by s u c h arguments,                      ably and attractively put though

        they were.                  It is in my view the visual             image which is all

         important.                 It is         what is fed to the eyes which makes          the instant

        effect upon the emotions,                           and the lasting effect upon        the memory.

        This was confirmed by the evidence of Dr.                              O'Connell on this

        matter,            whi ch I entirely accept.

                    I am sa t i s f i e d that the obse r v a t i o n through simultaneous

         television of the scenes of what was h a p p e n i n g during the
                                                                                                 ■


         disaster at H i l l s b o r o u g h is sufficient to satisfy the test of

         proximity of t i m e and space required                         in such actions as these.

                    Mr. W o o d w a r d           also relied on the     'floodgates'    argument        in
                                                                                                     ■




         relation to the question of simultaneous television.                                  He said
ER£ a C   '•w L L O Y O W O O O L A N O




                                                               60

  that the events were b r o a d c a s t to millions,                           and here there were

  real floodgates,                        rather t h a n   any figures      involved in the question

  of a road traffic accident.                              He said that there was the potential

  not only to identify the f l o o d g a t e s                        a r g u m e n t , but also to open

  the floodgates.

           Wit h those propos i t i o n s ,                  again,    I cannot agree.       There will

  not, under our syste m of law,                             be suddenly opened to the millions

  who were watching t e l e v i s i o n that day an opportunity to obtain

  damages,           as the d e f e n d a n t ' s          submissi on suggests.        Those millions

  will have no proximity of relationship,                                  and, therefore,      any claim

  b y them would fall at the f i r s t fence,                             or fall of its own

   inanition as it has e l s e w h e r e been put.

            Again,          there would be              the h u r d l e of reasonable

   foreseeability to be cleared ,                            as it must in any event,          even in

   those cases where I have a l r e a d y                        found there is proximity of

  relationship and prox imity                           of time and space.

            Let us look,                   then,   at   that h u r d l e of reasonable

   foreseeability.                        Was it r e a s o n a b l y foreseeable to the defendant

   that any negligence of his                            in re spect of persons killed or

   injured at Hillsborough m i g h t                         lead to psychiatric illness in

   loved ones of theirs who s a w the events                               live on television?         I am

   satisfied that it was,                          and will explain why.

            It is accepted that t o the defendan t it was not merely

   reasonably foreseeable that                             the tel e v i s i o n crews would be at

   Hillsborough for the semi                            final,   but that,      in fact of course, he

   had full knowledge that t h e y would be there.                                 It must be
                                                                                                 «



   accepted,             and I so find,              that    it was reasonably foreseeable that

                 the cameras would be turning long b e f o r e the match, collecting

                 footage w h i c h might be used later.                          It was reasonably

                 foreseeable,                   as I find, that if u n f o r t u n a t e events took place

                 which changed the event from a joyful sporting occasion to a
B
                 tragic piece of disastrous news,                             those cameras would,     or might

                 be, used to transmit live pictures.                               It was also reasonably

                  foreseeable that those live pictures would be seen by many of the

                  nearest and dearest of those inv olved                            in the disaster.
C
                              It was not merely re a s o n a b l y foreseeable,                it was a pound to

                  a penny that on the afternoon of two F.A.                              Cup semi finals in

                  which L i v e r p o o l and Everton Football                     Clubs were both separately

                  engaged,             the television sets of the C i t y would have been switched
D
                  on and e a g e r l y watched for the latest news,                        even though the

                  matches themselve s were not to be tran smitted live.

                              In thos e circumstances I find that all those who saw the

                  disaster live on television do come w i t h i n the line of proximity

                  of time and space,                          and I can, therefore,     bring together the

                  effect of my                   findings so far.

                              I b e g a n by making the a s s u m p t i o n that it was proved that

                   each of t h e s e plaintiffs ha d suffered psychiatric illness as the

                  result of the death of, injury to, or apprehended injury to their

                   loved one caused by the n e g l i g e n c e of the defendant.                       I then

                   considered where                         it was n e c e s s a r y to draw the line in relation to

                   the need to prove pro ximity of relationship,                             and made my findings

                   accordingly.                     I then moved on to c o n s i d e r where it was necessary

                   to draw the                 line in rela tion to p r o x i m i t y to time and space, and
                                                                                                          ■

               Stress Disorder.

                          Mr. Woodward,                   on the other hand,       a s s e r t e d that Mr. H y t n e r !s

 C
               indicated already,                         I find it u n n e c e s s a r y to make any

               pronouncement on this subject.                             Indeed,     it would be positively

               unwise,            since the aftermath for any p a r t i c u l a r                incident will

               depend entirel y on the circumst ances o f that incident,                                    and no

               pronouncements                     of mine on the subject of the aftermath are likely

               to assist in r e l a t i o n to cases as yet unbrought.

                           I should also refer to other p r o b l e m s w i t h which it is not

 £             necessary for me to deal.                           An example o c c u r s    in the case of the

               plaintiff Robert                          Spearrit whose brothe r,       Edward Spearrit,

               received severe crushing injuries                               in th e disaster.        Robert,      as

               brother to Edward,                          was therefore also t h e uncle of Edward's son

  F            Adam, who was,                     sadly, killed.         In this case the plaintiff saw                   the

                events unfold on television,                           and t h e r e a f t e r attempted,

                unsuccessfully,                      to contact the e m e r g e n c y telephone numbers.

                Thereafter he travelled to Sheffield,                               and spent two hours

 G             searching              for his brother,              and nephew, b e f o r e eventually

                discovering his brother in the I n t e n s i v e Care Unit of a Sheffield

              ones the situation would b e thus:

                          (i)        the relationship with his brother who was              injured would
D
              fall within the necessary degree of proximity.

                          (ii)          the relationship with his     14 yeas old n e p h e w who was

              killed would be outside t h e n e c e s s a r y degree of proximity.

                          The exercise of seeking to anal yse what part of the

              plaintiff's psychiatric illness was brought on by his reaction to

              the events befalling his brother,                  and what to those b e f a l l i n g his

              nephew, would be as una ttractiv e as it would be pointless.                            While

              it might form an interesting part of an academic e x e r c i s e for

              no place in the common law.

                          I am fortified by the decisions of the House of Lords                       in

              Bonninqton Castings Ltd - v - W a r d l a w [1956] App.                Cas.    6 1 3 ,* and in

       contributed to by the relevant br each of duty of the defendant.

       Quite clearly in this plaintiff's case his illness was caused,                                 or

       materially contributed to, by the def endant's b r e a c h of duty in

       relationship to his brother.

                I have not,              of course,   attempted to refer to each and every

       one of the many authorities cited to me,                            nor do I seek to set out

       on that exercise now.                   However/    I am conscious that I have found

        against several of the plaintiffs u p o n the basis that their

       relationship with the loved one who was                         the v i c t i m of the

        defendant's negligence is too remote-

                 I am conscious that many of the plain tiffs to whom I have

        refused a remedy will be aware of the arguments addressed to me

        in relation to various authorities w h e r e plaintiffs have won

        damages for nervous shock,                    despite t h e i r not being within the

        line as I ha ve drawn it.                 Indeed,       pla i n t i f f s have won damages for

        nervous shock where there has been no relationship at all of

        blood, marriage,                 or of any other kind.         It would not be right for

        me to leave this Judgment where it is w i t h o u t indicating h o w I

        have approached those various cases,                       so that those that I have

        held must fail in their claims should                        at least know,      today,     the

        basis upon which I hold that they do fail.

                 In my view each of those cases,                   w h e n properly looked at,        is

        not strictly speaking a case where the plaintiff wins damages by

        reason of a particular relationship,                        but,    rather,   where the

        damages fall to be awarded because of the p l a i n t i f f ’s particular

                 of rescue.                 His action was an errand of mercy,                 and it was by

                 reason of that activity that he fell within the c a t e g o r i e s of

                 persons for whom the defendant owed a duty of care.

                             In Chadwick -v- Bri tish Railways Board [1967]                         1 W.L.R.      1912,

                 was a disaster in December                          1957.    As soon as he heard of the

                  disaster he rushed to the scene and spent the whole night amid

                  horrific surroundings doing what he could to help.                                  His was     an

                  errand of mercy, an act of rescue,                           w h i c h caused in h i m nervous

                  shock.            It was that activity which brought him, t o g e t h e r w i t h

                  passengers on the train,                         into the category of those to w h o m the

    £            defendants owed a duty of care.

                             A different category of case was cited to me b y Mr. Hytner,

                  in support of the submissi on that there were cases where a

                  relationship of nothing m o r e than friendship had entitled the

    p            plaintiff to succeed.                       For reasons I shall indicate shortly,                I do

                  not consider that it was a relationship with a p e r s o n but,

                  rather,            again, a relat i o n s h i p with an activity w h i c h caused these

                  plaintiffs to be successful.

    G                        Let us take,                for instance,       the case of Dooley -v- Cammell

              plaintiff knew that fellow w o r k e r s were then in the hold,                          and he

              suffered nervous shock.                        In the course     of his Judgment Dono van

             J. , as he then was,                    said:

B
                      down the hold were his friends,"

              but it would seem that the real basis for his finding for the

              plaintiff was that Mr. Dooley was the u n w i t t i n g agent of the

              defendant's negligence.                        He was the c r a n e driver who, w i t h o u t any
C
              fault, was party to an accident w h i c h could have killed his

              fellow workers.                      It was his activity in operating the crane wh ich

              caused the actual and potential damage.                            It was that activity

              which brought him into the catego ry of persons for who m the
D
              defendants owed a duty of care, not r e a l l y any question of

              relationships of friendships.

                       Again,         in Galt -v- British R a i l w a y s Board          [1983] New Law

              Journal 8 7 0 , the plaintiff was a train driver who rounded a bend

              at a proper speed of 65 miles per hour                           and suddenly saw two

              railway men in front of him.                         He t h o u g h t he had killed them, but

              fortunately he had not.                        The def e n d a n t s were held liable for his

              nervous shock because they owed him a du ty to take reasonable

              care not to expose him to that injury.                            Again,   it was the

              activity of driving the train w h i c h he believed had killed his

              fellow workers that brought him w i t h i n the category, not any

              degree of relationship.

              In all these cases it can be seen that the courts                     are really

  dealing with a plaintiff w h o                      is engaged on the activity of

   operating some sort of equ ipment                        in circumstances where,      if there

   is negligence on the part of the defendant,                         it is reasona bly

   foreseeable that there w i l l be an accident involving that

   equipment ifi. which there w i l l be injury or death to persons,

   caused in the sight and h e a r i n g of the plaintiff.                      It is,

   therefore, reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff may suffer

   nervous shock.                      That,   I believe,   to be the true ext ent and basis

   for the decisions on this                       line of cases.

       apprehension for her own safety and the safety of her                        fiance,

       though he was hit and she was not, by a vehicle.                         Those

       circumstances are, of course, very different indeed from those of

       a plaintiff in this case,                   Alexandra Penk, who was unoffic ially

       engaged to one of the deceased.                      Miss Currie was not only at the

       scene, but suffered nervous shock through anxiety for her own

       safety.           It would have b e e n a task as Herculean as hopeless,               to

       attempt to work out what p ro p o r t i o n of her nervous                shock flowed

       from anxiety for herself,                   and what for her fiance.

                   It is probably appropriate that I deal last of all with the

       case of Owens -v- Liverpool Corporation [ 1938]                     1 K.B.   394.     It

       was a macabre case in w h i c h a hearse was hit by a tramcar,                       the

       coffin was overturned and                   the mourners suffered shock.          They were

       of various relationships                   to the deceased,    some of t h e m outside

       the line that I have drawn.

A                              Suffice it to say that, while I regard it as an interesting

                  case,         it did not involve injury to a fellow human being.                        It has

                  been heavily criticised in the past, and                          in seeking to deal with

                  questions that were hypothetical,                           such as the loss of the life of
B

                  respect, assist me in this case.

                              I conclude this Judgment by indicating that I have the

                  greatest of human sympathy with all these 16 plaintiffs and all
C
                  the other persons and families who have                           suffered in similar ways.

                  The human tragedy that afternoon repres ented can never be over

                  emphasised.                    My task, however,        is to attempt to interpret the

                   law, and I hope that it will be clearly understood that sympathy

                   alone is not enough.

                              May I also indicate what I am sure                    is already manifest.        In

                   the cases where I have not found for the plaintiff,                           but hav e

r                 found for the defendant,                         there is no suggestion that there       is
L
                   anything false or insincere about the nature of the claim

                   advanced.                 These are test cases.            The law itself has to be tested

                   and this can only be done by the b r i n g i n g of an action.                       The re is

    p             no shame, no ignominy, no lack of r e s p e c t of the dead in the

                   bringing of any of these actions.

                               It follows that in these test ca ses on liability I find for

                   the plaintiff in the cases of Brian Harrison,                          Stephen Jones,

    G             Maureen Mullaney,                          Karen Hankin, Agnes Copoc, Denise Hough,      Robert

                   Spearrit, Wil liam Pemberton,                        Harold Copoc and Brenda Hennessey.

                   There will be Judgment accordingly for the plaintiffs in those

                   cases on the question of liability,                          and the cases will be

    H             adjourned for damages to be assessed.

                be, used to transmit live pictures.                             It was also reasonably

                foreseeable that those live p i c t u r e s would be seen by many of the

                            It was not merely re a s o n a b l y foreseeable,              it was a pound to

                 which Liverpool and Everton Foo tball                          Clubs were both separately

                             In those circumstances I find that all those who saw the

c               disaster live on television do come w i t h i n the line of proximity
b,
                 of time and space, and I can,                      therefore,       bring together the

                 effect of my findings so far.

                             I bega n by making the a s s u m p t i o n that it was proved that

F               each of these plaintiffs had suf fered psychiatric illness as the

                 result of the d e a t h of,                 injury to,        or apprehended injury to their

                  loved one caused by the ne g l i g e n c e of the defendant.                      I then

                 considered where it was n e c e s s a r y to draw the line in relation to

G               the need to prove proximity of relationship,                            and made my findings

                  accordingly.                    I then moved on to c o n s i d e r where it was necessary

                  to draw the line in relation to p r o x i m i t y to time and space,                          and

                  have made my findings.

H                            It follows that by this stage,                     on the important assumption

^           that the psychiatric illness be proved,                                 that there wo uld be

             and Brenda Hennessey.                           T h e r e are,   however,   first,   some other

            matters to deal with b e f o r e                        I conclude finally the q u e s t i o n of

             liability.

                        I have come to my c o n c l u s i o n s                in relati onship to proximity

             of time and space on the b a s i s that such proximity has been

             established through the m e d i u m of simultaneous television.                                   Had I

             been unable to re ach such a finding                               it would have bee n necessary

             for me to consider the s ubm i s s i o n s made by Mr. Hytner in relation

^           to the doctrine of "the a f t e r m a t h " ,                       dealt w i t h by Lord

             Wilberforce in McLoughlin.

                        Mr. Hytner mad e v a r i o u s                submissions     to me in r e l a t i o n to the

             effect on specific plaintiff s                            of their activities        in trying to

F           discover what had happened                            to their loved ones, w e t h e r by

             telephone enquiries or by t r a v e l l i n g from Liverpool to Sheffield,

             or in the harrowing e x p e r i e n c e of h a v i n g to attend at the

             plaintiffs had that u n e n v i a b l e task.

             with the search for a body,                            and arg ued that there was no

            for the truth" was a fact tending to p r e c i p i t a t e Post Traumatic

             Stress Disorder.

                        Mr. Woodward,                   on the other hand,       assert ed that Mr. H y t n e r 's
B
             label,          "search for the truth" was a m i s u s e of the language.                             He

             argued that the aftermath only exte nded                               the length of time taken

             by the accident to a period which he w o u l d have expressed as the

             time "while the dust is in the air".                                Fo r reasons which I have

             indicated already,                         I find it u n n e c e s s a r y to make any

             pronouncement on this subject.                             Indeed,     it would be positively

             unwise,            since the aft ermath for any p a r t i c u l a r             incident will

             depend entirely on the circumstances of that incident,                                       and no

                         I should also refer to other p r o b l e m s w i t h whi ch it is not

             necessary for me to deal.                            An examp le occur s in the case of the

             plaintiff Robert Spearrit whose brother,                                Edward Spearrit,

             received severe crushing injuries in the disaster.                                        Robert,    as

             brother to Edward,                         was therefore also t h e uncle of Edward's son

             Adam, who was,                      sadly, killed.        In this    case the plaintiff saw the

             events unfold on television,                            and t h e r e a f t e r attempted,

             unsuccessfully,                        to contact the e m e r g e n c y telephone numbers.

             Thereafter he travelled to Sheffield,                               and spent two hours

              searching for his brother,                          and nephew,      before eventually'

             discovering his brother                           in the I n t e n s i v e Care Unit of a Sheffield

             hospital some hours later.                             At the t e m p o r a r y mortuary,    still

              later, he first identified a p h o t o g r a p h of his nephew, and he

                        His statement of facts pleads that his c o n d i t i o n was caused

                        mortuary. u

                         On the assumption w h i c h I make that the plaintif f                     is
C
              suffering from psychiatric                   illness whi ch is the cons e q u e n c e of

              the negligence of the defendant,                      in relation to b o t h his loved

              ones the situation would b e thus:

                         (i)       the relationship w i t h his brother who was                injured would

              fall within the necessary degree of proximity.

                         (ii)        the rela t i o n s h i p w ith his   14 year old n e p h e w wh o was

              killed would be outside the necessary degree of proximity.

k                       The exercise of seeking to analy se what part of the

              plaintiff's psychiatric illness was brought on by his r e a c t i o n to

              the events befalling his brother,                      and what to those b e f a l l i n g his

              nephew, would be as unatt r a c t i v e as it would be pointless.                           While

F            it might form an interesting part of an academic e x e r c i s e for

              examination in psychiatry,                   the dis t i n c t i o n could and should have

              contributed to by the relevant b r e a c h of duty of the defendant.

              Quite clearly in this plaintiff's case his illness was caused,                                          or

              materially contributed to, by the defend ant's b r e a c h of du ty in

              relationship to his brother.
B
                          I have not,                  of course,    attempted      to refer to each and every

              one of the many authorities ci ted to me,                                   nor do I seek to set out

              on that exercise now.                          However,     I am conscious that I have found

              against several of the pla i n t i f f s upon the basis that their
c:
              relationship with the loved one who was                                 the victim of the

              defendant's negligence is too remote.

                          I am conscious that many of the plaintiffs to whom I have

              refused a remedy will be aware of the arguments addressed to me
D
              in relation to various authorities w h e r e plaintiffs have won

              damages for nervous shock,                            d e s p i t e t h e i r not being within the

              line as I have drawn it.                          Indeed,        p l a i n t i f f s have won damages for

              nervous shock where there has been no relationship at all of

              blood, marriage,                         or of any other kind.           It would not be right for

              me to leave this Judgment w h e r e it is w i t h o u t indicating h o w I

              have approached those various cases,                                 so that those that I have

              held must fail                     in their claims should at least know,                 today,   the

               basis upon w h i c h I hold that they do fail.

                           In my v i e w each of those cases,                      w h e n properly looked at,     is

               not strictly speaking a case w h e r e the plaintiff wins damages by

               reason of a particular relationship,                                but,    rather, where the

               damages fall to be awarded b e c a u s e of the plaintiff's particular

               acti vity.

               reason of that activity that he fell within the cat e g o r i e s of

               persons for whom the defe ndant owed a duty of care.

C
               Mr. Chadwick lived close to the L e w i s h a m railway line where there

               was a disaster in December                         1957.     As soon as he h e a r d of the

               disaster he rushed to the scene and spent the whole ni ght amid

               horrific surroundings d o i n g what he could to help.                               His was an

               errand of mercy, an act of rescue,                             w h i c h caused in h i m nervous

               shock.             It was that activity which brought him, t o g e t h e r w i t h

               passengers on the train,                         into the category of those to w h o m the

               defendants owed a duty of care.

                          A different category of case was cited to me by Mr. Hytner,

               in support of the submission that there were cases w h e r e a

               relationship of nothing m o r e than friendship had e n t i t l e d the

               plaintiff to succeed.                      For reasons         I   shall   indicate shortly, I do

               not consider that it was a relationsh ip with a pers on but,

               rather,            again, a relat ionship with an activity w h i c h caused these

               plaintiffs to be successful.

                           Let us take, for instance,                      the case of Dooley -v- Cammeil

               Laird [1951] 1 Lloyd's R e p o r t s 2 7 1 .                       There the pl a i n t i f f was a

               crane driver whose load, without                             any   fault on his part,       fell into

               the hold of a ship.                       No-one was actually          injured but the

       plaintiff knew that fellow workers w e r e then in the hold,                      and he

       suffered nervous shock.                     In the course of his Judgment Donovan

       J., as he then was,                 said:

                 "I suppose I may reasonably infer that his fellow workmen

                down the hold were his friends,"

       but it would seem that the real basis for his finding for the

       plaintiff was that Mr. Dooley was the unwit ting agent of the

        defendant's negligence.                    He was the crane driver who, without any

        fault/ was party to an accident which could have killed his

        fellow workers.                  It was his activity in operating the crane wh ich

        caused the actual and potential damage.                     It was that activity

        which brought him into the category of persons for whom the

        defendants owed a duty of care,                   not real ly any ques tion of

        relationships of friendships.

                 Again,       in Galt -v- British Rai lways Board           [1983] New Law

        Journal 8 7 0 , the plaintiff was a train driver who rounded a bend

        at a proper speed of 65 miles per hour and suddenly saw two

        railway men in front of him.                     He thought he had killed them, but

        fortunately he had not.                    The defendants were held liable for his

        nervous shock because they owed him a duty to take reasonable

        care not to expose h im to that injury.                    Again,   it was the

        activity of driving the train whi ch he believed had killed his

        fellow workers that brought him within the category,                       not any

        degree of relationship.

                 In Wiqq -v- British Railways Board                [1986] T.L.R.    February

        4 t h , the plaintiff,              similarly,    was a train driver,   who this time

        looked after a passenger who had been hit by the door of his

        train.

                          In all these cases it can be seen that the courts are really

              dealing with a plaintiff who is engaged on the activity of

              operating some sort of equipment in circum s t a n c e s where,                          if there

              is negligence on the part of the defendant,                           it is reasonably
B
              foreseeable that there will be an accident                           involving that

              equipment in which there will be injury or death to persons,

              caused in the sight and hearing of the plaintiff.                               It is,

               therefore, reaso nably foreseeable that the plaintiff may suffer
C
               nervous shock.                      That,   I believe,    to be the true extent and basis

               for the decisions on this line of cases.

                          Next the case of Currie -v- W a r d r o p              1927 S.C.    5 3 8 , a case

               from Scotland, w h e r e the fiancee, who was walk ing arm in arm with
D
               her young man, recovered damages for nervous                          shock involving

               apprehension for her own safety and the safety of her fiance,

               though he was hit                        and she was not,   by a vehicle.     Those

 r             circumstances are,                       of course, very different    indeed from those of

               a plaintiff in this case, Alexandra P e n k , who was unofficially

               engaged to one of the deceased.                           Miss Currie was not only at the

                scene, but suffered nervous shock through anxiety for her own

 p             safety.                It would have been a task as Herculean as hopeless,                        to

                attempt to work out what proportion of her nervous shock flowed

                from anxiety for herself,                        and what for her fiance.

                           Itis probably appropriate that                   I deal last    of all w i t h        the

 G             case of             Owens -v- Liverpool Corporation              [ 1938] 1 K.B.   39*4.      It

                was a macabre case in which a he arse was hit by a t r a m c a r , the

                coffin was overturned and the mourners suffered shock.                               They were

                of various relationships to the deceased,                         some of them outside

 H             the line that I have drawn.

                           Suffice it to say that, while I regard it as an interesting

               case,          it did not involve injury to a fellow human being.                     It has

               b e e n heavily criticised in the past,                   and in seeking to deal with

               questions that were hypothetical,                       such as the loss of the life of
B
               a beloved dog,                      it moved into realms which cannot,   I think,     with

               respect,              assist me in this case.

                            I conclude this Judgment by indicating that I have the

               greatest of human sympathy wit h all these 16 plaintiffs                       and all
C
                the other persons and families who have suffered in s i m i l a r ways.

                The human tragedy that afte rnoon represented can never be over

                emphasised.                   My task, however,    is to attempt to interpret        the

                law,        and I hope that it wi ll be clearly understood that               sympathy

                alone is not enough.

                            May I also indicate what              I am sure is already manifest.           In

                the cases where I have not found for the plaintiff,                       but have

 r             found for the defendant,                     there is no suggestion that ther e        is
 L

                anything false or insincere about the nature of the claim

                advanced.                 These are test cases.        The law itself has to be tested

                and this can only be done by the bringing of an action.                             There is

 p             no shame, no ignominy, no lack of respect of the dead in the

                bringing of any of these actions.

                             It follows that in these test cases on liability I find for

                 the plaintiff in the cases                    of Brian Harrison,   Stephen Jones,

 G             Maureen Mullaney, Karen Hankin, Agnes Copoc, Denise Hough,                             Robert

                 Spearrit, William Pemberton,                    Harold Copoc and Brenda Hennessey.

                There will be Judgment accordingly for the plaintiffs in those
                                                                                                «

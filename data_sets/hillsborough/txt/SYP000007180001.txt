             L i verpool       coaches and .the s u p p o r t e r s .                  The Officers              in charge    of the

                Serial     were     Inspector MEjEK and S ergeant QiQYLE.



                At    1000 ho4rs we were                briefest regarding               the Policing             of the football

                 event    by various Senior Officers                          in the N orth S t a r ^ of the ground.

After    this      briefing,       Inspector MEEK       gave a shorter account           of Serial

39 and 4Q*s         duties       for the day.        We then made    our way to C l ay wh ee ls Ln

to await         the arrival       of the first Liverpool          coach.     From C l a yw he el s Ln

we were        re~~depl oyed to Halifax R d .           ihere we were deployed           in pairs,
                                           TfJM
myself     working with PC           1927 T A V L O f y i n the area opposite       the M o b i l e

garage     on Halifax rA .            It was   the    intention to ensure        that the

football         supporters       had no articles w hich         could be used as a we ap on or

cause danger,            be taken       into the ground and that any alcohol              be left      on

the    coaches.



The    coaches were          parked on Halifax Rd facing away from the ground,                        the

•First being        parked the furthest away.              As the     coaches were       being

parked at niy location               random searches were made            of the a lighting

supporters.          As further          coaches arrived,       we made    our way down Hali fa x

Rd,    keeping with the             last   coach to arrive.        On the arrival        of one

coach near to the Work in g M e n ’s Club on Hali fa x Rd,                     it was    noticed

that     fuel was         leaking    from the vehicle and therefore             the fire     bridge

were     requested.          Myself and PC TAYLOR          remained w ith the       coach until

the     fire     bridge had a r r iv ed and made          the   coach safe.



We then walked down Halifax Rd towards Cla y                          els Ln and as we did so

I noticed         large     numbers      of .alcohol   cans,    empty glasses      on the     pavement

and the wall             tops.    The    supporters    I had seen     I did notice       i,hat a

large      number        of them had been drinking and were               in very high spirits.



As we      reached C l ay wh ee ls Ln we a gain joined Serial                o9,   the   intension

 to walk         onto the Police         garage,     but due to a radio message          from ground

 control         I was    insructed with other O ff ic er s         by S er geant D Q Y L E _ t h a t we

          where                             the                   boy was admitted.

I then       returned to the ground with the a mbulance man whilst PC TAYLOR

rem ai ne d wit h the       boy.      I a tt ended     i mmediately at the Leppings Ln end

of the ground where            I saw the ambulance               driver.      On his    instructions,

three more        casualties were           placed    in the      rear of the am bu la nc e w h ic h        I

c onveyed to the N o r t h e r n General             Hospital      whilst     the a mbulance       crew

administered         first aid       in the    rear.       On this        journey and subsequent

ones,       I had a Police m ot or c y c l e     escort       to and from ths hospital.                I

made a total         of three       journies    to and from the hospital,                conveying

approximately          seven   people       from the L ep pings Ln end of the g r o u n d.

F ro m   the second journey onwards,                 the   route     to and from the Hospital

was m a nn e d    by Police        Officers at all         the    junctions        in order   to

a l l o w a free     passage       to the    location,      ensuring        the quickest

t ra ve l li ng    time.



Du r in g    the time      I was    driving    the a mbulance             I was aware of a large

number       of fans    standing      in the     roadway of L ep pings Ln and walking

away from the ground.                They were oblivious               to any traffic and even

t hough the e mergency blue                lights were       i ll um inated and the        sirens were

on,      the fans did not appear             to show any         concern for their         own safety

or the urgency at w h ic h the a mbulance was                      being used for.            They were

reluctant         to move    off    the    road way until         the      last   possible moment,

resulting         in me having       to slow down          in order        to avoid them.



Once      I was    relieved of this          duty,     I a tt e n d e d    in the area of the W e s t

S t a n d w here    I was wit h other Officers               i nstructed to form a cordon near

 to the       perimeter of the stadium               in order     to      prevent the fans and

 public from seeing or              interfering with the deceased.                    Whilst    stood

 there      the fans shouted abuse and threats                    towards         ourselves and other

O f fi ce rs    nearby.      Once    the    deceased fans had been moved                 I a tt e n d e d at
                                                                                                                            P AGE

                  returned from the hospital-



                  After a short           briefing        by Senior Officers,                 1 returned to the N o r t h e r n

              r ecollect        the time       but    it was      somewhere       in the         region of         1430 hrs,        PC

C l a yw h ee l s Ln,    as we did so          I noticed      large     numbers       of aicohol       cans

empty glasses           on the    pavement and the wall               tops.        The    supporters       1   had

seen,     I noticed that a large                number     of them had been drinking and were

in high spirits.



At C la yw h ee ls Ln we a gain joined serial                    39     and as a result             of a radio

m es sa g e    I along w ith other             officers were instructed to a tt e n d L ep pi ng s

Ln stand of the ground.                  I     was   not aware of the reason and a g ai n                  I do

not    recollect        the    time    but     it was     in the region of          1500 hrs.        PC

T ay lo r and myself           entered the ground via               Gate C and made             our way

towards        the West       stand.     There were an awful              lot of fans           coming from

the d ir e ct i on of the tunnel,               and also a lot of fans                in the       concourse

area.         I saw that       there were a lot of            people      o bviously d is tr e s s e d and

people        in various       positions       on the ground          being a tt ended to.



I. was    still      t otally unaware what was               going     on.        I continued to walk

towards        the tunnel,       PC Taylor was          just a h ea d of me and a r r iv ed at                 the

tunnel        before me,       just as       i a p pr oa ch ed the tunnel           I saw that        PC

T ay lo r was        carrying a small          boy of a p p r o x i m a t e l y    14 y r s .     This y ou th

 It was quite apparent                 that this      young     boy was seriously injured due                       to

 the mass       of    people     in this area         I assisted PC Taylor               to carry the

 y outh and to try to make a free                     passageway        to walk      into Leppings Ln

 where we then placed him                    into the    rear of a S Yorkshire Ambulance,

 here attempts were made                 to    revive the youth by PC Taylor and an

 ambulance woman who had come to assist                          us from another ambulance,                    as

 the     crew of the one we were                in were     not available.               It was    necessary

to a dm in is te r     oxygen to this youth,            so I left     the am bu la nc e and

o b ta i ne d an oxygen          revival    kit from nearby Fire Service                personnel.             A

short     time     later the ambulancewoman,              I am not able           to identify her at

all was       relieved      by the actual       crew member       of the a mbulance we were                    in.



Due   to the s eriousness            of the y o u t h 's c ondition         it was     n ec essary      that

he received hospital               treatment.     The    driver     of this a mb ulance was

engaged       in resuscitating another            fan and therefore               I took upon myself

to drive          the a mbulance myself whilst           the other       half      of the amb ul an ce

crew remained          in the      rear of the a mb ulance w i t h PC T a y l o r .            I was         noG

a wa re   of the      location of the N or t h e r n General           Hospital        and   therefore

picked up another Offi ce r                near to Pen is to ne Rd and the Spion Hop                        end,

I have       no    idea who      this Officer was.        On arrival         at    the N or t h e r n

General       Hospital      we    transp or te d the y outh to t h e Accident and

Emergency          department,      where    he was admitted.          PC    laylor      remained w ith

the y outh and            I returned    to the ground w it h the a mbulance m a n .                     I

cannot       identify him either and the officer                  that      had a s s i s t e d wit h the

directions.           I returned to the Leppings Ln end of the ground                              I have no

r ec ol l ec ti on of time w h at so ev er        I compl et el y    lost     track of        it

altog et her.         I joined       the driver    of the amb ul an ce        I was      in at the

entrance          to Gate C, almost         immediately three more             casualties were

placed       in the       rear of the ambulance.          I do    not know the exact                location

these     casualties were            brought   from or who       by and      I cannot h on es tl y say

wh et he r    or not they were all male               or a mixt ur e     of female         casualties.



W he n all        three    casualties were on board          1 a ga in drove the amb ul an ce                  to /

the N o rt h e r n General         Hospital,    whilst    the    crew a d m i n i s t e r e d first aid

 in the      rear    of the ambulance.          The    crew were     belonging          to that

 particular a mb ulance            only the driver did not a c c o m p a n y us on the first

occasion.           These    three    casualties were also a dm it te d to the a cc id en t
                                                                                                P AG E        4
                                                                                                S 622B

and e me r ge nc y department.               After   this all    three    of us     returned to the

same    location and a g ai n three more                 casualties were     placed      in the      rear

of my                 nee,   a g a i n my only    parti ci pa ti on here was      driving      the

ambul                 I made   the trip back to the N o r t h e r n General             wit h the same

crew members and the same                  procedure was      carried out        in relation to the

casualties and a g a i n all              three   of us    returned to the ground.             I then

left the a m bulance with the                crew members.       I saw that Officers were

f orming a cordon near              to the    perimeter      of the stadium between Gate A

and the       canal      in order    to    prevent the fans and the          public from seeing

or   i nterferring with an y deceased                person.     Whilst    forming       part of this

cordon we suffered verbal                 abuse    from the fans and threats             towards

ou rselves and other             officers.



Once the area had been               cleared of deceased         persons,        I recollect

s o m e o n e , but     I d o n ’t know who saying         that we were to go to the North

Stand.        I fo llowed the        instruction         it was here that        I rejoined my

serial       and   I saw that PC Taylor            had    returned from the hospital,                I

still       have   no    r ec ol lection of any time.



W hi ls t    in the N orth S t an d there was a short             briefing        from Senior

Officers.          After     this   briefing PC Taylor and myself                had a word with

Insp Meek & Sgt Doyle               re the youth Ph il ip H a m m o n d at the N or t h e r n

General       Hospital.        We were      then told by them to go to the g y m n as iu m to

inform w hoever was             there what we had done          that a f t e rn oo n    in relation

to any b o d i e s .                                                         /



On arrival         at the gym na si um we saw a DI C ha r l e s / w h o was            from R o t h er ha m

C I D , as we      knew him p ersonally we went              to spe*:    to him.        I spoke      to

him and told him that               there was a youthwat j^e            hospital.        As a result

of this       conversation we were            instructed to at te nd the hospital,                   we
                                                                                              P AG E   5
                                        /                                                     S62HB

were    told by DI Charles Wr\aX there were                  other    bodies at the hospital

and that he was a w a r ^ f           a C as ua lt y Bureau        in existence.



We    equipped ourselves with            labels and made           our way   to the Accid en t and

Emergency      department       of the N or th er n General          Hospital,     to deal with

P hi l i p H a m m o n d and other    bodies      present.     On arrival       at the said

d e p a f tment we were met        by a P ol i c e w o m a n Sgt and a P o 1 i c e w o m a n , ^hey

were dealing with C a s u a l t y Bu re au forms and                I a s s um ed they were

trained as such.            I cannot     identify the officers at all.



All    four   of us were       d ir ec te d to the m or t u a r y inhere we joined the

mortuary      staff.      I think     there were about J^ u r          or five staff       present.

As     it a p pe a r e d to me the Poli cewomani Ser/jeant had a record of people

in the form of a C as u a l t y Bu re au           bo^Jj/who   had been brought          to the

hospital      from the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground.       The    system that we undertook

then was       to take a body from the fridge                each     individual    body had what

I believe       to be a white         hospital     record    card on their        chest,   with

personal       belongings      if any.      As    I recall     some    of the bodies wet e

clothed.        The white      card    contained a number which started with the

letters NG w hich           I i nterpreted as N or t h e r n General           followed by a

number,       this was m a r r i e d up with the details              contained    in the Casuait-y

B u r e a u book,   as   it did      in everyone     of the     11 bodies       that we dealt

with.      As each one was m a r ri ed up with c or responding                   details myseif

and PC Taylor wo rk ed together                checking      the details       on the white

 cards     he w ou ld hand me a label,            I w ould then write          the NG Number      on

 the    label and tie        it to the      large toe of the          deceased.     As   each body

was     l abelled they were          then   put   into an a m b u la nc e and as far as         I am

 a wa re   I was    under    the   i mpression that a Police Officer w ould a c c o m pa n y

 the    body back to the g y m n as iu m at Hillsborough.                 We    conducted the same

 s ys te m for all       the eleven     bodies     including       that   of Ph il ip Hammond.

The two remaining               bodies was that of H a m m o n d and one I now know as
      ,0> 'X'LS                 °12_
Arthur Ho r r o c k s .         In view of the fact that PC Taylor had been with

H a m m o n d throughout         he a c c o m p a n i e d him to the g ymnasium and         I in turn

tr av e ll ed with Horrocks.                   On arrival   at the g ym nasium there were a

number      of bodies all           1 ined up on the floor,           as the body was        laid down

it was      given the next            consecutive      number    this    being 92,     being

a l l o c a t e d to Horrocks and H a m mo nd being 93.                 I completed a F o r m Gen

•18, w h i ch      is Su dd en D eath          report as far as       possible.     I also     put    the

No 92 on the same               label as the NG Humber           so that     they w ould     correspond

a nd   I also       put     that same No on the sudden death report.

I then went to              another       part of the gym na si um to wait        until    such      time

that we were          required for any             identif ic at io n of our      bodies.



Later,      possibly early hours                 of the morning,      I do not    recall    the      time,

but    I may well     have w r i t t e n it on the Gen 18, I was introduced to a

the staff and             I in turn       identified the body to a DC t-teyQold of West

Bar Pstn,          again    1 have       no     recollection of time.



At 013 0       16.5.89       (160589)          I paraded off    duty at my own parade          station.



 I w o u ld     like to add that               I am confident    that   I labelled eleven bodies

           was a female.            As far as      I am aware     each body was a cc o m p a n i e d      by a

           The only       consecutive      police     number      I entered on a label         was     the    one

BLACKPOOL TRAIN INCIDENT

You asked for further details on the incident referred to in the
attached letter.  I contacted British Rail Headquarters initially
who put me in touch with Inspector Dennis Temporam at British
Transport Police Football Liaison.  He told me that on 14 October
three teams from the Blackpool area were playing in London;
Blackpool playing at Leyton Orient;  Manchester City playing at
Arsenal and Liverpool playing at Wimbledon.

On the police computer system entry put in by officers at Crewe,
there was a complaint recorded of disorderly conduct and behaving
in an offensive manner involving 30 Liverpool and 30 Blackpool
supporters.  This train also carried 15 Manchester fans.

120 supporters had travelled to London from Liverpool in the
morning but only 30 were on this particular train back.  The
train was 25 minutes overtime at Crewe while the offenders were
removed.

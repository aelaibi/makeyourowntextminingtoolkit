DRAFT REPLY FROM PS/MR MOYNIHAN TO NO 10




Thank you for your letter of 21 April seeking advice on what, if
asked,      the    Government's         position      would       be         should
Lord Justice Taylortake the view that itwould be imprudent to
proceed    with    the     national    membership     scheme    for        football
supporters.


As you know, Ministers here share your view that the Government
would    clearly   have to    givethe expression of            any     such view

serious consideration.        As presently drafted by Bill does indeed
require the Football Membership Authority to draw up the detailed
scheme as soon as is practicable.             The difficulties you envisage
in the third paragraph of your letter would therefore arise in
the event that the Government decided not to proceed with the

scheme or to delay its preparation,             though as you say this is
very much hypothetical territory.


It would in these circumstances be necessary as you suggest to
amend the Bill.     Having checked with Parliamentary Counsel we can

confirm that there would be no difficulty in doing so.                     We would
of course be reluctant         to offer an amendment           to this effect

unless    it proved      necessary    since   to do   so could       create     the
impression that the Government expected the Taylor Inquiry to
reach a negative view on the membership scheme.                      But    if the

Government came under sustained attack on this count during the
later stages of the Bill we could offer to consider amending the
Bill.
I should perhaps touch on another possibility here, if only to
dismiss it.   We need to consider the Government's position in the
unlikely event that Lord Justice Taylor says little about the
scheme in his interim report but comes out strongly against it in
his final report, following Royal Assent to the Bill.        In that
event   the FMA would have to produce a scheme which,        in the
circumstances, the Secretary of State would find it difficult to
approve.   I hope that this is not a serious danger.     If after
publication    of   his    interim    report   we   learnt      that
Lord Justice Taylor was likely to take a significantly different
view in his final report, it ought to be possible to amend the
Bill in time in an appropriate way.


I am copying this letter to those to whom you copied yours.

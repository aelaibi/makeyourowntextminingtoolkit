It    was       our       intentions             to    stop          at       a       pub    en       route        for    a       small       drink,         b ut

a    policewoman                   stopped       us    from          doing             so    and       showed        us       in.

ye    arrived             in S h e f f i e l d        sometime                between             11 . 1 5 arn      ( 1115)            and    11 . 3 0 a m

but     it      was       parked          there       on       the       instructions                    of    the       Poli ce.After

parking           the      car       we    had    a    can          of    lager             each       but     it    was          horrible

so    it     was       thrown            away    before             it    was          finished.

None       of     the      pubs          were    open          at    this             time       so    all     five       of       us    went       to    the

Betting           shop         which       was    close             to    the          ground,           and       placed          a    bet    on    t he

dogs .

We    stayed           there         for       approximately                      15    ~ 20          m i n u t e s , which             was    the

duration             of    about          two    races,             we    all          then       left        the    Betting             shop       and

h e a dled
       ed       towards             the    ground,             which          took          us    a

Having          arrived             at    the    ground             we    all          made       for     t h e _y & t'/                 f B " area

which        was       our         entrance       point             for       the       ground.

There        was       hardly            anyone       around             at       this       time        so    getting             into       the    ground

was     very         easy.

Once       through             the       turnstiles,                all       of       us    got                                             police»

I got        myself            a    programme          and          all       five          of    us     went       to    the          pens    via       the

                  there            wasn't       any    Police             or          Stewards           visible          at       the       tunnel

entrance             or    exit..

All     five         of    us       we                                    and          at    this        time       there          was       only    few

people          in     there.             We    were       able          to       sit       down       read        the    programme                and    have

a    talk       to     each         other       this       was       a    few          minutes           after       entering                the    ground.

We    had       been       in       there       approximately                         half       an    hour        when       a    lot       more    people

began        to      come          into    the    pens,             we    were          situated              near       enough          in    the       rnidde

         on    the    floor,          but       we    soon          had       to    get          up,     to      get       out     of    the     way       of    the

         people.

         The    pen    was       filling             up    at       this       point             so    we       all     moved       away        from       the

         barrier       moving          a       couple          of    feet          forward.

         The    pen    gradually                began          to    fill          up       with       more          people.

         Sometime          between             2.15       (1415)          and       2.30pm             (1430)           I saw       some        of    my    mates

         who    had    entered             the       p e n , so          I left             the       other          four     l^ads a n d        went       and

         stood       with       the    others.                 At    this          time          the     pen         w a s X j e t t ing      fairly

It    was       at    this       time       I recall             seeing          a    person          to    my        right,         it       was    a

white       male       in    his       late       teens          or    early          twenties,             he        was     stuck           in

-amongst         everyone             else,       but       his       head       was       slumbed           on a n o t h e r          persons

shoulder.

When       I first          saw       him    he       was       pure       white,          including              his       lips,         I d i d n ’t

keep       1 o o k i ng     at    h i m , but          when       I did          his       face       and       lips        w e re     go i ng

pur p i e .

I    can    remember             feeling          a    weight          against             my       right       shoulder.                 I

turned          to    my    right          and    saw       a   foot        resting             on    my    s h o u l d e r , and              I    can

remember             seeing       a    ’N I K E ’ t r a i n e r            on    that          foot.

I turned             away,       then       turned          back       but       the       foot       was       gone.            I don't            recall

it    coming          over       my    head.

I    can    also       recall          a    bloke       who       was       just          in        front       of ms        he h a d a m a s s           of

black       hair       which          was    covered             in    vomit.

During          all    of    this          people       were          screaming                and    shouting              at    the         Police        to

open       the       gates       and       drag       people          out,       but       they       d i d n ’t do           anthing.

The    gate          for    the       pen was          about          six       to    eight          feet       away        from       me      to    my

then       getting          o u y and        in       turn       then       began          to       drag    o t h e r ^ p e o vp-Le" o u t , a

couple          of    p^pl'/ce        came       across         and        they       in       t u r n t b e g j ^ T to       help        peopl e o u t .

Although             this    gate          was    open          I was       unable             to    make       any        movement            towards

it    because          it    was       still          tightly          packed             in    there.

As    people          were       gradually             moving          away          from           the    pens the              crush began

to    ease,          and    I remember                falling          backwards,                    b e c a u s e t h e r e w a s no              one

behind        m e.         I put       my      hand        on    the       floor     to      stop       falling           onto    any    of

the     bodies         which          were       littered             around       my     feet,         I gradually              made    my    way

across        to      the       f e n c i ng     w h i ch       di v i d e d   the      two       pens        took    three       of    four

good     deep         breathes          and          then       made       m y way      to    the       tunnel,           I walked

through          the       tunnel       and          out    of^ y d e       ground.

I was       able       to       make    my       way       to    a wall        out      of    the       ground,           this    close

to    the     river         Bon,       I took          a    few       deep     breaths,               because        my    chest       was

feeling          sore.

1 then        made         my    way    to       a    Public          phone     b o x ,a n d          rang     me    M o m , I then          went

and     got      me    a    couple          of       cans       of    coke,     returning               to     the    same       wall,       where

I [net      up     withf                             lT a n d        the    other       l a d __________ .__

At    this       time       we     decided            to    go       and    make     some         phone        calls       for    the    other

lads,       we     then         met    up      w i t h ______________

After       making          the       phone          calls       we    went     back         to       the     coaches,       and       although

I never          travelled             there          on    one,       I had       no     difficulty                going    home       on

one ,

to    breath.

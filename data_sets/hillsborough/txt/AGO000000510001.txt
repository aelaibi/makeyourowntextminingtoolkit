           Mr and Mrs L Jones



           28 January 1997




           Dear Mr and Mrs Jones

           The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter of 10 January,
           enclosing a copy of one you have sent to the Home Secretary, and to reply. He
           has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the families involved in the tragic
           events which took place at Hillsborough and fully understands the concerns
           raised by the recent programme. Your letter suggested re-examination of the
           circumstances although you did not indicate whether you had in mind a
           further public inquiry or the seeking of an order for a fresh inquest.

           In considering the question insofar as the inquest is concerned the Attorney
           General has in mind the points made in the House of Commons in a debate on
           this topic on 17 December and what the Home Secretary said in response. He
           made the point that any decisions which have to be taken must be on the
           basis of consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather
           than simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
           particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
           and if so, whether that evidence is of such significance that had it been put
           before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
           Enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

           The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
           Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
           the Coroners Act 1988. He has previously considered several applications for
           consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an order
           directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case he concluded that the
           matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the
           High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have been
           canvassed in unsuccessful judicial review application to which you were a
           party and to which you refer in your letter.

          There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
          affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.

           S W / 2 8 0 1 /1
Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
there is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest. In addition, any
application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
usual way but as I have indicated, the programme is not of itself evidence.

Yours sincerely




S J WOOLER

Dear M r Howard,


        We request th a t the events o f the Hillsborough Disaster be re-exam ined not
only because o f the new evidence produced, but because 71/2 years after the Disaster
the questions we have asked since Day 1, have never been addressed. W e ask you to
read the following.


        We w rite to you not only as parents who lost a much loved member o f our
fam ily at Hillsborough , but were also firm believers in the rule o f Law and Order, sadly
we now realise th a t there is no such thing as honesty, integrity or justice.


       The Inquest started our concerns w ith the Coroner, who we considered, was
him self put in an untenable position, being employed by one o f the parties likely to
come under criticism for their decisions leading up the Disaster.


       The Coroner Dr Popper, was carrying ou t the investigation, and it was he who
selected the evidence to be heard. It was hardly surprising then when questions were
and still are being raised about his im partiality. The way the evidence was selected by
the Coroner was in our opinion, and in the opinion o f most independent professionals,
who have looked a t the Inquest transcripts extremely biased.


        In our own personal experience, Dr Popper was quite happy to call witnesses,
who had not been w ithin ten miles o f the Football Stadium, to discuss the supposed
drunkenness o f fans, while a t the same tim e refusing to call professionals who were at
the scene and attended the injured and dying who possibly could have answered some
o f our questions and cast some light on w h at occurred.


       We personally requested tw o Doctors and one Senior Nursing O fficer who were
a t the scene to be called as witnesses (see letter to the Coroner and his reply). All were
refused the opportunity to give the ju ry the benefit o f their knowledge o f events, but
as your know the Coroner enforced the unprecedented cut o ff tim e o f 3 -1 5 and no
evidence o f events occurring later then this was to be heard, considering a lo t o f our
questions relating to our son's death was after 3 -1 5 (he was declared dead a t 4.0 p.m.)
we knew then th a t our questions would go unanswered.


       When concluding the Coroner him self commented th a t the Inquest was not
the place to conduct a major Disaster enquiry, and the current law commission has
expressed views th a t the system needs major review.
         We as a fam ily consider the system as it is a t present to be corrupt and biased,
when one party the Police A uthority, had full access to all statements, while the
families and their legal representatives were refused all access, and had to rely on the
Coroner, to present the evidence im partially which he patently did not.


        The Police Complaints procedure was another major concern, we know you are
aware, o f the general criticism o f the complaints procedure, b u t are you aware th a t
the complaints procedure is toothless.


         Senior Police Officers closely related to the incident, were seen in Sheffield,
w hilst the Inquest was in progress, laughing openly a t the plight o f the families,
confident th a t they were under no th reat o f disciplinary action. Because if found th a t
disciplinary action was needed, th a t they could take early retirem ent unhindered and
unpunished. This was later to prove the way things were allowed to happen, so their
confidence was not misplaced.


         Only in our naive trust did we believe th a t because theirw actionsw ere so
obvious they would somehow be made accountable.


         We were involved in the judicial review procedure before the High Court and
although our faith in the system had been shattered, we were confident th a t even
w ith the meagre am ount o f evidence th a t we had managed to collect to support the
review, it was o f such importance as to require careful consideration.


         One piece o f evidence was th a t the W est Midland investigation team had
attem pted to coerce witnesses to change statements and this w en t uncontested,
although W est M idland Police were aware w h at was to be produced, to support this
allegation.


        We were amazed th a t such strong charges could be dismissed in one o f our
major courts in the Country w ith the words in the judgem ent "Who's to know w h at 16
believe” surely the courts exists fo r just th a t purpose to have evidence presented and
assessed. I f it fails to carry o u t its prime responsibility it will quickly lose c r e d ib ility
w ith the general public.


         I would like to remind you th a t law and order has to be applied, w ith the
consent o f the people, lose th a t consent and the fu ture looks very bleak.


         Please try and restore some o f our faith in the judicial system and be as
concerned about the events as we are, support our enquiry which o f course will be
open w ith full disclosure.

Dear Dr. Popper.

At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a series of questions concerning
the aftermath at Hillsborough, we were left with the impression that the
questions would be dealt with at a later stage.

However since then you have ruled that it is not necessary to proceed after
IS.15pm and it now appears that our questions will not be addressed, you
did say that in an Ideal world everyone would have ended up in hospital and
you suggested that we were naive in thinking that the medical response was
inadequate, that sort of answer is not conducive to the facts as shown in
the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying valiantly to
assist the injured.

The video shows 1t took till at least 15.35pm before all the casualties
were removed from the pens, a fairly lengthy delay which obviously did
nothing to help their chances of survival.

Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
enclosed) certainly imply that in their opinion, the response left a lot to
be desired.

We also know of people who were removed 1n an unconscious state, a prime
example being Mr. Edward Spearritt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
it was possible for people 1n the crush who suffered severe injury to
survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.

At the very least this raises questions 1n the eyes of the families that
the inefficiency of the major Incident response could have contributed to
the number of deaths occurring at Hillsborough and therefore we consider
that this should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for the
deaths.

You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
1t would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.

    Dear Mr Jones

>
    Thank you for your letter dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
    which I have noted and have read with care.

»   Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
    you view the points raised, I do not think that it is either right
    or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
    the issue which you have raised.
    However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
    to say that it is not my intention to call either Dr Ashton or.
    Dr Phillips.
    I have also read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
    advisors and I do not think that I should comment on this either.
    Yours sincerely

          Mr and Mrs K Clark




           17 January 1997




          Dear Mr and Mrs Clark

          The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter of 9 January
          and to reply. He has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the families
          involved in the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough and fully
          understands the concerns raised by the recent programme. Your letter
          suggested re-examination of the circumstances although you did not indicate
          whether you had in mind a further public inquiry or the seeking of an order for
          a fresh inquest.

          In considering the question insofar as the inquest is concerned the Attorney
          General has in mind the points made in the House of Commons in a debate on
          this topic on 17 December and what the Home Secretary said in response. He
          made the point that any decisions which have to be taken must be on the
          basis of consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather
          than simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
          particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
          and if so. whether that evidence is of such significance that had it been put
          before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
          Enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

          The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
          Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
          the Coroners Act 1988. He has previously considered several applications for
          consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an order
          directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case he concluded that the
          matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the
          High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have been
          canvassed in unsuccessful judicial review applications.
There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.
Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
there is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest. In addition, any
application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
usual way but as I have indicated, the programme is not of itself evidence.

Yours sincerely




S J WOOLER

Dear Madam

As members o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group, we wish to request that the events of
Hillsborough be re-examined in the light of the totally contradictory evidence that came to our
attention during Granada’s research for the recent Jimmy McGovern “Hillsborough” programme.

We lost our son, aged 18, in the tragedy, and owe it to his memory, and all the other people who
lost their lives that day, to seek to bring out the truth.

Yours faithfully

    Dear Attorney General,

             We are members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group and have been trying
    with great difficulty and stress to come to terms with the tragic death of our young Son at the
    disaster. We hoped to have carried on with our lives as best we could knowing that it was a
    disaster that could possibly have been avoided if certain steps had been taken. Then,
    Hillsborough became a reality once again on the television for all to see and although we
    never watched this programme, we found it difficult to avoid all the 'talk' about it.

            Now we feel strongly that in the light of the totally contradictory evidence that has
    brought to our attention, the events of Hillsborough should be re-examined so that the people
    responsible can be brought to justice and to ensure that this must never ever happen again.
    Maybe then part of us can be at peace.

                                         Yours sincerel)

           14 Januaiy 1997




           Dear Mr and Mrs Jones

           The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter of 8 Januaiy
           1997 and to reply. He has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the
           families involved in the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough and fully
           understand the concerns raised by the recent programme. Your letter urged
           that a further inquest be held.

           In considering the point made about the inquest the Attorney General has in
           mind the points made in the House of Commons in a debate on this topic on
           17 December and what the Home Secretary said in response. He made the
           point that any decisions which have to be taken m ust be on the basis of
           consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather than
           simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
           particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
           and if so, whether that evidence is of such significance that had it been put
           before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
           Enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

           The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
           Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
           the Coroners Act 1988. He has previously considered several applications for
           consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an order
           directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case he concluded that the
           matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the
           High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have been
           canvassed in unsuccessful judicial review applications.
There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.
Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
there is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest. In addition, any
application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
usual way but as I have indicated, the programme is not of itself evidence.

Yours sincerely

                                   ; Hillsborough 1989 and lack ofiBSrtke

Dear Sir l^sll,

As the parents of Gary Philip Jones who was killed at Hillsborough we strongly urge you to quash the
inquest verdict aad demand a new one te e d on the evidence which t a recently come to light on the
TV drama documentaiy " Hillsborough".

We attended the inquest on many occasions and were shocked to disbelief regarding the evidence that
was heard. There was a disproportionate amount of bias towards the authorities. After bearing the
verdict of the inquest we have since lost all faith in British justice and will not be satisfied until justice
has been done.




Yours Sincerely

          Dear Mr or Mrs Edwards

          I have been asked to thank you for your letter of 7 January 1997 to the
          Attorney General and to reply. He has the deepest sympathy for all the
          families affected by the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough, and
          fully understands the concerns raised by the recent programme.

          Your specific question related, however, to the possibility of a further enquiry.
          Lord Justice Taylor was appointed by the Home Secretary and it is for the
          Home Secretary to consider the question of a further enquiry. I have therefore
          passed your letter to the Home Office.

          Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,


I enclose herewith a letter which I sent to M r Howard. As most o f the points I am concerned
about are contained in this letter; I would like you to consider what I have to say, and perhaps
let me have your comments.




Yours faithfully




Rose Robinson


                       -—IP*.                  ^
24th December 1996


Dear Mr Howard,

I am writing as one o f the families who you were kind enough to see in the House of
Commons. May I say, I felt you were very sincere in what you said to us. I thank you for this.
I would identify myself to you as the lady who first spoke to you regarding police investigating
police.

I took careful note o f your speech in the house, when you rightly said we had already had four
enquiries. You said at one point, that all the evidence was available to all the bodies concerned
during those enquiries. Our argument is, that although it was available it wasn't all used in
those enquiries. The police carefully selected what was used, and did not bring all the evidence
forward. Likewise with the coroners inquest, He said to me on a local radio phone in; he had
thousands o f witnesses to call on, but he selected the witnesses to be called, ( possibly under
police pressure), and most o f the witnesses were pro-police. One particular witness (the so
called land lord) who wasn't a land lord at all, was found to be a complete liar, and the jury
were told to dismiss his evidence at a later date. A few fans were called tn give their evidence,
mainly young lads (my sons friend amongst them) they were systematically torn apart by a
team o f barristers, as if they were on trial, many were in tears, as they felt they had let the
victims down. This was supposed to be a inquest, not a trial. I knew o f many professional
people, who swore statements to the police, but were never called to give evidence at any of
the enquiries.

Talking about the inquest, yet again, the cut off time of 3.15 was totally inappropriate,
therefore invalidating the inquests. How can an inquest be legal, when many o f the victims
were still alive up to 4 pm (evidence can be supplied)
Talking about the disaster itself, how can the police justify stopping ambulances and
paramedics to reach dying people. The police said they were fighting yes - fighting for their
lives, why were they denied help ?

Whilst this was going on, lines o f police officers were on the pitch doing nothing - or
according to them separating the supporters. It was the supporters who saved lives, and
sprang into action immediately to help. How dare the Sun newspaper say otherwise,but then
the evidence for those reports came from the police..

Are you also aware that when some o f the perimeter gates burst open under pressure, the
police offers pushed the people back in again, and locked them in. How many died because of
this ? One man, pleading for help as his young son died in his arms, was ignored.

As the disaster unfolded, the police realising their complete lack of control, immediately began
to shift the blame. Alcohol tests were taken on all o f the victims, even children. Why weren't
the police tested for alcohol? It might have explained their incompetence. Many were known
to be in the hospitality suite, and one particular senior officer was thought to have a drink
problem. (Check this out) In a car accident, who do they breathalise, the driver or the victim?
Later on, about 5 p.m. many o f the people searching for their loved ones (knowing they were
dead in the gym) having been told this by fans who had carried them there, were sent on a wild
goose chase to hospitals, mortuaries etc.; this gave the police time to get their 'stories straight,
and to make sure nothing derogatory was put in their notebooks. Our loved ones were just
laid on the floor without dignity. Why were they not sent to hospital, or the new health centre?
Why was a disaster plan not put into action? Could it be that it would have uncovered the
truth. Within minutes o f identifying my sons body, my husband and I were interrogated by the
police. We had committed no crime, neither had my son. The only kindness shown to us on
that terrible night was from a social worker, and the ordinary citizens o f Sheffield. How can
you call this British Justice, it makes me ashamed to be British. In what other occupation can
people be so negligent, as to cause the death of 96 people, and be allowed to retire to avoid
disciplinary action, plus to get their full pension and walk into another job.My son was a 17
year old hard working apprentice,he had never been in trouble, and we loved him dearly along
with our four other lovely children. His death was not an accident, and I will never accept it
was. My son was in the care o f the South Yorkshire police, and through recklessness they
failed in their duty o f care to my son, and the other 95 victims.

I would like you to acknowledge you have read this letter, because if you read it, you cannot
possibly say there is to be no further enquiry. I do have faith in you, because you came across
as a very sincere gentleman. There have been many miscarriages o f justice during the last
decade, mainly caused by police perverting the course o f justice, this is just one more. Please
see that it is put right

               I look forward to your reply

                     The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter of 3 Januaiy
                     and to reply. He has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the families
                     involved in the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough and fully
                     understand the concerns raised by the recent programme. You raised the
                     question as to whether it does provide ’new evidence’ such as to justify a
                     further inquiry or prompt an application for a new inquest.

                     In considering these questions the Attorney General has in mind the points
                     made in the House of Commons in a debate on this topic on 17 December and
                     what the Home Secretary said in response. The Home Secretary made the
                     point that any decisions which have to be taken m ust be on the basis of
                     consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather than
                     simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
                     particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
                     arid if so, whether that evidence is of such significance that had it
                     bdfore JU)rd^Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of
                     Enquiry or the verdict of the ju iy would have been different.

                     The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have

Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
there is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest. In addition, any
application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
usual way but a s I                 the programme is not of itself evidence.

                                  The Attorney General has asked me to thankyou for your recent letter and to
                                  reply. He has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the families involved
                                  in the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough and fully understand the
                                  concerns raised by the recent programme. Your letter raised the question as
                                  to whether it does provide ’new evidence’ such as to justify a further inquiry
                                  or prompt an application for a new inquest.

                                  Ill considering these questions the Attorney General has in mind the points
                                  made in the House of Commons in a debate on this topic on 17 December and
                                  what the Home Secretary said in response. .'The Home Secretary made the
                                  point that any decisions which have to be taken m ust be on the basis of
                                  consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather than
                                  simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
                                  particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
                                  and if so, whether that evidence is of such significance that had it been put
                                  before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
                                  Enquiry or the verdictof ifrejuiy would have been different.

                                  The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
                                  Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
                                  the Coroners Act 1988, He has previously considered several applications for
                                  consent to the inaMng o f ah application to the High Court for an order
                                  directing tjhe holding^ of a fi^ h inquest. In each case he concluded tliat the
                                               forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the

High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have been
canvassed in unsuccessful judicial review applications.

There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.
Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988,

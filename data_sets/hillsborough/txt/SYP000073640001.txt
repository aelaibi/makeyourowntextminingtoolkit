       ~7
this time are known to myself                 fa cially but           tve no     idea of their

names.

The     coach belonging       to    ’L l o y d s of^^Ctneaton’ ev en tu al ly set off at

about     10.30am   (1030).         I sat j*fxt to my brother                   about   1/2 way

down the      coach and on the left hand side.                   I sat near the wi n d o w and

I       sat near    the aisle        of the coach.

There were      three other         pick up points along          the way,      these were at

Nuneaton,      Hi nk le y and Leicester.         I only spoke        to          throughout      the

jo urn ey and     I did not        take any    notice     to any other members who got on

the     coach except    for    perhaps a quick          look al t h o u g h   I did not know

an yo ne well     enough to talk to.

Once all      the pick up points had been made,                           handed out    the tickets

to each of us to en te r the ground.                 On    route to S h e f f i e l d we

were     stopped by sortie police who enquire d as to whether we were Ch els ea

footbal1 supporters.               Wewere     only held up for a few minute s at this

stage and      I d o n ’t think      that we were su bj ect ed to any other                 traffic

delays.       We ev ent ual ly ar ri ve d      in Sh ef fi el d between        1.30 a n d    1.45pm

<1330 a n d    1345)   but    I cannot      recall   where     the   coach was      parked.      It

was     then a matter of       leaving the       coach and walking            towards   the ground.

This walk took a p p r o x i m a t e l y    10 minutes and during             that time      I walk ed

wi th                                             (as     previo us ly stated).         The    only

police directions we           received was       from Police        on horses,      telling     us to

keep on the footpath.               On the way to the ground              I did not see any

other     person who    I re cognised as         belonging       to our       coach party.      There
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     SI 790

were    no signs of di sor de r l y            crowd behaviour at            this time.

We eve nt u al ly a rr iv e d at the turns                     entrance at about g.1 5p m

( 1415) .     There was         not a large       j^&wd of people at            this time,      there

were    small    orderly queues           tc/each turnstiles,            each was m o v e d by 3

police o f f i c e r s sea/r chi ag people as they entered.                      There were no

stewards      outside      t/he/g round at        this time.          I was quite easily able               to

enter     the ground,          throug h the turnstile           once    I had handed my ticket

in.     Sh ort ly after         this,    I was able      to re-group with the others                  inside

the yard are a from the turnstiles.                      To the best of my kn owledge                 there

were    no other gates open at this                   time.     I wo uld describe         the amount          of

people al rea dy         in the ground at this time as being                     normal,      there was

eno ugh     room to move a r o u n d quite/freely.                   There were no      crowd    problems

at this      stage,      and    I still       sa/no    other    person from our         coach    party.

I did not see any signs                 directing      fans to viewing areas            but    the

general      flow of fans wa^c through a tunnel whi ch obv iously                          lead to the

stands.       This    is the        reason     I and the others         chose that      route.        The

five of us walk ed freely through the t u n n e l, there were                           others       using

it but      it was not         crowded.       There were       no Police       or St ewards at        either

the entrance         or exit        of this tunnel.           We emerged from the tunnel,               onto

the stands which,              a l t h o u g h there was a large        number    of fans al r e a d y

p r e s e n t , it was    not    crowded.        In factj^tfe were able           to make our way

throug h the terrace wi th ease to t<fke a standing                            point   in the    right

hand    pen behind the goal w h e r a A h e             five of us stood for some               time.        We

were about 3 rows from the/rront                      fence and       centrally in the         pen,    in

front     of a   crash ba r r i e ^ T this was about 2.3Qpiti (143Q)                   and felt       quite

comfortable.                    /

As    the time wenty o n            leading    up to kick      off    time,    the terrace      became

more    crowded with people              to such an extent            that    there was    no room to

move and      I started to become               extre mel y hot.        There were some surges

forward nearing           kick-off       time due to w hi ch the five of us starte d to

split up and       lose     contact with each other.

I personally was          pushed slightl y forwards and to my                       left.        I had no

control     over my movements .            I was        being    pushed and shoved with the

crowd.      The forward surges were                not the usual            type of surge         nobody was

able    to regain any steps           backwards as           it app ea re d the space made was

be i ng filled by others entering                  tfm><'Cer r a c e s .      I have no rec ollection

of the game kick off,             there w ^ e       people aro un d me s creaming                 to get

out.     I was    tightly     crushp^l against            people      in f ront of myself and

those    to my    rear were jfhe same             crushed against me.

Some    fans began to j/tl imb the fences and spill ed out the                            pitch and as

the mo vements w e p        by,    the   crowd ar o u n d me          began to ease the            crushing

effect    I had experienced.             I was able to work my way through the                           crowd

and went       through the tunnel.               There was      no    crowd rushing         or    crushing

as    I went    through the tunnel,              some    people were tending to some                   lying

on the ground.          In my opini on           I believe       I had got out of the crush

re la ti ve ly easy and at that            time,        I did not a pp re ci at e       the eno rmi ty of

the    problem that had occurred.

I met    up with            at    the end of the tunnel,                   he too had a p p a r e n t l y got

out    fairly easily.        Th ro u g h o u t    these events,            I had not seen any of the

others    from our      coach     party.

We wa it e d arou nd      the turnstile area              intending to          locate our other

friends,       we were unable       to do so and                     and    I left the ground at

abut    3.30 - 3. 4 5 p m   <1530 - 1545).               We were      the first       to reach our

coach and       later   s u b se q ue nt ly met     up wit h our other             friends.

I was    not    injured except        for aches and             pains.       I did not witnes s any

deaths    nor did I assist          in any        injured.

I did not witness an yt hi ng            that      I consider was a             criminal      offence and

I believe       that the officials           did ev erything           possible under the

circum st an ce s when the         problem was           realised a l t h o u g h     I was      not   in the

ground    in the    later stages         of the afternoon.                                *s,3d>

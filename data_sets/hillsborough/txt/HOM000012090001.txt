 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER: LETTER FROM GEORGE HOWARTH MP

j^Ehank you for your note of 14 November in which you sought
C o m m e n t s on a draft reply to the letter of 4 November from
   George Howarth MP about the Hillsborough disaster.

 I am generally content with the paragraphs on pages 2 and 3
 which refer to the inquest.  However, in the last paragraph on
 page 2, second line, I am not sure that the phrase, "(as I
 believe some relatives are)", adds anything.  I would suggest
 that this is deleted.  It might possibly be taken as an
 encouragement to relatives to apply to the Attorney-General.
 But he has already responded to a Parliamentary Question from
 Mr Howarth to the effect that no one has placed before him any
 material which would justify a Section 13 application.  The
 Attorney-General has also recently written a discouraging
 letter to one of the victims' relatives on the same point.




                                r.



                                          G HARRISON (MISS)

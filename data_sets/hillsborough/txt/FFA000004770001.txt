 FA/HILLSBOROUGH



Time spent going through tha draft statements of*
and .Clark and amending them. Reading the file. Attending a
meeting at the FA at which John Dyson, Julian Gibson-Watt';
                                ancjfj      .....   were present.
The purpose was to look at tha videos,           We spent some time
discussing ticket allocation further.           We also looked at tha
highlighted bits of the video.           Ted .Crocker also came into
the meeting briefly and was shown the 1981 correspondence
with the police.           He could not remember any of it,    He was
also asked some hypothetical questions as to how he might
have dealt with the allocation.           He made the point that if
there had been representations from one club concerning the
venue before the decision had been made he would have told
the committee. He thought in fact that there were good
reasons for using Manchester rather than Hillsborough.                 Ha
confirmed it was standard procedure for a representative
from the Match and Grounds Committee to be at the Challenge
Cup Committee,           We raised the question as to whether \Crocker
needed anyone from Freshfields when ha was seen by the
police.       My advice was that it was not necessary especially
3s â€™^r'Crocker would no doubt need to come back to look at
the FA files in order to answer many of the questions, It
was stressed that he should not shy about saying that he did
not remember or needed to refresh his memory,  It was left
chat he would contact the FA once he had heard from the
oolica,
I also .had the opportunity of brief discussion with
Graham Kelly.  1 told him that I thought it was important
that ha read all the papers and he should give his evidence
on tha basis of any background knowledge he had from his
time at the league. He should not restrict himself purely
to matters he knew from being at tha FA.   It also appeared
that he could remember there being another meeting on the
Friday before the Challenge Cup decision was made which
                and       were at. He could not remember
much about the meeting. It was agreed that we would speak
to       andl         about it. It was agreed that I would
see       andl         at 11 o'clock the following morning.

Total time engaged: 7 hours 45 minutes of that 1 hour
travelling.

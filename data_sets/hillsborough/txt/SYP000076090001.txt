            minutes           walk     away        from     the        ground.             We    walked            down      to       the       ground and

            bought        some       scarfs          and    badges           on the                        There         wa s     a    large          crowd

            p ac k ed ,       people       were          pushing        target        in a n d        two      Policemen               on       horse       came

            into     the       crowd       to      force        pa^Tple to          form        queues.                 We w e n t         to    the

            turnstiles              and    eventually              got       into     the       g r o u n d at a b o u t              1 4 4 0 h ou r s ,       we

            We    went        onto     the      terrace          behind        the       g o a / and        could          see        there          was    some

            enclosure           seemed          to       fill     up    suddenly.




            There        was    s om e     pushing          and        swaying        and       because            of    that         we    moved          back

            to a b o u t       5 yards          from       the     perimeter             fence        a n d we          stood with               our       b a c ks

           had      started             but       I could       not       see    thf     pitch.               I turned                 round a n d           was

           still         with        me.            I could         see    there        was       a gate        on        to         the    pitch.              The

           getting            o v er      the       perimeter         fence       but      I thought                I could                get    to    the      gate,

            I got          over      to      the     fence      and / e a l i z e d           I would           h a ve         to      climb       over         to

           gate         and       the     police         were       letting       us     out.             There           were         a    lot    of

           he    brought             him      over       to me.            While        I was          l o y i ng         for                     I sa w

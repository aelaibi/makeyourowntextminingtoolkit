 PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE FILES ABOUT HILLSBOROUGH


 I return to you herewith the files about the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster which
 you kindly obtained for me from the Public Record Office in July last year. I attach
 PR O’s list of these files - they are all there.

 The files were needed for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny of evidence about the
 disaster. Now that he has finished and reported to the Home Secretary, I expect that
 PRO would like their files back.

 Some, but not all, are in the cardboard boxes (usually 3 files per box) in which PRO
 supplied them. I may be wrong but I think RMS have the other cardboard boxes
 somewhere. At all events, I haven’t.

I am afraid that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has put marginalia on some of these files (despite
my asking him not to). The files in question are the ones which contain the transcripts of
Lord Taylor s hearings - H O 397/46 to 58. I am very sorry about that.

Thank you again for your help.

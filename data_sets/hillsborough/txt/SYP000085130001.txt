             Upon      arrival          at      this    pjyfnt    I saw       that    many       of   the     supporters           from       this

             and     distressed.

             It a p p e a r e d        t h at    there    was     some       major    problem         inside       the      stand       and

             more      and more           people        were     trying       to    get    through       the      gaps      in the       wire

             fencing         and       onto      the    pitch.        General       control       wa s   maintained           of       the

             crowd      coming          onto      the    playing        area.       This    control         was    kept     until        all

             the     crowd        had     left     the    stand.

             At     4.45pm        we    left      the    ground        to    perform       stand      by d,uties         on P e n i s t o n e

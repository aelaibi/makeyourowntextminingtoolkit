Lane towards the traffic lights whilst near to the Four Lanes Cafe at the

lights.   I saw about ten people crowding around a single man selling tickets.

I would describe him as a white male between 20 to 50 years, about 5' 6" tall,-

stocky build, clean shaven, I think he may have had short fair hair.   He was

wearing a long crcenbie type navy blue coat.

I say "selling tickets" I didn't actually see him pass the goods over but my

wife did and say money changing hands.

The ten people I took to be Liverpool fans due to the emblems on the hats and

the clothes they wore.

The group dispersed and we continued walking along Leppings Lane until we came

out on Middlewood Road and then into Wadsley Lane.   There was a steady flow of

fans walking towards us and heading towards the ground.   I saw that a large

number of the supporters were drinking various alcoholic drinks and had more

with than.

I saw one fan with a carafe of wine from which he was drinking as he walked.

Another fan had about half a dozen Old English Ale bottles under his arm and in

his hands, I know Old English Ale is a strong beer made by Whitbreads Brewery

and could have been brought at

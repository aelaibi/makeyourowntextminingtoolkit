        Dear Sirs

        Hillsborough

        Your letter dated 28 February 1990 addressed to the Director
        of Public Prosecutions has been passed to me for reply.

        Firstly could I express, through yourselves, my sympathies to
        your clients Mr and Mrs Harrison for the tragic loss of their
        son at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989.

        I am sure you will understand that there is currently a
        criminal investigation being conducted by the West Midlands
        Police.     This investigation is not complete and the Director
        does not expect to receive the final police report until later
        this y e a r .

        The question of the institution of criminal proceedings
        against any individual or corporate body will be given the
        most careful consideration.

        The contents of your letter and the points which you make have
        been noted.

        Yours faithfully

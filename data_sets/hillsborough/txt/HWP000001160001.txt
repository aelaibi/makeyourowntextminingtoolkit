11 December 1996


Dear Sir/Madam

I have lived in the West Midlands for over seven years now, and remember
quite clearly the day of The Hillsborough Tragedy back in April 1989.

I am 27 years old and was bom and grew up in Liverpool. When I watched The
"Hillsborough" film on Thursday 5th December 1996 I was not only distressed
and upset at the reality of this tragedy, as it brought back bad memories for my
family and friends who attended Hillsborough that day, but most importantly I
was extremely Angry at the way the families of the victims had been treated.
The lack of sympathy displayed by Senior Police Officers involved, the
disgraceful and inhuman treatm ent of the families of the victims immediately
after the tragedy, and of course the verdict itself.

It is absolutely outrageous and I am writing to offer my help and support in
anyway I can, to help ease the suffering these people must face every day.

I work for                                      and would like to say that not
all "Media' workers are as Heartless as m e Tress‚Äù displayed in the film.

I believe strongly this case should continue and Justice should Prevail.

I hope my views will help and I would welcome any further request for help.

Yours sincerely

                                           and                    and        the      crowd was                s t ill     increasing             and     getting

                really          tight.           I do        not       really              believe             there       was    a    " C r o w d S u r g e ’ as

                reported             in the        Press,          but         more        and a gradual                   build       up    of    pressure.

                     remember          at 2 . 5 0           pm    (1450)           sayi ng           to                               how    intense          the

                crowd was             becoming              and    that          something                should          be    done.

 *2 . S U r ~   I did       not w i t n e s s              any    deaths           but         did    see       dead       bodies       afterwards.                 I

                did    not       assist          anyone           who        had      died        but      did       give       assistance             to a        young

                lad w h o        could       not           move    or       breath          and       was       panicking.I             cannot          really          say

                I saw a n y t h i n g            that        was       a     factor            in a n y o n e s        death      only       the       l a rg e

                number          of    people           causing             the     crush.

                At 3 . 4 5       pm     (1545)             I left          the     ground            of    my     own accord.                I did        not

                witness          anything              I consider                to     be a C r i m i n a l              offence.

                If    I h ave         any    views           on    the         way      the       incident             was      handled         after        the

                match       was       stopped              they would              be      that       there          was       a total       lack       of

                organisation,                no        plan,       Police             appeared             to     be      standing          around        and      not

                knowing          what       to     do,       I offered                  assistance                to a n        officer,          saying          that    I

                was    a        person who                 knew    first           aid,         but       he    refused          my    help       saying,          "Sod

             off    we    don't      need        your       t ype      of     help"

             On    the    other      hand        I did       speak          to a n o t h e r   who   was     helpfuland   appeard

             genuine.          I    must         also       say       that     when     I left the       ground there     were many

             many    Police         Standing          around        outside,          they      were     doing nothing    they

             s e e m e d as    though they            did    not      know what          was     going     on.

             I feel       t ha t    they         were       at    a    loss      as   what      to do.

             I did       not   go    to    the   corresponding                  g ame    last        year.

             I did       not   go    b ac k      to    the       ground        and    did      not see   Jamesagain.

                                                                                                         C A Sterritt     SIGNED

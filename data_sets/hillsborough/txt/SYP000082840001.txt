                                    A se c o n d man was        leaning        over    him a n d     I approached

         and on checking was               unable to find a pulse at w h i c h the man                          informed

         me that       he was a nurse and that               he had also         been    unable       to    find a

done     this      I was a p p r o a c h e d by a hysterical                  man    requesting my

assistance.           I accompanied              him back       inside        the    perimeter wall              where       I

saw a man          lying    on his        side    obv i o u s l y    injured        being       tended       to by



T o g ether       with these        men and another            officer         I assisted             in carrying

this man outside              the    perimeter wall            to the         road where an a m b u l a n c e wa

parked.

I ensured the man was                    breathing      and    r e m ained until               an a m b u l a n c e man

att e n d e d .

I was      then     instr u c t e d to form a part                  of a cordon        inside          the    perimeter

wall     b e h i n d the s t a n d t o prevent            fans       1e ^ l n g     the stand          interfering

leaving       the ground were              in an a g g r e s s i v e mood and              I

continually          felt     the    police officers                in the     line were           likely to be

a t t a c k e d by members          of the       crowd who were            shouting abuse and threats

t owa r ds officers.

During      this     time     I was a p p r o a c h e d     by a Liverpool             supporter             d e s cribed

as white male,             25 - 3 0 years,        5 * 7 ” tall,       slim build,              dark   hair,     wearing

a light       b l u e/turquoise           nylon tracksuit who                 informed me that a gate at

the     back of the stand *had been opened to a l l o w fans/in                                       (and that       he

himself       had got       in w i thout         showing      his     ticket) Resulting                 in there

oeing a crush on the terracing.                           He stated that the                    fans w ould         never

accept      that     it was        their    fault but that              the    police w ould get all                  the

blame     he stated that             it didn't matter                if the gate had been opened or

not     because      the    fans w o u l d have got            in a n y w a y       even       if it meant          putti n

the     gate t h r o u g h.

A woman approached                 the    line    of police          officers at one               point and said

" H e r e ’s one L i v erpool            supporter      who w ould         like to thank you all                     for

your     help."

The youth         in the      blue       tracksuit above,             on several           occasions          s t opped
                                                                                                                      PAGE

               other     fans from t h r e a t e n i n g        police officers and a s s i s t e d           in preventing

               any    further         trouble.

               A fter    the m a j o r i t y of s u pporters          had   left      the    ground    1 returned to         the

               Police       vehicle and          the serial       then   responded          to several    reports      of

               f i g h t i n g around      the    ground.        All were    found to be quiet            on arrival.

               It shou ld be noted               that       the serial   in w hich      I was a member         had only

               one    radio     between all         the       officers and as a         result       it was   not    until

               the    fan,    previously          described       informed me         of the events       that      I became

               f ully aware,          my   initial          instructions    being      that    the    events were      in

               fact     a large       scale      fight.

              After      public       order      patrol      a r o u n d the ground     the    serial    returned      to

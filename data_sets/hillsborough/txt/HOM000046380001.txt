             CHURCH v CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE



                                     NOTE
                                                                          i




TONY:



I gather from the note to John that the dependency claim is no

longer being pursued

                     .____________    _              ..            Although I

have pleaded it there is no claim to be made in respect of the

                                let alone a claim of this order.              As

a matter of interest can he prove that claim?

I have not particularised the pre-death trauma as there really

are no particulars.      Do you still need an Opinion on this?

If   there   are   serious   persisting     and   urgent   problems    please

contact me at Chambers or at home in the evening.             ?,

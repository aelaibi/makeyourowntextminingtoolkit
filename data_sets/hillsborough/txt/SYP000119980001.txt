            maintain           public         order       on P e n i s t o n e     Road        around          the B r a d f i e l d     R o a d ar e a .

            Having        attended            the    briefing             in the     g r o u n d s , the          serial        deployed          to

            our      designated              area.        In    company with              PC    2828 L i g h t o n         (from A3

            Adwick),           I maintained               a    presence          opposite           the R o y a l       Hotel     licensed

            premises,             which       was    open       for       business.            At    approximately               1pm     (1300)

            th e     landlord asked                 for       Police       help    to     clear          his    premises,         a n d after-

            cleared and              closed.           No      complaints          were        made       and     neither        were       there

            any      arrests.            A    very     large         number       of N o t t s .         Forest      fans       had    been

            drinking           at    the      premises          but w i t h       very     little          trouble.

            The      se r i a l     were      designated             to    proceed        to H i l l s b o r o u g h       ground        just

We   began          to m a k e           our       way      to H i l l s b o r o u g h        g ro u n d ,    messages             (c o n f u s e d ) ,

continuing            to       be        heard         o v e r the ra d i o.            We      got    a     lift      in     one       of    the

Police       transits               arid e n t e r e d             the g r o u n d s     on     the    Penistone              Road       side,

where      we w e r e          gathered             together.               At     this       time,        1 could          s ee     down       the

entry-way            onto       the       ground            i t self,       and      could also              see     civilians

carrying            people          on what            appeared            to     be a d v e r t i s i n g       hoardings.                  After

some      minutes,             our       serial          in    company with                  several         dozen       other          officers

were      directed             to    go       o n to     the       field and            once      there        to    face       the N o r t h

stand.          It w o u l d         appear            at     this        time     t h at     thoughts           were       still        of a

pitch      invasion.

We   went       onto       th e      pi t c h ,        and while            lining           up f a c i n g      the    North           stand       I

could      see       several             hundreds             of     spectators              actually         on     the      pitch          an d

carrying            people          on    hoardings                towards         the       N o t t s . Forest         end        of    the

pitch.          Once       we       were       lined          up,     abuse,         shouts         and mi ssiles               were         thrown

at   us    from       spectators                   in the          North        stand and           pointing           towards           the

teppings            Lane       end       of    the       ground.

Matters         as    far       as       orders          were        concerned           became         very        confused            at    this

stage.          From       a    continuous                  stream         of     voices        over       the      rad i o ,      suddenly

there      was       just       silence.               Looking            around        me    1 could          see     t ha t      it was

asked      the       Inspector                in    charge           of    our     serial         <1    cannot         remember              the

name)      if       I could          go a n d          help,        and     he     gave       his      permission             (we       appeared

to   be    doing        little            to       help matters                 just     standing            a r o u n d ).        I then

made      my w a y      to      the L ap pi n g s              Lane        end     of    th e     ground?           along       with

several         other          PCs       from       our       cordon.

I approached               one       se t      of      fans        gathered          around         a young          male       lying

comatose            and w it h           blue       tinged           lips.         We    tried         mouth        to m o u t h        and

gathered around                     a male          of a p p r o x .        40 years.               This      man      was      semi-

     At    this     time      a PS      came      around             asking        for       people     to    form a detail                to

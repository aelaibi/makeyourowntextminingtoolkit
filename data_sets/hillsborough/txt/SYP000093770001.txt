              registered number                     a South Yorkshire Police vehicle,



              Our duties were allocated to patrol Penistone Road from Bradfield Road

          on route for Nottingham Forest supporters travelling to the

          Hillsborough Ground but the bulk of traffic flowing along Neepsend

          Lane, Hillfoot Bridge to Penistone Road,                                                        but many of the vehicles were

          being directed off Neepsend Lane to park on and around Neepsend

          Industrial hstate.          This meant that many of the Nottingham supporters

              re using ’The O w l ’ and ’The V i c t o r i a ’ public houses and by about
I b J r t h     -----------------------------------------------------------
          s 12.30pm (1230) these places were packed solid with many overflowing to

          going.    Most of the persons on the outside were shouting and waving

          to other Nottingham supporters travelling past these premises.                                                                                                                              They

          were   in a happy and jovial mood.                                            Outside the                               ’V i c t o r i a ’ were several

          Special Constables whose duties involved directing traffic off

          Neepsend Lane to park.                    These Special Constables became the target

          for heckling from some supporters until PC RAMSEY and myself showed

          our presence.



          By about 2pm (1400)       traffic was crawling along Neepsend Lane and by

          then our patrol was more or less between                                                         "The O w l 5 and 'The V i c t o r i a ’

          of trouble on premises and on arrival                                                several minutes later all

          supporters had left to go to the ground.                                                                The             ’O w l 9 was empty as PS

          empty and all was quiet and PC RAMSEY and myself could then patrol the

          side roads in the Neepsend area re any possible thefts from motor cars.



          Up to 3pm (1500)   no other incidents were attended on our allotted area.

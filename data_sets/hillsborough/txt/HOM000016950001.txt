Dear Mr O'Neill

You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 7 March 1989 about
the approach made to you by your constituent Mr
      on the subject of inflatable bananas at
football matches. Lord Ferrers, in his letter
of 24 May 1989 mentioned that your
correspondence had been forwarded to me as the
Secretary to the Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylor who has noted it.

                                Yours sincerely

Dear Colin

One c^Jby constituents, Mr       of
has approached me on the subject of inflatable
bananas on the terraces at football matches.

He refers to an interview with you on Radio 4, on
the morning of Tuesday 28th February.  He feels
that you do not seem to realise the potential
dangers of these objects, for example, should the
terraces have to be evacuated in case of fire.

I am sure you would agree that this is a serious
point and as such I would appreciate your reply to
this as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely




Martin O ’Neill MP

Our Ref: FEP/89 35/48/2 (S)




Your letter of 7 March to Colin Moynihan on behalf of your constituent
Mr        1of             about the possible safety implications of
Ij'inflatables" at football grounds has been passed to me because of my
  esponsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act in England and Wales.

R g w n p ^ l h i l i t v f o r th e s a f e t y of lies with the   jrator.
Safety certificates issued by local authorities tor deSTgnated grounds contain
terms and conditions with which the ground operator must comply. These
include terms and conditions covering the size, number and situation of exits
and exits routes and the need for them to be kept free from obstruction.

The use of inflatables at football matches is a fairly recent phenomenon.
There is no indication that they post a threat to spectator safety but it is
something which both clubs and local authorities will need to bear in mind
when reviewing safety arrangements for grounds.

I am copying the correspondence to the Inquiry now being undertaken by
Lord Justice Taylor so that the point is not overlooked in his investigation
into safety at sports events.

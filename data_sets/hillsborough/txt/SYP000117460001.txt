               full        police          uniform.              I was       to be     conveyed          d i r ectly to H i l l s b o r o u g h

               F o o tball          Ground         by force             coach,      to be brie f e d for the day's                          duties.

              2.                      I     was      part       of serial 56 under                 the    leadership of                PS 2140

              Ta y l o r       from         C2.       We were under the                 direct        responsibility                 of     Inspector

              Newey.

               11.15 am             <1115)         that       date,        I took      up my        position to direct                    the

              The        football            fans       that       I saw were          condu c t i n g     t h emselves            in a good

POLICE CONSTABLE 951




1.          I reported for duty at Rawmarsh Police Station at 8.00 a.m.

(0800) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489).                       At this time I was in full

uniform.        I was to be conveyed directly to Hillsborough Football Ground

by force coach, to be briefed for the day's duties.

2.          I was part of serial 56 under the leadership of PS 2140 Taylor

from C2.     We were under the direct responsibility of Inspector Newey.

3.          Following      the    briefing    in    the    North    Stand      at   the    football

ground, I was deployed with the rest of my serial to Rawson Spring Road,

an industrial estate near to the bottom of Herries Road.                            At 11.15 a.m.

(1115) that date, I took up my position to direct the Nottingham Forest

contingent, to suitable parking places allocated within this industrial

estate.

The   football     fans    that   I saw were             conducting      themselves       in a good

natured    and    lighthearted      manner.        The    majority       had   parked     up    and

entered    the    ground   at an early stage.               On the approach of 3.00 p.m.

(1500)    the     roads     around Penistone         Road,        Herries       Road and Rawson

Spring     Road    were    almost    deserted.           There    were     the odd latecomer to
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   R-107

the     ground but          the    numbers were             not    so great as to             cause any          problems.

The     next    stage       of our       duties was          to a t t e n d C l a y w h e e l s Lane        Traffic

Of f i c e    for a    cooked meal          and     fol l o w i n g      this we were           to be on standby

o uts i d e    the gr o u n d on the P e n i s t o n e             Road end.

At about 3 . 0 5 p m          <'13050)      that    date,         I was       stood with the           rest      of my

serial        at the       corner     of Pen i s t o n e      Road and Herries Roa d outside                           the

Charlie Brown              shop.      We were a p p r o a c h e d          by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ,   who had

just     emerged       from the football                ground,          he    i mmediately        ordered        us    into

the ground.

At    this     time    I had no          idea what was             happening,          .1 ente r e d    the ground

wit h    the    rest       of my    serial       together w ith PS Taylor and                         Inspector

N e w e y who were          both    in posse s s i o n        of     police        radios.       As    I a pp r o a c h e d

the     playing a r e a        from      the entrance             betw e e n     the N orth S t a n d an d the

S p i o n Kop,     I saw the          players       leaving          the      pitch and a         large     crowd of

spectators         on the         pitch ar o u n d      the L e p p i n g s Lane          end of the            ground.

My    immediate        reaction was             that    there        had      been a pitch         invasion        by the

L i verpo ol      fans.        I then       ran across            the    pitch to offer my assistance,

there were         some Police            officers          present        but     not many.

As    I moved      closer         to the goalmouth,                I realised the full                 horror      of

w hat    had just          happened.         From only a couple                    of feet a way from the

perimeter         fences,         I could see          people were a l r e a d y            dead,      others were

turning        blue an d some were               having       d if f i c u l t y    in breathing.

I immediately              surve y e d    the    situation,             I shouted to the              people at the

•fences to wake             up,    I prodded them             to s t imulate           them     into    breathing

but all was           in     vain.        I then s t a r t e d to shout                to the suppo r t e r s

b ehind to move             back,     but    there was            no movement.            The     rest of my

colleagues were              doing       the same.           E v e r y t h i n g was     in chaos,        there was

no guidance           on what       to do,       s p e c t a t o r s were        climbing       over    the

perimeter        fences,          using     the bodies            crushed at the front as a ramp.

Police        o f f icers were        starting         to    pull       s pectators       over     the fence,           I
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           R-107

tried but           found      I was     too    small.      I then went          to gate     number 3      in the

perimeter           fence,       the    gate was open         but    the exit      from the       terrace was

blocked           by bodies.            I then a s s i s t e d    in the      dragging     out of some         of

these        bodies      onto     the     pitch.       This      task was h i n dered by some of               the

fans a l r e a d y on the              pitch,    they were         pulling at      us,     some were wanting

their        own    relatives and friends                dealing w i t h straight away,               w h i c h was

impossible at              this       time.

I could then see                 that     there a p p e a r e d    to be      plenty of space       to the

left     in the          number 2 enclosure.               I then shouted          to the     spect a t o r s       to

move     to       the    left     to    ease    the    crush on the           people at the front.             They

did not           move    so     I m o v e d over to this          part of the        ground myself,           there

I discovered              that    there was a fence               running      from front     to back

holding        the       people       in section       number 3.         As    I could do no more at

this     stage,          I r e t urned to gate          number 3,        there    I assisted        in the

removal        of a       very heavy man who was a p p a r e n t l y               dead.     Once    this man

was    removed,           we     could       clear a way through.

I then        climbed       into       the    number 3 enclosure,              by this    time,    a space was

beg i n n i n g     to    clear an d s p ectators were moving                    backwards,       allowing a

rescue        effort       on the       bodies     crushed        t o g ether at the front.           As   I

assisted           in the      removal        of the    bodies,      I then      realised that one of

the    barriers           had given way half w a y up the                   terrace.       Chief

Superintendent              Nes b i t was on the other               side      of the    perimeter     fence,

he was        shouting         for a chain to be fo r m e d to                 carry the    bodies away

from the terrace an d                   onto    the    pitch.       This      1 continued     to do until

all    of the        bodies       had been       removed.         This     effort was      h a m p e r e d most      of

the    time        by some       of    the    s pectators who were             unscathed,     they were

shouting and jeering and                       some    came ac r o s s and       punched out at the

Po l i c e    officers a t t e m p t i n g       to    rescue      the victims at the           front.

When    the        terrace was          clear and the         bodies       had been m o v e d     to the

g y m n a s i u m or to hospital,               I made my s e l f a v a i l a b l e     for other     tasks.
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      R 107

In the            confusion         I tried to help                   people who           had      lost        friends        etc.           I

then made my w a y to the                            centre       of the         pitch to other                 officers         to try

and         find the        rest       of my serial,                this was           not successful.                    I then

w a i t e d w ith other                officers            from C2 to a wait               further            instructions.

At 4. 3 0 p m         <1630)       that       date,         I r e t u r n e d to Rawson Spring R oad                           to

assist            in the     removal          of the N o t t i n g h a m Forest                   supporters.                From

there         I returned            to C l a y w h e e l s Lane,                then    back      to R a w m a r s h Police

Station.              1' boo k e d off          duty at 8 . 0 0 p m              <2000)      that date.

4.                    The    only       thing         I    can think            of that        could be             relevant in           an y

w ay        to this        enquiry        is that           the m a j o r i t y        of the       supp o r t e r s at          the

L e p p i n g s Lane         side       of the ground had been drinking.

On my arrival                at     the scene,              whilst        trying        to shout             to the       crowd to

move         back,     some       of    the     s upporters              were     o b v i o u s l y unaware             of what         had

happened,             they were           shouting a buse at                     the Police and                 the tubular              part

of the barrier was                      thrown over               the     perimeter          fence at             the Police.                 At

this         stage,        I had no         idea what             the     barrier was             that        had been thrown,

I only became                a ware       of the d a m a g e d barrier                   once       I was         inside       the

t e rrace.

5.                    My    r e a ction       was         to try and            reason with the                 crowd,       but this

was         impossible,           the     crowd a p p e a r e d to be beyond                        reason.

6.                    I did handle             bodies at             the    base       of number 3 gate and                           inside

the         number 3 terrace.                   The        bodies         I moved       from the base of the gate

were moved             onto       the     pitch,           there         they were        tended to by other

services.              The       bodies       I helped            to move         from the          terrace were               passed

a l o n g a line            of    police.             I have        no    idea who         the bodies were                   passed

to.          I cannot        give any d e s c r i p t i o n               of any of these                    that     I passed on.

At this            point,        e v e r y t h i n g was        hap p e n i n g    very quickly.

In the confusion I tried to help people who had lost friends etc.                       I then

made my way to the centre of the pitch to other officers to try and find

the rest of my serial, this was not successful.                 I then waited with other

officers from C2 to await further instructions.

At   4.30 p.m.    (1630)    that    date,      I returned    to Rawson    Spring Road,        to

assist in the removal of the Nottingham Forest supporters.                      From there I

returned to Claywheels        Lane,      then back to Rawmarsh Police Station.                 I

booked off duty at 8.00 p.m. (2000) that date.

4.            The only thing I can think of that could be relevant in any way

to this enquiry is that the majority of the supporters at the Leppings

Lane side of the ground had been drinking.

On my arrival at the scene, whilst trying to shout to the crowd to move

back, some of the supporters were obviously unaware of what had happened,

they   were    shouting    abuse    at   the    Police   and   the    tubular   part    of the

barrier was      thrown    over the perimeter        fence     at    the Police.       At   this

stage, I had no idea what the barrier was that had been thrown, I only

became aware of the damaged barrier once I was inside the terrace.

5-            My reaction was to try and reason with the crowd, but this was

impossible, the crowd appeared to be beyond reason.

6.            I did handle bodies at the base of number 3 gate and inside the

number 3 terrace.          The bodies I moved from the base of the gate were

moved onto the pitch, there they were tended to by other services.                          The

bodies I helped to move            from the terrace were passed along a line of

Police.   I have no idea who the bodies were passed to.                  I cannot give any

description of any of these that I passed on.                  At this point, everything

was happening very quickly.

7.            I have   policed     several     big matches     at Hillsborough Football

Ground in the past, for matches involving Sheffield Wednesday, I have
                                                                              PAGE 6

usually been miles away from the ground and had no part in the policing

of the crowd.     I was on duty on the Leppings Lane side of the ground in

1987 for the semi final between Leeds United and Coventry City, my duties

there entailed the orderly removal of Leeds supporters from their coaches

and into the ground.          I had occasion to arrest a supporter for being

drunk   and   he was   disorderly     on a PSV.     In   1988, I was     on    duty    at

Hillsborough Football Ground for the semi final involving Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest.       On    this   occasion my   duties   included   policing the

outside of the Leppings Lane entrances to the terraces.           There I searched

the Liverpool supporters on their arrival.          On this occasion there was no

late build up of supporters of the same scale as those I have witnessed

on the TV coverage of this year's event.

Thank you for your letter of 27 August to the Minister for Sport
which has been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for safety at sports grounds.   I apologise for
the delay in replying to you.

There is no dispute that a tragedy such as that which occurred
at Hillsborough must not happen again.  Its lessons have to be
learned.  Football, including the spectators, must look to the
future.

Lord Justice recognised, in his Final Report on the Hillsborough
Stadium disaster, that there is no panacea which will achieve
total safety and cure all the problems of crowd control at
football matches.   He was satisfied that seating does more to
achieve these objectives than any other single measure.       The
Report identified that all seated accomodation is also consistent
with the policies of both FIFA and UEFA.

All seated accomodation is, we believe, a major step towards
creating a better, safer environment in which all spectators can
enjoy the game.    That is why we have supported Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendation and are implementing it.


                                             Yours sincerely

supporters,                 some    10 0 at m o s t .              We     were       requested             to    cordon          off       the

front       of       th e    entrances           to     keep       fans        from       the    turnstiles.                 There were

quite       a few P o l i c e           Officers            there         at    t hi s     time.

An    ambulance              was    called         for,       to      this      g a te.         Upon       its a r r i v a l ,         a

watch       the       ambulance.               1 saw        two       people         led     into      the       back       of    the

obviously             dead,,        I followed my                  serial           member       through           the      tunnel          onto

the       No .3 terrace,,               We     walked         along        the       fence       b e t w e e n 3 a n d 4.                  As    1

                                                                                                                                          R73

looked         towards             the      ground        I saw P o l i c e m e n              and    supporters              running

around         on    the       -field.             1 s till         thought          we       were    heading           for      a mass

fight       on the            grass.           We       got    to    the       front          fence,       where        1 saw 2 men

tieing         up a       piece          of    t hi s     fencing.              We       made       our    way     to      the     No.     3 g at e

and    onto         the       field         to m y       right, I heard                   soroorte s h o u t          for     assistance,

1 turned            to    se e      several             men,      including              Police,          passing          a man       through

another         h ol e        in the          fence.           I ran o v e r             to    them,       grabbed          an arm and

helped         carry          t hi s     person          o n to     the    grass.              Parked         in f r o n t       of    the         h o le

in the           fence          was an a m b u l a n c e .            We       carried          this       man around             t^he        back

of    t hi s    vehicle.                 I looked          to     see      where         t hi s     man       could     be     laid        and

saw    bodies            all       around          the    rear       of    the       goal       area.           The     only       cle ar          area

to    the      s id e     of       the      am b u l a n c e , where            the       goal       net      ba ck     post       wa s

situated.                We    put       the       man    on      the     floor          and      1 started           heart        massage,

whilst         X believe               PC     Knowles,            A"i or A3,             did m o u t h        to m o u t h .          I was

also     aware           of    another             PC    checking          for       a    pulse.           We    tried        to      revive

t,h i s m a n f o r s e v e r a 1 m i n u t e s ,                   w h e n w e w ere             t h e n j o in e d by a m a n in

jumper         and       trousers,             who       asked       the       condition             of    the     supporter              and       how

long     we     had       been         trying.            When       told       he       said       "LEAVE:. H I M ".            We    wrote

our    numbers            on       the      mans        hand.        He w o r e          a fawn and white                   jumper            and

was    heavily            bu il t .           We    pulled          his    jumper             over    his       head and went                  back

to    the fen ce ,            where         we      grabbed another                      person       being       carried           over        the

wall.            On      t r y i n g to get         t h is      man       into    a space             to      "work     on*,       we         again

had    to w a l k         around            the     back       of    the       ambulance,.                I3y t h i s      time       the a r e a

was    so      crowded             with       bodies          I had       to    stand          on    people        laid       behind           the

goal     mouth.               We    bent       down       to w o r k       on     this         p er s o n ,     w h e n we       were         told

to    le ave        it    by       the      man     in the          jumper        and         trousers,          whom        I believed

was    a Doctor,,

I was       then         told       to      stand        in the         terrace           with       other       Officers.                1

looked         around          but       could          not    find any           of m y          serial.          I left          the

terrace         and walked                  onto        the    field,,           I wa s        s h o u t e d at       by    groups            of
fans,      who       b l a m e d me     personally               for    opening            the     gate™       Several         youths

walked        to me       and     s h o w e d me        tickets         that       had       not    been     checked.

OBVIOUSLY            these       were     the      people         pushing          at      the     gates     before          the   game

started,           but    1 said        nothing           as     they were            already          in f i g h t i n g     m ood.

1 did        find m y s e l f       arguing          at    one     stage         with        a youth.          He w a s       with       two

or     three       others.          He w a s       shouting            about       th e      line      of P o l i c e    across          the

halfway         line      and     the     fact       t h at      supporters               were     carrying         dead      to    the

gym.         The     youth       was    ushered away               by a n        older          man,    still       a Liverpool

supporter.                 Iwas       then aware               that    I had        b e c o m e the       centre        of

a t t r a c t i o n for     about       a dozen           supporters,                     some trying         to    c a l m the

situation,              others      shouting.              1 then         f e lt      a    push     in the         back,      1 turned

to     f i n d PC M c F a r l a n e       and      another,            unknown,            officer        stood      by m y        side.

We     then withdrew              from       the     confrontation,

A Superintendent                  was     now w a l k i n g        around          the       field,       asking        Officers          to

try     to    c l e ar     the    field        if we       could,        without             incident.           Anyone        not

wanting         to      leave     should        be      just      left,.         We       did    this     duty      until      the

message         over       the    speakers              s a id    the     game        wa s      postponed          and would

supporters              leave     the     stadium          in a n       orderly manner.                     together          with

PC     M c F a r l a n e , left        the    ground           via L e p p i n g s         Lane     and walked           back       to

th e     roundabout           for      Phase       3.

Some      two      or     three     minutes          l ater       we    were       joined          by P S A s h t o n        and    the

remainder            of    the    Serial.

(iu:!9,    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE! ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE POL JCF

           OFFICERS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



           It seemed total       chaos    there d i d n ’t seem to be anyone   taking

           charge and Police individually didn't seem to know what they

           should do - There were        individual acts of attention to injured

          spectators and to stretcher carrying but eventually it seemed

           to be trie fans on the pitch who were treating and doing things

          There were Police on the fences then pulling people out.



33°.      HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF TH1C

          HATCH STEWARDS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



          Only that my overriding        impressions that their olid’nt seem to be

          any co-ordination between stewards"Gates and Police as to what

              as were full and which areas had capacity at the Leppings Lane

          ena •■■■ w h u n   resulted in the centre section becoming fuller and

  G37.        DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

              FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



                nave maae my observation on this although I remember my

              impressions that the communication between Police and Stewards

            must nave been lacking someone not to have stopped entry to the

              centre section of Leppings Lane terracing that could have been

            done 45 rnins before kick off.                  And I   have an impression that

            merseyside teams are blase about semi                      finals and arrive on time

            but hang around to finish their drinks and associate before

            going in,

           things      we    touched          upon    the      possibility          of

E N D OF   REPORT
                                                          24 April 1989

I refer to our telephone conversation of 20 April when among other things
we touched upon the possibility of officers being provided with a copy of
their statement.

Hammond Suddards, Solicitors, of Empire House, 10 Piccadilly, Bradford,
have been appointed to act for the South Yorkshire Police in respect of
the legal actions that have been commenced against U3 and also in
connection with Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry. They have also raised the
question of obtaining statements of evidence from police officers involved
in the event, and rather than duplicate effort it would seem appropriate
if those officers your team interview could automatically be provided with
a copy of their statement for their retention and for the information of
our legal advisers. If you agree the principle I shall arrange the       ?
mechanics by which we obtain a copy of the statement.

AI 30 there will be many potential lay witnesses of whom we have made you
aware whose evidence our solicitors would wish to obtain and thi3 i3 an
issue that may need to be addressed between our solicitors and your
Inquiry in the not too distant future.

 In the post match phase we arranged for the video tape of events at the
 Leppings Lane end to be exhibited as the master copy from which we obtained
 a working copy. I now understand that your team has taken possession of
 both copies together with all the negatives and photograpnie eznibits of
 the events obtained by ourselves. At the request of our solicitors I
.would ask for the return of the working copy and a copy of all our
 photographs in order that we can pursue our own needs.

One of the writs we have received alleges criminal conduct and the
question now arises as to whether we should pursue normal procedures,
namely enquire into the circumstances outlined in the writ and submit the
result of the investigation to the Director of Public Prosecutions.   _

I also enclose for your information a copy of a letter I have received
from Sir Cecil Clothier in relation to the investigation of complaints
arising from the Hillsborough disaster, together with a copy of my reply.


                                                                 Continued
* ‘ - G J Dear £aq QPM DL LLB             - 2 -                    24 April 1989


      I would appreciate some guidance from Lord Justice Taylor on how we should
      proceed in respect of these matters.

      Finally, I appreciate that this letter i3 a mixture of requests, some that
      require your decision and some that will require the opinion of Lord
      Justice Taylor. If in your opinion I should be pursuing these i3auea
      through another channel rather than yourself would you please 1st ms know.

               At    the     briefing             I was      t e a m e d Tff^with PC                Baxter,             of    the W e s t        Yorkshire

               turnstiles              at    th e    Liverpool             end     of    th e      ground,

               We    commenced              our     patrol       at      about       1000         hours       and       I spent          t h e M ^ i rst

               half     hour       or       so    showing        PC      Baxter         the       area around                the    ground and

               pointing           o ut      the     streets          etc    t h at      I knew          the       names       of a n d      both       of us

               trying        to    locate           the    possible          trouble              spots       etc.

               A l t h o u g h PC        Baxter       was       probably           relying          on me          to    know       the     a r e a he

               couldn't           have       been     further            from      the    truth!!                 I didn't          say a ny thing             to

him    but    my knowledge                of    the a r e a a r o u n d              the     ground          is    to    say       the

least    limited and                as    to    the       inside          of    the     stadium          it s e l f ,        it    is    non

existent}!,             never       actually          having          been        inside          it.

Never    mind,          I thought,             we'll       probably             be a b l e        to    cope       between          us.           If

we    can't    I suppose             we      can always              ask!

The    first       couple       of       hours       of    p atr o l       went        very       quietly,          no       trouble,

other    serials          in the          area       getting          themselves               organised.                Most       of       the

police       officers          I saw a r o u nd L ep pi n gs                    Lane       were        from my Division,

Doncaster,          and    probably             knew       the       a r e a as        well       as    I did.          Ha!       Ha!        At

least    I had a          radio          to a s k     for       help       if     I needed             it.        They       didn't.

About    midday          there       was       a steady          flow          of L i v e r p o o l      fans,          mainly          older

men    with wives          and       ch ildren who               have          arrived         early         by    car       a n d well

organised          coaches,          making          their wa y            along        Leppings             Lane       to    the

turnstiles.              All    very         pleasant,           cheerfull              and       queueing          o r d e r l y at          the

turnstiles          to    get       i n to     the    ground.              If     they're          all       like       t his      t h e n we

will    have       an    easy       day      I thought.

At    about    1300       hours          the    majority             of    the       Liverpool           coaches             began       to

arrive       and were          sent       into C l a y w h e e l s             Lane     for       parking          and       to

discharge          their       passengers.                 We    parked           on    th e      forecourt             of L a w Bros.

Coaches.           As    the    buses          emptied          the       number        of     fans      increased                greatly

and    they were          the y o u n g e r          fans       in    large          groups        and       gangs.          Many       of

them were          drinking          or      carrying           ' fo u r       pac ks *      or    plastic          2    litre

bottles       of    beer       and       la ger .         Most       of    them appeared                 to       have       been

drinking       to       some    extent          and       some       were       so     drunk       they       could          har dl y walk

without       help       from       their       mates.           As       they       got     nearer          to    the       ground          they

began    chanting          and       singing          etc.,          some       were       starting           to    get       abusive

and    their       behaviour             slowly       became          worse.

About    1400       hours       we       moved       from Le pp ing s                Lane      into P e n i s t o n e             Road       to

escort       the    fans       to    the       ground who             had a r r i v e d           by the S p e c i a l             T r a i n at

Wa dsl ey Bridge.               Generally             they were                good     humoured and                well          behaved

a n d we     got    them       to      the L ep p i n g s           Lane    turnstiles                without          any     trouble

and    in g o o d     time        to     get    into        the      ground       before          kick       off.

By    this    time,       due       to    the       volume          of    people       in L e p p i n g s         Lane,        it wa s

almost       impossible             to    drive         th e     van      safely along                the    road and           it

was    closed       to all          traffic.

We    parked       in L e p p i n g s        L a n e,     in the          entrance          to    the U s e d T y r e           firm,

( m a r k e d A on m a p s )           and     kept       observations                on    the       turnstile           area.         At

this    time       the    area         in f r o n t       of     the      turnstiles             was     packed with

supporters          but     there         appeared             to    be    no    trouble,             they were           queueing,

sort    of,    and       they were             getting           into      the    ground,             albeit       slowly,           without

any    problems.

There       were    however            large        numbers          of    fans       just       hanging          about,        sat     on

the    parapet        walls         of    the       river        bridge,         sat       on    the     footpaths,             stood

outside       the     chip        shop and           the       other       shops       in the          immediate              area and

they were          making         no a t t e m p t        to     join any         of       the    queues          at     the

turnstiles          which         were       now     relatively             quiet          to w h a t       they       had     been.         A

lot    of    these       fans       were       s t ill      drinking            their       stocks          of    beer        etc.

The    flow    of     fans        along        Leppings             Lane    had       now a lmost            stopped.               It was

about       1450    hours.             I decided            to      take    a    last       look a l o n g         Leppings           Lane

before       going       i nt o     Niagara          fo r      our       meal    at    1 5 0 0 ho ur s .           Just        as    I was

moving       off    from       th e      tyre       firm       the M o u n t e d       officers             began        to    round     up

the    fans    who       were       hanging          about          and    direct          them       towards          th e    turnstiles

I went       along       Leppings            Lane       to P e n i s t o n e      Road          around       the       roundabout

and went       back       towards            th e    ground.              The    road was             virtually           empty and

traffic       officers            were       again        allowing          vehicles             along       Leppings           Lane .

When    I got       back       to      the     Leppings             Lane    turnstiles                I c o u l d n ’t b e l i e v e         my

eyes.        There       was      a mob        of    fans ,         perhaps       1500          plus,       all    jammed           in the

pushing       towards          the       turnstiles              attempting            to       get    into       th e    ground.

were     having         difficulty                 controlling             these          fans    who       were        now    pushing

from     the      back       of       this       crowd a nd          people          at    the    front          were       in g r e a t

difficulty.

     number       of M o u n t e d          officers           were    trying             t'S^C^rce t h i s             mob away         from

A    p d i ce     l«ndrover                then arrived              with       a PA       system and an                   Inspector,            I

d o n "j k n o w       who       he was,           climbed       onto       the       roof       of the          vehicle         and     began

trying       to    stop          these       fans        pushing       by a p p e a l i n g           to    them        through         the PA.

He    shouted          at    them          for     several       minutes             and    tried          to    ge t      them around

the    side       of    the          ground        to a n o t h e r    turnstile              but      they       just        ignored

repeated          attempts             to    get        them    to    stop       pushing.

A Superintendent                      then       began        speaking          on    the     radio,            I d o n ’t k n o w w ho

he w a s     or w h e r e            he w a s      in    relation          to    the       turnstiles,                he    informed        the

control         that        the       s i t u a t i o n at      the    Leppings             Lane       turnstiles              was

getting         out     of       control           and    there       were       several          hundred             supporters

still      outside           the       gro un d who            would       miss       a good          deal       of     the    first       h alf

of    th e m a t c h        as       they would           not    get       through          the       turnstiles              before       the

kick     off,      which             was    now     due a n y        second.

He    then      suggested              that        the    kick       off    was       delayed          until          they were          all

inside       the       ground.              Control           replied       that          they would             enquire         whether

this     could         be    do ne.          I never           heard       the       reply       to    his       request.

There      was     then          a    loud       cheer        from    inside          the     ground,            possibly         the

players         coming           onto       th e    field       or    even       the       kick       off       itself        as m y w a t c h

was    now show in g                 1501    ho urs .

The    result          of    this          was     that       this    mob       of    fans       outside          the       turnstiles

became       even more                frenzied           and    began       surging          and       pushing             forward       even

this       mob was          determined               to       get    into          the    ground,         with       or w i t h o u t      a

To     get      out    of       th e      c r u s h at        the    front          several          of   them were             now     scaling

the     perimeter               walls        to     ge t      into       the       ground.           I could         see       police

officers             who    were          inside         the      ground           reaching          over     the        walls       to a s s i s t

people          to    get       over        out     of     th e     crush.

The Su per in ten den t                     then     told Control                   that     he w as         considering              opening

one     of      the    gates             to a l l o w      these         supporters             into      the      ground        as     in his

opinion          there          was       serious          risk      of       people       being          injured         or    even     killed

released.

As     I recall,            control              replied          that        if    he    thought         the      sitution           needed

such       action,          then          they were            in a g r e e m e n t        with       hijf

The     order         to    open          this      gate       in m y         v iew was         very      confusing             to a n y o n e

listening             on t h e           rad io.         As    stated          above       the       Superintendent                  ordered A

gate       to    be    opened,              now     did       he a c t u a l l y         mean    *A*      Gate       as    shown        on the

plan       or    did       he       mean     just        A gate          (eg.       any    of    the      gates          in t h a t    area       of

Was     the      correct             g ate,       he m e a n t ,         opened?           I suppose            only       the

Superintendent                      knows        that!!

 became       obvious          to    us     listening             to    the       radio     that          everything          was      not

 OK    and    there       seemed          to    be    some        sort       of     problem          now       developing         inside

 the     ground.          From       th e      radio        traffic          I thought           there          was     an attempt

 being       made    by L i v e r p o o l           supporters            to      invade        the       pitch.         I thought

 that     the      dogs    might          be    requested              to a s s i s t      with       clearing           fans     off       the

 pitch       so    I remained             in L e p p i n g s       Lane        near       the    turnstiles              rather        than

  return      to N i a g a r a       for       my meal.

 A    few m i n u t e s    later          the       radio     traffic             began     to       get       somewhat        confusing

 and     after      a short          period          of     furious          conversation                 in w h a t     sounded          like

 almost         panic     stricken             voices,        th e      radio        suddenly went                 silent       for a

 few     seconds         and    I heard             a voice        say,        quite       calmly and              plainly        "We

 have     some      dead       bodies".

 There       was    then       a sort          of    unreal        feeling           of    disbelief              and    numbness

 about       and    even       those        officers          around           me    without          radios          seemed      to

  sense      it    becaue       t h e y all          started           to a s k      what       was       going       on.      It was

  difficult         to a n s w e r        their       questions              because         I didn't             really       know

 m y s e 1f .

 This      'feeling*           soon       gave       way     to a s i t u a t i o n         of a l m o s t         total       p a ni c     as

~~^ust a b o u t     every          senior          officer        who       was     on d u t y       started           to    try and

  organise         the    situation             with        the    result           that    radio          procedures           went        out

 of    the    window       and       the       radio        traffic          just        became       a    complete           incoherant

  garble      and anyone             who       wished        or    needed           to    say a ny th in g            relevant         to

the       situation             and     take       command.           Everyone             was       busy    doing          his     'own

th in g '        and       that    didn't          help anyone              or a n y t h i n g .

The       time        was       now about          1515 hours.                 I was        s t i ll     in L e p p i n g s         Lane         when

my        commander,             Insp.       Phenix,          arrived          to     j o i n me.           The    first          time        I'd

seen        him       since       the       briefing          at    0900       hours.            I asked          him       if    there          was

anything              we    could       do    to     help,         but    he     just       l o o k e d at me           and       said

nothing.               I r e p e a t e d my          question and                this       time       he    replied             abruptly

    " N q 'V a n d w a l k e d         away.         He    appeared            to     be     in a s t a t e        of       shock        and was

    totally        confused            by    the     things         that       were        going       on a r o u n d        h i m as         there

were        now       traffic          cars,       ambulances             and       fire      appliances               arriving             in

Leppings              Lane       all    with       sirens          and    blue        lights          etc.    working.                 The       area

    was    becoming             chaotic.

    About       a minute          or    so    l at e r     Inspector             Phenix          returned          to m e          and      said,

    as    though my             previous          question          to    him       had     finally          registered,                 "I      don't

    think       so,    have       you       had your          meal       break        yet?       "     I told          h i m we        hadn't

yet        so    he    despatched             us     to N i a g a r a       for       our     m e al .       More       to       get     rid      of

    us    from     the      area       than anything                else       I thought              because          he    couldn't

    think       of a n y t h i n g      more       useful          for    us     to    do.

    It w a s     1520       hours       when       we     got      into     the       c l u b at N i a g a r a          and        got      our

meal.            I didn't          eat       much       I didn't          feel        like       it.        I went          into       the T V

Room        where          they were          showing           pictures            from      inside         the       ground.              I saw

    there       were       some    of       the    Police          dogs     on      th e    pitch        behind         the        cordon         of

Police           officers          near       the       Notts.        Forest          f ans.          I thought             we m ight            be

    n e e d e d at     the       ground       so we        left       the      club and              returned          to    our       previous

    position          in L e p p i n g s      L a n e.

    It w a s     now a bo ut           1535       h our s ,     w h e n we       got       back       to L e p p i n g s         L a n e.        The

    scene       that       we    s a w was,        to     put      it m i l d l y ,        t o t al    chaos.

The        road was             blocked       by e m e r g e n c y        vehicles,              mainly       fire          appliances

and ambulances.                        Opposite           the      entrance           to V e r e       Road       we    parked           up w i t h

about           ten    other       Dog       Handlers           and about             12-14 M o un t ed            officers.                  There

were     about          150-200         other          Police        officers         in L e p p i n g s      Lane         f r o m all

over     the       force        area,        apparently              responding           to     'Operation Support'

These        officers           were        just       stood about             in g r o u p s     or       still     sat        in t h e i r

vans     looking           bewildered              and       trying       to     find     ou t    what       was     going         on.

There        appeared           to     be    very       few    supervisory              officers           with      them and

there was           no     o n e , I could              see,       taking        command         of    them       from      the       senior

officers           at    t he      ground and            deploying             them     to a s s i s t       with         the    situation

As     with a       lot       of     police        operations,              they      appear          to    be a n        excellent

idea     in t h e o r y         and     when       'on       paper'       but     when     put        into    practice             they

sometimes           don't          quite       work      as    they       should.          As     in t h i s       instance,

'Operation Support'                         was    brought           into      action      and        from what            I saw went

according           to    th e       plan.         Officers           f r o m all       over      the      force        area       asked

to a t t e n d      at H i l l s b o r o u g h          Stadium and             t h e y all       duly       arrive         the re,       so

fa r    so    good,       but        then what           happens.              In a w o r d       nothing,           because

there        are    no    senior            officers          to m e e t       them,     explain what                is h a p p e n i n g

and     then       deploy          them      to    the       b est    advantage.               The     res u l t ,      hundreds          of

police        officers             stood          about       doing       nothing adding               even more            problems

to a n a l r e a d y          chaotic             situation.              As     what appeared              to h a v e      happened

at H i l l s b o r o u g h .

The    other        Dog       Handlers            and myself             remained        in L e p p i n g s        Lane         until

about        1600       hours        when         we    were       deployed        by Insp.           Phenix         to    standby        on

the    forecourt              of L a w      Bros        (Coaches)           Ltd.,        on L e p p i n g s L a n e        n e ar

Penistone           Road        in    c a se      of    possible         trouble         as     the L i v e r p o o l           f ans    were

now    leaving           the       ground.

Whilst       at     this        location           we w e r e        subjected         to a      barrage           of     verbal

abusie a n d        threats           etc.        from       the     fans    as    they       passed         en    route         to     their

coaches,           cars,        etc.

My    feelings           of     disbelief              and    sorrow        for    the     dead and           bereaved

families          was     quickly           put a s i d e          and   replaced         by     disgust,            anger        and

                     What      annoyed me               was    the    fact       they were          putting       the       blame      on a n y o n e ,

        I have received a copy of the letter that . '         to detective ergeant Julie
         w p e .on about ycur concern over the Hillsborough disaster, the criminal
        enquiry and the decisions that hsve been mads,       I have noted your disquiet
        uut I think it v/oiu.d be inappropriate for me to mate any comments,

        You say      in y o r r iettar that you are ready for explanations and I therefore
        c           W<M?         appropriate for you to raise your concerns through your
        Solicitor   so he can take up the matters at the Inquests which you will probably
        know tiy    now commence in Sheffield on 19 November 1990.

       Because the Inquests are about to commence i+        d be inappropriate for me
       or m y officers to fengags in explanations outside the prblic arena of the
       Coroner's Hourt < That his how i beliefs the Coro -£r would prefer it and I
       woi-iri •••;• , i’ll to bear with me in this regard.

  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.

2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                       Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:

      C.D. died from natural causcs.
                                                                             Re
      C.D. died from the industrial disease of

      C.D. died from dcpcndencc on drugs/non-depcndable
      on drugs.

      C.D. died from want o f attention at birth.

      (In any o f the above eases, but in no other, it is
      suggested that the following words may, where
      appropriate, be added:

      care/self-ncglcct').

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one

      his/her mind was disturbed).

      C.D. died as the result o f an attempted/self-
      induccd abortion.                                                      Verdict
     C.D. died as the result o f an accident/misadventure.

     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
          attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
          names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
          to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

          I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
          submit.

          Your/aO:aithfully,

     Dear Sirs,



     RE;          OUR CLIENTS                  -      CARL DARREN HEWITT DECEASED AND. NICHOLAS
     m C.HAEL... HEM T.T. ..DE.CE.&S.E.D,,.
     We acknowledge safe receipt of the Post Mo r t e m Reports in
     this case and are grateful to you for your assistance. The
     question has been raised as to whether these boys were under
     the influence     of alcohol  at the time   of the incident.
     Certainly one of the Post Mortem Reports mentions that a
     s p e cimen of blood was taken from the body for analysis in
     this respect.

     We should appreciate hearing from you                                                             with    a      note            of        the
     outcome of the further investigations.

     Yours          faithfully,

^          Sire,
He:        GAEL I). HEWITT (deceased) He.44.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

             Dear Reverend Clark,

             Re: Mr & Mrs. M- Hewitt, parents of Carl and Nick Hewitt (deceased).

             Thank you for your letter of the 22nd of April.   I regret the delay in
             replying.

             I am pleased to read that you feel that there may be some improvement for M r .
             & Mrs. Hewitt.

             I am very sorry to learn that they missed the conclusion of the Inquests.^
             However the summing up lasted for about 13 hours and the transcripts run into
             several hundred pages.  Copies can be supplied but would cost a considerable
             sum of money.

             An alternative, would be if the Hewitts came up to Sheffield and read the
             summing up through for themselves here at the Medico Legal Centre.  I regret
             that I have no information regarding the disciplinary proceedings, nor does
             it fall within my province.

             With regard to the photographs, I notice that Inspector Layton in his
             evidence regarding the Hewitts refers to a video Map 1 timed at 14.50.53.18
             but at the moment I am unable to trace the other reference which you mention
             in the evidence.

             In any case, the photographs were not exhibited at the Inquest and quite
             apart from the fact that I have no colour copying facilities, this creates
             various problems with regard to obtaining copies and releasing them.

             Yours sincerely,




             S.L.Popper,
             H.M.Coroner.

               Dear Dr. Popper,

                          Re: Mr. & Mrs. M. Hewitt, pkirents of Carl & Nick Hewitt, deceased


               I have been working as a Cruse counsellor with the above for the past two years.
               Now that the official inquest is finally over, I had hoped that Mr. & Mrs.
               Hewitt s grief might lessen a little.    There is some sign of improvement, but
               I think there are a number of factors which could help them.        I am writing
               to you to see if you can help in two matters.

               First, friends who promised to notify them about the     time of the summing-up
               failed to do so, and they missed your conclusion of the inquest.       I wonder
               if it would be possible for you .to send me a copy of the summing-up, and if
               possible the decisions regarding tzhe disciplinary proceedings relating to the
               five policemen.

              Secondly, the Hewitts and I took part in the very painful procedure with
              Inspector Mike Leightonwhen we examined photographs and identified the two
              boys just before their deaths. Mr. Hewitt at the time expressed an interest
              in two of thephotographs taken from the B.B.C. video      footage. He was unable
              to ask for them at the time, when it would have been possible J and when they
              became the possession of the court, he was informed by Inspector Mike Leighton
              that after the inquest was over it was very likely that you would release the
              photographs for copies to be available to the survivors. I am therefore asking
              on behalf of Mr. Hewitt a copy of the following photographs:

                    1.     From Map 1: 14.50.03.02
                    2.     From Map 2: 14^50.53.18

              In both requests I am acting according to the wishes of Mr. & Mrs. Hewitt
              expressed to me yesterday afternoon during our counselling session. I look
              forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

              Yours sincerely,

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

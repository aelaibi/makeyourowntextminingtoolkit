 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

Q14

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN

 ACCORD?

 AT THE DIRECTION OF THE   POLICE OFFICERS WHO CAME ONTO THE TERRACE,



 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A

 CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?                                /

 I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE REACTION BY THE EMERGENCY SERVICES WAS QUICK

 ENOUGH AFTER IT HAD BEEN REALISED WHAT HAD   OCCURRED.   I ALSO FEE!/THAT A

 PUBLIC ADDRESS ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED MAY   HAVE BEEN USEFUL.

 G34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY THE LARGE BUILD UP OF FANS

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND. THIS BUILD UP WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN,    IF   IT HAD

 BEEN CONTROLLED AT AN EARLY STAGE, THE NECESSITY TO RELIEVE THE
                                                                           /
 PRESSURE BY OPENING THE GATE, WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED.   I ALSO FEES/ THAT

 IF THE TUNNEL HAD BEEN CORDONED OFF, THE PROBLEM WOULD HAVE BE E)

 AVOIDED.

 HELPED.     A LOT OF   THE POLICE APPEARED TO JUST LEAVE IT TO THE FANS

 (B) POLICE DIDN'T      KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) ID CARDS WOULD CAUSE BUILD UPS LIKE AT HILLSBOROUGH

THAT CAN OPEN AUTOMATICALLY

£      INNER FENCES FORMING P0NS ARE WRONC

 1. IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR AMBULANCES TO GET ON THE PITCH * ^                    ^        |
                                                                 (^pi)r OlW<Ui^             '

 ABOUT 5 MINS7 BUT THE FANS DID.      \J

016

 3mW A T FIVE PAST THREE I SAW ONLY POLICEMAN PULLING AT THE FENCING

 TO PULL I T   DOWN.   I SAW ST.JOHNS AMBULANCE PUT OXYGEN THROUGH THE

 FENCES TO HELP FANS.

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. I THINK THAT THE FENCES AT GROUNDS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY SHOULD

 BE PULLED DOWN. THEY HAVE DONE I T NOW AT LIVERPOOL & GOODISON AS

 ITS BETTER VIEWING AND SAFER FOR THE FANS.

 2 ^   ALSO FEEL THAT THE I . D. CARD SCHEME IS CRAP.   IF THERE WAS A

 CARD SCHEME IN OPERATION AT THIS GAME.      I FEEL SURE MORE PEOPLE

 WOULD HAVE DIED/INJURED OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES.

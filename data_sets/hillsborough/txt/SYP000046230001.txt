                                FORCE CONTROL ROOM

                                 RECORDING SYSTEM



There are a total of four VHF radio channels and a

number of internal, national, emergency (999) and

motorway emergency telephones in use within the Force

Control Room.              In addition there are also direct lines

to the Fire and Ambulance Service controls available

to each console.              All incoming and outgoing radio and

telephone calls from the room are recorded on a

multi-channel ’Racal’ tape system.               The tape and radio

channel numbers do not correspond.



The following schedule 1 shows the ’Racal’ recorder

channels together with the corresponding

console/internal extensions/switchboard and radio

channels.               Schedule 2 shows the tape channel and what

is being recorded on it together with the console from

which it is being made.



This is explained in order that the reader can

understand the origin of the extracts taken from

transcripts of the recordings from the Force Control

Room system, which follow the schedules.



The UHF Channel 25 transmissions between the Force

Control Room and the Police Control Box at the ground

were on a ’stand-alone’ system and not therefore

 recorded.

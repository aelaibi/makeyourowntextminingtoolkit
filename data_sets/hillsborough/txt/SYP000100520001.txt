            At   9.00      a .m .     on S a t u r d a y ,    15 A p r i l          1989,        I paraded          fo r    duty       at

            Ecclesfield Police                    Station,           and    was       subsequently                conveyed        to

            Hillsborough              football       ground           for         briefing        re    the       Semi-Final.               I

            a r r i v e d at     the     ground      together              with       other       officers          at     approximately

            9.40    a . m.       At    this       time    there        appeared             to    be    very       little     activity

            around        the    ground       apart       from        that         of P o l i c e      Officers.

            Briefing         for      the    event       subsequently                 took       place       in    the     North       Stand        at

            approximately              10.00       a.m.

            My   duties         that     day w e r e      plain        clothes             foot       patrol       in M i d d l e w o o d       Road,

            together         with      Temporary          Detective                Constable           O'Brien,          paying

            particular           attention          to    teams        of         p ick    pockets          and    theft     of     and         from

            motor      vehicles.             My    supervisory              officer          being          Inspector        Scaife.

            At   the      conclusion          of    the      briefing              TDC     O'Brien          and    myself      made         our     way

            along      Penistone            Road    and      into      Parkside             Road,       this       would     have       been

            about      1 1 . 0 0 a.m.

            I saw      that      within       the     l ast     hour        there          had    certainly           been     an      increase

            in   pedestrian            activity          with        large         groups        of    youths       wandering           around
                                                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                                                              R 159

aimlessly          with        a    few       shouting           the    usual          football             chants.            We     both

made    ou r      way    along           Middlewood              Road       in    the        direction             of    the     hospital.

When    nearing          the        Texaco          petrol        station             we     decided         to     walk,      back           in   the

opposite          direction              towards          Hillsborough                 shopping             centre.

At    about       12    midday            as we     approached                  the    junction             of     Middlewood                 Road

and    Wadsley          Lane,            our a t t e n t i o n    was       caught           by P o l i c e        Sergeant            -1948

Miller       who       was     on m o b i l e        Transit           patrol.              He    stated           that     one       of       the

pubs    situated             f u r t h e r up       Wadsley            Lane       was       full       to    capacity            and          t ha t

there       was    a    large           n u m b e r of      people          outside          on       the    frontage            and          road

drinking          beer.            He    appeared           concerned             that        they may             get     out       of       h and.

Also    situated             at     this       junction           are       a    number          of    shops        where        a    l a r ge

number       of    Liverpool               supporters             had       gathered             for       what     can     only          be

described          as    a     drinking             session.            There          were       numerous              cans     of       beer

and    lager       being           and     had      been     consumed.                 I continued                 to    walk        along

Middlewood             Road        and     i n to    the     shopping             centre.              Whilst           walking           along

this    road       I again              saw    large        groups          of     youths          drinking             from     cans of

beer    and       lager.            Those that              I did       not           see    drinking            I could         h e a r pass

comments          as    to     "Where          is    th e    nearest             public          house?"

Once    TDC       O'Brien           and myself              had    patrolled                the       precinct,           we     decided               to

visit       Parkside           Section           House       via       the       p ar k      grounds.              At    about

1.00    p.m.       -    1.15            p.m. w h i l s t    walking             along        Parkside              Road,       I was

approached             every            five y a r d s      by a L i v e r p o o l            supporter             asking           for a

ticket.           On    eventually                reaching         Parkside                Section          House,         I saw          a

large       number       of y o u t h s           standing         behind             the     Section            House      and       around

vehicles          in    th e       parking          bay     situated             adjacent             to    th e    Section           House,

the    majority          of        whom were          drunk        and          were        subsequently                removed.               Again

by    the    accent          I believe              these     to       be       Liverpool             supporters.

I recall          that       whilst           inside        the    box/Section                   House       I heard           footsteps

on    the    roof.           On     inspecting              this       I saw about                four       youths         to       be

standing          on    top        of    the     Police       Station             Station             drinking           cans        of       beer/
                                                                         PAGE 3
                                                                         R159




lager.   Needless to say, I took prompt and necessary action and

removed the youths who were again from Liverpool.    Whilst engaged in

this I saw one youth emerge from the rear of the building holding a

can of lager in one hand and holding his exposed person in the other,

intending to walk along the road in this manner.    This youth was

spoken to and advised accordingly.

TDC O â€™Brien and myself thought it best to inform ground control of

the situation at the Section House, so that further attention could

be paid to it.

We were some fifteen minutes at the box before resuming patrol in

Middlewood Road.

At 2.15 p.m. TDC O'Brien and myself returned to the Police area at

the rear of the North Stand via the Penistone Road entrance.    Whilst

en route we were again approached by dozens of Liverpool fans looking

for tickets.     On arriving at the gym I mealed.

At about 2.45 p.m. I resumed patrol together with TDC O'Brien and

together with Police Constables Hiles and Moulding we made our way

along Penistone Road into Vere Road and into Leppings Lane.    This was

the first and only time during the day that I visited this side of

the ground and to be honest, I was taken back by the sight.    The

crowd appeared to be solid from the turnstiles 1-16, to near the

centre of Leppings Lane.

It did not however cross my mind that people may be injured

                                                                                                                                             R 159

as    a    result          of       such       a    crowd        forming.

We    continued                to    walk          past    Leppings             Lane     and    through              t he    car       park

situated             in H i l l s b o r o u g h           Park,        intending          to    go    back           i nto    the       precinct

in M i d d l e w o o d          Road.

It w a s        whilst          walking             in the        park       that      I decided            to       listen        in on       the

channel             used       by    ground          control           whilst       Police          Constable               Moulding

monitored                the    C.I.D.             channel.          I recall          hearing        at        about        3.00       p.m.       the

request             for    an       ambulance,             the       reports        of    somebody              seriously              injured.

Throughout                the       following             five       minutes        or    so    there           seemed        to       be    chaos

and       confusion.                 The       transmissions                 were      c lea r ,     b ut       everybody              seemed        to

be    requesting                ambulances                at     the      same    time.         I recall              seeing           two    or

three          travelling                along       Penistone             Road.         To    be    honest,           at     this          time     I

thought             somebody             was       over    reaching             until     I heard           a    voice        on       the    radio

who       I recognised                   to    be    Chief        Inspector            Sumner        who        stated        that          there

were       a    number          of       bodies          and     something          about       a    temporary               mortuary.              On

hearing             this       all       four       of    us     immediately             returned           to       the     gymnasium.

On    my arrival                my       stomach          churned          as    I saw        them    bringing               in    the       first

of    the       bodies          on a d v e r t i s i n g          boards.         One     after       the        other        fo r      some       few

minutes             I was       in       shock.           I j u st        stood     there       saying           nothing,              doing

nothing.             I recall             seeing          si x    Liverpool            supporters               carrying           a    dead

body       into          the    gym,          three       of     which       were      crying.         As        they        got       to    the

door       the       body       just          dropped          off     the      board.         It w a s         on    seeing           this    that

I tried             to    pull       myself          together.               I do      not     know    where           TDC        O'Brien          had

got       to    or       the    other          officers.

I grabbed                hold       of    a    board       and       ran     onto      the     pitch        with       th e

supporters.                    again,          I was       in d i s b e l i e f .        I saw       people           still        being

pulled          ou t      of    the       West       Stand        some       unconscious,             but        the        majority

appeared             dead.          I just          did    not       know what           to    do.     I saw           people           injured,

people          dead       and       people          in    grief.            I at      first        tried        to    see        to    all

three          at    once.           I recall             most       if    not    all     of    the     injured              were       being

seen       to    by a m b u l a n c e      crew.          Police       Officers          and    St.    John's.           I

resigned          myself          to    removing           those       who    were       obviously          dead       from        the

pitch.          I recall          there       were        Forest       fans       still       chanting        obscenities                   as

bodies          were    being          carried        in    front       of    the       Spion    Kop.         This       was       soon

to    stop.

I carried             some       three     or      four     bodies       from       the       pitch.        I recall

thinking          I was          fortunate           to    be    in    plain       clothes,          seeing        the       abuse          and

bad    feelings             being       directed           towards       t he      uniform          lads.         In m o s t       cases

understandable                   as    a grieving           heart       sees       no    barriers.            Each       journey             to

the    gym       the    amount           of     bodies          increased         two     fol d .      Ir e c a l l    when        I

brought          in m y      l a st      b o dy,     just        standing         and     looking,          thin k i n g that               t h is

should          not    have       happened.               I was       upset,       confused          and    did       not     know          what

to    do    nex t.          At    this     time       I saw       that       I was       not    by m y s e l f .

I eventually                directed          my     attention          to    assisting          the       uniform           Police

Officers          with       the       searching           and    identification                of    the     bodies.          I

assisted          some       three       or     four       officers          in   this        task.    I cannot              say    t ha t

I can       give       any       descriptions              of    these       bodies.           I merely           assisted          the

uniformed             officers           who       completed           the    reports.

I was       subsequently                 conveyed           to H a m m e r t o n     Road      Police        S t a t i o n where,

together          with       other       officers,              I took       missing          person       reports           from

relatives             and    friends.           It    was       only    at    this       stage       that     I    recalled             any

descriptions                of    the    bodies           I had       handled.           This    was       disturbing

knowing          that       the       person       they     were       looking          for    was    in f a c t       dea d ,         but

still       having          to    complete           the    report.

At    1 . 0 0 a .m.         that       morning        the       temporary          enquiry          room was          closed.           I

was    subsequently                   conveyed        to E c c l e s f i e i d      Police       Station           where       I

signed          off    duty .

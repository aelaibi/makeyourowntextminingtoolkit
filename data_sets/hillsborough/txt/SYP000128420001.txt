                  FA CUP SEMI FINAL - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989 (150489)

                  With regard to the above event I have to report that I reported for

                  duty at Ecclesfield Police Station at 9 am (0900 hrs) and was

                  transported to Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground for the match

                  between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

                  At 10 am (1000 hrs) all officers present were briefed by Senior

                  Officers.     I was a member of Serial 19 with POL PC323 PROCTOR as

                  supervising officer.       Our duties were outside the ground at the

                  Leppings Ln end near to the turnstiles which were to be used by the

                  Liverpool fans.    The duty consisted of the reception of coaches and

                  other forms of transport attending directly at Leppings Ln and general

                  public order duty.

                  At 11 am (1100 hrs) after the general briefing we attended at the rear

                  of the West stand where we received a further briefing from Inspector
                                                                     PAGE    2


SYKES, we ensured that all officers were aware of their duties.        He

instructed us to carry out selective searching of fans outside the

g round.

At about 11.10 am (1110 hrs) the serial took up their positions in

Leppings Ln outside the turnstiles and the mouth of the road that

leads to the official car park at the rear of the South stand.        On

leaving the ground I saw that there was quite a number of Liverpool

fans there waiting to get into the ground.     These supporters were well

behaved.     Several fans enquired of me where they could find a public

house open.     This was a regular enquiry throughout the day.

At about 12 noon (1200 hrs) the turnstiles were opened and fans

started to enter the ground.     There was still a fair amount of

supporters outside the ground who had no intention of entering the

ground.     Many of these fans were drinking alcohol from cans and

bottles and you could see them stopping other fans and asking if they

had any spare tickets.

Together with mounted officers at this location and other members of

my serial we were constantly encouraging people to enter the ground

and if they did not have tickets move them away from the turnstile

area.     All the time the volume of fans was increasing.

At 12.20 pm (1220 hrs) I saw a large group of fans on the footpath in

Leppings Ln approximately 50 yrds away from the turnstiles in the

direction of Penistone Rd N.     There was about 30 - 40 people blocking

the footpath and spilling over onto the road causing traffic to stop.

On going towards the group I saw a man I now know to be

                                                Liverpool.   I could see

that he had a handful of tickets he was offering for sale.       On seeing

me approaching he placed the tickets in his pocket.     He was arrested

for obstructing the highway and taken to the police room at the rear

of the North stand.     On searching ________ I found that he had 11
                                                                       PAGE         :


tickets for the Liverpool end and 7 tickets for the Nottingham Forest

end together with    701.64.     The tickets were checked with the Football

Club office and were originals.       I ascertained that the tickets were

being offered for sale at       35.           stated that he had obtained

the tickets from the Anfield ticket office.       After completing the

detention and submitted the file against               I returned to my

position in Leppings Ln.       The time then was 1.15 pm (1315 hrs).     The

crowds had grown but there did not seem to be any problems.       From that

point onwards the flow of fans greatly increased and it was noticeable

that many were carrying cans and bottles of alcohol.

These were prevented from entering the ground.       Leppings Ln was

thronged with supporters and I was continually moving people away from

the footpaths and from the middle of the road.       These fans were

directed to the turnstiles or away if they did not have a ticket.             Due

to the problem vehicular traffic was having difficulty negotiating

Leppings Ln, the road was blocked off at both ends.       I was made aware

just after 2 pm (1400 hrs) that a special train had arrived at Wadsley

Bridge Station containing Liverpool fans.       On their arrival at

Leppings Ln they greatly increased the volume of supporters there.             As

time went on it became clear that the amount of fans without tickets

was growing.

At about 2.30 pm (1430 hrs) I was aware of an incident that took place

in Leppings Ln about 50 yrds Catch Bar Ln side of the turnstiles.             I

had heard the sound of breaking glass and a gap appear in the fans

approaching me.     I could not see what was happening but went towards

this location where I saw.POL PC2120 THORPE and POL PC2333 ENGLISH

walking towards me with two youths who were obviously under arrest.               I

ascertained that there had been a fight between the rival fans.          I was

then approached by three men who showed me tickets they had purchased,

these tickets were obvioulsy photostat copies.
                                                                   PAGE         4


I then returned to a position nearer the turnstiles.      All the time the

crowd was growing and with other officers entered the crowd to try and

ease the congestion.

I cannot say the exact time but for a short time the double exit gates

alongside the turnstiles A were opened and then closed.

Mounted officers were still attempting to get the fans in orderly

queues.    I could see fans climbing on the walls outside the turnstiles

that allow fans into the standing area.    These fans were climbing over

the wall and into the ground.    I became aware of possible serious

problems outside these turnstiles due to the sheer volume of fans

present.   With other officers we went into the crowd in order to close

the iron gates situated about 15 yards in front of the turnstiles and

at the head of the road leading to the official car park.      So that the

crowd could have a more direct access to the turnstiles.      I then saw

a mounted officer alongside these gates having a problem with some

supporters and one appeared intent on getting to this officer.        I got

hold of this person and pulled him away from the horse, telling him to

calm down he was still trying   to push forward.   I pulled several

other people away from trying   to push past the horse.   The horse did

not have room in which to manoeuvre.    While I was in the crowd

several fans who were obviously Nottingham Forest fans with tickets

for the South Stand were attempting to reach this stand via the road

leading to the official car park, I informed them that they could not

reach the stand this way due to a barrier across the road, and

directed them to the correct way to the stand.     They got agitated and

annoyed because they could see a large sign above the turnstiles.         The

sign showed South Stand and an arrow underneath pointing down the road

to the car park.Due to the immense pressure of supporters around me I

had to physically push my way   back out of the crowd into Leppings Ln.

The crowed was getting denser   as kick off time approached and the
                                                                     PAGE        5


mood more agitated and aggressive.

The pressure seemed to ease and I found    outlater that a double     exit

door had been opened although I was not    aware of that at the time.

Sometime after 3 pm (1500) I received a radio message requesting that

all officers attend inside the ground at the Leppings Ln end.        I ran

through Gate a with other officers, through the North Stand and onto

the playing area,     On entering the playing area I saw people on the

pitch (supporters and Police).     It seemed to me that there had been a

pitch invasion,     Many supporters were climbing over the perimeter

fence and through the gate in the perimeter fence,     A lot of people

after getting out of the terracing collapsed onto the pitch.        Others

were directed to enter the pen adjacent    to the North Stand that was

fairly empty,     I could see the crowd in the   centrepen being crushed

forward and right up to the fencing.     The situation worsened and there

seemed to be hundreds of people and Police around,     I saw some

officers and supporters trying to pull away the fencing from there

supports.    I assisted them and then helped lift the bodies and injured

from the terracing on to the pitch,     At this time a St Johns ambulance

had been brought onto the pitch and was adjacent to the terracing.           I

helped lift two bodies into the ambulance. they were obviously dead

and were checked by the attendant,     Two more people were taken out and

after giving them oxygen they recovered,     I then assisted in carrying

several bodies to the gymnasium on makeshift stretchers.

One of the bodies that had been taken out of the teerracing was a Paul

Anthony HEWITSON,                                        -iverpool, with

help   I carried the body to the gymnasium where it was certified dead

at 3.55 pm (1555) by a            (Royal Hallamshire) I remained with the

body until it was identified by the youths father at 12.15 (1215) am

160489.     I was then present when the body was conveyed to the Medico

Legal Centre where details were given to Police Officers and the
                                                                           PAGE


        Mortuary Staff.

        Throughout the time I was on the pitch I was aware of Police,

        ambulance men and supporters giving first aid to people on the pitch.

        In my opinion due to the volume of supporters outside the turnstiles

        in Leppings Ln if the double doors had not been opened to relieve

        pressure there would certainly have been fatalities and serious

        injuries to the fans there.

        I have been a Police officer for 22 years in the Sheffield area and

        have served in the Division that covers Sheffield Wednesday Football

        Ground for 17 years.    During this time I have been on duty at most of

        the matches that have taken place there including previous semi

        finals.    Over the last 2 - 3   years I have performed duties mainly at

        the Leppings Ln and either on turnstile duty or coach reception.

                 I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present

                 stationed at Ecclesfield Police Station.

                 On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was on duty at the FA Cup Semi

                 Final taking place at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground between

                 Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.

                 A short time after 3.06 pm (1506 hrs) that date as a result of a radio

                 message requesting Police Officers to enter the ground.        On going onto

                 the playing area at the Leppings Ln end of the ground I saw people

                 climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the playing area.

                 After a short time you could see that a serious incident was taking

                 place.

                 I went to the front of the fencing and assisted the lift people and

                 bodies from out of the terracing.

                 One body that I lifted from the terracing was that of Paul Anthony
                                                                               PAGE     t



         HEWITSON,                   \                   , Liverpool.   On checking

         the body I could not find any signs of life.        A civillian who I

         assumed was a doctor stated there was no life in the body.

         The body was then taken to the Sports Hall at the ground.         I checked

         it for any identification       but there was not any.   At 3.55 pm(1555

         hrs) that date       (Royal        Hallamshire Hospital) certified life was

         extinct.

         I remained with the body in the Sports Hall.        At 12.15 am

         (0015 hrs) Sunday 16 April 1989 (160489) Mr William HEWITSON, the

         father of the deceased identified the body to me as being that of his

         son.

         I obtained further details from Mr HEWITSON which enabled me to

         complete the Gen 18 sudden death report.

         I then accompanied the body by ambulance to the Medico Legal Centre,.

         Watery St, Sheffield where it was handed over to DC WEIGOLD.         Details

         of the body were given     to him and the mortuary staff.

           SUBJECT s REPORT ON MY ATTENDANCE AT THE INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH

                                        FOOTBALL GROUND»




           With regard to the incident at Hillsborough Football ground, I have to

           report my involvement and feeling as followss-



           I started duty at 6 am (0600 hrs) at El as Force cover until 8 am

           (0800 hrs) when I collected PC1594 Allott from his home address and

           went down to Niagara for the briefing.     I was in good spirits looking

           forward to Policing the match after the success of last year’s semi -
                                                                  PAGE       2


final between the same two clubs, when everything had gone well with

just a handful of arrests made.



On arrival at Niagara we were briefed by senior Officers as to our

duties and who our partners were.   My partner was PC 1741 Squires from

the Nottinghamshire Police Dog Section and we were to Police the

Midland Station prior to the match, receiving both Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest Supporters.



We arrived at the station at approximately 1030 am and some Liverpool

fans had already arrived by train and were awaiting transport by South

Yorkshire Transport buses to the ground.   Most of them were in good

spirits although some had already been drinking and a number of

arrests were made by the serials in attendance there for drunk and

disorderly.   A number who had brought drink with them on the train had

the drink confiscated from them or they poured it down the drain.        A

second train of Liverpool fans arrived at the Station and they were a

little rowdier than the first and on instruction from Chief Inspector

King myself and PC Squires took our dogs from the vehicle and

patrolled the area where the fans were being held until they could be

put on the SYT buses and transferred to the ground.



Some of these fans didn't like this as they stated they had made

arrangements to meet people in City Centre Pubs prior to attending the

match, but they were still ushered back into the waiting group and

taken to the ground without any trouble.   We stayed at the Station

receiving the fans until 2.40 pm (1440 hrs) and then on instructions

from PS721 Hill, we attended at West Bar to take an early meal.     Both

myself and PC Squires remarked generally how well behaved the fans had

been apart from the odd ones who had been arrested for drunk and
                                                                     PAGE    3


disorderly and joked that we wouldn't get much overtime from this

match as it would be a repeat of last years semi - final.



We met up with PC1594 Allott and his partner in the canteen and I

believe at that time we   were all in good spirits,,   laughing and joking

again about the overtime and how     PC Allott and his partner had   been

patrolling Town Centre, attending several skirmishes at Pubs and how

we had been down at the Station, doing nothing much.



We were still monitoring the radio on Channel 29 when we heard control

ask PS Hill to send all his dog handlers from the Town Centre to the

ground as assistance was needed urgently.     We heard PS Hill tell them

to ring the canteen to inform us as we had gone in for early meal but

we managed to get through and tell them that we were already on our

way.



We went downstairs and as we were passing through the Station

Sergeants Office towards the Garage where the vans were parked I

remember a PC shouting to me “Denise, you used to work in Ops Room,

What's Operation Support mean?".



1 hadn't heard this come over the radio and asked him what he meant

and he said that it had come over the radio that Operation Support was

required at the ground. I informed     him then that it meant all

available Personnel was   required at the ground toassist with a

serious incident.   I then went to my van with my partner and looked at

my watch, seeing that it was only 3.05 pm (1505 hrs) and saying to

myself, "They've only been playing 5 minutes.      I wonder what's

happened?"
                                                                  PAGE      4


We arrived at the ground at 3.12 pm (1512 hrs) and parked on the

central reservation in Penistone Rd outside the Hop end of the ground.

A number of Police vehicles were already there and officers were stood

looking bewildered.



No one seemed to know what was happening and what was required from

us.   Then a call came from one of the other Handlers that we were to

take the dogs into the ground.     I took my dog and went into the ground

through gate '0' and stood with the other handlers near to the Police

room at the top of the ramp which leads down onto the pitch.     People

were running around, some coming up the ramp with stretchers and

people laid on them with coats or jumpers over their heads.     It then

hit me that people had in fact died in whatever had gone off inside

the ground and I remember thinking, perhaps selfishly, I don't know,

"I hope the Bobbies that are in there are alright".     We were then

instructed to take our dogs back to the vans and remain with them

until instructed further.   Once back at the vans we stood talking

amongst ourselves, trying to work out what had happened to result in

people's deaths.



I couldn't make anything much over the radio, all the transmissions on

it seemed to blurr into one.     Several Notts. Forest fans came out of

the ground and said it was the Liverpool fans that had invaded the

pitch.



I remember watching in awe as ambulance after ambulance passed by me

and went into the ground to be followed shortly afterwards by the Fire

Brigade.   An off duty Doctor in his own car pulled up and stated

he had heard the radio message on [local radio and had come to help.
                                     j

In the rear seats were his two young children and he asked if someone
                                                                  PAGE     5


could look after them.    As I was the only Policewoman around I stated

that I would look out for them.    The children were both about 5 yrs

old and were strapped in child safety seats so I left them there as I

thought it would be safer than trying to keep them with me outside in

the steady streams of fans that were now beginning to leave the

ground.   I then saw all the other Dog Handlers getting their dogs from

the vehicles and going into the ground.    I had to remain with the

children as there were no other Officers either male or female around.

At one point, I seemed to be the focus of the fans because they kept

coming to me in a very aggressive and angry manner, spitting and

occasionally punching me saying it was all my fault.    Some of them

were complaining that the gate men had been letting fans without

tickets in for a tenner a time and one very irrate Liverpool fan who

refused to give me his name, said he had seen a gate man let in ten at

once and his words were "He made    100 while people suffered and died".



The fans were very aggressive and angry continually converging on me

saying what they had to say before making their way off towards City

Centre.   A number were banging on the car which contained the 2 young

children and I began shaking with fear thinking that they might turn

the car over so I moved away from the car shouting at them to take

it out on me and not the children in the car.    They came towards me

and I thought "This is it, I’m going to get it now".    but apart from

being pushed around and spat on yet again and a couple of punches to

my body they went away.    I went back to the car and comforted the

children who were beginning to cry and got them laughing again talking

of all things about 'Thomas the Tank Engine’.



I again stood away from the vehicle so that the children would remain

safe if anymore irrate fans came to me.    I could hear coming from
                                                                     PAGE        6


inside the ground cheers, screaming and booing and began to wonder

what could possibly be happening to my Colleagues inside the ground,

because if I was being subjected to this abuse outside the ground,

what was happening to them in there.



The Doctor then returned to his vehicle stating that there wasn’t much

more he could do.



I asked him what had happened and he told me that      people had been

crushed and    he had seen about 30 people dead.     I saw that he was very

white and shaken.     I asked him for his name but he said he had given

his details to someone inside the ground.     He then drove away and I

began to make my way towards the ground when Inspector Phenix came out

and asked me if 1 had seen PC Dowdall, another of the handlers because

he couldn’t find him.     I said I hadn’t all the time I had been stood

outside the ground, so he asked me to take him round to the Leppings

Ln end of the ground in the dog van to see if he was there.



As we arrived at the Leppings Ln end all I could see was a mass of red

and white, Liverpool fans were everywhere, most of them surrounding

what Police Officers I could see, arguing with them and pushing them

around.   Inspector Phenix got out of the van      and told me get back     to

the Hop end as soon as possible and get into the ground with the

other dog handlers.     Liverpool fans began to come towards the van

shouting and swearing, some banging on the front of the van and I

waited until they had vented their obvious feelings and then drove

back to Penistone Rd. I went into the ground with my dog again through

gate 'O’.     All I could see was ambulances, their crews and Police

officers running around either to the ambulandes or gym with people

on stretchers.     Once onto the pitch I saw a number of dog handlers
                                                                    PAGE    7


lined up in front of the Hop and others in the middle of the pitch

between the Hop and the cordon of Police officers that were across the

pitch near the Leppings Ln end.    I stood in the middle of the pitch

and looked around.    People and officers were running around

everywhere with stretchers or just helping people on foot back towards

the gym.   Everything just seemed to be chaotic.   I looked over towards

the Leppings Ln end and I could see fans in the stand above the

terrace throwing things down onto the people and officers below and

thought "Can't they see that people are hurt and we are trying to help

them".



I was only on the pitch with my dog for about 5 minutes but it seemed

like an age and then PS Dent came around telling the dog handlers to

return to their vans and try to get to the points we had been given

which for my partner and I was Brook Shaws forecourt, at Shalesmoor.

We arrived there and got out of the van, watching the steady stream of

fans coming passed.    Quite a few of them came up asking for the

telephone numbers to ring regarding friends or relatives and I gave

them the numbers they needed.



All the Liverpool fans that I spoke to were well in drink, some of

them were even carrying cans or large plastic bottles of beer.       When

the stream of fans had finished we made our way into the Town Centre

and down to the Midland Station and waited until the fans had been

placed back onto their respective trains.



We were then told to stand down and return to Niagara, which we did.

As I walked up the steps into the club, I remember seeing a male

officer sat crying and I was told that he had been at the front and

had carried some of the injured and dead from the crush.    Other
                                                                           PAGE   8


         Officers were just sat around quietly with looks of sadness and

         disbelief on their faces and it wasn't until speaking to other

         Officers that I realised just how lucky, if that’s the word to use,

         how lucky I was to have been stood outside the ground with the

         children.   Then after a de-briefing from Inspector Phenix we were

         stood down from duty at the ground and together with PC Allott

         returned to El where we went off duty at 8 pm (2000 hrs).



         All I can say in closing is that I was very frightened and upset by

         the actions of the majority of Liverpool fans towards myself and the

         other people who were trying to help the injured inside the ground.

         Especially when on my own outside the ground, the group of supporters

         advanced on me because I honestly feared that I would be caused

         serious injury and that even though I wanted to call for assistance I

         didn’t because I knew people inside the ground needed help more than

         myself so I would suffer the consequences and not add to the already

         large burden inside.



         Submitted for your information.

           At approximately 3 =20 pm (1520),. on the day of Saturday 15th April

           1989, I was on duty with *B * Division Crime & Vandal Squad, when as

           a result of a radio message, in company with other Officers of the

           squad, I attended at Hillsborough Football ground.           Upon entering

           the ground, from an entrance on Penistone Rd, approximately opposite

           Charlie Burns garage.        As I entered the area, outside the gymnasium

           and between the gym and stand directly opposite it, I was

           immediately aware of numerous bodies lying on the ground in this area.

           In company with PC 2671 Winsor, I took a body of a white, male,

           35 yrs off a piece of advertising boarding and we went on to the pitch.

           As we approached the cordon of officers placed along the halfway line

           of the pitch, we were informed by several officers that there were no

           more bodies to be brought out.        We returned to the area outside the
                                                                     PAGE        2


gymnasium,.. I believed the rest of my squad to be inside the gymnasium

assisting in the "emergency ’morgue1'.       I was prevented from gaining

access to the gym by an unknown Sergeant.        I then was seperated from

PC Winsor for a few moments.     I started to attend to the injured

placed outside the gym.    I spoke to a doctor with a beard, wearing a

green jumper described as Male, white, 5*8", brown hair, 32 yrs

approx, who stated he had attended as a result of a radio appeal on          a

local station.    I asked if there was any point in trying to

resuscitate persons at this stage,

He replied, "Not really, but you can try."        I then tried to

resuscitate a white male, 18-20 yrs.        After a few moments it was

apparent that    there was little point.     The man was deceased.   At this

point I heard    an officer start to shout up at some supporters in the

gantry directly above myself.     I looked up and could see one or two

streams of what appeared to be water being poured onto officers and

bodies below.    I stepped out to see what was happening and could see

that there was at least one male supporter urinating from the gantry.

There were corrugated sheets placed along most of the length of this

gantry and apart from a space at the end joining the ramp.

This space was approx 2 - 4    feet wide.     I saw several officers make

their way to the bottom of the     ramp, and I believed them to be

going to deal    with the matter, I did not stay and watch.     Whilst ever

any officer was in this area, he was subject to violent verbal abuse,

from Liverpool supporters who only hindered you trying to talk to

other officers regarding instructions and information.

A lot of these Liver pool supporters were shouting and pushing

officers, including myself.     It was apparent that a number of themhad

been drinking heavily.

At this point I was joined by PC 2671 Winsor again, and we were

approached by an unknown inspector, who requested us to obtain a
                                                                             PAGE     C


         stretcher.   This we did, and followed him, out of the ground, and were

         transported to the outside area of the Leppings Lane end.       There we

         assisted in the labelling, identifying of 8 - 10 bodies.

         Bodies loaded onto transit van and taken to somewhere.       I do not know

         whe re.

         Myself and PC Winsor then made our way to the main stand at the side

         of the pitch for a de-brief, (approx 7 pm (19005 5.      There we met up

         with Insp Cooper and Sgt 1437 Elliott, our supervising officers in

         our squad.

         I did not see any other member of my unit for quite a while, as they

         were virtually all used in the gym.     Terminated duty at Barnsley

         Police Stn, approx 8.15 pm (2015).

         I believe that our unit was supposed to have been attending at that

         match, but it transpired that we were not included on the match order.

         I do not know if this was a clerical error, or a decision was taken

         not to use the 3 division squad,

           On Saturday, 15'th April, 1989, I attended the Hillsborough Ground in
           order to watch the semi final between Liverpool and Notts Forest.             I

           attended with my wife and daughter, leaving Liverpool at 11 a.m. that

           morning.     1 was accompanied by a driver who informed me that road

           works on the M62 would make the journey difficult and as such we

           would take the ii56 A616 Woodhead route to the ground.

           We ran into road works at the end of the M56 at Hyde where the A616

           to Sheffield was to be picked up.       Traffic was very heavy and forty-

           five minutes passed before we joined the A616.          By this time it was

           12.40 p.m.       Slow moving traffic along the A616 occurred for some time

           and some miles further on at a large roundabout, where if my

           recollection is correct, the M67 joined the A616, there was a further

           traffic tail back leading to another fifteen to twenty minute delay.
Even allowing for the fact that 25,000 fans approximately were

travelling to Hi 1Isborough? I was surprised by the volume of

traffic.    This was only one route to Sheffield and acknowledging that

many drivers following the previous year's experience may well have

decided to avoid the M62, there did seem to be an excess of traffic.

At the time I pondered whether many people were attending without

tickets.    Eventually, we travelled over Woodhead on the A616 and some

nine miles from Sheffield were diverted by the police at a junction

which I cannot recall but which strangely seemed after about one

mile, to take us back on to the A616 again.

At that point there were two public houses and signs said eight and a

half miles to Sheffield.     Considerable numbers of Liverpool fans were

having a drink outside the public houses as the weather was fine and

sunny.     From that point on traffic moved relatively quickly and there

were no traffic jams until we arrived at the ground.     Throughout the

last three or four miles, every public house had Liverpool fans

consuming alcohol but I observed no drunkenness or hooliganism.

Traffic controls by South Yorkshire Police were in operation and

there were a considerable number of police officers in attendance

along the route.     The police operation seemed well organised as there

was no delay at all in approaching the ground.      We arrived at

2.15 p.m. approximately, having taken three and a quarter hours to

travel the comparatively short distance.    (70 miles)

On arriving at the ground there was a traffic light junction and if

my recollection is correct, a road leading to the left which was

Leppings Lane.     There were very large crowds of mainly Liverpool

fans, the atmosphere seemed happy and there were no signs of

hooliganism or drunkenness.     There were plenty of police officers

around and, in fact, we took directions from two of them.     We turned

left into Leppings Lane and travelled around the ground on to the
                                                                   PAGE


main road which I think is the A61 and turned right to go to the main

entrance of the club, where we were dropped by the driver as it was

impossible for him to get in the car park at that tiime because of

congestion.                                           j

It is fair to say, that there was no undue congestion, coaches were

dropping Notts Forest fans off and again there were no signs of

drunkenness or hooliganism.     However,, the crowds were more thin and

the whole area was much less crowded than the Leppings Lane end.       On

walking the short distance to the Directors entrance, I was asked for

spare tickets on two occasions.     There were again a number of mounted

officers and foot patrols in existence.

I   entered the ground at approximately S.25 p.m. and remained in a

guest lounge with other persons until 2.50 p.m.

On entering the Directors Box which, to put the geography into

context, placed the Liverpool fans to my left and opposite and the

Notts Forest fans to my right and in the stand I occupied.

At 2.50 p.m. it was obvious that the Notts Forest portions of the

ground were fully occupied.    There still seemed to be space in the
Leppings Lane area on the wings of the standing terrace.     The centre

portion seemed packed.    At that stage there was nothing to suggest

that anything was untoward.     The teams preceded by Liverpool came on

to the ground.   There was a gap of about one minute between the two

teams.   Both teams were obviously greeted with considerable support

from their own fans.     Prior to the kick off I noticed some swaying in

the centre part of the standing terrace at the Leppings Lane end

amongst Liverpool fans.     I commented briefly to the Liverpool

Directors sat along side me, that I was surprised at the swaying with

the match being an all ticket game.     Comments were made by others

about forged tickets etc.

Within three or four minutes Liverpool hit the bar and the ball went
                                                                     PAGE     4


immediately back down towards the Liverpool end.     Whilst

visually following the game down towards the Leppings Lane end it was

immediately apparent that there had been a considerable sway of

people in the centre part of the standing terrace.     There still

seemed reasonable amounts of movements on the two wings and the

contrast between the cent re and the two wings, in terms of density of

people was quite marked.

At that point youths immediately began to climb over the fences and I

assumed that a crowd disorder problem was developing.     It is true

that some individual police officers endeavoured to stop the people

climbing over the fence, as in that first moment, it did appear to be

the case that a crowd invasion of the pitch was occurring.     However,

my observations were that the police very quickly, certainly within a

minute or two, began to assist people climbing over the fences.        Some

of the crowd encroached out onto the playing area and a police

officer of some rank, I think Superintendent, approached the referee

to take the players off the pitch.

For the next fifteen to twenty minutes I observed the scene and

throughout that period I have to admit that I still considered it to

be an attempt by youths to climb over the fences and obtain access to

the ground and did not at any moment feel that we were dealing with a

crowd safety problem.

When stretchers appeared and the actions of officers and other people

demonstrated clearly that there were casualties, it then became

apparent that injuries or worse had taken place.     However, apart from

people at the Leppings Lane end it was my belief that virtually

everyone else at the ground thought we were dealing with a crowd

disorder problem.

The Notts Forest fans surrounding the Directors Box were angry and

remonstrated strongly about what they saw as hooliganism.     The Notts
Forest contingent situated in the main stand area to my right made a

chant of ’
         'You’ll never get into Europe now' and this continued for

some time.    One angry Liverpool fan ran the length of the pitch and

remonstrated with the Notts Forest fans.    His behaviour left a lot to

be desired and was provocative and he was duly arrested.

It then became apparent to all concerned that because of the

stretchers that this was a serious incident and the attitude of the

crowd changed.    They began to applaud the stretcher bearers

comprising, Liverpool fans, stewards and police officers and the

developing ugly atmosphere of some minutes before swiftly abated.

Some of the Liverpool Directors had left the Directors Box and when I

saw the stretchers which clearly contained fatalities, I immediately

left the Directors Box in order to provide whatever assistance I

could.    That was about 3.E5 p.m to 3.30 p.m. and I saw a police woman

who informed me that there were at least nine fatalities.       I gave that

information to the various Directors of the clubs concerned, most of

whom gathered in the board room, although some of them went on to the

pitch in order to assist the two managers and others.
At 3.40 p.m. approximately, I informed the control room at Merseyside

Police of the situation and ordered the opening of a casualty

bureau.    At this time the situation on the pitch was that most of the

casualties seemed to have been extracted from the Leppings Lane end

and were either receiving medical treatment in situ or were being

carried by make shift stretchers to the Notts Forest end, where

ambulances were gathering and as I now know? the Gymnasium was being

used as a temporary mortuary.    I saw many officers and non-police

officers giving resuscitation and senior officers of Assistant Chief

Constable and Superintendent rank were present at the scene throughout.

Further police officers had arrived by this stage in considerable

numbers, they were placed along the front of the stand facing the
                                                                   PAGE


Directors box which contained Liverpool fans and a thick line of

police officers was placed across, roughly the half way line, as some

Liverpool fans opposite wished to remonstrate wth Notts Forest fans.

Indeed, small numbers of them had to be held back by the line of

police officers from so do ing«

Some Liverpool fans were clearly upset by the police line but they

were necessary and the decision to deploy them was, in my opinion,

entirely correct.

I went to the Police Control Room on a number of occasions over the

next ninety minutes.     The Control Room which was situated to the left

of the Directors Box at the end of the stand overlooked the Leppings

Lane standing terrace.     On entering the Control Room on all those

occasions there were senior South Yorkshire Police Officers present

of ranks from Inspector to Assistant Chief Constable.     They clearly

had a grasp of the situation and were exercising control in a calm

and composed manner.     A Superintendent, who at the time I did not

know his name, was briefing Assistant Chief Constable Jackson about

the opening of a gate at the rear of Leppings Lane stand.     He

explained in my presence that the surge of people which had developed

in the last ten minutes before the kick-off had become so great that

he had become concerned about the safety of the public.     He explained

that he had opened the gate and that, in his words, ’A few hundred

fans had entered through that gate on to the terraces.5     He also

stated that an attempt was made to stop the game being commenced by

way of a radio message but was unsure as to what had happened.        He

also stated in my presence that on opening the gates and the crowd

entering he heard the roar of the crowd which intimated to him that

the teams had come on to the pitch.     He was clearly an officer that

had been dealing with a fraught situation.

Throughout that period I briefed the Directors of the clubs concerned
                                                                  PAGE


as to the rising casualty rate and kept liaison with Assistant Chief

Constable Jackson as well as informing the Force Control Room at

Merseyside of the situation..    Shortly after 4 p.m. and I would guess

about 4.15 p.m. the Directors indicated that if there were fatalities

then they did not wish the game to continue.     I went to the Control

Room and asked Assistant Chief Constable Jackson what was his

intentions.   He stated that the game was to be abandoned and

instructed an officer, who I think was a Superintendent, to abandon

the match through the public address system.     The officer responded

in a very professional competent way.     He calmly told the crowd that

there was a major incident involving injuries.     He explained to them

that many injured people had still to be removed from the crowd.        He

did not mention fatalities.     He asked for the support of the crowd

and then explained to them that in view of the need to give priority

to casualties, that the game had to be abandoned.     He asked for their

support and a spontaneous round of applause went around the crowd.

In my view that officer's contribution to the manner in which the

game was abandoned and then how the fans, in the main, made their way
home, was outstanding.

By this time it was apparent to me that almost all the casualties had

been removed but there was clearly still large numbers of police

officers and others at the exact scene of the disaster.     I saw only

one ambulance enter the playing area and position itself direct in

front of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end.     I do have a vague

recollection of a second ambulance on the field and I saw a number

of ambulances situated near to the Gymnasium at the Notts Forest end

of the ground.

I did not hear any public address system used for some considerable

time after the incident occurred.     It is difficult to put a time as t

when the first transmission took place but I think it would be some
                                                                  PAGE   I


thirty to forty minutes after the first signs of trouble.     I do not

know who the speaker was and he did not identify himself as either a

police officer or an official of the club.   The speaker asked fans to

leave the playing area in order to facilitate the removal of the

injured.   I myself understood what he was trying to do but many fans

on the pitch became angry as they assumed that he was suggesting that

they get back into the Leppings Lane area.   He made two or three such

appeals over the next few minutes and I have to say it was possible

for him to be misunderstood.    I am not being critical and I know he

was not suggesting that the fans go back on to the terracing at

Leppings Lane but clearly people were gaining that impression.

The next transmission after that, that I heard, was the one announcing

the abandonment of the match.   There may have been other

transmissions as I was in transit from the Directors Box to the Police

Control Room which I did not hear.   During this period and again, I

cannot be sure of the exact time, I saw Fire Brigade Personnel,

together with two machines situated near Leppings Lane end.    A fire

officer was certainly at the Police Control point, although 1 have to

say that there was not much activity by them as I feel the worst of

the incident had occurred before their arrival and there was little

for them to do.

I returned to the Board Room some time after 4.45 p.m and spoke at

length to the Chairman of the Liverpool Football Club, John Smith, I

gave him and others a briefing as to what had occurred and indicated

to them that, at that stage, the deaths were at least eighty-four.

That figure had been given to me some moments before in the Police

Control Room by an officer of Superintendent rank who stated that

seventy-four bodies were in the Gymnasium and ten bodies were at

Leppings Lane end and were being taken to the Gymnasium.    He stated

that at that stage a Detective Inspector was in charge of the bodies,
                                                                    PAGE


and the head of the C.I.D was present at the ground.

I went to the Gymnasium which was being used as a temporary mortuary.

I spoke to an officer who I think was a Chief Superintendent or a

Superintendent, identified myself and he informed me that there were

eighty-four fatalities.    This was about 5.15 to 5.30 p.m.   A number of

bodies were in green body bags, the remainder being covered in some

way, either by blankets or so on.    There were a number of South

Yorkshire Police Officers in attendance and property was being

properly accounted for and there was certainly an organisation and

control about the events in the Gymnasium which was impressive.

In the stand next to the Gymnasium I saw many South Yorkshire

uniformed police officers probably totalling seventy or eighty, who I

assumed, were waiting to be debriefed.     Both amongst them and other

officers at the stadium and particularly in the Gymnasium, there was

much distress, however, that was not preventing them from carrying out

their duties.

I spoke to Assistant Chief Constable Jackson about 5.45 p.m. and

informed him that I was leaving for Merseyside in order to attend the
Casualty Bureau there.    At that stage, players and directors had left

or were leaving.   The South Yorkshire operation was clearly in full

swing and there was nothing further I could do.     We left the ground by

way of the A61.    Junctions were manned by officers and the traffic

moved easily and I attended Merseyside Police Casualty Bureau at

Smithdown Lane Traffic Headquarters Liverpool later that evening where

I carried out duties in the force area.

I watched the media treatment of the incident developing over

succeeding hours and the first day or two and I am aware of the

various allegations that are being made.

My observations are snap-shots and can clearly only form a very small

fragment of what occurred during those hours.     My timings are somewhat
                                                                     PAGE     10


vague but can perhaps be substantiated by comparison with other

statements and certainly my two calls to the Merseyside Police

Control Room and the timings should be capable of confirmation.        When

I left Liverpool that morning, I was very surprised by the time the

journey took.    None of the difficulties of travel occurred within ten

miles of the ground.    All the delays were on the M56 and A616 many

miles from Sheffield.   When approaching the ground the traffic control

operation seemed to me to be running very smoothly.     In fact, we drove

straight to the ground and turned into Leppings Lane without

hinderance, albeit, the crowds were dense.     Throughout the last miles

of my journey to the ground it was clear that South Yorkshire Police

were running a major operation.    I saw coaches being stopped and

searched for alcohol, officers were stood at road junctions and

advising drivers where they could park.    Parking seemed controlled and

well directed.

Arriving at Leppings Lane it was clear that there were many late

arrivals, either caused by traffic congestion or because people had

gone to public houses to drink.    I first observed Liver pool fans

drinking at public houses on the A616 at two public houses which are

situated along side traffic signs which say, eight and a half miles to

Sheffield.   Throughout the journey down from that point I saw many

fans drinkings outside public houses, although I hasten to add there

was no signs of misbehaviour or hooliganism.

At 2.15 approximately, when we went down Leppings Lane, there were

dense crowds but they were all well behaved.     I saw many police

officers and, in fact, a number of small side streets off Leppings

Lane had barriers across them preventing access and were manned by

police officers.    I saw mounted officers in the area in front of the

Leppings Lane stand.    I have attended football matches all my life and

have worked in football grounds at Manchester United and Bolton
Wanderers.     I have been present in an operational supervisory capacity

at other grounds.     On my arrival at Hi 1lsborough, although it was

apparent to me that there were late arrivals? I had no other

impression than that a well organised smoothly running police

operation was taking place.

At the ground when the incident occurred? there was clearly a

misundertstanding from everyone? apart from those at the Leppings Lane

end.     The police officers did not push people back off the

fencing into the ground for as long as has been suggested.      Certainly

for about a minute the officers were clearly worried by the youths

climbing over the fence but it was apparent to me that their response

changed very quickly.     Although I remained convinced for some twenty

minutes that there had been a crowd disorder problem? I assumed that

when police officers were lifting and assisting fans over the fence?

that it was the disorder that was making the police help them out

because they were concerned as to their safety.     At no stage during

that twenty minutes did I think there was a tragedy in the making or

that people were losing their lives.     It was not easily visible to the

rest of the ground that people were receiving resuscitation as now I

know they were because of the large number of fans on the pitch as

well as the police and other officials.

There were angry fans on the pitch who did make threatening gestures

to Notts Forest fans and the police.     I did not see any police

officers attacked and their distress and anger in the circumstances is

now understandable.     Throughout that period there was a co-operative

approach by fans? officials? police and ambulance personnel and what

came across was a controlled operation arising out of the original

chaos.     I did see senior South Yorkshire officers on the field and any

suggestion that there was no one in charge or endeavouring to bring

order out of chaos is unfair.
                                                                  PAGE   12


On my first visit to the Police Control Room the exact time of which I

cannot recall, it was probably around about 3.40 p.m.   I saw from the

high vantage point of the Police Control Room the operation going on.

Even though the vantage point is a good one it was not very clear as

to the scale of the problem? the crowds were still dense and in the

morass of people? even from the Police Control Room? observations were

diffi cult.

The atmosphere within the Control Room was composed and professional

and senior officers up to Assistant Chief Constable level were present

throughout.   Instructions were being issued and the paraphernalia of a

major incident was being obtained.   On no occasion did I see panic or

confusion amongst the police officers despite being clearly shocked?

they seemed to know what they were doing.

On thinking over the issues since the incident and this is merely

opinion? it is my view that such tragedies do not occur as a result of

one single incident.   The traffic delays which led to the late

arrival at the ground? coupled with the footballs fans’ culture of

going for a drink and arriving at the ground just minutes before the

kick-off? together with the resulting crush and the decision to open

the gate? together with the arrival on the pitch of the teams and in

the first minutes of the game the hitting of the bar by Liverpool, in

my view all come together in one tragic set of circumstances.

Liverpool fans are used to attending Anfield? where in the last twenty

minutes? one thousand fans per minute can enter the Kop? they are

marshalled into lines and are well used to it and I have no doubt that

there would be a similar expectation in the minds of many Liverpool

fans attending Hilsborough on Saturday.

I repeat? that my thoughts? observations and involvement are only

snap-shots of the overall incident but they may prove useful.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was on duty at 9 am (0900) on a

           Public Order Transit Serial 19 for the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest

           Semi-Final match.      After the initial briefing we became mobile at

           9.40 am, other officers in the transit being PS 2698 ROPER,

           PC 2220 BROMLEY, PC 2113 TURNER, PC 111 AGAR, PC 2590 BROADBENT and

           PC 2277 BARBER.

           At 2.07 pm (1407) on West Bar Green, we stopped and seconded a transit

           mini bus and one occupant a

                                      kottingham was arrested for being Drunk and

           Disorderly.      He was transported to the Charge Office Bridge St and we

           resumed mobile patrol at 2.30 pm (1430).

           At about 3.05 pm (1505) we received a radio message via Force

           Operations to attend Hillsborough Football Ground.         We arrived at
                                                                    PAGE   2


about 3.10 pm <1510) and were told to wait at the entrance to the

pitch near to the Police room.    Whilst here, I saw a number of

officers who were standing at this location yet covered in liquid

coming from the Nottingham Forest fans.

After about 3 minutes, with numerous other officers, I was directed

onto the pitch between the Kop and North Stand.

I immediately saw a number of people on the pitch in front of the

Leppings Lane Stand.    We were instructed to stand facing the North

Stand.

Immediately I was confronted by numerous Liverpool fans shouting

obscenities at myself and other officers.    I also saw a number of

bodies being removed from the pitch, towards the Kop, North Stand

exit.

After a short time of being verbally abused, I was instructed to go to

the Leppings Lane Stand behind the goal.    On attending here I saw

numerous bodies and Police Officers, Fire brigade and other person all

attempting First Aid.   A Fire officer stated that a male 30-35 yrs,

wearing a grey T shirt and trousers was beyond help and could be

removed.   He appeared dead.   With the help of a few Liverpool fans we

placed the man onto some advertising hoardings and carried him towards

the Police room.   Here I was directed towards the Gym.    However, it

was not possible to get the body into the Gym area as the doorway area

was a mass of bodies.    I placed the man down in the area of the

doorway with the other bodies and returned to the Pitch.

On returning to the Pitch I noticed the majority of the bodies behind

the goal had been removed and I was instructed to stand in the centre

of the pitch facing the Leppings Lane Stand.

Here I stood for about an hour being moved from one side of the line

to another and have to listen to verbal abuse.    On two occasions

having to stop Liverpool fans assaulting persons of the press, who
                                                                                PAGE


        were taking photographs.

        The tension and atmosphere being very         high.

        The ground was then emptied and I was         instructedto return to   the

         Transit vehicle.
        PC 111 AGAR, PC 25 BROADBENT and PC 2113 TURNER also returned to the

         transit and we immediately attended an assistance call.          Hillsborough

        Park, which was all quiet on arrival.

        We then conveyed a number of Officers         back toWest BarPS and    was

         instructed by    D1 control to take up MobilePatrol inSheffield        City

         Centre.   This   we did and there were no incidents with      D1reporting us

         off duty at 8    pm (2000).

           I am a Police Constable with the South Yorkshire Police, at present

           stationed at Wath Upon Dearne.



           At 3.12 pm (1512) on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was on duty,

           attached to the Rotherham Divisional Support Services, in Corporation

           Street, Rotherham, when, as a result of information received, I was

           transported, via police transit van with other officers, to

           Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield.         Whilst en route to the

           football ground we were directed to attend the Leppings Lane entrance

           to the ground, as part of Operation Support.



           At 3.25 pm (1525), this same date, with Inspector GRACE and other

           members of the Rotherham Divisional Support Services, I entered the
                                                                    PAGE   2


rear courtyard of the Leppings Lane stand at Hi 1Isborough.



On entering the courtyard I saw several bodies, approximately six in

number, with their heads covered by clothing.     Numerous people were

lying on the ground injured.



At this time there was a large crowd of people milling around, several

were intoxicated and showing particular aggression towards police

offi cers.



On entering the area, Superintendent MARSHALL instructed our unit to

move the bodies to an adjacent lane.    With another officer, I moved a

man, who was obviously dead, from near to the entrance of the tunnel

leading onto the terraces.     I would describe this man as being

approximately 30 years of age, heavy build, with light brown coloured

hair, about 6 ft tall and wearing denim jeans and a red coloured

shirt.   The man was carried outside the courtyard and placed on a lane

at the rear of a waiting ambulance.



At 3.40 pm <1540), this date, a message was received to the effect

that there was trouble in the Leppings Lane stand and, together with

the rest of our unit, we were directed to attend that location.

Whilst in the stand many of the supporters present were drunk and

showed aggression towards us.    We were instructed to remain in that

location until 4.50 pm (1650) when we were instructed to travel to

Sheffield City Centre and patrol the city in the transit van.



At 7.00 pm (1900), this same date, I returned to Main Street Police

Station and took no further part in this incident.

About       'Mam,          my    serial          walked          -From      the    ground                  to t h e    roundabout                at    tn:

and    of    Leppings             Lane,          where       we       were       deployed                  in p a i r s     at    various             pain

around        the      roundabout.                 I was          paired          up    with              PC 9 1 9     Evans          and    we

concentrated                on    the       shops       leading             just       from          the        roundabout             to

Penistone             Road       for       fear    of       the       fans       smashing             windows,             and    causing

trouble          at    a    ’H o t     Pie       and    Pastie             S h o p ’ that            was       open    just       before          the

turn       off    to       Niagara          Sports          Ground.

There       w e r e n ’t m a n y           fans    around             at    this       time,          but       I soon          noticed          that

certain          fans       in    groups          of    2    or       3    were    walking                backwards             and    forwards

from       Leppings             Lane,       past       us,       up       towards       Wadsley                Bridge       and       back       down

again,       asking             other       fans       for       tickets          and       had       anyone          any       spare       tickets

or    tickets          for       sale.

It    soon       became          evident          that       as       time       passed          and       the       crowds       got       bigger

there       were       even       more       fans       who       had       travelled                to    the       game       without

tickets.

The    mood       of       the    fans       prior          to    the       game       was       jovial,             and    neither          myself

or    PC    Evans          received          any       abuse          from       any    of       the       fans.           We    had    to       speak

to    quite       a    few       fans       who    were          walking          towards             the       ground          carrying          cans

of    beer       and       lager.           These       fans          were       told       that          if    they       went       any

further          then       they       probably             would          not    be    allowed                into    the       ground          and

they       agreed          to    go    to    a    garage          just        round         the       corner          where       according

to    PC    Kent,          who    was       outside          the          garage,       they          sat       on    the       wall    and

consumed          what          beer       they    had       left          before       walking                up    Leppings          Lane

towards          the       ground.           There          was       also       quite       a       few       fans    sat       on    the       wall

opposite          the       road       to    us,       drinking             beer,       etc.,             but       there       was    no

trouble          with       any       of    these       people.

The    crowds          got       bigger          and    bigger             and    quite          a    lot       were       leaving          it

late,       in m y         estimation,             to       get       into       the    ground             and       get    comfortable

walked          towards                the       pub,       in       the     opposite                direct!on               to        the      ground           with

only       half          an       hour       before             kick       off.            It       was       obvious            a     lot      of     the       fans

had    been          drinking,                   and       myself          and        PC    Evans             had      to      stop        them        using          the

rear       alleway                behind          the       shops          as    a     toilet,                this       being          the       first

secluded             spot          they          had       after          getting           off          their         buses          on     Claywheels

the    ground,                most       of       these             running           or    jogging,                but      nowhere              near       the

large       amount                there          had       been       some       10        minutes             previously.

All    our          serial             started             to       walk        up    Leppings                 La ne, as          our       brief          was     to

officers             and          one    told          me       fans       had       broken              a    gate       down         at     the       Leppings

Lane       end       of       the       ground.                 We    all       started              to       run      towards             the       ground           as

assistance                was          required.                    This     would          be       shortly             after         3pm.

On    arrival             at       the       ground             I    cannot          remember                 if    there            were       still        any

large       numbers                of    fans          outside             the       turnstiles,                    but      we       were        originally

formed          into          a    large          cordon             outside           the          ground          next         to    the        road.           I

d o n ’t k n o w          why,          nobody             said       what       was        happening.                      Little           bits       of

information                   filtered                through             that       there           had       been         some       trouble             and

t he ra     w e re        some          people             injured           and       one          fan       s ai a     t h e re      were          some        dead

as    he    passed                us,    leaving                the       scene.

Our    serial             was          then       taken             towards          the        access             road      outside              Gate       C    on

the    attached                   map.           As    we       approached,                 I saw             people         lying           on      the     ground

near       to       the       fence          next          to       the    river.               I knew             immediately                  s o m e Tjf

                                                                                                                                            R3 4 6

these       people           were    dead.           There          were       people        lying          there          with       their

eyes     still          open,       clothes          missing,             blue     in    colour

                                                    I have          seen       enough        dead          bodies          in    my    service

to    know     something             really          terrible             had    h a p p e n e d .,         We    were          formed       up       in

a    cordon        by    Inspector             Sykes       at       this       location,              to    guard          these       bodies,

facing        towards             Gate    C„        The    gates          kept     being          opened          and       other

policemen           kept          bringing          more       people          out.      Some          were       dead,          others          were

injured.            They          were    kept       separate,             awaiting              ambulances                which       by    now

were    arriving              at    the       scene.           The       road    was     kept          clear       for          them    to

arrive,        pick          up    and    depart.              I    still       had     no       idea       what       had       happened

inside        the       ground.           I estimated                there       were        about          12    to       15    bodies

right       behind           me.

A    short     time          later       the    Liverpool                fans    started              leaving          the       ground,

where       the     first          people       they       saw       were       us,     guarding             bodies.              They

hurled        abuse          at    us,    saying          it       was    all    our     fault             for    opening             the

gate.         I d i d n ’t e v e n            know       what       they       were     talking             about,          but       what

could       I say,           they    might          be    right,          I didn't           know.           By    now          there       were

lots     of    injured             outside          Gate       C    and    medical           teams          had    arrived             in

response           to    a    radio       call.           Police          vans    were           used       to    ferry          some       of       the

injured        to       hospital.

As    the     crowds          built       up    outside             the    Leppings              Lane       end,       a

superintendent                    whom    I did          not       know,       took     10       of    us    away          to   gently           move

the    crowds           to    the    other          side       of    the       bridge        and       stop       anyone

approaching              the       ground       without             good       reason.            What       a    futile          exercise

that     was.           As    we    tried       to       move       people,       more           came       out    behind             us,

filling        in       the       empty       spaces.              Fans    were       coming           up    to    me       looking          for

their       sons,        asking          me    what       was       happening.               I    c o u l d n ’t       tell       them,          I

d i d n ’t k n o w .          I made          something             up    so    that     it       appeared             everything                was

unde r      control.

1 felt        as    if       I should          be    doing          something           more          to    help       the       injured,                  .

             I never          actually             went          into       the     ground          until        we    were        all       called       in       for

             de-briefing                in    the       North          Stand,            I wasn't           allocated              a    body       to    deal

             with       outside             the    ground.               I d i d n ’t         know       the     full       extent           of    what       had

             happened          until          I saw             the    news        on    TV       later     that       night.               I fait       so

             helpless,             in       that       I ’d      been       there        and       d i d n ’t    feel       as     though          I'd    done

             enough       to       help.           I    can't          remember           seeing           any       Club       Stewards           on    my

             arrival          at    the       ground.

             I    remember          thinking                when       moving           fans       away     from       the       scene        that       we    had

             to    be    very       careful             and       diplomatic              as       one     slight          incident           could       have

             sparked          off       a    riot,          which       we       w o u l d n ’t     have        been       able        to    handle.

             I saw       Inspector                Harry          White       at     the       de-brief.               He    told        me    that       his

             serial       usually             got       the       job       of    putting           the     crowd          in    the        different          pens

             at    the    rear          of    the       goal          mouth,        working           from       the       outside           to    the

             centre,          but       for       some          reason       h e ’d      been       told        to    let       the     fans       find       their

             own    level,          on       this       occasion,                resulting            in    too       many       going        into       the

             area       immediately                behind             the    goal.            I    could        tell       he    was        really

             distressed             by       what       had       happened.

             The    personal                radios          I    could           hear were           going        non-stop.                 if I ’d      had       one

             I wouldn't             have          been          able    to       get     on       air,     but       then       again        I w o u l d n ’t

             have       had    anything                to       say.

             What       caused          this       incident?                 I    c a n ’t        really        say,       too    many

             circumstances                   all       happening             at     the       same       time,        at    the       wrong        time       and

             place.           How       many       would          have           died outside              had       the    gate        not b e e n       opened?

             Who    knows,          it       may    have          been           more than           died       inside          theg r o u n d .

             Perhaps          fans          without             tickets          should        have        been       segregated              from       those

             with       tickets             before          they       got       anywhere           near       the     ground.               If    only       it

             had    gone       so       smoothly            as        -1988.        I t ’s a        day     1*11       never          forget!

               I am      a Constable                 with     19 y e a r s       service              during      which         time         I have       been

               on    duty      at    every           football          ground         in    the        fcrce      area,         including              last

               y e a r ’s S e m i     Final           when        I was    on       duty         on       Leppings Lane,             where        I     saw     no

               trouble         at         all    either           before        or a f t e r         the       game.

               I    reported              on    duty    at        Doncaster DHQ                 at    8.30am          on S a t u r d a y ,    15 A p r i l ,

              with       Inspector             Millet        in    overall           command.

              We     travelled            by     Police       Transit            Van       to    Hillsborough                Stadium          where        the

              main       pre-match              briefing          was     held       in     the       North       Stand         about        10am.         This

              was     followed            by     a    packed       meal        taken        in       the       stand     before        deploying

              onto       the     streets.              I don't          remember           a     great          deal     about       the      briefing,

              it     was    the      usual           format       describing              who        was       going     where       etc.         I do

              remember           Chief         Superintendent                  D u c k e n f i e 1 d 's w o r d s          however           that       the

              match        would      start           “ promptly          at    3pm".

              I     remember         thinking           to    myself           that       with        all       the    pre     match         build       up     on

About       11am,          my    serial          walked          from       the     ground            to       the     roundabout               at    the

end    of    Leppings             Lane,          where        we      were       deployed             in       pairs       at    various             points

around       the       roundabout.                 I was           paired         up    with          PC       919    Evans       and       we

concentrated                on    the       shops       leading             just       from          the       roundabout             to

Penistone             Road       for       fear    of       the       fans       smashing             windows,             and    causing

trouble          at    a    'Hot       Pie       and    Pastie             Shop*       that          was       open    just       before             the

turn       off    to       Niagara          Sports          Ground.

There -weren't                  many       fans    around             at    this       time,          but       I soon          noticed          that

certain          fans       in    groups          of    2     or      3    were    walking                backwards             and    forwards

from       Leppings             Lane,       past       u s,      up       towards       Wadsley                Bridge       and       back       down

again,       asking             other       fans       for       tickets          and    had          anyone          any       spare       tickets

or    tickets          for       sale.

It    soon       became          evident          that        as      time       passed          and       the       crowds       got       bigger

there       were       even more             fans       who        had      travelled                to    the       game       without

tickets.

The    mood       of       the    fans       prior          to     the      game       was       jovial,             and    neither             myself

'or P C     Evans          received          any       abuse          from       any    of       the       fans.           We    had       to    speak

to    quite       a    few       fans       who    were          walking          towards             the       ground          carrying             cans

of    beer       and       lager.           These       fans          were       told    that             if    they       went       any

further          then       they       probably             would          not    be    allowed                into    the       ground          and

they       agreed          to    go    to    a    garage           just      r o u n d ,t h e         corner          where       according

to    PC    Kent,          who    was       outside           the         garage,       they          sat       on    the       wall       and

consumed          what          beer       they    had        left         before       walking                up    Leppings          Lane

towards          the       ground.           There          was       also       quite       a       few       fans    sat       on    the       wall

opposite          the       road       to    us,       drinking             beer,       etc.,             but       there       was    no

trouble          with       any       of    these       people.

The.crowds             got       bigger          and    bigger             and    quite          a    lot       were       leaving          it

late,       in    my       estimation,             to       get       into       the    ground             and       get    comfortable

before       the       scheduled             kick       off        time.

Indeed          I    remember                a    grouf^ of           older         fans          in    their        3 0 ' s and           40's        asking

me,    about             2.30pm,             where          the     Gate       Inn       was.           I told        them          and        away        they

walked          towards                the       pub ,      in     the    opposite                direction           to       the        ground          with

only       half          an       hour       before           kick       off.           It       was    obvious           a    lot        of    the        fans

had    been          drinking,                   and     myself          and       PC    Evans          had     to    stop          them        using           the

rear       alleway                behind          the       shops        as    a    toilet,             this       being           the     first

secluded             spot          they          had     after        getting            off       their        buses          on    Claywheels

Lane.           As       3pm       arived          there           were       still          a    few    fans        making          their        way          to

the    ground,                most       of       these          running           or    jogging,             but     nowhere              near       the

large       amount                there          had     been       some       10 m i n u t e s          previously.

All    our          serial             started           to      walk     up       Leppings             Lane,        as       our    brief        was          to

wait       there          on       a    bus       until          half     time          when       we    were        to       go    to    Claywheels

Lane       for       a    hot          meal,       if       there        was       no    need          for    us     to       remain           there       on

standby.

I didn't             have          a    personal              radio       but       I    can       remember           hearing             somebody

else's          as       we       walked          up     Leppings             Lane.           We       had    been        joined          by     other

officers             and          one    told          me     fans       had       broken          a    gate       down        at    the        Leppings

Lane       end       of       the       ground.               We    all       started            to     run    towards              the        ground          as

assistance                was          required.               This       wxmld          be      shortly           after           3pm.

On    arrival             at       the    ground I cannot                          remember             if    there        were          still        any

there       were          some          people           injured          and       one       fan       said       there           were    some           dead

as    he    passed                us,    leaving              the    scene.

Our    serial             was          then      taken         towards          the          access          road    outside              Gate        C    on

the    attached                   map.        As       we     approached,                I    saw       people       lying           on    the        ground

near       to    the          fence       next           to    the       river.              I knew          immediately                 some     of

these       people                were    dead.               There       were          people          lying       there           with       their

                                                    I have          seen       enough          dead           bodies          in m y      service

to    know    something               really         terrible              had    happened.                    We    were          formed        up       in

a    cordon       by    Inspector              Sykes       at       this       location,                 to    guard          these       bodies,

facing       towards             Gate     C.        The    gates          kept     being            opened           and       other

policemen          kept          bringing           more       people          out.      Some             were       dead,           others         were

injured.           They          were     kept       separate,             awaiting              ambulances                   which       by     now

were    arriving             at     the       scene.           The       road     was    kept             clear       for          them     to

arrive,       pick          up    and     depart.              I still           had    no       idea          what       had       happened

inside       the       ground.            I estimated                there        were       about             12    to       15    bodies

right       behind          me.

A    short    time          later        the    Liverpool                fans     started                leaving          the       ground,

where       the    first           people       they       saw       were        us,    guarding                bodies.              They

hurled       abuse          at     us,    saying          it       was    all     our    fault                for    opening           the

gate.        I didn't              even       know       what       they       were     talking                about,          but    what

could       I say,          they      might         be    right,          I didn't           know.              By    now          there       were

lots    of    injured             outside           Gate       C    and    medical           teams             had    arrived             in

response          to    a    radio        call.           Police          vans     were          used          to    ferry          some       of       the

injured       to       hospital.

As    the    crowds          built        up    outside             the    Leppings              Lane          end,       a

superintendent                   w h o m .1 d i d        not       know,       took     10       of      us    away           to   gently           move

the    crowds          to    the      other         side       of    the       bridge        and         stop        anyone

approaching             the       ground        without             good       reason.            What         a     futile          exercise

that    was.           As    we     tried       to       move       people,        more          came         out     behind          us,

filling       in       the       empty        spaces.              Fans    were        coming            up     to    me       looking          for

their       sons,       asking           me    what       was       happening.               I     couldn't               tell       them,          I

didn't       know.           I made           something             up    so    that     it       appeared                everything                was

under       control.

I felt       as    if       I should           be    doing          something           more          to      help     the         injured,

instead       of       moving         people         away,          getting        lots          of      abuse        in       the    process.

I   never   actually    went    into   the   ground     until    we   were   all   called   in    for

de-briefing       in the North    Stand.      I wasn't     allocated     a body     to   deal with

outside     the   ground.      I didn't    know   the   full    extent   of what    had happened

until I saw the news on TV later that night.                    I felt so helpless,         in that

I'd been there and didn't feel as though I'd done enough to help.                           I can't

remember seeing any club Stewards on my arrival at the ground.

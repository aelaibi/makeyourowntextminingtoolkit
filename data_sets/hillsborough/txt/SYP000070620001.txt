 .iverpooi, a d m i t t e d            not    having a ticket               for    the game,       he had been

d ri n k i n g and he was a rr e s t e d for entering a d e s i g n a t e d sports                              ground

w hilst      drunk.

W i t h P.O.       GO D L E Y    I took                             to the Police Room at               the    rear    of

the N or th Stand,               where       he was       d o c u m e n t e d and detained.            On

c om p l et io n of the a d m i n i s t r a t i v e            details,         P.C.     GO D L E Y and myself went

into     the      gym where we            did the         clerical         regarding

We    com p l e t e d    the     clerical          at 3 . 0 0 p m    <1500)       and    then c o llected a meal

from the mobile                 canteen and went               into       the   gym to consume          it.

I had b arely started                    to eat my meal              w hen everyone         in the gym was

ordered          out,    with     ins t r u c t i o n s    to go to L e p p i n g s        Ln end of the         pitch,,

At this          time    I was        unaw a r e    of what         the    s i t u a t i o n was or what was

o c c u r r i n g at that end of the                   ground.

On going          onto the        pitch,        I saw that fa n y ^ T e r e             on the    pitch at      the

L e p p i n gs    Ln end,       fans      climbing         from >tne te r r a c i n g       up into the West

S t a n d and others             still       com-ing o v j / r      the    fencing       onto    the   pitch.

On    reaching          the L e p pi ng s                   goalmouth,            I saw that a lot of the

fans     on the         pitch were           in a shocked            state,       a n g r y and some        obviously

injured.            I began to            try to get u n i n j u r e d            fans    to move      to the

perimeter          track        so that       those who          needed medical            attention         could be

e asily      identified and               treated.          My acti o n s were met               by verbal      abuse

and    obscenities.

A man      ran from the fans                  in the g o a l m o u t h towards             the S'pion Hop where

the Fore st         fans were,            w i t h P C .G0DLja?V I went after                him and saw him

g e s ti cu l a t i n g at the For e s t              fan's.        On    reaching       him he was         shouting

o b s ce ni ti es and still               ( ^ st im ul at i n g      putting 2 fingers             up to the      crowd.

His    breath stunk              of    i n t o x icants and we             escorted       him from the         pitch to

the    rear       of the N o r t h Stand.

Although          it was obvious an offence                         had    been    committed by this man,               PC

G O DL EY and myself              d e ci de d to eject him,                 due    to the s i t u a t i o n at    the

                                                                                                                   S '14S&

L e p p i n g s Ln end,     so we would            be able       to     return there a 1most

iminediately to assist w i t h the                     injured.

On    returning     to the       pitch and nearing                 the L e p p i n g s Ln end,        a       large

number     of fans      began to        run from that              end towards          the Kop.          I

pre v e n t e d some    reaching        that       end of the ground and then told to form

c ordon across          the    pitch.         A short         time      later,      I was    ordered          to    leave

the    grou nd and a t t e nd at the               rear     of the L e p p i n g s Ln terrace and stan

w here with       other     o f f icers we made a cordon to direct                           fans    leaving           the

ground.

The m a t c h was      o ff i c i a l l y a b a n d o n e d and fans          began to       leave    the

terraces and stand             in large        numbers.            A great        number     of the fans were

e x t r e m e l y abusive     towards        the     police,       using      obscenities and             calling

us m urderers.          It was       impossible           to speak         reaso n a b l y to them and

t h a n k f u l l y 2 male Liv e r p o o l     fans did an e x cellent                  job by usher i n g             fan

out    of the ground,          unfortunately              I do not know the                names    of those 2

fans.      1 feel      that    had    it not         been for         those 2 fans there             could have

been more       d i f f i culties     for     the     police with           the     fans    leaving.          We were

later    ordered back          to the N or t h Stand after                    the    ground had       been

e v a c u a t e d and were     sp o k e n    to by senior             o f f i c e r s . W e were   s tood down,

however     due    to the      press        trying      to get        round to

the    police     room,     gym a n d St.          J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e   room area,        I was

d e t a i n e d a short     time     cordoning          off the        entry to that area.                    I was

eventually        stood down from duty at 7 . 1 5 p m                      <1915).

From    the time       I was    o rd er ed     out      of the        gym onto       the    pitch,    I did not

note any times as that was                    the     last     thing       on my mind.

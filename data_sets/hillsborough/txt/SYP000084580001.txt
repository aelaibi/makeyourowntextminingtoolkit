            I am a fourth year medical           student*' currently studying to be a doctor

            at                                 F a/- the past year         I have bee^f working within

            Hospitals     in Liverpool rna/nly the Royal Liverpool Hospital                     gaining

            experience whi 1st supervised by qualified doctors. / 1 will                        fina 13.y

            qualify as a doctor     in 1991.



            On Saturday     15th April       1989 I went to Hi 11 sboj/ough football ground

            Sheffield to see the FA Cup semi final                 between Liverpool /football              club

            and Noting ham Forest football          club I am a Liverpool              sqi/porter.



            I did not go in an organised party,               I paid £6.00 for a ticket to the

            Leppi ngs/Lane terraces which was obtained for me by my friend ______
                                                                        PAGE


I travelled to the game with

         and my girl friend                   She drove us to the ground and

then left us there whilst       she went shopping with a friend who we had

arranged to stay overnight with us in Sheffield.



We travelled to the game via the Woodhead Pass over the Pennines and

only stopped en route to get petrol for the car.        On the way to the

game we were subjected to hardly any travel       delays.



On arriving    in Sheffield we went for a drink with our friends with

whom we were staying     in Sheffield.   We had a pub lunch and saw other

people drinking who appeared to be supporters,       but I saw no one

drinking excessively.



When we had initially arrived in Sheffield at about         12 noon we had

driven past the Spion Kop end of Hillsborough and had seen very little

traffic with just a few Nottingham Forest fans waiting outside at this

t ime.



After    lunch we had tried to get a taxi over to the ground but all the

taxis we approached refused to go to that       part of the city and we

therefore had to get a bus into Sheffield City centre and then

catch a special    bus to Hil lsborough from the train station.



On the special    bus that we   caught from the station to the ground there

was a mixture of Forest and Liverpool      fans and five policemen.     When

we had arrived at the station we had told a policeman that we were

Liverpool   fans and asked which bus to use and directed by him to this

bus.     It did not appear that there were separate buses to each end of

the ground,    we caught this bus at about H.20 pm and arrived at the
                                                                                          f.l
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S2884

         ground at about 2/. 40 pm - 2.45 pm



         I witnessed no disorder,   fighting or drunkeness at any time before the

         game.   On the bus in particular   it was very quiet because of the

         Police presence and 1 was talking to siK Forest fans sat in the seats

         in front of us.



         When we arrived at the Leppings Lane entrance there were no queues at

         all .



         The bus dropped us off jfn Leppings Lane between Middlewood Road and

         the bridge over the^Saver Don.     We could then see a large crowd

         spilling out into Leppings L a n e forming an arc   into the road between

         the bridge and the corner shop on the far side.



         Within the crowd there was a lot of pushing and shoving and people

         were shouting at the Police because    it apepard that we could not get

         into the ground,   certainly not by kick off.



                              /    ^
         There was one mounted Police officer within the crowd iny,Leppings L a n e

         and four mounted Police officers within the outer q z & iis .   These had
VliJCA
         been closed and the Police were opening one gate at a time every so

         often to allow more people in the area between the outer gates and

         turnstiles when the crowd thinned within this area,      to prevent

         crushing here.



         However,   this created crushing within the   crowd push4/y*f against    these

         gates and the fans were shouting at the Police to come out and create

         some order within the crowd outside.
                                                                         PAGE       4
                                                                         SH884

We got through the outer gates quite quickly and then made our way

with everyone else towards the turnstiles.          Near to the turnstiles      I

could see a policeman on each one and then when we were near to the

far right hand turnstile a Policeman came to us J r orn the private end

at the side of the ground and said,         "Come on you can get in round

here."     He then directed us around the      corner/to gate      which was

already opened and we entered through here.          That is

and I as                    had a ticket for the North Stand.



I do not remember seeing any stewards at the turnstiles,          though I

think there was one at ga t e ' C ’ where    I entered.



I had no problems finding which set of turnstiles to use as I have

been to Hillsborough about five times         previously but not last year,

1 9 8 8 ’s, semi-final.



Outside the outer gates there had been difficulty entering.            All    the

Liverpool       fans entering the ground did so at the same point and in the

crowd locked outside the outer gates,         there was   confusion because fans

for the North and West Stand and the terraces were all mixed together.

Normally people with Stand tickets for designated seats           can enter

about    15 minutes before a game with no difficulty but this year there

was    chaos.     You had to aim towards your particular set of turnstiles

andjust go with the flow of peole.



Once    through the outer gates    it was not too bad because the Police

kept    it freer of people within this area.



I did not see any other gates other than Gate         ’C ’ open and this was

already open when I got there.        I entered through here w i t h _________
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S2S84

         on the directions of a Police Officer.



I did not see any unauthorised entry to the ground,              itself other than

fay the gate   ’C ’ in the directions of the police.           I did not see people;

climbing over the outer gates that the Police had closed and some

people climbing from the area between the outer gates and turnstiles,

over the fence separating those fans the terraces and west stand.

Obviously these people had got into the wrong sections because of the

chaos outside.



I d i d n ’t hand my ticket   into anyp'ne nor was    I required to show it to

anyone     I still possess this ticket number              □
            -------- !----------- V - -------------


Once   inside the ground I did not see any si g ns to the terraces           but

because of my previous visits       I knew I wanted to get into Pen 7 as it,

has better views of the pitch and I knew the way to go,              therefore I

did not look for any signs.



On entering we firstly went to the toilet and then through the gate in

the inner partiti         11 and then up the steps on the left of the West

Stand into Pen 7         i is raised.



We did not have any difficulty getting         into Pen 7 but we could not get

as high as we wanted because       it was fairly full.



As we walked past the entrance to the centre tunnel             I did not see any

Police or Stewards    controlling    it, but   I d i d n ’t really look as   I was

not going this way.



I witnessed no disorder       between entering the ground and getting on the
                                                                        PAGE         6
                                                                        S2884

terracing i rt Pen 7.



I witnessed no consumption of alcohol within the ground.



I did not see the crush barrier break within Pen 3.



We eventually got to where we intended to stand in Pen 7 just before

kick off.     I was still with                  at this time,   When we got

onto the terracing I noticed that the pens behind the goal        petysr 3 and

4 werej/ull, whereas where we/Were at the front of Pen 7 and in

particular    the first dozep^or so steps of the terracing within Pen 6

were relatively e m p t y .,/ It was as though it was a Tranmere Rovers       game

at these    points and not what y o u ’d expect at an F A Cup semi    final.

I was watching the game more than the crowd and did not realise that

there was crushing taking     place.    I had seen the two centre pens were

full but just thought there was overcrowding as opposed to crushing.

When the first fans started coming onto the pitch I through there had

been an overspill and that they would be moved into the space in Pen

6. But when 1 started seeing people trying to resuscitate others          I

realised that something drastic had taken place.



I personally was not involved in any crowd crushing within the ground.

I did not witness anything       I considered to be a crowd surge within the

terraces.     I was not injured at all.



When I realised that something had gone drastically wrong and I could

see that there was something       I could do to help on the pitch I made my

way to the front fence,    told a policeman that    I was a medical    student

and was allowed onto the pitch to help.        This was about twenty minutes

after the game had been stopped,       about 3.2Q - 3.£5
                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                S2SS4



              I did not go down earlier as there were enough people on the pitch to

              carry stretchers and things      like that,     it was only when I realised

              that there was something      I could do better than others there that               I

              went onto the pitch to administer first aid.             I did not go earlier as

              there was enough confusion without me going down and adding to the

              numbers of people.       If I had not been necessary.




D C * Tsf^    The first      person I went to help was   in the six yard box on the edge of

              the pitch to the/left of the goal as you look towards the Spion Hop.
^     c't t
              This man was ajzfout £0-25 years of age,       fair hair no beard or moustache

              but stubble tfn his face,     his hair was    collar    length, medium to t hi n

              bui 1d , I cars’t really remember his clothing but I think he was wearing

jp&r          blue jeastys and had no top on.



             When I approached the man his face was a blue/grey colour and he
^    % U cn^
o\       '*“ appeared dead.  There were three friends of the^m'an stading round

              saying "D on ’t stop, D o n ’t stop."   Either ayj^oliceman or ambulance man

              wearing black trousers and a white shipx was administering heart

              massage a nd another    person was givyrvg mouth to mouth resu sc it at io n.

              I said to the man giving heart massage,          "I am a medical       student what

              do you want me to do."      He replied,    "Can you issue death

              certificates."      There were a lot of bodies on/the pitch at this time.

              I said No and then took over giving moutl~j/Xo mouth resuscitation from

              the other man, whilst one of the mans T r i e n d s      ran off to find some

              o xy g e n .



              I cannot say how long I stayed giving mouth to mouth resuscitation and

              was not aware that the person had gone for oxygen at the time.                     I just

              remember the m a n ’s friends shouting,      " D o n ’t stop,   D o n ’t stop."
                                               \                        PAGE
                                                                        S2SS4



After five minutes may be less either a St J o h n ’s ambulance man or

regular ambulance man arrived^ wi/Kn an oxygen bottle.     I then stood up

to give him access and then left to see if there was anyone else          I

could help.



I do not know what happened to this man nor whether he recovered.I

then walked along the touch line to see if there was anyone else          I

could help.



There were a lot of bodies who    had been covered   over with shirts     or

coats pulled over their faces.



On the far side of the gaols,    the right as you look towards the Spion

Hop there were a number of people with groups of friends trying          to

resuscitate them.     I took the pulses of two people receiving heart

massage to see if they were doing    it right. I could   feel pulses

whilst heart massage was being    a dm in istered but once it was stopped

there was no pulse at all.



I cannot remember what either of these    people looked like.



I then helped place a number of people onto stretchers who were then

carried away by others.    When I say stretchers I mean the broken down

hoardings that were being used as stretchers.



I. remember at this p/)int also seeing the tw^r HICKS girls fyn the      pitch

with their father^/



One of these girls already appeared to be dead,      the other girl Sarah
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S2884

      HICKS                             her father was with her saying,   "Come on

      Sarah,    come on Sarah." There were a    lot of people round   them.

      I then realised that the     majority of people were already     dead and that

      there was nothing else      Icould do on the   pitch to help.   I then

      decided to get back out onto the terracing so that people could get on

      with their jobs without me     in the way.



                 had stayed on the terrace and I went back and rejoined him.

      I think the main factor that caused the deaths and injuries to the

      people were the inner fences.       The perimeter fences are necessary but
<r*
      because of the inner fences the fans entering       pens 3 and 4 could not

      spread out into the spaces at either side.



      I believe that    it should have been realised early on that the pens 3

      ^nd 4 were full and someone either Police or Stewards should have

^ / ^ l o s e d off the centre tunnel   to prevent anyone else entering these two

      pens.    The crush outside made everyone     panic that they would not get

 ^i n to      see the game.



      I do not believe the opening of the Gate       'C' was solely res pons bile

      for the deaths and injuries as I feel that with the spaces either side

      of the pens 3 & 4.



  There was room to accommodate the fans on the terraces the majority of

  whom I saw had tickets, although there were undoubtably those without

      tickets who entered through the gate.



  Certainly when I entered there was no rush of people through gate               "C"

  we walked in, went to the toilet and then made our way to Pen 7.

      I believe that the allocation of tickets was wrong and Liverpool
                                                                           PAGE        10
                                                                           S 2 S 84

should have had the larger Spion Kop end.



The   lack of order amongst the crowd outside obviously had some effect

The Police had lost control of the crowd early on and once that

happened it was almost     impossible to regain control.



However thes^ factors would not have led to the disaster           if only

somone haa closed off the centre tunnel and diverted the fans to the

         here there was   room.



I did not see anything through the day which I would consider to be a

criminal offence.



Once the game had been stopped,        the Police brought    in reinforcements

wWo formed a line across the pitch to s£:op a pitch invasion,          seeing

/i50-200 policemen apparently doing nothing to help obviously caused

frustration within the crowd,



I did not consider at the time there was a lack of medical           facilities

in the way of equipment but I certainly saw very little.           There     is

only a limited amount that you can do with your mouths and hands once

someone has had a cardiac arrest.        With a crowd of up to 50,000 people

at a football match with all the excitement there           is a chance that

there is someone going to have a heart attack.         Within hospitals there

is a case smaller than briefcase which contains a drugs ready made up

and a mouth piece and an air bag which would be of great assistance                   if

used by doctor or someone suitably qualified.



A defibri1lator is a large        piece of equipment that has been talked

about   in the press,   it would obviously have helped but would not be
                                                                         PAGE  1
                                                                         82884

easily accessible to the fans on the pitches they were at Hillsborough

If this equipment was available then the staff would have to consist

of doctors or other professional         people and not just St Johns

Ambulancemen.



However,   I do not know the specific       injuries   causing the deaths of the

people at Hillsborugh and whether such equipment would have assisted.

I do not feel that the public address system was not used enough.               The

first announcement       I heard was about 4.05 pm by Kenny DALGLISH.       The

uncertainty and confusion within the         crowd aggravated the sitaution.

I d i d n ’t feel that anyone appeared to take charge of t           tuation,
                                 y:
                                  '
Everyone was looking                /one else for guidance.   _T     seemed no

organisation by the authorities



We eventually left the ground at about 4.30 pm of our own accord,

though I had heard an announcement asking fans to leave the ground

quietly.



We met                    and then went outside



On the day I was wearing a pair of blue jeans,          red T shirt and a

         leather j ac k e t .   I am about 5"8 tall with curly brown hair and

a moustache.      My T-shirt had             written on the front.

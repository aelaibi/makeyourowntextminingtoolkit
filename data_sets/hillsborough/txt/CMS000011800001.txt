 EVIDENCE TO LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S ENQUIR^-"

 The Secretary of State has seen your minute of 17 May, together with
 Mr Macdonald's minute of 18 May and Mr Moynihan's comments.

 The Secretary, of State thinks that it is important to get the tone
 of what we say to Lord Justice Taylor right.   He considers that what
 we should be doing is telling Lord Justice Taylor what the
 Government is going to do and why, rather than making it into
 "evidence".   It should be made clear that the introduction of a
 national membership scheme represents Government policy and that we
 believe the scheme to be necessary irrespective of events at
 Hillsborough.   It will therefore be Lord Justice Taylor's job to
 accept that there will be a scheme and to look at ^suggestions for
 modifying it arising out of Hillsborough.           cav.

 The Secretary of State wold like to see the material you are
 assembling for the Inquiry when it is ready.  At that stage he may
 wish to discuss it with you.

EVIDENCE TO LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S INQUIRY


Ministers will recall that the Home Secretary told the Prime
Minister's meeting on the Football Spectators Bill last week that
Lord Justice Taylor "wjguld probably ask the Department of the
Environment • for a written contribution" on the case for the
national membership scheme. We have not received a direct request
from the Judge but we have been notified by the Home Office that
he would like written evidence to be submitted to him by 12 June.
The Home Office will be preparing evidence on Part II of the bill
and on other measures which they have taken to prevent disorder
at football matches. ACPO will also be submitting evidence.

I would be grateful for guidance on: (1) whether Ministers wish
us to submit evidence to Lord Justice Taylor; (2) what form the
evidence should take? On (1), we do not seem to have any choice
but to submit evidence, since the Judge will be considering the
scheme and we cannot allow the Government's position to go by
default* On the other hand, I doubt if the Secretary of State
would consider that it was for Lord Justice Taylor to sit in
judgement on the Government's legislative proposals - that is
surely a matter for Parliament.

If Ministers feel that it would be inappropriate to go further in
explaining the case for the scheme to Lord Justice Taylor, than
they have done in explaining it to Parliament, then the answer to
question (2) above may be to base our evidence very largely on
what has been said ejbout the Bill in Parliament, with copies of
the press notices issued when the Bill was introduced. We could
also include a copy of the report of Mr Moynihan's working party
on the scheme and copies of press notices issued following
meetings between Ministers and the football authorities since the
agreement on partial membership schemes and other measures in
February 1987.

The Home Secretary also told the Prime Minister's meeting that
Lord Justice Taylor would "consider the available technology, as
well as the situation in other countries". It is not clear what
the reference to other countries means since no other country has
a national membership scheme for football supporters but we could
offer to provide contacts with other countries, through the
Council of Europe's Standing Committee on Spectator Violence,
which Mr Lee of this division chairs.
 c



> jject to Ministers' views, we will prepare written evidence on
this basis and submit it for approval. I would suggest that it
should then be sent to Lord Justice Taylor under cover of an
official letter without any publicity.

DRAFT DOE EVIDENCE TO LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR



INTRODUCTION


1.      Hooliganism has been associated with professional                                football
in England since the mid-sixties.                         It is a major factor in the
37% decline in attendances at English league games since 1963 and
has denied English clubs the opportunity to compete in European
competitions.             Nearly      every    weekend          incidents     of     hooliganism
occur    in association with domestic                      league matches;-           over     6,000
arrests    and      6,500 ejections           were       made    at games     in the        1987/88
season and there were over 300 arrests of football supporters on
the last full day of the 1988/89 season.                          The weekend immediately
after the Hillsborough tragedy saw 24 arrests at West Ham and 94
at Chelsea.                                          Q


2.      Football hooliganism continues despite the efforts made by
the    Government,        the       police,    the       football       authorities      and     the
clubs    themselves.            A    summary    of       the     measures     that    have      been
introduced is at Flag A and evidence supplied to the Inquiry by
the Home Office will                add further comment.                Lord Justice Taylor
will wish to be aware,               in particular, of the package of measures
announced      by    the     Government        and       the     football     authorities         in
February      1987    -     see     press     notice       at    Flag    B.     One    of      these
required      each     of     the      football          clubs    to     introduce,       by     the
beginning of the 1987/88 season, a membership scheme to cover at
least    50% of      its ground capacity.                  At     the end     of   the    1987/88
season only 16 of the 92 clubs had done so.



PRIME MINISTER'S MEETING WITH THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES -
6 JULY 1988


3.      The   1987/88       season was         scarred          not only by the          level    of
incidents     at     domestic        matches    but       also by       the   shameful       scenes
involving        so-called           England         supporters          at    the       European
Championships in West Germany last June.                            Over 300 English fans
were    detained.         It was       against this background                that    the      Prime
          (i)          To review the main principles of the scheme;                             and
          (ii)         to identify appropriate technology to implement the
                       scheme for the start of the 1989-90 season.


18.    The working party met for the first time on Tuesday 26 July
1988 and on five             further occasions.                Its meetings were attended
by representatives of the following bodies:


          Football Association
          Football League
          Association of Chief Police Officers
          Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency
          Home Office
          Number 10 Policy Unit
          Department of the Environment


19.    The working           party published its agreed report on 9 November
1988     and     a    copy,       together       with     the     accompanying       DOE    press
notices,       is at Flag E.          The report sets out the working party's
views on what the main principles of a national membership scheme
should     be        and      contains       a     series        of     recommendations         for
consideration by the football authorities and the Government.



THE POLICE VIEW OF THE MEMBERSHIP SCHEME


20.      The     Association         of   Chief         Police    Officers        (ACPO),   which
represents the Chief Constables of Police, endorses the principle
of    excluding        known      football       hooligans       from grounds.           ACPO   was
represented          on     the   Minister       for    Sports        working    party    and   its
representative,             a senior officer with considerable experience of
the    problem         of    football     hooliganism,            was     fully    involved      in
preparing        the      working     parties       agreed       report.          ACPO   will    be
consulted in detail on how the scheme is to be implemented.


21.    The Police Federation initially welcomed the scheme but have
since voiced some reservations.                         The Federation would             favour a
scheme     voluntarily            introduced       by    the     football       authorities     and
based on Luton Town's            "home fans only"          scheme.         The Federation
have been assured that              any concerns      it has will be taken into
account when the details of the scheme are determined.


22.    The Police Superintendent's Association of England and Wales
have expressed broad           agreement with the conclusions                   reached by
the    Minister      for      Sport's      working       party.         The    Association
congratulated the working party for having the courage to grasp
the nettle of football hooliganism and suggested that those with
experience of policing grounds from places like the touch-line or
the    visitors      enclosure       would       welcome    implementation            of   the
proposals.



CONCLUSION


23.    For two decades hooliganism has ruined the game of football
as    an entertainment        for many and physically endangered the law
abiding    supporter.          In   his    speech    on    18     May   to    the    Football
Writer's Association (copy of text at Flag F), the Minister for
Sport said that "At the heart of my determination to tackle the
hooligan is the wish to see fans go to the game in safety and
return home the same way.             This could bring back many supporters
who have been lost to the game and could also attract a greater
family audience."          The national membership scheme is the key to
this    hope   being    realised.         The    scheme    will     mean      that   for   the
first time there will be an effective and comprehensive means of
keeping    the    troublemaker            away    from     football        matches.         By
separating     the     true    football      supporter      from    the      hooligan,     the
game will be returned to its rightful audience and may once again
become the pride of the Nation.
scheme     that        were       introduced              did     not     make        a     significant
contribution to controlling hooliganism.


6.     The Government is therefore committed to the introduction of
a    national     membership               scheme     to        which   everyone            attending      a
professional       match         must       belong.         The    need       for     the    scheme was
explained by the Department of Environment                                    (DOE)       Minister,      the
Earl of Caithness,               when opening the Second Reading debate on the
Football        Spectators            Bill     on      2       February.             Lord       Caithness
recognised that measures had been taken to deal with the problem
of    football      hooliganism               by     Government,          police          and     football
authorities in recent years,                        but went on to say that:


          "Unfortunately, they have not been enough.                                  More is needed
          inside football grounds.                        The effect has been to keep the
          lid on the problem, not to cure it.                             At too many matches,
          violence remains just below the surface.                                  Rival supporters
          have    to    be       kept       apart    by    physical       barriers          and    by    the
          employment of large numbers of police.                                    When there          is a
          slip in those separation arrangements, violence follows.


          We also have a serious problem outside football grounds.
          The    behaviour            of    rival     gangs       can   make        life    intolerable
          both    for law abiding                  football       supporters          and    for people
          who live or trade near football grounds or wish to travel
          by train on the same day as a football match."                                         (Official
          Report: Volume 503, Number 29, Column 1218-1219)


7.       Lord Caithness also explained the principles on which the
scheme would be based.                     He said:


          "The Bill proposes that it should be an offence for anyone
          to    attend       or       to    attempt       to     attend    a    designated          match,
          except       as        an        authorised          spectator.             An        authorised
          spectator         is    either       a     member       of    the    scheme        or    someone
          allowed      for by a specific exemption within the                                     scheme."
          (Official Report: Volume 503, Number 29, Column 1219)
THE FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP AUTHORITY


15.   At Report Stage Lord Hesketh explained the relationship that
the   Football   Membership      Authority       will    have       with    the       football
authorities.       Official     Report     Volume       506    Number       63    Column     67
reports:


        "I have explained that it has always be^rr our hope that
        the Football Association and Football/Eeague would set up
        and run the Football Membership Authority.                           I have been
        able to tell your Lordship's^;fct>day that everything is on
        course   for thatto happep'i   In the unlikely event that
                               S'
        they are not appointed-'to run the FMA or that they cease
        to run it in the fjjture, this amendment would require the
        new   body desigp^ted         as   the   FMA    to     consult      the       football
        authorities Jcn drawing up or modifying the scheme or when
        replacing/it.          The Government accept completely the need
        for tl>e football authorities to be fully consulted at such
        tir
         /

THE LICENSING OF GROUNDS

                                                          /
16.   Lord Hesketh explained at the Committee stage tlja'fc:


        "The Bill proposes that spectators shduld be admitted to a
        designated football match onl^,i£ the club or other body
        hosting the match has a licence to do so.                          The authority
        which would issue suclv^ licences would be the Secretary of
        State,   or    another,.-i>ody appointed          by       him.     One       possible
        alternative      fpf    the    Secretary        of     State       would       be   the
        Football      jyf^mbership     Authority,         although          so        far   the
        positiprf of the        football authorities               has been to          resist
        takifvg on this job. "


Lord Hesketh went on to explain why the Government considers the
licensing     responsibility      should     lie    with       a    small        centralised
authority     which    could     apply     standards          uniformly          to     ground
throughout the country rather than with,                      as the opposition had
       "The     Government            have      always    accepted       that        there     were
       practical reasons for certain limited exemptions from the
       membership requirement of the scheme.                          ...But there is no
       benefit       in seeking         to exempt        large categories             of people
       from membership if the categories are drawn too widely. We
       run     the     risk       of    creating         loop     holes       through         which
       hooligans perhaps               people who have even been banned                         from
       membership,          can    sneak        their    way    in.      We   also         create    a
       whole new problem of checking that people who had claimed
       to be exempt are who they say they ar e ."


Lord Hesketh is also reported in Column 1393 pointing out that
membership of the scheme will benefit those who join.                                 He said:


       "People are not going to achieve a great advantage if they
       are exempt from the scheme.                       Membership of the scheme is
       not a burden.          It is a means of ensuring that everyone who
       goes to football matches in future can do so without fear
       of     violence,       and      without       being      subject       to     obscene        or
       racial abuse.              It is the law abiding spectators who will
       be the members             of   the scheme.             The only people whom we
       really want to exclude from membership of the scheme are
       soccer    hooligans.             They are         the people whom we want                    to
       keep away from football grounds,                        and excluding them from
       membership       of    the       scheme       will      achieve    that        objective.
       This is a crucial point.                      Membership of the scheme will
       confer        real    benefits           on   those     who    enjoy        it.        Their
       membership cards will be read quickly and efficiently by
       the electronic readers at the turnstiles - with the right

their   duties    under         the    Safety         of    Sports       Grounds       Act.         Lord
Hesketh said:


        "I do not accept the argument that the responsibilities of
        the    licensing        authority         under       the    Bill    will       cut    across
        those     of    local      authorities             under     the    Safety       of    Sports
        Grounds Act.            The two authorities will have to co-operate
        in    operating         their      licences,          but    there       are     plenty         of
        precidents         for different authorities working together in
        relation to the same premises.                            ...There is no reason to
        suppose that the licensing authority proposed by the Bill
        will      not        operate         in        tandem        with         the        separate
        responsibilities              of   local       authorities         and others.              ...I
        certainly          do    not       see     a       good     case     for       giving       the
        responsibility for licensing grounds to local authorities.
        I suggest it is in the interest of football clubs, and of
        the consistency between them, that the authority should be
        a central one, as the Bill provides." (Col 140)


Notwithstanding this, Lord HeskethJtater explained that:


        "If      the       AssociatiojK          of        District        Councils           or    the
        Association of Metropolitan Authorities                             wish        to    run the
        licensing autho^ty ,                I will         listen to any proposal                  they
        make.     I canneft make a committment, but I shall listen if
        they wantegr to run a responsible national body.11 (OR: Vol

FURTHER ^BACKGROUND



THE MINISTER FOR SPORT'S WORKING PARTY


17.     At     the     Prime       Minister's              meeting       with      the       football
authorities      on    6    July      it   was     agreed         that     the    details          of   a
national membership scheme should be examined by a working party
chaired by the Minister for Sport.                         The objectives of the working
party were:
APPLICATION OF THE SCHEME


14.     The Government is               committed to introducing the membership
scheme    throughout        the       Football       League    to     all    of    the       92    clubs
which play in it.               Lord Hesketh explained at the Bill's Report
Stage that:


          "The     Government's          position       is     tha.jt-'-'to exclude           certain
          matches could create the darjgiSf'that hooligans prevented
          from going to those gaipeir"covered by the scheme would be
          displaced        to    those       games    outside       the     scheme."         (OR:    Vol
          504, No 38, C o l 3 5 ? ? )


On the question of a possible phased introduction of the scheme
Lord Hesketh explained that:


          "We accept that the Secretary of State must consider -the
          possibility of phasing and he must listen to what the FMA
          has to say on the possibilities.                         But we continue to hope
          that phasing will not be necessary.                             We remain concerned
          that,     if    the        scheme    were    to     be     introduced         in    stages,
          hooliganism would be displaced from those clubs of which
          the scheme applied to those of which it did not. Hooligans
          who had been banned from some clubs,                         perhaps as a result
          of convictions for violent offences,                         would be free to go
          to others        and       cause    trouble       there.        For    this    reason       in
          particular, we believe that it will be in the interest of
          all     clubs    that       the     scheme    should        apply      throughout          the
          league     from       the    date    of     its    implementation,            though       the
          implementation date                itself must       of course depend                   on the
          technology being available and working."                              (OR: Vol 506, No
          63, Col 15)


A   good deal      of debate          at both the Committee and Report                            stages
centred    on     the     possibility         of     exempting       certain      categories          of
spectator from the requirements of the scheme.                                  Official Report
Volume    504     Number        47    Column    1393    reports        Lord      Hesketh's          view
that:
         "It    is    essentiaj^ that             e     flow    of   spectator           through
         turnstiles      sjaduld     move               smoothly     as     possible.          The
         technolog\^/is available to provide for this provided that
         everyojie has the same card               ' (OR: Vol/f)05, No 51, Col 100)



THE SCHEME AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS


13.   Official       Report    Volume       505    Number       502 Column        193    reports
their Lordship's debate at the Committee Stage on the possibility
of providing the police with the power to temporarily suspend the
requirements     of    the membership           scheme        in emergency         situations.
Column   194    reports       the    Home      Office      Minister,        Earl       Ferrers',
explanation that:


         "The    obligation         for   the      safe       operation      of    a    football
         ground is,      and   should remain,             with the club or official
         responsible.      ...That        is      not    to    say   that     that      type   of
         person should not consult                 the police and listen to what
         they may wish to say.              In many cases they would do so, as
         that is the sensible approach.                        There is nothing in the
         Bill to prevent them from doing so."


Later in the same debate Earl Ferrers said:


         "The responsibility for the rupjrfng of the club should be
         that of the club officiaj^r                     Of course they will discuss
         with the police if tfc^y find a great build up of people
         outside the      grcturfd.       The police will             say that          the club
         must do sojnething and let                   the people      in;    but       it is the
         c l u b 's .grfisponsibility to do that, not that of the police."
         (Column 198)
        "The     scheme       will   provide     for      the      Football        Membership
        Authority        to     disqualify       from          membership          t h o s e / who

8,    In the/same speech Xord Caithness made clear that the costs
of the scheme will be £6r football to find but that if clubs take
a positive approach t?o the commercial opportunities presented by
the scheme they cotfld benefit              from it       (Col 1221).          He also said
that 4/htroduction/of the scheme was dependent on the availability

that dur     ig the debate several/of their Lordships^asked about the
implications of the scheme for the passage of supporters through
the   -turnstiles.        The    n o y Minister         Lord    Hesketh        responded       by
expj*aining that:

9.    It might be helpful to Lord Justice Taylor if I also explain
that during the debate several of their Lordships asked about the
implications of the scheme for the passage of supporters through

THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE SCHEME




        "The Government           have already made it clear that the key
        issue in settling the timetable                     for introduction               is    the
        need to be satisfied about the availability of the right
        technology.          We   shall not       implement the scheme until                      we

        demands on the technology but much has already been learnt
        about the conditions and use and about membership cards in
        match day conditions.             It is simply not the case that this

THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE SCHEME


12.   Lord Hesketh explained during the Committee Stage that:

In addition, he pointed out that:


        "We    should        also     bear    in     mind     that       the    technology       and
        experience         of    running      membership          schemes       is     not    new to
        football.          Some 90 of the 92 clubs run membership schemes,
        backed by a range o f ,technology,                     some of it advanced.                 Of
        course       the     national        membership           scheme        will     make    new
        demands on the technology but much has already been learnt
        about the conditions aliel use and about membership cards in
        match day conditions.                It is simply not the case that this
        experience is new to football. l,^H^Kl~>Veir^04^ Nd^&©7 Cot                                      x

         "It    is   essential          that      the      flow    of      spectators               through

their Lordship's debate at the Committee Stage on the possibility
of providing the police with the power to temporarily suspend the
requirements      of   the membership              scheme        in emergency                situations.
Column    194     reports        the    Home      Office          Minister, Earl                  Ferrers',
explanation that:


         "The     obligation           for   the       safe      operation of                 a    football
         ground      is,   and    should remain,              with the club or official
         responsible.         ...That        is      not    to    say      that       that         type      of
         person should not consult                     the police and listen to what
         they     may wish to say.In many cases they                              would do so, as
         that     is the sensible approach.                       There is nothing in the
         Bill to prevent them from doing so."/ ( o ^ c ^ A . ■.                                             Sc£>,

Later in the same debate Earl Ferrers said:


         "The responsibility for the rupwfng of the club should be
         that of the club officiaJ^s<^^ Of course they will discuss
         with the police if th€y find a great build up of people
         outside the gr^uria.                The police will                say that              the      club
         must do  something and let the people in; but it is the
                 s'
         club's^responsibility to do that, not that of the police."

APPLICATION OF THE SCHEME
                                                                                    *

14.     The Government is              committed to introducing the*membership
scheme    throughout           the    Football       League       to all    of    the     92    clubs
which play in it.                Lord Hesketh explained at the Bill's Report
Stage that:                                                                                .


          "The    Government's          position       is     thajt-"^€b     exclude       certain
          matches could create the da^geir' that hooligans prevented
          from going to those garn^s'covered by the scheme would be
          displaced       to     thos^/games         outside       the     scheme."       (OR:    Vol
          504, No 38, Col'357? )


On the question of a possible phased introduction of the scheme
Lord Hesketh explained that:


          "We accept that the Secretary of State must consider the
          possibility of phasing and he must listen to what the FMA
          has to say on the possibilitJhssr-                      But we continue to hope
          that phasing will not be necessary.                            We remain concerned
          that,     if    the       scheme    were    to     be     introduced       in    stages,
          hooliganism          would be displaced from those clubs of which
          the scheme applied to those of which it did not. Hooligans
          who had been banned from some clubs,                           perhaps as a result
          of convictions for violent offences,                        would be free to go
          to others        and      cause trouble          there.        For this       reason     in
          particular, we believe that it will be in the interest of
          all     clubs    that      the     scheme    should        apply       throughout       the
          league     from      the    date    of     its    implementation,          though       the
          implementation date              itself must of course depend                        on the
          technology being available and working."/(OR-:— Vol G06v— Ito—



A     good deal    of debate         at both the Committee and Report                          stages
centred     on    the     possibility        of    exempting        certain       categories       of
spectator from the requirements of the scheme.                               Official Report
Volume     504    Number       47    Column    1393        reports    Lord       Hesketh’s       view
that:
       "The     Government          have    always      accepted          that         there       were
       practical reasons for certain limited exemptions from the
       membership requirement of the scheme.                          ...But \here is no
       benefit       in seeking to exempt              large categories                  of people
       from membership if the categories are drawn too widely. We
       run     the     risk       of     creating      loop      holes           through          which
       hooligans       perhaps people who have even been banned                                    from
       membership,          can    sneak    their     way     in.         We     also      create        a
       whole new problem of checking that people who Jbtad* claimed
       to be exempt are who they say they are."


Lord Hesketh is also reported in Column 1393 pointing out that
membership of the"scheme will benefit those who join.                                   He said:


       "People are not going to achieve a great advantage if they
       are exempt from the scheme.                    Membership of the scheme is
       not a burden.          It is a means of ensuring that everyone who
       goes to football matches in future can do so without fear
       of     violence,       and       without    being      subject           to     obscene          or
       racial abuse.              It is the law abiding spectators who will
       be the members             of the scheme.            The only people whom we
       really want 1:o exclude from membership of the scheme are
       soccer hooligans.                They are      the people whom we want                           to
       keep away from football grounds,                      and excluding them from
       membership       of        the   scheme     will     achieve        that         objective.
       This is a crucial point.                    Membership of the scheme will
       confer        real    benefits       on     those     who     enjoy           it.          Their
       membership cards will be read quickly and efficiently by
       the electronic readers at the turnstiles - with the right
       technology in place. ^                     ubn taka a                           ^rp-r-oar^h t-n

           the     licensing            authority      under      the    Bill    will       cut       across
           those       of    local        authorities          under     the    Safety       of       Sports
           Grounds Act.                The two authorities will have to co-operate
            in    operating            their     licences,        but    there     are       plenty         of
            precedents            for different authorities working together in
            relation to the same premises.                            ...There is no reason to
            suppose that the licensing authority proposed by the Bill
            will        not'       operate        in          tandem     with       the          separate
            responsibilities                  of local       authorities and others.                    ...I
            certainly             do    not     see      a     good     case     for     giving          the
            responsibility for licensing grounds to local authorities.
            I suggest it is in the interest of football clubs, and of
            the consistency between them, that the authority should be
            a central one, as the Bill provides." fsCul 140)

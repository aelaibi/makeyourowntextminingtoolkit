I h ad       no      idea    for     what      r e ason.        The     crowd       in the          other        parts        of    the

ground were               very     or d er l y and        the    only        trouble       appeared              to     be    behind

the L e p p i n g s         Lane     goal.




On     reaching           the     Leppings       Lane      end       and     standing          on    the        track        in f r o n t

of     the     N o r t h S t a n d , I still           could         not     see    the    cause          of     the     trouble.

T he     only        police       action       which      seemed       obvious         to me         was        to    form an           open

cordon across                the     touch      line      from       the     n orth west            corner           flag     towards

the      goal        mouth.        I ordered         officers          to     form     this         cordon           to w h i c h       they

As     I 'neared the              goal     mouth      I sa w     that        the    eme rg e n e y         gate       i n the

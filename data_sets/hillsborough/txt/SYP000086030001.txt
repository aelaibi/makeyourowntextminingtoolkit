By this        time      I had     lost sight          aft my Serial.              I made my way to exit

to the stewards                "has |myone          gone out         of these      gates."          T h ey         id "

However,        none were         s er io u s l y    injured,.         A number        of the       spec t a t o r s

coming      through were asking                  for     directions           to their       part    of the

seconds an        initial       burst     of 50 - 100 people               came thorugh this           gate.

A fter    the    initial      burst     these       people    sorted       themselves        out and walked

in an o rderly fashion,                some went        to the      programme hut and some asked

for    directions.          The m aj o r i t y headed         towards        the North Stgjnd.

A shart       t ime    later,     I rnade my w a / to Gate C a n d wg^=rff^mats i de where                      I

T o g e th er withrnost         of my serial           I went    back      into          ground    through

were     being    pulled up        i t h e          stand.      I immediate ley went           to the fence

and shou t e d abuse          towards       us.      I lifted a number             of fjcrfs over       the

fencing,        some    of these      fans were         slightly      i n j i j r e^and some more

The    ones     that were       s l i g ht ly    injured     I carried as far a w a y from               the

fencing as        possible.          I ensured that           these       fans were      not    in any

distress.         Before      returning          to the     fence.

I then       carried one man          out who was           close    to    collapse.         I c^ried         him

on to        a clear area        in the         pitch and     stayed with him p e fr            some   five

minutes.         He was     very d i s t r es se d however,           did notytfppear to be              in any

               The     only one       I can give any d e s c r i p t i o n of was a man               in his     late

               time     to    pay attention.             T h roughout    the    time   that     I was    pulling        the

               of alcohol           was on the         clothing.

               T hr o u g h o u t   the ordeal         officers were       c o n t i n u a l l y having abuse     shouted

               at    them,     which was most, upsetting.                  However,      having said that,              there

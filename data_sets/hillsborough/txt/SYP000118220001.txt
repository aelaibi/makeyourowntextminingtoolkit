                11.10      Briefing by Inspector Sykes re duties performed          at

                turnstiles 9-16.

                11.15      Patrol street just outside West Stand entrance.           Streets

                relatively quiet.

                11.30      Steady Increase of fans in area but none making          their way

                to the ground.

                12.10      Turnstile 11/12 open.       PC 782 Hemsworth and myself deployed         j

                to cover the entrance of these two gates which are allocated for West               <

                Stand seats.       Duties to check for correct coloured tickets and

                searching fans.       Coaches arrived at Leppings Lane.       Fans departed and

                headed off away from the ground.

                                                                                       R183

13.30        Steady stream of Liverpool fans arriving at turnstile.

Mostly father and son, middle aged fans.                  Good spirits and queueing

orderly,    patiently and responsible.

14.15        Fans still well behaved and co-operative,                  of course the

number of fans increasing but myself and PC Hemsworth still in a

position to carry out our duties of checking tickets and if need be

searching fans before entering the ground.

14.30        From nowhere a sudden influx of fans arrive at turnstiles

9-16.    Increased pressure from latecomers starts to tell as the orderly

queue starts to disintegrate and a funnelling type queueing b e g i n s .

I found it impossible now to search fans as the pressure on the front

two fans entering the turnstiles              is too great.          Gone are the

respectable father/son, middle aged men and women.                       Instead these are

replaced by y o u t h s , late t e e n s , early t w e n t i e s .   Minute by minute the

swell of fans increases as does the pressure and the crushing

element.     By this time I have moved to the side of turnstile 12 to

avoid injury.       Searching fans is now totally impossible as well as

checking t i c k e t s , as the single queue is now 4, 5, 6 a b r e a s t .            The

noise limit also increases and I find it hard to pass on                      my orders to

Liverpool    f a n s ; o n e , to   stop pushing and crushing people          at the    front

and t w o , to make sure they have the correct coloured tickets for this

part of the ground.          As far as I can see,         fans are choc-a-block past

the blue swinging gates on Leppings Lane.

To my left adjacent to turnstile 16 is a grey coloured corrogated

panelled fence,       approximately 1 0 ’ high.          This is being scaled by

young Liverpool fans and with the aid of a supporting bar,                      climbing

over the top of the brick built turnstiles and into the ground.                          The

crushing is now getting greater and I am pinned to the brickwork of

turnstile 12, unable to             move. The fans entering the ground              now have

obviously been drinking             and in some cases heavy.
                                                                       PAGE         3
                                                                       R183

14.50      Fans   are jumping queues and pushing in, which increases          the

pressure and raising the tempraments of certain fans.        At this time I

cannot understand why the presence of Mounted police is not evident.

A public address message is passed over the speaker system at the

Leppings Lane end and is clearly heard by most of the fans.           In it

the fans are told to stop pushing as people at the front are getting

crushed.   Fans   seem to take no notice of this message,    as the

pressure at the front ceases to get any better.

15.00      Fans   in this area of the turnstiles have now entered the

ground.    A Mounted police officer from Merseyside appears my side of

the corrogated fence and implores fans to get down off the fence.

They totally ignore him and carry on scaling the wall and into the

ground.

15.05      I rejoin my serial at the main blue    metal gates at the

Leppings Lane.    The turnstile area is relatively quiet with only

strandlers and fans looking for mates with tickets.

I then received a message from S g t . Morgan that there is a pitch

invasion and I quickly run through a metal gate into the area behind

the turnstiles and following the rest of the officers headed right to

the West Stand/South Stand corner,     under the police control box and

into the uncovered seated area of the South Stand,     continuing down

through the seated area and onto the pitch.      I saw youths climbing

over the blue 10' high fencing behind the goal at the Leppings Lane

end.    At firt I didn't realise why but then I saw youths sat on the

track perimeter   in tears and bodies lying face down on the pitch.            I

immediately went to the fence and helped fans who either had climbed

over or had been pulled over the fence and took them away from the

scene to a safer/quieter place.

The fans behind the goal especially the seated area began shouting/

chanting   'second division'   and criticising the police.    I saw fans on
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             R183

the front row of the upper seating on West Stand pulling fans up from

the terraces below them.             It now became apparent to me what had

happened.      I continued to help on the pitch,         asking people how bad

their injuries were and those who were not injured and who could walk

to move away from the scene near to the fence, as by now Police were

carrying bodies out who urgently required treatment and space was

also needed to perform            this treatment.

Ten to fifteen minutes            into the incident I sensed fans becoming

aggressive towards the Police.            This h a d n ’t been helped by the Notts.

Forest fans at the Spion Kop end who had been chanting and upsetting

the Liverpool fans.          I saw Liverpool    fans climbing on the goal posts

and then tearing the netting off.

The tension was getting greater as fans blamed myself and other

officers for what had happened.

I saw a fan kick a metal object on the track perimeter.               I could see

this was one of the metal            tent type pegs used to hold the netting to

the ground.       I quickly       picked this and about 30 others up as they

were about 6" long and at one end they were ground to a point.                  I did

this because of the mentioned growing tension on the pitch and the

possible ci rc um t a n c e s .

I decided to take them to the players'              tunnel and as I did this I saw

the corner flag at the West/South Stand corner uprooted.               I also

picked this up as it had a metal pointed base.

I returned to the penalty area at Leppings Lane to help clear the

pitch and help fans with injuries until proper medical assistance

arrived.     One of the injured I treated had been unconscious and had

regained consciousness but was still very groggy.              After monitoring

him for a while I asked him if he had any injuries he said his leg

hurt, possible break.             By this time Liverpool fans were using

advertising hoardings as make shift stretchers.              One was brought to
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            R183

          me by a group of about 6 fans.   They insisted on putting the injured

          male who was with me on this board and I had to argue with them for

          some time not to, as the injured male may have broken bones.

          They finally left and medical assistance arrived.

          It was then announced over the PA system that the game had been

          abandoned and for spectators to stay put for a short time,    enabling

          accident/emergency vehicles to leave the scene.

          This was ignored and spectators were leaving by droves.

          I was then instructed by Chief Inspector Sumner to go out of the

^         ground onto Penistone Road and marshall Notts.    Forest fans away from

          the ground towards the city.

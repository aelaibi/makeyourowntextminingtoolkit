Personal History

1.   I was born on 16th April 1949.



2.   I am the Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer with the South

     Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS).     SYMAS is

     a part of Trent Regional Health Authority and provides

     ambulance services for the whole of South Yorkshire, an area

     which covers the District Health Authorities of Sheffield,
     Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley.



3.   The SYMAS headquarters and control are at Heather Close in
     Rotherham.



4.   I am a Justice of the Peace and a Fellow of       1    bulance

     Service Institute and a member of the Associate        f Chief

     Ambulance Officers.



5.   I joined the ambulance service as a cadet in Liverpool in

     1966   and   spent    18 months   as   a cadet.   I became   an
     ambulanceman in 1968 and between then and 1974 I worked on

     general out-patient duties, emergency duties, which included
     shift work.      During that time I became a qualified in-

     service instructor and spent time at the Liverpool training

     school and was seconded to the regional training school for
     short periods.       In 1974 I was promoted to the position of
sub-officer in charge of the headquarters station on a shift
basis, and my duties primarily involved administration and

responsibility for control.   In October 1974 I was promoted

to Station Officer over three stations in Liverpool.   I was

promoted to Superintendent in January 1975 and was put in

charge of the St. Helen's Station which was a large sub-unit

and was totally self-contained.    This was a station of 40

men, it included its own control unit plus workshops and

stores.   In February         I transferred to SYMAS and was

appointed Assistant Divisional Officer      (Operations)   in
charge of six ambulance stations in Doncaster and Rotherham.

I became Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for

SYMAS in 1978 and was appointed Chief Metropolitan Ambulance
Officer for SYMAS in 1982.



Since 1986 I have been an instructor at the National Health
Service training establishment in Harrogate on courses for

senior ambulance officer development.



I am a member of the Association of Chief Ambulance Officers

Working Party To Review Control Procedures For Ambulance
Services, which has just re-written and issued the control
procedures for ambulance services nationally.



From 1979 to 1986 I was an Executive member of the Institute
of the Certified Ambulance Personnel.
9.    In the new national training notes for ambulance personnel

      issued by the NHSTA there is a section written by me on the

      ambulance service response to civil disorder incidents.

      This was as a result of the SYMAS involvement in civil
      disturbances at Orgreave.         We had pu rc h a s e d protective

      equipment and specialised vehicles ( t h e n c o n v e r t e d   Land

      Rovers) prior to Orgreave and were therefore in a position

      to deal immediately with that incident when it arose.


Organisation of SYMAS

10. The ambulance service is split into two main divisions, the

      operational division and the control division.



11.   On the operational side most ambulancemen in SYMAS now start

      as cadets when they are 17 and spend two years training in

      all fields of the ambulance service; emergency services and
      NHS.   They have no responsibility for the patients other
      than in observing their treatment.



12.   The next stage is the basic grade ambulanceman, some of whom

      will not have been cadets.        They normally begin on part-

      time work within the jfc)T services transporting the elderly
      before moving on to full time transporting of              general
      outpatients.



13.   The next grade is that of qualified ambulancemen.         They are

      trained in all aspects of the ambulance service including
dealing with emergencies.         They do six weeks training and

two weeks driving training after twelve months of general

experience.     The national guidelines are for the training to

be repeated every five years but in SYMAS the ambulancemen

receive      repeated     training    between each attendance on

national courses.          The next grade    is that     of leading

ambulanceman,      who takes responsibility for a shift on an

ambulance station in the absence of a station officer.



Station Officers are in charge of an ambulance station and

are responsible for the vehicles, manpower, and operational

resources     of   that    station.    The next rank is that of

Superintendent      (Operations).        We have   two   in SYMAS,

Superintendent Dale who is responsible for Sheffield and
Rotherham, and Superintendent Horner who is responsible for
Barnsley and Doncaster.          They co-ordinate manpower and

vehicle resources, monitor wages and salaries,           and advise

the Support Services Officer of any difficulties relating to

finance.     They report to the Assistant Chief (Operations) in

relation to operational matters.



The   Assistant     Chief    Metropolitan    Ambulance     Officer

(Operations) is Mr Jones who is responsible for every aspect

of operational cover.       He reports to Mr Hopkins, my deputy.


On the control side the lowest rank is that of Control

Assistant.    The Control Assistants have no ambulance service
experience in operations.     They receive telephone calls from

the general public, hospitals,     ambulance stations and the

police and fire services and they work in shifts.       They do
not deal with patients themselves but pass the calls onto

the Control Officers who make the decision on the action to
be taken.



The Control Officers decide on the deployment of ambulances

in response to information passed to them by the Control

Assistants.    During the working week day there are four on

duty.    One dealing with accidents and emergencies,        one
dealing with out-patients in each        the areas of Sheffield

and Rotherham, and the other dealing with out-patients for

Doncaster/Barnsley.     After 1700 only the Control Officer on

accident and emergency        remains   on duty with control

assistants and Superintendents and the situation is the same

for the whole of Sunday.     On Saturdays there are two Control
Officers on duty during the day.



The control room is supervised by a Control Superintendent.

There is always a Superintendent on duty and they work on a

shift basis.       On the afternoon of Saturday 15th April the

Control Superintendent on duty was Mr Clarke.


The Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer (Control

and Communications) has overall responsibility for Control.
This    is Mr A.    Smith.   He is responsible for control,
         planning,    registration (the pre-booking of general outÂ­

         patients),     ambulance liaison posts,               and    standards    and

         efficiency officers.      The standards and efficiency officers
         are of superintendent rank and their job is to monitor the

         standard     of    services     to    individual            hospitals,    the
         investigation of complaints about services provided,                      and
         liaison with the hospitals.


20   .   Mr Smith is accountable to Mr Hopkins.


2 1 . In addition to the personnel mentioned above there are also

         the following officers:-



         1.   The Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer (Training), who

              is responsible for arranging all aspects of training

              all SYMAS personnel.       This is Mr Wade.



         2.   The    Assistant    Chief       Ambulance        Officer     (Support
              Services).      He is primarily responsible for advising
                                                        e
              upon    and    procuring    computer           and     communications

              equipment, and giving budgetary advice.                    This is Mr
              Truman.



         3.   The Assistant Divisional Officer (Support Services).
              This    is Mr Morley.           He   is       responsible    for    the

              investigation of complaints,                  certain disciplinary

              matters,      strategic and operational planning,                  joint




                                          433
             planning with hospitals and emergency services, and he
             plays a supporting role to Mr Truman.



      4.     Myself.     I have overall responsibility for all aspects

             of the ambulance service in SYMAS.


Paramedics

22.   Thirty three of the          SYMAS   ambulancemen and women are

      paramedics.       Ten of them having qualified as paramedics only

      recently.        Paramedics are also referred to as "extended
      trained".     In 1985 we began our own paramedics training in

      SYMAS.    There had been a national paramedics training scheme

      for some time but it was slow in getting off the ground, and
      I was anxious for some of my staff to receive extended

      training and I knew that there were a number of ambulancemen

      and women who wished to receive such training.        We began our

      own paramedics training in 1985 and the national scheme was
      started in the following year.         Those people who had done

      the SYMAS paramedic course simply had to pass an exam rather

      than   attend      a national   course.   The SYMAS paramedics

      training goes beyond that required by national guidelines

      and SYMAS has been certified to do its own paramedics

      training     by    the   National    Health   Service   Training
      Authority.



23.   The most     important aspects of paramedics training are

      intubation, infusion, defibrillation,         cardiac monitoring,
                            and drug   administration.          At     the end of that course
                            paramedics take an exam and every twelve months thereafter

                            they must prove to a consultant anaethatist and ambulance

                           officer that they are proficient in each of the aspects of

                           paramedic training.      An ambulanceman who has not received

                           extended training is not permitted to deal with the matters

                           referred to in the preceding paragraph.                        There is strict
                           control over the work done by paramedics.                 They should only

                           put   their extended     training into practice when it is

       â   _____         -â absolutely necessary and as a last resort^                    They must do a

(/ff^wv^^nnajr^?^)   Sitting   case   vehicles/' These are

essentially mini buses which are normally used for
transporting the elderly, and general outpatients who

can walk with the assistance of one person.          They carry

little in the way of equipment,            but they do have a
first aid kit, blankets and a carrying chair.



We have one major incident vehicle (emergency tender).

This is essentially a mobile stores and communications

centre.     A schedule showing the equipment carried by

the major incident vehicle appears in a separate bundle
of documents.



The special incident unit.        This is essentially a riot
vehicle and is a fully protected Range Rover.            It was

not used at Hillsborough and is intended for lifting
casualties from civil disorder incidents.



Marked and unmarked staff cars.         The marked staff cars

are used by Station Officers and are occasionally used
on operational duties.



A marked Range Rover which is the management incident

vehicle.    It contains back up equipment to be used in

support of an ambulance at the scene of an accident and
is a mobile flood lighting system.
The Control Centre

25.   In the control centre we have a separate incident room which

      was set up earlier this year following the Kegworth and

      Lockerbie disasters.          Saturday 15th April was the first time

      that the incident room was used operationally although it

      had, of course, been tested previously.                       The intention is to

      be able to manage a major incident from a separate room

      without      disrupting the general services or "domestic"

      emergency work being dealt with in the control room which is
      next door.



26.   SYMAS use four radio channels



      Channel   1 is the emergency reserve channel which is a
      national emergency channel.                    The intention is that any
      ambulance using ERC can pass from one area to another

      without having to switch channels and have radio contact at
      all times.



      Channel 2 is the SYMAS emergency channel.


      Channel 3 is the domestic channel for use on out-patient

27.   On Saturday 15th April ambulances were using the SYMAS

      emergency channel and only one of the domestic channels

      because it was a Saturday.       During the incident many of the

      ambulances were told to use the emergency reserve channel.


Changes Following the Bradford Fire

28.   Following the fire at the Bradford City Football Ground in

      May 1985 I arranged to meet with John Davis,           the Chief

      M e tropolitan Ambulance Officer for the West Yorkshire
      Metropolitan Ambulance Service, to find out about the sort

      of problems which they had experienced in dealing with the

      Bradford fire, in order to improve the SYMAS planning for

      major incidents.       He identified the following main areas of
      difficulty:-



      1.   Locating off-duty officers because they were not

           equipped with radios or pagers.


      2.   Once contact had been made they did not have marked

           ca rs   to   go   to   a major   incident   and   no   radio

           communications in their own cars.      As a result of this

           the WYMAS officers had great difficulties getting

           through crowds to reach the Bradford City Football

           Ground and to gain access to the ground itself.


      3.   When the^ arrived at the ground they had no^radio

           communications to their control.
I immediately implemented an on-call rota call for the

operational ambulance officers in SYMAS in order to give

senior officer availability 24 hours a day.        There is a pool
of six senior officers who work an on-call rota outside

normal   working    hours   so   that one   of    them    is always

available.       In addition the Deputy Chief Metropolitan
Ambulance Officer and I work an on-call rota on a weekly

basis,   taking alternate weeks.       When      this    system was

introduced by me in 1985 it was done on a totally voluntary
basis, payment was only introduced by national agreement in
1987.



In 1987 because of the ambulance officers salary increase, I
restructured the service by inserting another              line of

operational officers.    I now have a station officer on duty
with the emergency tender from 0600 to 2400 every day.



Therefore, outside normal working hours, there is always a

Station Officer on duty, a Senior Officer on-call, and the
Deputy or myself also on-call.



All senior officers had been issued with pagers before the

Bradford fire but these were upgraded after.



All senior officers have had portable radio sets since the
Bradford fire.
34.   All officers on duty now have marked vehicles with radios.



35.   The senior duty officer is equipped with a vodaphone as are

      the major incident vehicle and the Range Rover which acts as
      the management incident vehicle.



36.   All senior officers now have magnetic blue lights for their
      own vehicles.



Major Incident Planning

37.   There has been a major incident plan in SYMAS for as long as

      I have been there.     It is reviewed from time to time,
      specifically after each exercise.


38.   When a major exercise takes place only a few senior officers

      know about it, and none of those who would be taking part
      are informed.   The last exercise was in November 1988 at

      Doncaster Railway Sidings.   In 1987 there was an exercise in

      Rotherham where a building which was being demolished was

      used to simulate a collapsed building, and in 1985 there was

      an exercise in Sheffield where there was a simulated railway
      incident.



39.   Following each exercise each of the emergency services and
      the hospital involved have an in-house debriefing followed

      by a co-ordinated debriefing.       The major incident plan is
       then updated.             The current version of the major incidgr,Tux(LS
       plan is dated 1985.            It has been reviewed, but/Viot^-filtered

40.    In fact, wejwere in the process of preparing a new major
             <*â  ^^1+ -              of 2    Z/>C^X JLA^O
       incident plan^at the time of the Hillsborough disaster and
       the plan had reached its second draft.                  A meeting had been

       arranged for the working party to discuss the second draft

       on 19th April, but this has been postponed as a result of

       the Hillsborough disaster.                The working party consists of

      myself,          my Deputy, the four assistant Chief Officers, the

      Assistant Divisional Officer (Support Services) and the
      Public Relations Officer (|                            who also acts as my
      secretary).


The Hillsborough Plan
41.   Following my meeting with                               of WYMAS in 1985 I

      delegated to an Assistant Divisional Officer (Mr Wilkinson)

      responsibility to co-ordinate plans for ambulance service

      involvement at five football grounds within South Yorkshire.

      Those           football   grounds        are the grounds       of Sheffield

      Wednesday,          Sheffield United,         Rotherham,     Barnsley,   and
      Doncaster.



42.   In January 1986 I wrote to all five football clubs.                   A copy

      of my letter of 16th January 1986 addressed to the clubs

      appears in a separate bundle, together with a reply from
      Sheffield Wednesday dated 29th January 1986.      Following that

      correspondence Mr Wilkinson contacted the club and the
      police     and    started   a process   of drawing up plans in

      conjunction with the Station Officers local to each of the

      football clubs.        In the case of Hillsborough the plan was

      prepared by Mr Wilkinson,        Station Officer Higgins     and




43.   The plans relating to the football grounds were prepared in

      the late summer of 1986 and appear in a separate bundle of

      documents.       The incident plans for the grounds are intended
      for use by control and senior officers.      I would not expect

      individual ambulancemen to be aware of the contents of those
      plans.



Provision of Liaison Officers and Ambulances to Hillsborough

44.   The circular HC( 78)45 from the Department of Health and

      Social Security is entitled Health Services Management-

      Ambulance    Services:      Operational Control and Use.    The

      circular summarises and updates advice and practice about
      the control and use of ambulance transport.      Paragraph 28 of

      the circular deals with sporting and other public events and
      states:-



           "Although the voluntary aid societies usually

           provide first aid cover at sporting and other
           public events where accidents and emergencies
                                                           are likely to arise, NHS ambulances may be
                                                          provided                      if        appropriate.                        In           such

                                                          circumstances a written undertaking should be

                                                          obtained in advance from organisers to meet

                                                          the cost of providing special standby cover,

                                                          though                no     charges             should           be      made            for
                                                          conveying any patient to hospital.                                           It may be

                                                          inappropriate                             to    make          a   charge                 when
                                                          ambulances are provided at public shows as a

                                                          public relations exercise to benefit                                                      the
                                                          ambulance service.                               This is a matter                         for
                                                          discretion of Authorities."



                                     45.    Following the Bradford fire I decided that irrespective of

                                              finances we would place ambulances and crews into grounds at

                                              games where we felt it advisable;                                                  this would happen at
                                              Sheffield Wednesday if the ground was going to be full or if

                                              the supporters had some particular reputation for trouble.

        .                                   In the case of the FA Cup Semi-final^between Liverpool and

                                             Nottingham Forrest an ambulance was provided at the ground

                                             with its crew                       with another ambulance and crew on standby
                                             nearby) because of the size of the crowd.



                                 46.        Our policy is for either or both of Station Officers Eason

                                             and Higgins to attend all matches at Hillsborough.^t^s&axr



                                 47.        I recall that after Mr Wilkinson attended one meeting Afith

Club Officials at Sheffield Wednesday he came back and told
me that if it was going to cost the club money to provide

ambulances   then they were not interested.       For major

matches, therefore, the ambulances are provided in breach of

the terms of paragraph 28 of DHSS circular HC(78)45.



The Club were, however, prepared to provide free tickets for

the two liaison officers at every match and they regularly

sit in the same two seats in the South Stand behind the

directors box from where they have good views of most of the

ground.   When, however, the club knows that they can sell
all the tickets for a match the seats are taken away from

the liaison officers to be sold to the general public.   The

liaison officers then make arrangements with the police to
gain access to the ground and they position themselves at
pitch level and I understand that this would normally be at
the North East corner of the pitch.


In April 1988 I wrote again to the five football clubs^and,

in addition, to Doncaster race course.   I sent this letter

because   there had   recently been a pop concert at the
Sheffield United football ground and they had refused to

allow ambulances to be on standby because we had given them

a price estimate of Â£1,000.     The attitude of the clubs
generally seems to be that they would prefer to make a

donation to the St. John's Ambulance Brigade or the Red
Cross of about Â£50 and rely upon 999 calls if they need us.
           St. John's Ambulance Brigade and Red Cross do excellent work

           but they are not in a position to give immediate help beyond
           first aid.

15th April 1989

51.        On Saturday 15th April 1989 I would normally have been on

          call but Alan Hopkins had agreed to do my on call duty
           instead because I was on a course at Sheffield University

          that morning in relation to my position as a Justice of the

          Peace.         The course finished at 1230 and I arrived home at
          about 1330.

          control in Rotherham and she told me that there was a major

          incident at Hillsborough.                     I told her that I was on my way.




53.       I left home and arrived at ambulance control at about 1550.
          I saw Mr Jones leaving in a staff car to go to Hillsborough.
He told me that there was a major incident at Hillsborough,

that people had died, and that Mr Hopkins and Mr Morley were

at the ground.    He was going down to the ground to back them
up.



I went into the control centre and met Mr Clarke in the

incident room (which had been set up by then) with Albert
Smith.   They briefed me of the situation, providing details

of the officers present at the ground, vehicle deployment,
and the backup from the neighbouring ambulance services.      I

gave instructions to call additional officers         into the
Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to act as

liaison officers.    Standards and efficiency officer

was sent to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Control

Superintendent                to the Northern General Hospital.
It was clear when I arrived that we had sufficient officers

at the ground but we also needed eyes and ears at the
hospital.     I was told by Mr Clarke that there were eleven

ambulances which had already been to the ground.

was in the incident room dealing with press enquiries.        I

went into the control room to speak to                about the

out-patient vehicles deployed to the ground.        He told me

that a further twelve vehicles had been deployed to the

scene.      I also spoke to                 to ensure that the

"domestic" emergency services were still being provided.

Having satisfied myself that they were in control of the
situation I went back to the incident room where I remained
until about 1755.



Whilst I remained at control I was basically monitoring what

was going on.      I was satisfied that my officers knew what

they were doing and that they were doing an excellent job.



There was no point in my going to the ground whilst the
incident was at its height.       Mr Hopkins was at the ground

and I was more use supervising the control end of the

operation.    In the event of a major incident either Mr
Hopkins or I will attend the incident itself and the other

will be at control.     The decision as to which of us is in

which position depends purely upon our locations when the
incident arises.     As I live near Doncaster it clearly made
more sense for me to travel to control in Rotherham.



Whilst at control I spoke to a number of the officers at the

scene and took a number of phone calls.       It is difficult for

me to recall the exact content of those conversations or the
order in which they happened.     I do remember that I tried to

contact Mr Hopkins at the ground and that there was some

difficulty with communications       (which I shall deal with

later).   At one point I was able to speak to Mr Hopkins whom

I believe told me that either 27 or 37 were then dead but
that he thought there would be many more.    I told him to try
                                                oJc IbZSfiâ rsAeftfi&AS)
to keep in contact.    I spoke to him again later/vwhen he told

me that there were 53 dead.     I also spoke to Mr Jones and Mr
Morley   during   this   time in order to receive up dates
relating to the situation at the ground.



I also remember a police inspector coming through to me at

about 1605 requesting more body bags.



As well as receiving up dates from the ground itself I was
being kept informed of the position by the staff both in the

main incident room and in the control room.         I took about

six telephone calls from the media which were mainly from

television or radio.     I had wanted to speak to them myself

because I knew that their reports would be going out almost

immediately and there would ngt^b^ar^ opportunity to correct
any matters.                                oLCoXA2jq(




I recall speaking to David Jones at about 1620 when he told

me that all live casualties had left the ground and that
ambulances should be sent to Herries Road Bus Depot.         By

that time we were also transferring patients from the Royal

Hallamshire to make more space available for the incoming
casualties.



Throughout the whole of my time at Control I was satisfied

that we had sufficient vehicles and manpower at the scene.

I spoke to the Regional General Manager of Trent Regional
Health Authority twice whilst at Control.     He rang at about
1615 and I outlined the situation to him and he said that he
would do anything he could to help if we needed further

resources.     I told him that we had sufficient resources at

the scene and that we were receiving additional help and

cover from other ambulance authorities.      I then telephoned

              at about 1745 to give him an outline of some of
the statistics involved in the operation.



I went to the ground with Noel Wade,        leaving Control at

about 1755.    At that stage I was satisfied that, as far as

live casualties were concerned,     the incident was closed.
When Mr Wade and I arrived at the ground we saw Mr Hopkins
and Mr Jones.      They briefed me as to the then current

situation and how the incident had gone.      Mr Hopkins said

that he thought we had moved about 200 casualties.      I also
spoke to each of the crews (about 8 crews) who were then

still at the ground before going into the gym to meet Chief

Superintendents Addis and Mole.       We arranged that our
ambulances would take the deceased to the Medico Legal
Centre in Sheffield when they had been         identified by

relatives.    Dealing with the deceased is actually a police

responsibility but it is normal for the ambulance service to

co-operate in moving them in a situation such as this.       I

left the ground at about 1850 and went back to headquarters.
I gave a press statement to reporters who were there from

the Sheffield Star and Sunday Mail and an interview to the

BBC with Mr Hopkins.      They basically wanted details of
statistics.
64.   I went of duty at 2100.


Statistics

65.   Forty two ambulances attended the ground, of which 31 were

      SYMAS vehicles and 11 came from outside areas.              Most of

      these vehicles made several trips between the ground and the

      Sheffield Hospitals.           In addition further vehicles were

      brought in from outside SYMAS and were put on standby.           172

      casualties were taken to hospital by ambulance, initially to

      the Northern General and then to the Royal Hallamshire.
      Three patients were taken to Barnsley District General

      Hospital.     Ninety Four fatalities were taken to the Medico

      Legal Centre in Sheffield, some having been returned from

      the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to the
      gymnasium at the ground.          The last of the fatalities left

      Hi ll sborough       at 0528   on Sunday 16th April 1989.        The

      incident itself was closed by Mr Hopkins at 0530 on Sunday
      16th April.



66.   Four paramedics attended the ground and three others were on

      duty.   There was no point in deluging the ground with

      paramedics because it is difficult for them to put their
      extended training into practice in crowds.         In any event, by

      1620 there was no need for them.            I understand that there

      has   been    some    criticism     about   the   failure   to   use

      defibrillators.         I should explain that a defibrillator
                          should not be used in a crowd situation.      It must only be
                          used on a patient without a pulse.        If it is used on a

                          patient who has a pulse, however weak, it would kill that

                          patient, and if anyone was to touch a patient whilst the

                          patient was being defibrillated then that person would

                          receive an electric charge sufficient to kill them.


                 67.      We received a large number of calls from the media.        The

                          transcripts of our tapes show that by 1630 we had received

                             So         calls   (although   some   calls may have been
                          counted twice if they were transferred from one telephone to
% TUucoJUL*   faA & 'jy            *
                   /      another). A These calls caused a problem in that they blocked
                          lines which were much needed, for example by nurses doctors

                          and ambulancemen calling in to see if they were needed at

                          work plus otherr routine calls and domestic emergencies.


                 68.      Between 1500 and 1800 hours on 15th April we also dealt with
                          49 domestic emergency calls.



                 & 1.     As a result of the Hillsborough incident we have put in

                          three additional telephone lines to the incident room to
                          handle press calls.



                Difficulties Experienced

                          We did experience some difficulties in relation to access to
                ft
                          the ground.   One problem was simply the crowds outside the

                          ground, and another was vehicles in the way.     At one stage
the yard in the area of gate 0 was partially blocked       by
police vehicles and police horses.    It would have been our

intention to drive ambulances into the entrance by the

gymnasium which has recently been made       in the   row of

terraced houses, collect patients and drive out through gate

0 but that road was blocked because of a police feeding unit

being parked outside the gymnasium and because of other
police vehicles parked in the area of the entrance between

the terraced houses.   As a result of this ambulances had to

reverse into the yard through gate 0 which slowed down the

rate at which we were able to remove casualties away from
that area.



In addition a number of the ambulances       (and the major

incident vehicle when it first arrived at about 1540) were
trying to proceed up Penistone Road to gate 0 but were

directed by the police into the service road to the south of
the ground.



We did experience some difficulties in relation to radio

contact.   There were three main areas of difficulties:-



1.   The handsets did not always work properly because of

     the stands at the ground.   I understand that there is

     not normally any difficulty in using the handsets from
     the seats in the South Stand which Mr Eason and Mr

     Higgins would normally sit in because these are well
             above ground level.



     2.      The   sheer   weight   of   radio   traffic   caused   some

             difficulties.    Most ambulances were told to use the

             emergency reserve channel but one or two used other
             channels in order to reduce the pressure on ERC.



     3.      There was     interference    on the   emergency reserve

             channel.    This seemed to appear only on 15th April but

             is still present.      Phillips (who supply and maintain

             our radio equipment) were called in immediately after
             15th April and they are still trying to locate the
             source of the interference.



     The problems with the radio transmission has only caused us

     minor difficulties.       They did not result in the operation
     being handled any differently.


Conclusion

    My attitude and that of my officers is that we wish to

     provide a swift and efficient service.         We have always tried

     to be at the forefront of the ambulance services.               The

    equipment obtained prior to the Orgreave civil disorders,

    our training of paramedics, the setting up of the incident

    room, and the changes introduced following the Bradford

     fire,    are all evidence of this.          Since the Hillsborough
    incident we have, as I mentioned above, already put in new
        telephone lines to the incident room and a television and

        commercial radio are being installed so that, in any future

        major incident, contemporaneous media reports will also be

        received in the incident room.   We shall be reviewing the

        position to see if any further changes should be made but

        the only alterations which we have put in motion at present

        relate to the incident room which had not previously been
        used other than for testing.




Sports Grounds:       The Future

        SYMAS would wish to make submissions to phase two of the

        Inquiry as to safety of sports grounds in the future.    The
        fire service have a degree of involvement in the question of

        safety both because they issue a fire certificate       and

        because they are consulted by the local authority who issue
        a certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

        I would wish the ambulance service to fulfil a similar role.

        Such a role would, in particular, deal with the question of

        ambulance access and egress as well as the provision of

        equipment and ambulances at major sporting events.      Our

        views and recommendations will be set out in more detail in
        due course.

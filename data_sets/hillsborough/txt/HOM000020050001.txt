    Note
    The seats available to Sir P e te r's p a rty for th e ru g b y in tern atio n al are
    situ ated at th e e n tran ce to th e Committee Box, so it would not be
    inconvenient to o th er members if Sir P eter wished to see less of th e
    actual match and see more of th e sp e cta to r arrangem ents on th e
    te rra c in g s . But as th e crowd for th e Fiji match will be relatively small
    by M urrayfleld sta n d a rd s, th e re may be little to see in term s of te rra c in g
    crow ds. In th e circum stances, Sir P eter may p re fe r to see th e actual
    game.
    I will of course be back in touch to confirm th e fin er details of th e
    above.

 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S VISIT TO CELTIC PARK
 F u rth e r to our re c e n t telephone d iscu ssio n s, I can confirm th a t
 Lord Ju stice Taylor will be a rriv in g a t Celtic P ark a t 1545 h o u rs on
 Friday 27 O ctober. He will be accompanied by R obert Whalley (S e cre tary
 to th e Taylor In q u iry ), Jonathon Sweet (P riv ate S ecretary ) and myself.
 We will be a rriv in g in a Government c a r.
  Lord Ju stice Taylor will be p a rticu la rly keen to see th e outside of the
  ground as well as th e in sid e. I su g g e st th a t it might be u sefu l to s ta rt
  at th e tra c k sid e in o rd e r to give him his b e a rin g s, and proceed with a
  perim eter walk around th e outside of th e g ro u n d , so th a t Sir P eter can
  look a t general ap p ro ach es, c ar p a rk in g arran gem ents and tu rn stile
  facilities. Inside th e g ro u n d , I su g g e st we th en proceed to stairw ays and
  te rra c in g moving on to look at facilities such as th e Police Control Room,
  tu rn stile control room, medical facilities e tc . I imagine th a t th is outside
  and inside to u r could be done in a m atter of 70 m inutes o r so.
  S ir P eter will also probably wish to d iscu ss such m atters as tic k e ts sales,
  su p p o rte rs’ tra v e l arrang em ents for away m atches and o th e r general
  topics which may have a b e arin g on sp e cta to r sa fe ty .         It might be
  ap p ro p riate to handle th is so rt of discussion ov er lig h t refresh m en ts (fo r
  h a lfjo r so ?).
   I imagine th a t Lord Ju stice T aylor will wish to d e p a rt a t
   1730 h o u rs although hav in g said th a t, i t would be no g rea t problem if he
   were slightly la te r th an th is .
   As with th e v isit to Hampden e arlie r in th e aftern o o n , th e Divisional
   Commander and p e rh a p s also Mr John Dickson th e A ssistan t Chief
   C onstable, will be p re s e n t th ro u g h o u t th e v isit.
   At th is sta g e , the above arrangem ents a re , o f c o u rse, still provsional.
   P erhaps we could d iscu ss fin er po ints of detail early n ex t w eek. I will
   tr y to phone you on Monday o r T u esd ay .

LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S VISIT TO McDIARMID PARK
SATURDAY 28 OCTOBER
I am w riting to confirm th a t Lord Ju stice Taylor wishes to see around
McDiarmid P ark on S atu rd ay 28 O ctober and to h e a r som ething of the
background about the arrangem en ts which made th e development possible.
As we have d isc u sse d , Lord Ju stice T aylor will a rriv e a t 1000 h o u rs, and
would wish to leave for E dinburgh no la te r th an 1130 h o u rs. He will be
accompanied b y Mr R obert Whalley (S e c re ta ry to th e Taylor In q u iry ),
Jonathon Sweet (P riv a te S ecretary ) and m yself. We will be trav e llin g by
Government c a r.
I imagine th a t Lord Ju stice Taylor will wish to begin h is v isit with a
sh o rt b riefin g on th e ev en ts of th e la st few y e a rs which have led to the
opening th is season of y o u r new Statium , as I have no doubt th a t he will
find th is p a rticu la rly in te re s tin g , b e arin g in mind th e larg e num bers of
medium-size clubs in England b u rd en e d by relatively dilapidated g ro u n d s.
T hat is not to su g g e st th a t similar deals with developm ent companies can
become w idespread, it is simply my observation th a t you have an
extrem ely in te re s tin g sto ry to re la te . Such an in tro d u c to ry b rie fin g need
not take more th an 15 m inutes and might b e s t be u n d e rta k en o v er a cup
of coffee e tc .
T h e re a fte r, I imagine th a t S ir P eter will wish to see around th e Stadium ,
s ta rtin g outside th e g ro u n d with consideration o f approaches to th e
ground and including c ar p a rk in g and tu rn s tile a rran g em en ts. Inside th e
gro u n d , he will wish to see sp e cta to r facilities in some detail. Sir P eter
may also be in te re s te d in medical facilities and in p a rtic u la r may ask
w hether th e re is a m arked difference betw een c a s u a lty num bers and
ty p es of in ju ries reco rd ed in f irs t aid re c o rd s betw een th e old ground
and th e new. He will also w ish to see Police control facilities and have a
discussion with th e Police and th e Club on p a rtic u la r a sp ec ts o f policing
crow ds at McDiarmid P a rk .
A ccordingly, I will be making arran gem ents with                   T ayside        Police    for
relev an t Police O fficers to b e p re s e n t for th is V isit.

The above details a re o f course provisional at th is stag e and I will tr y to
telephone you on Monday o r T uesday o f n ex t week in o rd e r to d iscu ss
fin er p o in ts o f detail. In th e meantime, can I rec o rd formally on behalf
o f Sir P e te r, his g ra titu d e fo r th e o p p o rtu n ity to v isit McDiarmid P a rk on
what will, I imagine, be an extrem ely b u sy day for you.

              With regards to the event of Saturday,                      15 April,       1989 at 9.00am that

                      I reported for duty at Ecclesfield Police Station and was then

                ransported to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.                           All officers,^

            \\C8present were briefed at             10.00am that date.           I was a member of Serial

              19 consisting of 9 other               constables and a sergeant, PS 323 Proctor.

              We were directed to perform duty outside the ground on Leppinqs L a n e

              itself near to the t ur n s t i l e s .         This duty consisted of general            public

                  er duty,          the reception and searching of any coaches attending

              di rectly at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and assisti ng

              turnstile officers               if so, required.

                t ?1.00am that date my serial made its way to the Leppings Lane end

              where behind the West S t a nd we received a further briefing together

              with the          serials directly responsible for the turnstiles at Leppings
                                                                                          PAGE

             Lane from Inspector Sykes.     During this briefing we were advised that

             it was    likely that Liverpool       fans would bring alcohol to the ground.

             We were told to search any coaches arriving at Leppings Lane for this

             purpose.     The officers directly concerned with the turnstiles were

             told to make selective searches for alcohol.

             My serial wj^rft outside the ground and positioned ourselves on

             Leppinjys Lane on the footpath adjacent to the turnstiles.              This was
T S^    L.   ^^ /ap p ro xi ma te ly , 11. 10am and on leaving the ground a large number of
   9lfl ^    X                       '
             Liverpool    supporters were already milling around outside the gates on

 c LPo&j     ^he ground and walking up and down Leppings Lane.             Almost    immediately

             on taking up our positions I was approached by a group of Liverpool

             fans enflrfl r ing where the nearest open Public House was.            This was a

             compron request      prior to the kick off that day.       Some time around     12

             /loon the Leppings Lane turnstiles were opened.            It became apparent

             that a large section of the Liverpool fans were not interested in

             entering^Cne ground early.            There were large number of fans of all

             age></<nanging around on Leppings Lane drinking          large quantities of

             alcohol    from cans and bottles.         Attempts made to persuade these fans

             to enter the ground were met either with derision or the Police were

             ignored.     I was    involved in the search of an official Liverpool

             suap^ 0 ^ s ^ c y a ^ H ^ f n Leppings Lane.   This search resulted in the find

                'tWfii^^ns of lager together with some empty cans.           The d r i v e r was

             verbally cautioned regarding this matter.             From approximately 1.30pm

             onwards the situation seemed to get worse due to the large crowds

             developing    in Leppings L a n e .    All my time was taken up wth attempting

             to prevent obstructions to the footpath and road.

             Vehicles    began to have difficulty negotiating Leppings Lane due to the

             large volume of .supporters who were making no effort to enter the

             ground,    standing   in gr ou ps, drinking alcohol and causing a g e ne ra l

             obstruction.      Again due to the volume of numbers and the fans being
                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                 S921

                unco-operative this task became almost impossible and I believe that

                at some j^fcage traffic was stopped by the Po li ce from entering

                Leppjmgs Lane.      Sometime ar o un d 2.QQpm I was aware that a special

         ^'^ y y a i n had arrived from Liverpool and this made the situation on

                Leppings Lane w o r s e .   Other officers were also attempting to prevent

                obstructons and to get the fans into the ground without much success,

                       as apparent by this time that there were a large number of

                    upporters from Liverpool who were not in possession, of a >              Bt.         I

                was also approached by three men who showed me ti                   ,hey had just

                purchased.      It was quite obvious that the tickets               forgeries and
X                   oor ones at that yet these men had paid twenty pounds each for

                them.     There were also a large number of supporters who were obviously

                drunk but due to the vast numbers of supporters            present these had to

                be ignored.

                      h who was in the process of attacking others.          We took these

                    ouths towards   *A* gate in order to transport them to the Police               room

    f a r ' but due to the vast numbers of supporters attempting to enter the

                turnstiles at this time we were unable to force a path through to the

                gate.     We therefore were obliged to take the youths to the Police

                room via adjacent      roads.    As we were taking the youths away from the

                immediate area of Leppings Lane we were approached by several youths

                attempting to purchase the tickets from the arrested youths.                 After

                the prisoners had been processed I was in the gymnasium                     e rear

                of the North Stand when around 3.00pm Chief           Ijnspe^frfrSr Sumner S H    /J ^

                requested that all available officers         in the t<fyrn attend on the

                pitch.     I then attended in front of the Leppings Lane terraces and

              Saturday    15th April    19 8 9 , I can say that approximated                   JS pitr t ha t

              date I was in the gyr(rtfa^i^arn at the Sheffield ^gtfnesday Football                        ground

              where I was completing clerical du t ies.^lSncerning an earlier arrest
                          f J (gjM t'V          ,
              when Chief Inspector Sumner camg^fn and requested all available

              officer to go the the Le^pcfngs Lane terraces.                    I went onto the<i5itch

              at the Hop end of Jt>rfT ground and made my way to the Lej^fffngs Lane

              terrace.        On my arrival       there   it was apparent tfcwsft there were a large

              number of people either dead or dying c r u ^ P f e d up against the fencing

              near to the goal area.              I gave assis>gmce to other officers                in pulling

              poeple through the gate onto tjie^pitch.                 I also assisted in removing

              approximately six young p e j t j f l e     who were obviously dead from the pen to

              the right of the goal ^ntffiere the f enc i ng had been torn open.                     These
                                                                               PAGE    2

         people were taken from the terraces and placed ontg^the pitch where

         other officers attempted resuscitation.      I t \ygffx assisted in

         transferring a dead male from the pitcly#o outside the gymnasium w here

         the body was left.    I returned to >He   pitch where   I assisted less ,

         seriously hurt people and witj^jeneral    public order duties until

         allowed to leave the footjytfll ground around 6.QQ pm that night,

         I would not be able tj^identify any of the dead or injured on that

         date.

            Further to my previous statement dated 6th July 1989 060789.

            On 2nd   October         1989 021089 I was shown video f o y ^ ^ e ^ n d           p^tCtfraphs

            of the   Hillsborough disaster by P C |                       |of the West Midlands Police.

            On photograph           (Ref no        1/          •x No       ) I can identify myself.                At

            this point I[ am
                          ^m engaged

            I can be seen on the left side of the photograph.                            I am partially

            obscured by a fan.  I can identify myi^elf, by my wedding ring and that
                                            zr\ <?t>
            I am standing next to PC Mick ROB If )N i        sted me in carrying

            this person across the pitch with some s up p ort ers .                       I can remember

            that this deceased person was heavy and that the hoarding on which we

            were carrying him snapped and we had to lay him on the pitch.                                This

            can be seen on the photograph.
                                                                                  S921B

         After   laying this man on the pitch we were approached by a

         superintendent who     instructed us to take the body to the gymnasium

         area.      Ule left^the body adjacent to other bodies,    outside the

         gymnasium.>yl     tfTen returned to the pitch.

         I have indicated on a plan of the pitch (Ref l^o^Vp^l        ) (b.x No    ) the

         point where I first     came into contact with No 60 Christopher T R A Y N O R ,

         next to the goal at the Leppings Lane end and the a              n front of the

         Spion Kop where we placed him prior to carryin                             lum.
         I have done this by way of a coloured dot and have signed the plan.

         X was unable to identify any of the other deceased persons that I came

         into contact with.

                                                                      A THORPE SIGNED

  REVIEW OP THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS (DESIGNATION       OP    FOOTBALL
  HATCHES IN ENGLAND AND WALES) ORDER 1990

  Thank you for your letter of 28 January about the possible
  exclusion of Berwick Rangers' home matches from the definition
  of designated matches.     I have also seen Tony Baden and
  Keir Hopley's notes of 5 February.

  I would have reservations about dropping Berwick Rangers from the
  list, even though its current capacity is only 600!, unless I
  could be sure that it will be covered by whatever arrangements
  are envisaged for other Scottish League 2nd Division clubs. We
  do not want to create another anomaly such as that whereby
  Berwick is still at war with Imperial Russia.
  I concur with Keir Hopley's view that friendly and testimonial
  matches should be covered by the Order.

  I would not support a two tier system of designated matches
  distinguishing between our licensing and safety certification
               Unless or until the list of designated grounds
  accords with some kind of reality, I would not wish to expend our
  resources on non-League (and in some cases very minor League)
  grounds. I am copying this to Tony Baden and Keir Hopley.

           Dear Mr Bone

           Re: Waiver of Privilege

           Further to your discussions with Ann Adlington, please find
           copies of the waiver which has been sent to Mr B Hytner QC and
           Mr T King QC.

           I trust this satisfies Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
           requirement.  If this is not the case, please advise.

           Yours sincerely

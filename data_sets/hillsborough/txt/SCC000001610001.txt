                     The Panel received the minutes of its meeting held on 24th
           September, 1990, and, arising therefrom (a) expressed concern at the
           implications for Sheffield as a result of the decision of South
mk         Yorkshire Police Authority made at its meeting held on 19th October,
           1990, to reject revised arrangements for lay visiting to Police
           Stations; and (b) noted that requests for financial assistance from

     (2)   ASSOCIATION OF CHIEF POLICE OFFICERS - STRATEGIC POLICY DOCUMENT
                     The City Solicitor and Head of Administration submitted a
           report concerning a policy document compiled by a joint Home Office/
           Association of Chief Police Officers Working Party which set out a
           strategy for increasing public confidence in the police as a service
           and reorientating police priorities. He stated that the policy
           document had been the subject of a recent special conference
           attended by Police Authority representatives which had identified
           several areas of concern and that as a result the contents of the
           policy document was to be reviewed.
           RESOLVED: That (a) the information reported by the City Solicitor
           and Head of Administration be noted; and
                     (b) the City Council’s members of the South Yorkshire
           Police Authority be requested to raise the issue of extending the
           Authority’s equal opportunities policies to cover service delivery
           aspects when the policy document is considered at its next meeting.

     (3)   COMMUNITY SAFETY URBAN PROGRAMME SCHEMES
                     The City Solicitor and Head of Administration submitted a
           report giving details of several community safety schemes which had
           been agreed for inclusion in the 1990/91 Urban Programme. The
           report explained that recent guidelines issued by the Department of
           the Environment on the use of Urban Programme monies had as one of
           its main criteria special environmental improvement initiatives
           aimed at improving the general perception of inner city areas,
           personal safety and a wider security of property.
           RESOLVED: That (a) the information contained in the report of the
           City Solicitor and Head of Administration now submitted, be noted;
                     (b) proposals for the increased use of Urban Programme
           money on safety and security projects be welcomed; and
                     (c) the City Solicitor and Head of Administration be
           requested to submit a report on the progress of the schemes to a
           future meeting of the Panel.
          Meeting of the Police and Community Safety Panel
          (Policy) 5.11.90                                             Page 2




    (4)   LEGAL RESPONSES TO RACIAL HARASSMENT
                    Pursuant to the decision made by this Panel at its meeting
          held on 8th January, 1990 (page 1170 of the printed minutes), the
          City Solicitor and Head of Administration submitted a report on
          responses received from Council Departments giving details of legal
          powers available to them to enable the City Council to play a
          pro-active role in combatting problems of racial harassment.   The
          report concluded that, although not all Departments had replied to
          the questionnaire, it was clear it would be necessary to formulate
          departmental procedures for using powers available in relation to
          racial harassment, training staff in their use and developing
          systems for the support of victims.
          RESOLVED: That (a) in view of the City Council's commitment to the
          irradication of racial harassment, this Panel expresses its concern
          at the low level of response to the questionnaire from Council
          Departments;
                    (b) consideration be given to the inclusion of information
          on measures to combat racial harassment in departmental race
          equality annual reports; and
                    (c) the City Solicitor and Head of Administration be
          requested to (i) produce detailed information concerning the powers
          available to Departments together with legal advice and support and
          (ii) submit a further report on this matter in 12 months' time.

    (5)   FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT - RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE
          POLICE
                    The Panel received and noted a report of the Director of
          Social Services outlining the range and extent of contact between
          officers of his Department and the Police.

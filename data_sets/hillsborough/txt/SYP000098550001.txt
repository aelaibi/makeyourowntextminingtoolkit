Dear Belinda

                      RE   HXUSBOROOSH

I refer to your recent correspondence dated 28 August 1990.

Please find enclosed one video tape 'Ccupilation of BBC Television Footage
fran Hillsborough Incident' supplied by you for Superintendent Bettison to
obtain copies, and one West Midlands Police photograph album supplied by
you for copies to be obtained.

I have researched film albums in our possession.   We do not have any copies
or negatives of these films.

I have spoken to Detective Inspector Perkins of the West Midlands Police,
they are not prepared to supply us with either copies or photographs fran
their negatives or permission to copy any photographs we already have in
our possession as this would breach their copyright.

Detective Inspector Perkins did advise that should you wish to pursue this
further you should write to Superintendent Beachey, Hillsborough Incident
Roan, Nechells Police Station, Sowler Street, Birmingham B7 5DA.

Yours sincerely




Detective Inspector

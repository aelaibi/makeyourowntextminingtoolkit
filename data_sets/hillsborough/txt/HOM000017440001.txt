      Dear Sir,

      I enclose a note of evidence to the enquiry into the Hillsborough
      disaster, which was written by the Director General,
      Mr Richard Warburton OBE.

      I also enclose a copy of the Society's most recent annual report
      which referred to other major public disasters and the likelihood
      of similar occurrences.

      If you require any further clarification of the Society's views
      please contact Mr Warburton.

      Yours faithfully,
                                                                                                     Upitd      k

 TAYLOR INQUIRY - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBAT.T. GROUND. SATURDAY 15 APRIL
 1989




 The Society welcomes the decision to hold a Public Inquiry into this
 tragedy. The wide terms of reference allow both for a full analysis of
 cause and an authoritative statement of the actions needed to prevent a
 recurrence.

 In recent years the Society has repeatedly expressed its concern for
 the safety and well being of members of the public. This concern is
 more pointed in view of the recent tragedies - Abbeystead, Herald of
 Free Enterprise, Bradford     City, Manchester Airport, Kings Cross,
 Clapham, Purley and now Hillsborough where large scale loss of life and
 injury has occurred.  The Society has been involved in providing expert
 evidence at the Kings Cross Inquiry.

 It may well be that there are factors which will emerge from this
 Inquiry common to those other recent tragedies. The Society is by no
^feans convinced that, despite the well publicised results of those
^Kiquiries, the true lessons have been learnt or that it can be assumed
 that undertakings   facing   similar potential risks have     initiated
 objective and systematic reviews of safety within their undertakings.
 In consequence there is still a serious potential risk of further
 accident involving large scale loss of life and injury at public
 gatherings.

 It is the Society's view that:-

 1.   It is no coincidence that these recent tragedies - still very much
      in the public perception - have occurred where large numbers of
      the general public as invitees are brought together - for whatever
      purpose - in situations and circumstances where their safety and
      well being have not been seen as a primary responsibility by those
      who own, manage and control those locations.

 2.   Whilst  there   is  an understandable    concern that   individual
      shortcomings be highlighted and blame apportioned,       any such
      identification must be placed within the context of the complexity
      of the issues involved. There must be an identification of where
      the ultimate responsibility may lie and of the provisions made by
      those with the responsibility for the duty to be discharged
      successfully throughout their organisation.

 3.   If the public are to be safeguarded it is axiomatic that safety be
      managed without conflict and to the same level of priority,
      competence and continuing effect as these organisations would
      apply themselves to what they perceive to be their main
      objectives.   High standards    of  safety integrity require     a
      demonstrable and demonstrated commitment to safety at the highest
      level within the organisation. This commitment should be written,
      made public and monitored for effect.      A safety policy should
      exist which sets out the safety objectives. This should be
      supplemented by detail as to the organisation, arrangements and
      procedures that exist to meet that objective.
Given the sad frequence of disasters involving large numbers of
the public it could well be that a more positive profile and more
positive action is required from those with a responsibility for
the enforcement of any relevant legislation.   Clearly, inspection
bodies have to balance their enforcement and advisory roles, but
the public have a right of reassurance that these bodies enforce
the law to a common standard whatever immediate effects that
policy may have.   The Society believes that sanctions do have to
be applied where the circumstances are such that without such
sanctions safety standards cannot be guaranteed.

If Hillsborough is seen within this wider context of public safety
you may well wish to consider whether the enforcement role should
be the responsibility of one Government Department rather than the
present situation where, given the specific environment, it could
be any one of a number of Government Departments or even a shared
responsibility.

The Society would suggest that the Health and Safety Commission
and the Health and Safety Executive could most appropriately
assume this responsibility.

It is necessary to look in detail at the quality and the
competency of all those with responsibility for safety and how
these responsibilities and duties were discharged. To that extent
individual football clubs, their governing bodies, the Health and
Safety Executive, the Police, Fire Brigade and Emergency Services
are clearly key bodies.

The Society would wish to see football grounds subjected to an
appraisal of the hazards and the risks that apply at football
grounds. Risk constitutes the likelihood of occurrence of the
hazard and its adverse effect in respect of people and property
damage.  It is for responsible management to project, from its own
experience and from such professional advice it may have or has
called upon, the extent of adverse effects.      That risk may be
expressed in terms of a frequency or a probability.           Good
practical guidance to this approach has already been formulated by
the Institution of Chemical Engineers.     Attached is a copy of
their nomenclature for hazard and risk assessment in the Process
Industries.   Whilst this is based on experience in a different
environment, it is both relevant and applicable to any environment
where hazards on this scale exist.

Such an analysis would indicate at first sight four primary areas
of concern, ie fire, congestion (over-crowding), structure and law
and order. You may well conclude that the first two offer the
greatest risk even if in more recent times thinking has been
conditioned by the fourth.
3

8.    Consistent with a risk appraisal exercise is the need to look
       further where the degree of risk warrants further analysis.  It is
       by no means uncommon for emergency planning and contingency
       planning to include a disaster planning exercise where those
       involved can examine a particular problem in the light of their
       own resource, experience and how their contribution interacts with
       others. As important is the need to indicate not only the
       strengths, but the possible weaknesses in the present organisation
       and the resource available for containment where prevention has
       failed.   In particular, liaison, communication, speed of response
       and evaluation can be explored.

      Where organisations more thoroughly understand their own role,
      that of others and the necessary interactions between them, then
      any emergency plan has a higher probability of mitigating the
      effects of an incident.

fc.   Unless an     analysis in this or some other relevant form       is
^     undertaken   the Society has doubts as to whether the problems can
       be clearly seen and effective long term solutions proposed.  It is
       important to identify common factors applicable to each hazard.
       It is equally important to identify discrete factors in order that
       the solutions offered do not adversely affect those solutions
       proposed for other identified hazards.   Hillsborough offers some
       insight into this problem in terms of the extent to which physical
       separation of the playing field did or did not affect the safety
       of those spectators in an overcrowded area of the terracing.
       Perhaps it would be helpful to reflect on the possible outcome if
       the hazard had been that of fire.

10.   Those responsible for safety are, without evidence      of   forward
      thinking, vulnerable to the charge that they:-

            (a)   do not really know what is going on;

            (b)   have no priorities to deal with hazards;

            (c)   have not evolved adequate safety defences   to meet the
                  hazards;

            (d)   cannot demonstrate that they have a commitment based on
                  an   examination  of  worst  possible   cases  and  the
                  precautions they have determined will meet such a worst
                  possible outcome.

11.   It is crucial also to look at the needs of all employees in each
      and all of the relevant organisations who implement safety duties
      at these locations. The adequacy or otherwise of the training
      received by them to control such circumstances is a basic factor
      in assessing their performance in an emergency.       It is quite
      foreseeable in this Society's view to have made an identification
      of the requirement to control large numbers of people both within
      and immediately outside the environment of a football ground. No
t




        doubt this has been done, but it is equally important to look at
        the training as well as the numbers involved to control the
        potential hazards brought about not only by the large numbers
        involved, but of the timescales within which they have to be moved
        into and out of the ground.      Similarly, the quality and the
        training of supervision at all levels, including the most senior,
        needs to be assessed.

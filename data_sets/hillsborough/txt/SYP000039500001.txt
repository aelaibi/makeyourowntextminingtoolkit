                                   STATEMENT


Name:
Address:                     ' Liverpool
Occupation: Insurance Broker
Age   38 years                       D.O.B.



On the 15th April# 1989, I went to Hillsborough for the semi-final of
the F.A. Cup. I went with three friends#
and Brian Matthews. We all had tickets tor standing at the Leppings
Lane end of the ground.    The tickets cost £6.00 each and had been obtained
from the Anfield Season Ticket Allocation.


I drove the four of us down in my car..       We left Liverpool at 12.00 noon
and arrived at the ground at 2.00 p.m.     I parked in Bradfield Road: this
being the Nottingham Forrest supporters end of the ground, and was the
same place I parked for last years semi-final.       We arrived at Leppings
Lane at about 2.15 to 2.20 p.m. and noticed that there was quite a crowd
at the turnstile.    At this stage the crowd seemed to be out of control.
There were no orderly lines filtering to the ground and turnstiles.
One police horse outside was trying to control the crowd.       When we stood
with the crowd waiting to get in it became very uncomfortable. As
     ... ,                                 we decided to stand to one
was with us i
side to let the crowd get through. We stood next to the blue concertina
 gates.    The crowd did not abate, but got worse.    A lot of people were
 standing back to avoid the crush.    At this stage we could not get away.


 I am a regular attender at football-matches.      Normally the Police officers
 make people form lines using Police horses.      Merseyside Police never
 let such a situation arise outside the turnstiles.      I attended the semi-final
 the year before also held at Hillsborough and the Police were far better
 organised then.    The Police the year before prevented the crowds from
 developing around the turnstiles by filtering the crowds well before.
 This year there seemed to be no real organisation and certainly inadequate
 Police manning levels.


 The blue gates were being used by the Police inside the ground to eject
 people who shouldn't have been in the ground.       At one time when the gates
 were opened about 45 to 50 people rushed in.       This must have happened
^   about 2.40 to 2.45 p.m.    The reaction of the Police to this was to
try to clear people standing by the gates back into the crowd.        I thought
a Police horse was going to trample spectators and I saw a Policeman
punch a lad in the eye without provocation simply because he would not
move.    The Police were trying to move people into a more dangerous situation
than they were already in, and needless to say they would not move.
We would not move either.     When we refused to move the mounted Police
officer went charging his horse into the crowd.     This obviously did not
make things any better.


In my opinion there were not enough Police officers at the Leppings Lane
end to sort out the problem that had arisen.     It was apparent at 2.30
p.m. that we were not going to get into the ground for 3.00 p.m.
                                                                        ✓

At about 2.50 p.m. or thereabouts the blue concertina gates were opened
by two Police officers.       They said, "Alright lads, come in, in an orderly
fashion."    We walked in without pushing or shoving in an orderly fashion.
There was no one directing us once inside the gates.      The only obvious
entrance was the tunnel.      We just went to the nearest entrance.     It
was not at all obvious that we could filter out to the side terraces.


We went through the tunnel and as we came out on to the terraces, the
teams had just come out on to the pitch.      It must have been about 3 to
4 minutes to three.    We went through in the order of m y s e l f , ____
and Brian.


It was congested on the terraces.      This is quite usual; just before kick
off, I would expect it to be congested.      Once out of the tunnel, we tried
to move sideways to the right, pushing through the crowd.         was holding
on to me.    I do not know what happened to Brian after this.


About 2 minutes later the crush happened.      We had managed to push our
way to the right.     As I got further over to the right there was no more
space.    We had managed to get well over to the right, but did not realise
at the time that a 9 foot high spiked fence prevented us from going further.
I could see space to the right through the fence.       When we had got further
in we could feel the crush.      I saw a crash barrier to our right and tried
to get in front of it.     I was pulling      after me and      and presumably
Brian were behind her.     At this crash barrier the pressure was very bad;
it was coming not just from behind but from all around.      We managed to
move sideways to a second crash barrier until we got wedged tight.


People were screaming all around us.        There was still motion in the crowd;
a sort of twisting.     I got stuck at the barrier and         *nd        moved
passed behind me with this motion.      The three of us ended up pinned at
the barrier.     No one could move it was so crushed.      People were walking
on trapped spectators shoulders and heads to escape.         We were cramped
so much that they could not have fallen through. There were other people
sitting under the crash barrier where we were who could not stand up.
One man was screaming/ "My legs, my legs".        Other screams were to move
back and to the Police to open the gates.        One Police officerI shouted
to for help just held up his hand to express that he could not do anything.
I was in pain through being pinned on the crash barrier.         I managed
to lift myself up and sat on the barrier.        My feet were off the ground.
It felt like being in concrete which was constricting.         The pain was
so severe that I though I was going to die.        It was the most terrifying
experience of my life.     I was unable to move.


There was a noise which I can only assume was the first crash barrier
we had passed giving away.        When the barrier gave away, it released
some shoulder pressure and I managed to get over the 9ft fence which
was close by.     Spectators on the other side of the fence cupped their
hands through the fence to help me get over.        Two other spectators managed
to drag        out over the fence.


Eventually the Police recognised there were problems and the gates were
opened/ but the gates were so small that it took too long to get people
out.


It took me at least 10 minutes to recover enough from the crush to attempt
to find the others.     I found       and       fairly quickly, but we could
find no trace of Brian.


We watched the bodies being taken on to the pitch.        We were there until
4.30 p.m.    There were no loud speaker announcements until 4.30 when we
were told that we could leave the Stadium.        We then tried to find Brian
again.    I returned to the car to see if he had gone there.         When at 5.00p.m.
we still had not found him, we formally reported him missing to the Police.


At 5.30 p.m. the Police asked us to join them on the Police coach, and
   wece taken to Hammerton Police Station# Sheffield.       As there were
so many of us, they seconded a Boys' Club close by.


We then telephoned our families and I, as the representative of our group,
went to fill out a missing persons form on Brian.     We then tried telephoning
hospitals to try to find Brian.   We waited from 6.00 p.m. until 1.00
a.m. and then were taken to the sports hall being used as a mortuary
to identify Brian's body.


I was very shocked at what had happened, particularly the death of my
good friend.   Although I did not attend hospital on the day of the incident,

      We managed to move sideways to the next crash barrier untl

       people were screaming all around us.            .here was still - i o n in the crowd.
a sort of twisting.          bot stuck at the barrier and       and I moved
involuntarily passed behind him with this motion.     The three of us ended
up pinned at the barrier.     No one could move it was so crushed.    People
were walking on trapped spectators shoulders and heads to escape.       We
were cramped so much that they could not have fallen through.      One man
was screaming/ "My legs, my legs".     Other screams were to move back and
to the Police to open the gates.     One Police officer seemed to just hold
up his hand to express that he could not do anything.     A man had his
leg pinned across my hip and when I heard a dull crack/ I thought his
leg had broken.    The man was screaming/"my leg."    I was pinned double
over a crash barrier.    The pain was so severe that I though I was going
to die.   It was the most terrifying experience of my life.     I thought
we were being allowed to die in a football stadium without anyone doing
anything to help.     There was a noise which I can only assume was the
first crash barrier we had passed giving away.       When the barrier gave
away, it released some shoulder pressure and I managed to get over the
9ft fence which was close by.    Two supporters managed to get       out
over the fence.         was helped over by spectators on the other side
of the fence.


Throughout the preceding 10 minutes I had difficulty in breathing/ I
had severe bruises to my hips and pains in my chest.


The first Police officer to notice anything was wrong was a W.P.C. who
jumped up to the barrier and told people to push back.      Eventually the
Police recognised there were problems and the gates were opened.      The
gates were so small that it took too long to get people out.


It took me at least 10 minutes to recover enough from the crush.      I found
    and         almost immediately/ but we could find no trace of Brian.


We watched the bodies being taken on to the pitch.      We were there until
4.30 p.m.   There were no loud speaker announcements until 4.30 when we
were told that we could leave the Stadium.     We then tried to find Brian
again.          returned to the car to see if he had gone there.   When at
5.00p.m. we still had not found him, we formally reported him missing
to the Police.


At 5.30 p.m. the Police asked us to join them on the Police coach, and
we were taken to Hammerton Police Station, Sheffield.       As there were
   many of us, they seconded a Boys' Club close by.

We then telephoned our families and       Jrent to fill out a missing persons
form about Brian.   We then tried telephoning hospitals to try to find
Brian.   We waited from 6.00 p.m. until 1.00 a.m. and then were taken
to the sports hall being used as a mortuary to identify Brian's body.

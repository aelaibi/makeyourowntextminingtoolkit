 Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster,

 Dear Mr. Whalley,

       Further to your letter, I enclose publications from the Sir Norman
 Chester Centre which may be relevant to the Taylor Inquiry.  I have also
 written a short 'submission' which describes the work of the Centre and
 which provides some guidance to the enclosed reports.

       I hope this method of making submissions is acceptable. The Centre
 would like its material returned at some stage if that is possible.

                               Yours sincerely




                               John Williams
                               Co-Director.

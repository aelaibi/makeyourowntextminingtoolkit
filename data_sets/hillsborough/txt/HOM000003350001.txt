            1. We enclose copy of letter dated 16th June which we have
            received from                  which sets out their dealings
            with Mr.v Reddington (acting on behalf of the Hillsborough
            Disaster Appeal Trustees).

            2. What appears to us to be perfectly clear is that the
            Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trustees haD no idea how to
            approach this situation. They were frightened of making very
            large sums of money available in individual cases. They were
            not prepared to wait or to assess the needs of major victims




            4. As discussed with your secretary, the writer will meet you
            at your home at 4.30 pm on Friday 24th June to go together to
            see |                |
                                 .

            5. Finally, please find enclosed a copy of Alsop Wilkinson's
            letter of 20th May 1994 to you (together with a copy of our
            letter of 19th November 1992 to Alsop Wilkinson and their

    S T R I C T L Y P R IV A T E AND CONFIDENTIAL


   Dear Mr. Alton,

   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - Hillsborough Disaster Appeals
   Thank y ou for your letter of 13th May. Could I say at the outset that the plight
      the          family has been a matter of great sympathy on the part of the
   Trustees.I


   to treasons which wi 11 appear later in this letter this particular case has not
   been an easy one for the Trustees.

  As background material I am enclosing the published Reports and Accounts of the
  Hillsborough Fund, copies of the original Trust Deeds of the Disaster Appeal
  Discretionary Trust and Charitable Trust and a copy of a paper written by my
  partner, Donald Mason, and Michael Reddington, our Trust Fund Manager, who will be
  known to you, and George Tasker on the Setting Up and Operation of the Hillsborough
  Disaster Appeal Funds. From these you will see first of all that there were two
  funds, one a discretionary fund and one a charitable fund. The advantage of having
  the discretionary fund was that the Trustees had a complete discretion as to who
  should benefit and how they should benefit. They were not constrained by charity
  law or required to distribute their funds according to the principles relating to
  compensation for injury. It was to this fund that over £11.7 m i 11ion was donated
  and all of this has been paid to, or for the benefit of, the bereaved and injured.
  The Trustees were told that it would be necessary to establish a charitable fund
  as well because certain donors, e.g. other charities, would either have to, or wish
  to, give donations for strictly charitable purposes. Such proved to be the case.

Not all the charitable funds have yet been distributed but they must be held for
charitable purposes which the law defines as the advancement of religion or
education, the relief of poverty and other purposes beneficial to the Community.
Except in cases where poverty can be established charitable funds cannot be paid
to the bereaved and injured.
On points 1 to 4 of your letter the information you require is contained in t h A
reports. On point 5, there are no funds left in the Discretionary Fund of t h ^ ^
Disaster Appeal because they have all been distributed to the bereaved and injured.
As stated not all funds have been distributed out of the Charitable Trust.         I
should, however, say that the grants which have been, as you will see from the 1992
report, made, amongst others, to the Liverpool John Moores University for the
purpose of establishing memorial bursaries, have been made out of the Charitable
Trust and not out of the Discretionary Fund of the Disaster Appeal.        (To that
extent, the leaflet which you sent to me is slightly, though not materially,
misleading). I hope that the remark about the University in your letter does not
imply that you think that the Trustees' decision to support young persons at the
Liverpool John Moores University was misconceived. If that were the case, I would
strongly refute it.
On point 6 in your letter the principles of operation and distribution were
established by the Trustees in relation to the Discretionary Trust and published
by them in their reports. Briefly these principles have been:-
1     the distribution of the fund would reflect the fact that there had been
      unequal suffering and hardship and it would not therefore simply be a
      question of making an equal distribution to all those affected;
2     payments should be made by way of capital sums rather than by making
      continuing income payments over a number of years;
3     payments should be made to beneficiaries as quickly as possible;
4     the names of persons to whom distributions were made should not be divulged;
5     amounts paid to individuals or categories of persons should also not be
      divulged;
6     since it would be impossible for the Trustees personally to see all the
      beneficiaries it was agreed that they should not see any of them.
Contact with the prospective beneficiaries was achieved through the Trust Fund
Manager and a team of assessors and in the case of the injured the Trustees
appointed a medical assessment panel of three distinguished consultants to advise
them.

The Trust Fund Manager has also, from time to time been willing to see
representative groups such as the Family Support Group. In                    1s case
I know that he had a meeting with the solicitors involved (E. Rex Makin & Co.) and
the Trustees also considered written representations which were made by E. Rex
Makin & Co. They therefore felt that they had all the facts relating t o p
       w h i ch were necessary to enable them to come to a decision about what shou Id
be paid to                        |.The Trustees also had as much information as they
felt they needed inre lation to the other bereaved and injured.
Where there were incapacitated beneficiaries or beneficiaries who were vulnerable
or under age the       Trustees sought to protect those beneficiaries by the
establishment of individual Trust Funds. Two extracts from the Mason/Reddington/
Tasker Paper are relevant:-
      "Many of those affected had sought and were receiving legal advice so
      that numerous solicitors could find themselves having to create trusts
      which might or might not have been found acceptable by the Main Fund
      trustees. To avoid this situation the trustees arranged for precedent
      accumulation and maintenance and interest in possession trust drafts
      to be prepared which were then offered to the lawyers acting for the
      potential beneficiaries. This saved the wheel being re-invented a
      hundred times over."
      "The trustees were conscious that as a result of the tragedy, there
      could be claims for damages against any held to be responsible.
      Practitioners will be aware that when such awards are made for
      infants, the proceeds are paid into court for the benefit of the
      claimant. It seemed to the trustees that this would be an unnecessary
      duplication if there was already an appropriate trust vehicle in
      existence capable of receiving any such awards. Clearly the court
      would have to approve the draft precedent trust deeds the Main Fund
      trustees were intending to create. An application was made and the
      judge, after calling for the counsel to appear before him, concurred."
The case of               was one where the co-operation of the legal advisers was
not forthcoming.     All other legal advisers gladly accepted the Trustees'
initiative. The Trustees were never able to fathom the reason for this non-co-
operative attitude but had to accept it as a fact. For the reasons set out in our
principles of operation I am not a b le to tell you to whom we eventually made
payments in respect of                nor their amounts.
Your letter mentions the amount recoverable in the compensation claim on which I
would make two comments. First, the Trustees were advised not to base their method
of distribution upon the law relating to compensation for personal injury or death.
If they had they would not have been able to make substantial payments to many of
the bereaved which they felt would not have been in accord with the donors' wishes.

            Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trust




            The way in which the task of distributing monies from the
            Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trust has been undertaken can,
            clearly, be considered unreasonable if one applies 'Wednesbury
            principles' and, accordingly it may well constitute a breach
            of trust.

            We understand from page 5 of the Liverpool Echo of Wednesday
            18th November that there is still some £700,000 available to
            the Trustees.

            We  reiterate what,    unfortunately, appears  to have   been
            repeatedly ignored by you (see for example your letter to us
            of 4th December 1991) that there are matters and needs which
            still need to be considered and properly acted upon to fulfil
            the obligations which exist for                     |
                                                                »




             Having regard to our dealings with the Court of Protection and
             a consultation with Leading Counsel earlier this week it seems
             likely  that  specialist Junior Counsel will      have  to  be
             instructed to ensure that             position is safeguarded
             from the failings of the Trustees ana their advisers.   Claims
             for breach of trust and/or negligence may well have to be
             brought.


                                                                                 1

           can not allow a situation In which ^ there is a
shortfall between 1       I's requirements and the resources
available to meet them (which was and maybe still is avoidable
having regard to the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trust) to
occur when such a situation could and should be redressed.

Please will you acknowledge receipt of this letter which is
written to you acting for and on behalf of all and each of the
Trustees  (collectively arid individually)    and in your own

                THE USE OF TRUSTS IN DISASTER APPEALS

                         THE HILLSBOROUGH EXPERIENCE


The Liverpool Branch o f STEP met on October 29, 1991, to hear a presentation on the use o f trusts in disaster
appeals based on the experience gained in relation to the tragic events at Hillsborough. The following is a
summary o f the talks by Donald Mason (Part 1) and Michael Reddington (Part 2). The note and the footnotes
were prepared by George Tasker.

Dear Mr. Morris,



I am writing to you on behalf of my above constituent whom you will
appreciate was I




^            I             shall be grateful if you will deal with the
following points

1.   Previously what funds were collected and what interest/income was
earned thereon (i.e., the total funds)?

2.   What charges, expenses and other deductions had been met out of the
total funds (please provide a detailed breakdown)?

3.   What funds have been allocated to victims of the disaster and their
families?

4.   What funds have been allocated elsewhere (please provide specific
details)?

5.   What funds are still available and how are they likely to be
allocated? (I enclose leaflet Issued by the Liverpool John Moores
University which does not relate to vicims of the Hillsborough
Disaster).
6.   How has the need of victims such as                           been
assessed? What consideration was given to immediate needs, short term
needs and what has been and will be done about        long term needs?
Please let me know precisely what information you have gathered and are
proposing to gather and let me know how this is to be considered?




I am extremely concerned that the real purposes of the collection of the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trust are not going to be fulfilled if
l'        needs are not fully met because of a shortfall in funding. The
vnstnfisn of sums expended to date (approaching half a million pounds),
the nmount likely to be legally recoverable in the compensation claim,
 the future needs, the uncertainties and contingencies hnvyp all caused
and continue to cause great anxiety to                        and I look
 forward to hearing from you with regard thereto as soon as possible.

From all the accounts which I have heard about the courage and fortitude
of the 1       family, I can only say that X have huge admiration for
them and hope that you will bring this matter to a speedy conclusion.

Yours sincerely,




DAVID ALTON HP

Not all the charitable funds have yet been distributed but they must be held for
charitable purposes which the law defines as the advancement of religion or
education, the relief of poverty and other purposes beneficial to the Community.
Except in cases where poverty can be established charitable funds cannot be paid
to the bereaved and injured.
On points 1 to 4 of your letter the information you require is contained in the
reports. On point 5, there are no funds left in the Discretionary Fund of t h e ^
Disaster Appeal because they have all been distributed to the bereaved and i n j u r e d ^
As stated not all funds have been distributed o y > o f the Charitable Trust;          I
should, however, say that the grants which have Bfeen, as you will see from the 1992
report, made, amongst others, to the Liverpool John Moores U n Y etrhV ryhaH t a b l e
purpose of establishing memorial bursaries, have been made out of the Charitable
Trust and not out of the Discretionary Fund of the Disaster Appeal.         (To that
extent, the leaflet which you sent to me is slightly, though not• ™ ateria JJ:
misleading). I hope .that the remark about the University in your letter does not
 imply that you think that the Trustees' decision to support young[persons at the
Liverpool John Moores University was misconceived. If that were the case, I would
 strongly refute it.
On point 6 in your letter the principles of operation and distribution were
established by the Trustees in relation to the Discretionary Trust and published
by them in their reports. Briefly these principles have been:-
 1     the distribution of the fund would reflect the fact that there had been
       unequal suffering and hardship and it would not therefore simply be a
       question of making an equal distribution to all those affected;
 2     payments should be made by way of capital sums rather than by making
       continuing income payments over a number of years;
 3     payments should be made to beneficiaries as quickly as possible;
 4     the names of persons to whom (distributions were made should not be divulged;
 5     amounts paid to individuals or categories of persons should also not be
        divulged;
 6     since it would be impossible for the Trustees p e r s o n a l l y to see all the
        beneficiaries it was agreed that they should not see any of them.
 Contact with the prospective beneficiaries was achieved through the Trust Fund
 Manager and a team of assessors and in the case of the injuru - ntQ        adJise
 appointed a medical assessment panel of three distinguished consultants to advise
 them.

The Trust Fund Manager has also, from time to time been willing to see
representative groups such as the Family Support Group. In 1                   |s case
I know that he had a meeting with the solicitors involved (E. Rex Makin & Co.) and
the Trustees also considered written representations which were made by E. Rex
Makin & Co. They therefore felt that they had all the facts relating to j ' I
       w h i ch were necessary to enable them to come to a decision about what should
be paid to                         The Trustees also had as much information as they
felt they needed in relation to the other bereaved and injured.
Where there were incapacitated beneficiaries or beneficiaries who were vulnerable
or under age the Trustees sought to protSfet those beneficiaries by the
establishment of individual Trust Funds. Two extracts from the Mason/Reddington/
Tasker Paper are relevant:-
      "Many of those affected had sought and were receiving legal advice so
      that numerous solicitors could find themselves having to create trusts
      which might or might not have been found acceptable by the Main Fund
      trustees. To avoid this situation the trustees arranged for precedent
      accumulation and maintenance and interest in possession trust drafts
      to be prepared which were then offered to the lawyers acting for the
      potential beneficiaries. This saved the wheel being re-invented a
      hundred times over."

      "The trustees were conscious that as a result of the tragedy, there
      could be claims for damages against any held to be responsible.
      Practitioners will be aware that when such awards are made for
      infants, the proceeds are paid into court for the benefit of the
      claimant. It seemed to the trustees that this would be an unnecessary
      duplication if there was already an appropriate trust vehicle in
      existence capable of receiving any such awards. Clearly the court
      would have to approve the draft precedent trust deeds the Main Fund
      trustees were intending to create. An application was made and the
      judge, after calling for the counsel to appear before him, concurred."
The case of              Iwas one where the co-operation of the legal advisers was
not forthcoming.     All other legal advisers gladly accepted the Trustees'
initiative. The Trustees were never able to fathom the reason for this non-co-
operative attitude but had to accept it as a fact. For the reasons set out in our
principles of operation I am not a b le to tell you to whom we eventually made
payments in respect of                nor their amounts.
Your letter mentions the amount recoverable in the compensation claim on which I
would make two comments. First, the Trustees were advised not to base their method
of distribution upon the law relating to compensation for personal injury or death.
If they had they would not have been able to make substantial payments to many of
the bereaved which they felt would not have been in accord with the donors' wishes.

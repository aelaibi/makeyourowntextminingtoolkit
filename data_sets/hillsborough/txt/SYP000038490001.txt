                                  The attached correspondence from
                                                  Wirral, addresses the Hillsborougn
                          Disasterin generalterms and does not specifically
                          involve Merseyside Police.  Similar correspondence has
                          been previously dealt with by the West Midlands Police

                                   I therefore suggest that the correspondence be
                           forwarded to Knowsley Hall, for the attention of the
                           enquiry team.

        Liverpool Police.

Sir,

This letter is in continuation of the one dated the l4|h and is occasioned by my having
received support from people who thin£,as I do, about Hillsborou^i particularly as we
now know that the Police are to launch a full crinriwa-l enquiry into the disaster.
In this maps, enquiry the Police are to take evidence to establish if there are grounds
for possible manslaughter charges against individuals*,charges which, if proven, could
lead to life imprisonment. Furthermore, according to the Telegraph of the I8th, the
Officer deputed to conduct the investigation has stated that the criminal enquiry
will report every potential offence from manslaughter to failure to carry out duties*
The situation has, therefore now changed^in that far from being an ordinary Saturday's
tour of duty at a Soccer match it has, now, escaieted into something as a result of
which ai police Officer could face life imprisonment. And it is in this context, Sir,
that you entertain the misgivings expressed by me/Ln my first letter.

I have attached a letter written by Mr Grayspn (a champion of the World of Sport who
has, in the past dwelt or given expression to a chapter of misgivings about various
aspects of the Generic Term SPORT) to the Editor of the Telegraph and published in its
issue of the 7th August. You will see that he states that the unspoken cause for the
disaster transcends any police culpability. He blames Football Authorities and the
Parliaments of the last 60 years, beeause they have failed to implament the recommend­
ations made by Investigators in their findings on some 5 incidents on ground control
problems. He has concluded and quite rightly so, that unless Football Authorities and
Governments look at their responsibilities for all the terrace deaths since 194-6,there
is little hope that a disaster, similar to Hillsborough, willi NOT recur. And, lastly,
we have the Home Secretary (Jaccording to the Telegraph, of the 5th) stating that most
 of the problems which caused Britain's worst catastrophe had been identified previously
and that the disaster need not have happened if the Police,ai M M M g f c t a amongst
 others, had acted on lessons of previous crowd safety blunders.

The South Yorkshire Police will NEVER, repeat NEVER live down the severe criticism
levelled at it in the Taylor Report. It is in this context, therefore, that you should
study the contents of an article (published by the Suhday Telegrapii of the 6th) and
attached to this letter. "Don't blame the police for Hillsborou#”. You will see who
the writer has.identified as the villain of the piece .viz the tieketlesa element,
some of whom drunk. We have read/heord a hell ©f a lot ©f the EFFECTS of the disaster
but little about the CAUSE, Is'nt that what I©r&Justice Taylor shoyld have considered
at greater length ? The Telegraph reports that the Sec. of the Victxais Group
Devonsihire    states, on the Investigation Report and Mr Wright's resignation (not
accepted bybthe local Police Committee) that 'jUstita nnkst be seen to be done*. A very
 emotive statement but what does he mea* by that ? Would Mr ftigjifs leaving his Office
bring about thebetum of the dead. Then Mr Hicks on T? states mush the same though he
welcomes the investigation into all aspects of the disaster and we have
 condemning fee decision to have Police conducting an investigation into the Police*
He, Sir, by so doing implies that the inquiry will be biased; a white wash. What does
 underly all thfts^tatements ? Compensation, as if money will bring back the dead
 Reprehensible, to say the least. Yes, if the amounts awarded by a Court,
 Z be given to an Old Persons Home, to a Hospital, it would be a salute t® the dead.

 Finally, I had offered a comment on the ID scheme. Take                            co^is^ceofwtot
 Mr Grayson has stated, viz that the Government shouldJ 02 p
 potentially dakgerous ID Scheme, it beingin reality, a Sicense t o e n t e r a g r o u i d and
 NOT a true Membership scheme known to law. Sir, you have the n^it to ignore wha
 have pleaded you to do, but you are NOT entitled 1jo place the earners <|f your
 Officers at risk.

Copy of an article publidied by the Sunday Telegraph in its issue dated 6 August.


It would be outrageous if any Sheffield Policeman were to be made to stand trial for

any o|fence connected with the Hillsborou^i disaster. Lord Taylor's interim report on

the events of that Saturday afternoon is one of the sorriest public documents of our
                                                                                 01

time. Indeed, only our time could have produced itt a time Mie^figures of authority are

ever on hand to absolve the violent, unruly and uneducated from responsibility for

their own condition o*"behaviour.
The report concedes that somefans at Hillsborough were drunknand arrived at the gates

only a j&ort timebefore the kick-off, but surprisingly minimise their number. Yet Lord

Taylor decided that unruliness among fans - ox the prospect of it - did Not cause the

disaster.
But NO single thing did cause it. A whole way of life did , complacent football author­

 ities, and inadequate grounds, but above all thereputation among fans for violence and

 irrationality. For *at other entertainment do spgctators arrive without tickets,

 get drunk and assume they will somehow gain admittance, often without paying ? Ihen

 disaster strikes in such conditions, police inadequacy - in the face of a rabble who

 came from a city.
 The Police were faced with the dioice of opening the gates, or risking disorder «utside

  m e ground. We all know now that they made the wrong dioice. But which ol us can say

  that we could have foretold the ni#tmare consequences ? An error of judgement is HOT

  a criminal offence, especial* * e n it is ^ d e amid a » s s of youths some of *ose

  criminal again,

   city. But a city does not have a single voice. Plenty of L iv erp u d lia n s despise the

   With reference to your recent communication to the Chief Constable of Liverpool

   I have noted the contents of your letter concerning the criminal enquiry and
   newspaper articles and have forwarded the same to Lord Justice Taylor’s Office.

   If you have any further information you can write to the Secretary of the
   Inquiry as below:-

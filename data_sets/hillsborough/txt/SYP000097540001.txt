ADM/1
                        THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UP-DATE II

         TO:   Officers of the South Yorkshire Police submitting evidence
               to the West Midlands Police in connection with the Public
               Inquiry into the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium


    Hammond Suddards, Solicitors, are acting on behalf of the South Yorkshire
    Police in the preparation and presentation of evidence to be submitted to the
    Inquiry.

    As part of this process the firm initially requested that all officers
    directly concerned should, as soon as possible, prepare a note of their
    recollections, in the form of a statement, including matters of comment and
    impression, whether or not this amounted to evidence.

    These accounts are of immense value to our Counsel.

Subsequently, the South Yorkshire Police were advised by the West Midlands
Police that it would be appreciated if South Yorkshire Police officers, who
were at Hillsborough, could effectively prepare their own factual statements
for submission to the Inquiry.  This was agreed and the obvious way of
proceeding was to look at the statements which had been initially prepared at
our request, on the basis that if matters of hearsay and comment could be
removed, these would be suitable as the factual statements requested by the
West Midlands Police.

Some officers have expressed concern about alterations being made to their
original statements prior to submission to the West Midlands Police.

What must be kept in mind is that the statements for submission to our own
Counsel were intended to have an entirely different purpose to those submitted
to the West Midlands Police.

The initial Reports    submitted contained a mixture of fact, conjecture and
opinion.  In editing them for use.as a factual statement by the Inquiry it has
been necessary for the solicitors to remove conjecture and opinion and to leave
only matters of fact.

All statements which are submitted to the Inquiry may be taken into account in
reaching conclusions, whether or not the officer making the statement is
called as a witness.  It follows that the statements must contain only direct
factual observations, as'opposed to matters of impression.

No amended statement will be submitted to the West Midlands Police until it
has been seen, approved and signed by the officer making it.

                  SUBJECT:       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



                      On the 22 May an update in respect of the Hillsborough Inquiry was
                      forwarded for your information and in order that it may be brought
                      to the attention of all other members of the force.

                      In particular, reference was made to officers who, for one reason
                      or another, may be people the Inquiry would wish to hear from,
                      their names being appended on a schedule.

                      I wish to affirm that the update was for the information of every­
                      one, and the comments contained therein should be disseminated to
                      all officers on your division not merely those named in the
                      appendices.

                      I am advised that some officers have expressed concern regarding
                      the editing of their original statements prior to submission to
                      the West Midlands Police.  The attached circular explains fully
                      the reasons for this course of action and should be brought to
                      the attention of all your officers.

Personnel Overheads:   Travel and Subsistence


The first quarter figure of £15,000 reflects the amount of money
advanced by way of imprest to Home Office staff (approx. £13,000)
and that actually paid to the Judge and his clerk (approx.
£2,000).   Further claims relating to the period in Sheffield will
be paid during the second quarter.


2.   The third quarter figure reflects the likelihood of
increased travel (including overseas) during the course of
research for Part II of the Inquiry, for which an examination of
a number of stadia in a number of countries may be required.

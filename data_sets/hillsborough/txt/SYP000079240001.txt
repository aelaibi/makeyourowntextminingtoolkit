             more    tense.          The    only Police           presence     I saw were        four    policemen on

             horses       c ontrolling        the     crowd.        I also     saw some O f f icers          on foot

             I did witness            a number        of Liverpool          fans    drinking        from beer       cans

             Beca u s e      the    crowd was so vast                              and myself       deci d e d that        it

             would     be a waste           of time        trying    to gain e ntry at the Leppings                      Ln end

             so we went            right a ro u n d    the ground behind             the S o u t h stand,          using    the

             public       roads and ga i n e d         entry to the S o u t h S t a n d via the Spion

             H o p End.        There was        no trouble          getting     into    the ground at this                end

             We took         up our     seats at about             one minute       to three        o ' c l o c W e

             were    sitting         just    below     the Police Control              Box    in the South S t a n d near

             to   pen number.           I could       see straight away             that     there were       problems

             u nd er n e a t h the West Stand.                1 didn't        know what was wrong             but    I knew

             that    pens 3 and 4 were                c o mpletly full w h e r e a s         pens    i, 2,    6 and 7 had a

             1 ot of      room      in t h e m .

             A bo u t 3 minu t e s after            the kick        off    I saw a movem e n t        of the       crowd    in
 CAT
6 e a &*J    pen 3.          I thought at the              time    that    it might     have     been a barrier
bmiet        breaking.             1 saw that a s ec t i o n of the             crowd sort of went                forward
%/vj3
             lopsided.             I don't    think man y          people were w a t c h i n g       the game       they were

             w a t ch in g    the    c o mmotion      in pens 3 and 4.              1 have me n t i o n e d

             that a S ec t i o n of the             crowd moved           forward when         I thought          that     a

             barrier         may have       broken.         I should, like         to add      that this was part               of a

             bigger       surge      that    seemed        to have     come    from the        back.       I would         say that

             it came         from the       tunnel     area.        I c o u l d n ’t tell      if a n y b o d y    had     fallen

             down at this            stage.

             After     this        I saw    people     being       carried over        the    fences     onto the         pitch.

             I coul d t e 11 that            so rne ha d 1 o s t t h e i r 3.i ves,          I ca n t d e s c r i b e any t h i n g

             I saw,       there was a lot             of    confusion at the           time.

             I know that whe n              it s ta r t e d the Police          reaction was          to keep the          fans

             in the       pens.        I can only          think    that   they thought          they were         dealing

                                                                                                             S2350

              w i th a disorder         situation.          W hen the    group was     stopped      they   realized

              that    s o m ething   drastic      had happened.           It a p p e a r e d that   nobody at

              first     u nd er st oo d the     g ra v i t y of the     situation.

              In my o pin i o n the       s i t u at io n   lacked Police      s u p e r v i s i o n at the L.epping•

              Ln End.         I think    that    the s it ua t i o n was a d d e d   to by the       late arrival

              of the      fans at the ground.

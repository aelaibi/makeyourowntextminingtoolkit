      SCHEDULE OF COMPT-ATNTS


(1)   Anthony Dennis LEIGH

      Together with other supporters Mr LEIGH says he shouted at a
      policeman walking along the perimeter track to open the perimeter
      gate to let them out. The police officer turned to the
      supporters and appeared to mouth the words "shut up you
      dickheads". Mr LEIGH feels this officer should have helped him
      and the other supporters.


 (2) Edward SPEARRITT

      He failed to open gate 4 in the perimeter fence despite his (Mr
      SPEARRITT) loud appeals directed at him, his position being in
      close proximity to him and, as a result his failure to act had a
      direct bearing on the death of his son and injuries to himself.
CIRCUMSTANCES PRECEDING COMPLAINT



R1   On Saturday, 15 April 1989 a Football

Association Cup Semi-Final match was to be played

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football

Clubs at Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium,

Hillsborough, Sheffield.




R2   It is a matter of record that there was

serious overcrowding at the match and that shortly

after kick off at 1500 hours, the game was

abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and 4 of the

West Stand terraces.   As a result of the

overcrowding and crushing 95 supporters died and

some 730 received injuries.




R3   Following the disaster Mr G J DEAR, QPM,

Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

appointed' to investigate and collate evidence for

HM Coroner for Sheffield (West District) and for a

Judicial Inquiry which was conducted by Lord

Justice TAYLOR.




R4   On 27 September 1989 responsibility for the

criminal investigation arising from the

Hillsborough disaster, together with all complaint
                  and disciplinary matters was also passed to Mr

                  DEAR.    With effect from 1 April 1990 these

                  responsibilities were transferred to Mr L SHARP,

                  QPM, Chief Constable of the Cumbria Constabulary.




                  CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION




                  R5      As a result of this disaster a full file of

Parts I - VII     evidence was submitted to the Director of Public

Main File         Prosecutions and to the Police Complaints

                  Authority.




                  R6      The nature of the complaints made against

                  Police Constable 417 ILLINGWORTH by the

                  complainants LEIGH and SPEARRITT form part of the

                  evidence submitted to the Director of Public

                  Prosecutions for consideration of whether to

                  prosecute Police Constable ILLINGWORTH for

                  Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance.




Main File         R7      The interview with Police Constable

Part 7            ILLINGWORTH for these alleged criminal offences was

                          unidentified police officers with regard to being

                          thrown against some hoardings on the pitch.      A

                          separate file has been submitted in relation to

                          this complaint.




                          R15     He did also make a specific allegation

                          concerning the Police Constable at gate 4 to the

                          Leppings Lane terraces.




                          R16     The specific allegations made by Mr LEIGH are:,

                          as follows




                                                                                    8
      Together with other supporters Mr LEIGH says

      he shouted at a policeman walking along the

      perimeter track to open the perimeter gate to

      let them out.   The police officer turned to

      the supporters and appeared to mouth the

      words "shut up you dickheads".     Mr LEIGH

      feels this officer should have helped him and

      the other supporters.




R17   Two possible disciplinary offences are

evident in the allegation and they are;-




(A)   NEGLECT OF BUTT, by failing to open the

      perimeter gate and release Mr LEIGH and other

      supporters.




      (Contrary to The Police (Discipline)

      Regulations 1985. Regulation 5,

      Schedule 1. 4(a).




This forms part of the evidence submitted to the

Director of Public Prosecutions who is considering

criminal offences against the officer of

Manslaughter and Culpable Malfeasance.
R18   The evidence required to consider

Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

negligence or recklessness and there is no

comparable discipline offence to consider.




R19   However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

although it is based upon the same evidence, it

requires a lesser degree of negligence or

recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.

Should the Director of Public Prosecutions decide

that there is insufficient evidence to prove the

offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

no further action can be taken in respect of the

Disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.




(B)   ABUSE OP AUTHORITY, by using offensive and

      dismissive language he was uncivil to a

      member of the public.




      (Contrary to The Police (Discipline)

      Regulations 1985. Regulation 5.

      Schedule 1 (8c).




This allegation can be considered separate to any

criminal matters and stands alone for

consideration.
                          R2Q   It is important to assess the actual

Statement Pages 10 - 12   allegation made by Mr LEIGH in his statement

                          of complaint made on 10 October 1989,      Mr LEIGH

                          cannot be definite about the words allegedly used

                          by Police Constable ILLINGWORTH because he used the

                          phrase, "seemed to mouth, ’Shut up you dickheads’,"




                          R21   The doubt is compounded in an earlier
                                                                                       :

                                "Eventually he turned and mouthed some words

                                which appeared to me to be offensive and

                                dismissive.   I believe that what he was

                                mouthing was shut up you dickheads, or

                                something along those lines."                          i

                          it may well be the case at that time he felt

                          familiar with the term alleged.

                is almost 43 years of age, being born on

                has performed all his police service in the

                Sheffield area serving at Attercliffe and West Bar

                Sub Divisions on D (Sheffield Central) Division

                until he transferred to F (Sheffield North)

                Division on 1 June 1987.   All his service has been
on uniformed patrol duties with the exception of a

period between December 1980 and October 1982 when

he performed plain clothes duty in the city centre

dealing with licensing matters and as an aide to

CID.   He is currently posted to Community Constable

duties.




R38    He has no similar previous disciplinary

matters recorded against him and has been commended

once by the Courts for courage, vigilance and

tenacity during an arrest.




M J Foster

Detective Chief Superintendent 6930
CONCLUSION




R38   Currently, the Director of Public

Prosecutions is considering the two possible

offences of Manslaughter and Culpable Malfeasance.

These are alternative criminal offences and the

latter covers the disciplinary offence of neglect

of duty.     Should the Director decide that there is

insufficient evidence to prosecute for Culpable

Malfeasance then it will not be appropriate to

pursue a disciplinary charge of Neglect of Duty.




R39   In that case the complaint made by Mr

SPEARRITT is unsubstantiated, and so is that part

of Mr LEIGH’s complaint which relates to Police

Constable ILLINGWORTH’S alleged failure to help him

and other supporters.
                             j



R40   That leaves only the complaint of Abuse of

Authority made by Mr LEIGH.




R41   The complainant cannot be sure of the actual

words used and formed only an impression of what

they were.    I place no great emphasis on the fact

that Mr LEIGH made no mention of the offensive

conduct either in his original questionnaire nor
in his statement of recollection, because in a

statement made by Mr LEIGH to his solicitor, he is

quite clear in his own mind that Police Constable

ILLINGWORTH said something which he believes to

have been offensive.   This belief was reiterated in

his statement of complaint.




R42   However, there is no evidence to resolve the

doubts expressed by Mr LEIGH as to the words used

by Police Constable ILLINGWORTH.   The officer

denies using them and there is no way of resolving

the matter satisfactorily




R43   Whilst I am satisfied that it is possible to

prove that the officer referred to by Mr LEIGH is

Police Constable ILLINGWORTH, it is not possible to

prove the use of any offensive or dismissive

language by that officer.




R44   The complaint is therefore unsubstantiated.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION



1    A vast amount of statements and documents

have been submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions and to the Police Complaints

Authority.




2    Although in that main file of evidence there

is the evidence to consider the allegation against

Police Constable ILLINGWORTH it is necessary to

provide a more precise and identifiable list of

those witnesses that have a direct bearing on the

complaints made by Mr LEIGH and Mr SPEARRITT.




3    Of the supporters in Pen 4 on 15 April 1989

637 provided questionnaires only.    These have not

been submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions or Police Complaints Authority but are

available for inspection.




4    A further 240 supporters completed both a

questionnaire and a statement and a further 217

made statements only.    Of these 45 statements have

been included in the report to the Director of

Public Prosecutions and the Police Complaints

Authority and the remainder are available for
reading if required.   A list of those supporters

incorporated in the file is attached showing where

they can be found in the main file.




5     In addition it is felt that certain police

officers, stewards, media people and ground staff

in the vicinity of Pens 3 and 4 provide material

evidence relevant to these specific complaints and

similar identifiable lists of those witnesses are

attached to assist.

           I am a single man living at the above address with my ccranon law

        wife,                                           I am enployed as a tyre

           fitter.     I am a Liverpool supporter and have been nearly all my

        life.        I am not a member of the Liverpool supporters club.      I have

        attended only Four games this season, the game at Hillsborough would

        have been my fifth.          On Friday 14th April 1989 (140489) my father,

                                                   gave me a ticket for the North

        Stand.       The ticket was for seat 100, row 'T'. The ticket was a sort

        of present for my birthday.         The cost of the ticket was #14.    On

        Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I left hone about twenty five to

        seven (0635) in the morning.          I went to the Crescent Garage on the

        Liverpool Road, Huyton with                          I'm afraid I don't know

        his address.       We waited about five minutes for              brother,

                                          Road, Huyton to turn up but he did not.      We

        then walked to       his       house andknocked him up.   We he came out we

        walked back to       the       LiverpoolRoad and waited for a bus.    We caughtthe

        No 10 bus intoLyme Street.           We then made our way into the station and

        caught the 0816 to Manchester.         The ticket cost #11 return.    On the




                                                                                             1

train there was quite a few other supporters. On the train it was

packed and it was a bit rowdy.       On the train there was a few cans of

beer but I did not have any myself.         At Manchester we got off the

train onto platform.     The platform was either 4 or 8.     As we mingled

around on the platform with all the other supporters me mate,

brought a ticket for the game.       The ticket was for 'B' turnstile at

the Leppings Lane end of the ground.              paid for #14 for the

ticket off another fan.     On this platform I met two other kids I've

never seen before.     One was called            The other was           We

had a cup of coffee whilst waiting for the train to cone in on the

other side of the platform.       After about 10 minutes the train to

Sheffield came in. Before the train came in there was an announcement

saying the Sheffield train was delayed.        When it came in all five of

us got on the train.    The train was supposed to stop at various

stations to Sheffield but just after we moved off there was an

announcement on the train saying it would step at the next station and

then it would go straight through to Sheffield.        The train stopped and

numerous people got off.     The train carried on but there was no

excessive noise or shouting.      There were still several people around

with a few cans of beer but no drunkeness, it was a bit early.         At

Sheffield we got off the train and went into the walkway, there was

about 40 or 50 of us that got off the train.        At the ticket barrier we

were stopped by sane Policeman who wouldn't let us through.

Eventually a couple of coppers came and shepparded us from the ticket

office to another exit.     We were made to wait for about 20 minutes.

There was lots of coppers about and then a double decker bus came and

the Policeman made vis get on it.     There was no other way we were going

to leave the station.     We paid a pound for a return ticket.      The bus

took vis to Leppings Lane and we were allowed to get out.        Hie time was
LEIGH                   ANTHONY    DENNIS


about eleven (1100) or just after. The five of us joined up again and

we tried to get          |a ticket. We went up to the ticket office at

the ground but it was shut.       The coppers made us go back.   We then

turned around and got some bacon butties from a shop.        We then walked

up a hill to a little pub, the Horse and Jockey.        The pub was packed

inside and out with about five hundred outside.        We only had three

bottles of Pills, that's all we could get.       The fans were just singing.

The time we got to the pub was about twelve to quarter p>ast twelve

(1200 to 1215).     I had to queue for 1.1/2 hrs to get served,

got his ticket for the Leppings Lane End.       I swopped my ticket with a

   late called           , I left the pub with my mates about ten past

two (1410). Nearly all the fans at the pub left at the same time.          We

walked down to the ground getting there about two-fifty.         (1450)   When

we reached the Leppings Lane end it was just one mass of people, there

were several hundred there.       I saw no policeman about or any stewards.

The only policeman who turned up was a mounted one whom I know cones

fran Liverpool.     He has got silver hair and moustache.     I've seen him

on the television since it happened, he's visually at the cop end.

The ticket I now had was the same of my mates.       We all made our way to

'B' turnstile. We got though the crowd with sane jostling.         I went

through the turnstile first, followed by my mates.        I wasn't searched

but my mates were.     I did not see anyone outside the ground drinking

anything.    From where we got in you could see the ground through the

tunnel.     I did not see any Policeman or stewards.    All five of us

went through the tunnel and we went into Pen 4.        In the tunnel it was

very busy but there were no hold ups.       At the end of the tunnel there

was no stewards to be seen.       We all went to the left hand side

between a crash barrier and the side fence.       I stood there singing

and chanting like any normal game.      At this time we were all packed
LEIGH                  ANTHONY   DENNIS


but it was not uncomfortable. I heard them announce the teams and

then it started, everything was getting tighter, more packed.         All of

vis got split up by an almighty sway forward.      I then realised it

wasn't normal, you couldn't move, you couldn't even get your arms

out.     I saw a little lad facing the tunnel with his head over it and

his backed pressed against it, he was going under.       I nudged him and

talked to him.    I then saw next to him another man get pressed

against the barrier, he was screaming in pain.       The young lad was 14

to 15 years, wearing a denim shirt.       He had black collar length

hair.    The man I can't remember.    There was also a man and a girl

there.    The girl was red in the face.    There was then a lot of people

screaming at a copper on the pitch in front of the man.       They wanted

the gate open.    He just looked at us and walked away.     The pushing

got worse and I hit the barrier .      I remember pushing and the next

thing I remember was flying through the air and coming to right in

the left hand c o m e r of the pen.    Ithink I climbed up the side

railings.    I remember lying on the floor with an injured right ankle

still in the co m e r of the pen.     I remember someone saying 'Get up or

you'll be trampled.' The next I remember was being carried onto the

pitch by two lads.    I lay on the pitch and two coppers came over,

picked me up and threw me into the hoardings. Hie coppers said, "Get

him off the fucking pitch."



                                              I cannot identify the

Policeman who threw me off the pitch.

          I make this statement to my Solicitor, Mr Keith LEVIN of Keith Levin &

          Co, and in relation to the treatment that I suffered at the hands of

          the South Yorkshire Police, and also the behaviour of the Police that

          I witnessed, on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489).

          I travelled to the match with ray two friends,

                  who are brothers, and who both live at               Road,

          Huyton, Liverpool,         We caught the normal train from Liverpool to

          Sheffield.    It was our intention to have a pleasant day out, and to

          spend some time in Sheffield City Centre before going to the match.

          The train arrived in Sheffield at 10.30 am, (1030), and after we got

          off the train, problems started inmediately.     We found that along with

          other Liverpool supporters, we were physically herded like what I can

          only describe as cattle.   We were prevented by the Police from leaving

          the railway station, although we wanted to do so.
Along with other supporters at the railway station, we were forced

aboard double decker buses which had been laid on to ferry fans from

the railway station to the ground itself.     I felt that we had no

choice whatsoever other than to board those buses.      I would go as

far as to saying that had we not agreed to board those buses, then

we would simply have had to caught the next train back to

Liverpool.   In effect, there was no choice at all.    Accordingly, we

got on these special buses and were taken to Hillsborough.     The return

fare was #1, and again we were given no choice, we had to pay the

fare or go heme.

We arrived at the Hillsborough ground at about 1100 am (1100). We

wandered around the Leppings Lane area, simply to kill time.     We went

into a little shop and bought something     to eat.   I did not see any

trouble whatsoever. At about 2.20 pn (1420), the three of us returned

to the Hillsborough ground to go in.     We queued up to get through the

turnstiles for about 10 minutes. Although it was crowded outside the

turnstiles there was no real problems.     The queueing was not orderly,

but the crowd was not hostile or badly behaved in any way. There was a

bit of jostling, as everybody wanted to get into the ground.     A Police

horse arrived and went straight into the middle of the crowd, and

after the Police horse arrived, then the queue became more orderly.

As I have said above, we got through the turnstiles with no problems.

I was not wearing a jacket and there was a Police Officer on the

inside of the turnstile.   He did not search me, but both of my friends

who were wearing jackets were searched.

We went through the tunnel which was straight ahead and when we came

out of the tunnel at the other side, we went to the left and stood at

the back of the pen.

Things began to get really bad when the teams got on the pitch.

Turning now to my specific complaints against the Police:
Firstly, when the crush was really bad, I saw young children being

crushed against the crash barriers about fifteen feet back from the

main perimeter fence.    I saw youngsters being trampled on and girls

screaming.    There was one Police Officer in uniform who was walking up

and down the running track on the other side of the perimeter

fence.   I was screaming to him at the top of my voice to open up the

gates.   Lots of other people around were also screaming at him, but he

appeared to be ignoring what was being said.     Eventually he turned and

he mouthed some words, which appeared to me to be offensive and

dismissive.   I believe that what he was mouthing was 'shut up you

dickheads' or something along those lines.     Certainly, the Officer

did not apear to want to help in any way and did not seem to be

interested in what was going on inside the pen.

Secondly, after I myself had been thrown over the perimeter fence and I

landed on the other side in a heap, I was then carried onto the

pitch by two or three lads who were supporters who had come out of

the ground. A couple of Police Officers came over to me and they

picked me up, in what I can only describe as a rough manner. They

threw me into some advertising hoardings at the side of the pitch, and

at the same time they were saying words to the effect 'get off the

fucking pitch' or 'get him off the fucking pitch', and am not

absolutely certain which of these two versions were used.    However,

the impression that I got was one of aggression towards me by those

two Police Officers, and certainly they were not treating me gently

or kindly, bearing in mind the state that I was in.

After I had been thrown into the advertising board by the above two

Police Officers, I could hear people in the crowd shouting to the

Police Officers not to be so rough and that there were problems.

After that, I had little involvement with the Police at Sheffield.

I vrould add that I have no complaints whatsoever with regard to the
                                                               PAGE

DATED: 101089                                               TONY LEIGH (SIGNED)



        On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I went to Hillsborough Football

        Ground Sheffield to watch the Semi Final between Liverpool and

        Nottingham Forest.

        As a result of what occurred at the match I     have previously made

        statements to my Solicitor Keith Levin and Co., and also to the West

        Midlands Police.

        My specific complaints are as follows.

           1.   When I arrived at Sheffield Railway Station with otter Liverpool

        Supporters, we were herded towards the exit and penned by the Police

        and treated like animals.

        We were kept like this for at least half an hour whilst they got some

        Nottingham Forest supporters off their train on the other platform.

        The Police seemed very oppresive and just would not let us move away

        at all.

        There were officers on horses, some with dogs and large numbers of

        them, but I could not individually describe than.

        We were told if we wanted to go to the match we had got to get on a

        double decker bus & pay #1 cash for the return fare, otherwise we
LEIGH                  ANTHONY   DENNIS                                       2

were not being allowed out of the Railway Station.    We had arrived at

the Railway Station at about     10.30 am (1030) and by the   time    we gotto

the ground    it was after 11 o clock (1100).

2.   When I   was in the ground I was halfway in the terrace in      Pen 4.

Before theteams came out it was gettiang very crushed, and a lot of

people started to panic.     Together with a lot of other supporters I

started to shout to a Policeman who was walking along the perimeter

of the pitch, to open the gate.    He ignored us so I started to scream

and swear at him to open the perimeter gate and get us out.    He then

turned his head towards us and seemed to mouth "Shut up you

dickheads".   I could not hear him because of the tremendous noise.       I

would describe this officer as middle aged, well built with a grey

full moustache and greying hair which I could see at the back of his

helmet.   I feel that this officer should have helped us but just

didn't want to know.

3.   Because of the crush I must have blacked out and the next thing I

remember was being helped and climbing over the fence into the alleway

dividing Pens 4 and 5.     I fell from the top and lay on the floor and a

number of people stumbled over me.     I was told to get up but I could

not because I had hurt my right ankle.    Three lads then carried me

onto the pitch by the left side of the goalposts.     I looked up and

could see Bruce Grobbelar, the goalkeeper.

IVro Policemen in uniform then came up to me, grabbed me by my jeans

and shirt, and the one on my left hand side said "Get him off the

fucking pitch".   I was lifted up by both of them one on either side

and thrown into the hoardings. I was more bundled than thrown, but I

must have then got up and stumbled back onto the pitch.



                                     I have been shown a video by
        LEIGH                   ANTHONY     DENNIS                                  3


        Knows ley Social Services which shows me stumbling on the pitch & the

        time on this video was 1505.        I cannot describe the two officers

        because at the time I was very hazy and in pain from my ankle.

        These officers were very aggressive and should have helped me instead

        of throwing me into the hoardings.




        My injuries were caused by falling of the fence.       I do not think I

        received any further injuries by the two officers bundling me off the

        pitch.

           Further to the Questionnaire I made regarding the disaster at

        Hillsborough on 15th April 1989 (150489).

        As stated I went to the match with my brother          and a friend, Tony

        LEIGH.

        We went into the ground altogether, but as we all went through the

           tunnel, due to the crush, me and___    got separated from Tony.    We

        ended up right at the front.     I don't know where Tony ended up.    I was

        with         behind the goal.

           I am aware that Tony has told the Police about an incident which

        happened when he got out of the pen.     I never saw this incident.

        After losing Tony as we entered the pen, I never saw him until 45

        minutes or so after the match was stopped where the casualties were by

        the gym.

        My brother          was with me all the time and he never saw the

        incident involving Anthony.

            I am the father of Adam Edward SPEARRITT aged 14 years who died when

            we both attended the semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham

            Forest held at the Hillsborough Football Ground Sheffield on the 15th

            April 1989 (150489).

            I have made previous statements to the West Midlands Police regarding

            the loss of my son and the injuries I received.

            I wish to make a specific complaint as follows:

            1.   That a Police Officer who I believe to be PC ILLINGWORTH of the

                 track side serial neglected to discharge his duty in that he

                 failed to open gate 4 in the perimeter fence despite my loud

                 appeals directly to him and his close proximity to our position.

            I consider PC ILLINGWORTH'S failure to act had a direct bearing on the

            loss of my son and the injuries I received.

           I am Edward SPEARRITT of                         Runcorn.    I have lived

           at this address for about the past eighteen years and am employed as

           a taxi driver.   My immediate family consists of my wife

                              and Adam of late.

        Adam was b o m on June 13 1974 (13071974).     In Liverpool.    He attended

        St Mary's Junior School and Norton Priory Comprehensive School.        Adam

        has always been a fit and healthy lad,

                                                       Adam's doctor was our

           family doctor, his name is                  - the surgery address is



        I have been following Liverpool Football Club virtually all of my

        life and have taken Adam along with me since he was about five years

        old.    On Wednesday 12 April 1989 (120489) I collected one ticket frcm

        Anfield which was a standing ticket, I was able to obtain this because

        Adam was given a voucher by a friend at school.      I was able to get a

        second ticket off Tony CURRAN.      I planned to attend the Cup Semi-Final

        at Hillsborough with my friends William Derek MCNIVEN of

                Liverpool, Anthony CURRAN of                    Liverpool, and my




                                                                                       17
SPEARRITT               EDWARD                                              2

son Adam.     We planned to get to the match in Derek's car.

On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) Adam and myself left heme to meet

William and Anthony at about 11.55am (1155).     We walked a short

distance to the Norton Arms Public House on Main Street, Runcorn,

arriving about five minutes later.     We met William and Anthony outside

the pub and then wait inside.     William and Anthony had a pint of lager

I had a half pint of lager and Adam had a glass of coke.       After ten

minutes we left the pub and made our way by car towards Sheffield.

The route comprised of joining the M56 at Junction 11.     We headed for

Stockport and travelled along the Snake Pass and made our way into

Sheffield.     We arrived in Sheffield City at around 2 pm (1400).   We

left the car about half a mile away from the ground and decided to

walk because we were unable to find anywhere else to park.      There was

a lot of traffic about but I wouldn't say it was excessive in the

circumstances. We walked towards the ground it was obvious which way

to go as there were supporters all walking in the same direction in my

opinion the amount of supporters was just normal considering the type

of game.     Whilst we walked to the ground everything was normal, I

couldn't see anyone fighting pushing or being a nuisance nor did I see

anyone drinking beer from cans or similar.    We arrived at the Leppings

Lane end at about 2.30 pm (1430), William and Anthony wait to a c o m e r

shop and I stayed with Adam.     There were no problems with the crowds

at that time seme supporters were queuing at the turnstiles others

were milling about, there was one policeman on horseback at the

turnstiles, I met a friend passing by and talked for a while.      At

this time there was no need to be anxious about getting into the

ground my son and I had tickets and there seemed to be no problem.

William and Anthony had made their way to the seated part of the

stadium because of the tickets they had bought.    After I had said
SPEARRITT               EDWARD                                              3


goodbye to         the friend that I had met, Adam and I decided to go

into the ground.   We walked through a blue gate fully expecting to go

through seme turnstiles and to be met by stewards and police, but

there were neither.     I couldn't see any officials at all.    I made my

way with Adam towards the front of the West Stand.     As we made our way

down the terrace there were very few people inside.    We were able to

make our way unhindered to the front of the terrace.    We stood

directly behind the goal right up to the blue fencing, at this time

I could see one policeman on the pitch but there could have been

more.   I couldn't see anyone on the terrace drinking or misbehaving.

Soon afterwards the Liverpool team came out and started kicking

about, I think it was about 2.50 pm (1450) by this time.       I said to

Adam, 'The boss man is playing'.    I was referring to Alan HANSON.

Adam acknowledged me and then I became aware of the immense amount of

pressure building up behind me, I instinctively knew that something

was wrong.   The pressure suddenly became so great that I was unable

to turn around to see what was happening.    Adam was in front of me

and was getting crushed.    I knew that the situation was serious and

so I began to bang on the fencing in front of us in an attempt to

attract the attentions of the policeman who I mentioned earlier.

There was a gate about an arms lenghth away to my right, I screamed

to the officer to open it but he just looked at me and seemed to take

no notice.

I tried to lift Adam up above my head so that I could get him over

the fence, but the pressure behind me was so great that I was unable

to get a grip of him.    After that I lost consciousness, when I came to

I was in a Hospital bed.    I remained in the Northern General Hospital,

Sheffield, until Tuesday 18 April (180489), where I had been placed on

a ventilator.
        SPEARRITT               EDWARD


        When Adam left heme with me on 15.4.89 (150489) he was wearing a blue

        and white     tracksuit top, green corduroy jeans and white 'NIKE'

        training shoes, to my knowledge he wasn't wearing a watch or any

        jewellery.     I believe that my brother Robert received all of Adam's

        clothing.

        When I was discharged from the hospital, I was missing items of my own

        clothing which consists of a ski jacket with white sleeves blue trim,

        the rest being basically green, it has a zip up front and a 'Crew

        neck' type collar, a pair of size 6 Oxblood shoes, a gents quartz

        watch with an analogue face and steel bracelet, and two semi-final

        tickets for the Liverpool Nottingham Forest game with the stubs still

        attached.

           I am a married man and I reside at the above address with ray wife and

           family, I am the father of Adam Edward SPEARRITT, who was b o m on 13.

           6.74 (13061974) in Liverpool.

           On 15th April, 1989 (150489), Adam and I went to the FA cup Semi-Final

           at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, where Liverpool were to play

           Nottingham Forest.   We got into the terrace behind the goal at the

           Leppings Lane end of the ground at about 2.40 pm (1440).      I think

           I was in the area referred to as Pen 4 with Adam.   We were

           inmediately in front of the perimeter fence at this location.

           I was wearing a pair of black trousers, a cotton zip up jacket, green

           coloured, the sleeves are white, only from the wrist to just above the

           elbow.    The jacket is bottle green on the bottom section and almost a

           blue or green blue on the top section.    There is a white band about a

           1/4" (quarter inch) wide, just a little over the top half of the

           jacket, this also continues on both sleeves and on the back of the

           jacket.   On one sleeve, the left one, is a circular cotton badge,

           green coloured with a white background and the words 'ICE BREAKERS' a

           green, dark open crew neck sweater, I wore under this jacket. I wore




                                                                                     21

lace-up size 6 ox blood shoes.

My son Adam was dressed in a white jacket with blue collar, a blue

kangaroo on left breast area, and a series of narrow blue lines

running across the back of the jacket, in the middle area.     There are

narrow blue vertical lines running down the front of the jacket from

the area of the shoulder.    In addition there is a 2" blue line running

the length of each sleeve and at the back of each one.   Adam also wore

a pair of green corded trousers, a rust coloured sweater and a pair of

'Nike' white trainers, with the name and logo in red.

As a result of the disaster at Hillsborough on 15th April, 1989

(150489) my son Adam died.

Chi Monday 10th July, 1989 (100789), at my home address I handed to

PC's        and        of the West Midlands Police, one colour

photograph of my son, passport type, taken this year.    This photograph

is a good likeness of my son Adam SPEARRITT.   I gave a second

photograph, taken of myself in Paris.   In both pictures, Adam and I

are wearing the jackets that we w r e to the match that day.

I understand that these pictures will be used to assist with the

visual identification of Adam and I in the football crowd.

I further understand that these two photographs will be returned to

me, once such identification, or otherwise, has been carried out.

           Further to my previous statement dated 28th April 1989 (280489), I

        have today been shown a number of video tapes and photographs by

           I can say that having viewed the material, I am reasonably satisfied

           I live at the above address with my wife and young daughter and am

           employed as a taxi driver.      I am a supporter of Liverpool Football

           Club who I have followed for about twenty years.

           It was my intention to go to the F.A. Cup Semi Final match on 15th

        April 1989 (150489) between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at

           Hillsborough, Sheffield.

           On Friday 14th April 1989 (140489) I went to Anfield in the morning

           as I knew that tickets were on sale to the general public.      There I

        bought two West Stand tickets from the ticket office, each one

           costing   12.   The tickets were for entrance W, row 11, seats 58 and

           59.   I was going to use one ticket for myself and the other one for

        Tony CURRAN of                        Liverpool      We both had planned to

           go to the match with Edward SPEARRITT and his son Adam, aged 14 years

        who lived at                                      Runcorn.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I got up at about 10am (1000)

           and got ready to go.      The arrangements were that all four of us would

           go to Sheffield in my own, personal car.       Tony came to my house at

           around 11.30am (1130) and then we both went to the Norton Arms public
MCNIVEN                 WILLIAM   DERRICK                                  2

house, Main St, Halton, for 12 noon (1200) to pick up Eddie and

Adam.   At the pub we met them on the car park and then we went inside

the pub for one drink.     There I had a pint of lager, Tony had a pint

of lager, Eddie had half a pint, while Adam had a coke.    After this

drink we all got in my car and headed for Sheffield, the time now

being 12.10pm (1210).

We travelled through Halton and got onto the M56 at Junction 11.      We

then went through Stockport and from there went through the Snake

Pass to Sheffield.     Although there was a large amount of traffic on

the roads there was no real hold ups and we arrived in Sheffield at

about 2pm (1400).    We then parked the car about half a mile from the

ground and began to walk the rest of the way.     By this time it was

about 2.20pm (1420).

On walking to the ground there was a lot of people and everyone was

well behaved.     I saw no one who was drinking alcohol for cans or

anything else.

At 2.30pm (1430) we all arrived at the co m e r of Halifax Rd and

another road, the name of which I do not know.    There Tony and I went

into a shop to get something to eat while Eddie and Adam carried onto

the ground.     We arranged to meet up with them back at the car after

the game.     This was the last time I saw Eddie or Adam before the

game.   Tony and I then came out of the shop after having a pastie and

continued to the ground.

At 2.40pm (1440) we arrived at the Lepping Ln entrance to

Hi 1lsborough.    I went up to entrance W with Tony and went to the

turnstiles. Although there was quite a few people around we both had

no difficulty in gaining entrance as there was only about four people

in front of us at the turnstile.     I passed through the turnstile

main part.     This was between turnstiles 1 to 4.    Before having

entered the ground I had only seen one mounted policeman and one

policewoman.     I had not seen any stewards.

Inside the ground we were in an enclosed area and were looking for

which way to go.     There was quite a few people there but no more than

you would expect at any big match.     At this point Tony went to get a

programme while I went to the gents toilet which was situated to the

left of the tunnel that led to the terracing.        It was now about 2.45pm

(1445).    On caning out of the toilet I immediately noticed that there

was a lot more people about.     I also saw that directly opposite the

toilet I cane out of, about 25 feet in front of me was a large, blue

gate which had been opened.      It was open wide enough to allow four

people abreast in at a time.     There was three policemen there, two

constables and one higher than a sergeant, who were standing about

three yards away from the gate letting people into the ground.        The

supporters were coming through the gate four abreast in a steady

flow.     There was no panicing or rushing.     I saw about forty people

come through the gate and none had their tickets checked.       All of

them headed for the tunnel leading to the terracing.        I went to my

right ad rejoined Tony and we went to entrance W to go up to the

seating area.     On going up the stairs I only saw one steward and he

did not check my ticket.     We were then upstairs and took our seats

for the match.     We were positioned to the left of the goal, eleven

rows from the front.     It was now 2.55pm (1455).

From where I was sat I could see that the terracing behind the goal

was absolutely packed but to the left and right of the terrace it was

empty.     I saw some people start to climb up the fencing at the front

of the terracing.     By this time the match had just kicked off.     I said

to Tony it was pointless kicking off as they would have to stop the




                                                                                28

match to let people out of the terrace to avoid the crushing.

I could see that the crush on the terracing was very bad and more

people were climbing over the fencing.     This went on for a few

minutes.   There was about seven police officers standing on the pitch

but they were doing nothing to help.

It was now 3.10pm (1510) and the players had left the pitch.     I saw

five men, who were supporters, on the pitch trying to pull the

fencing down.    Just before they managed to get the fencing down, two

policemen came along, one of them being more than a sergeant, and

stop them pulling at the fence.    During the next ten minutes more

people were climbing over the fence frcm the terrace onto the pitch

and a gate was opened in the front fence.    There was also people

being pulled up frcm the terrace into the stand where I was sitting.

More police arrived then with bolt cutters and began cutting away at

the fence letting more people out and onto the pitch.    People were

falling onto the pitch with some lying down being helped by others.

It was just general chaos.

All through these events I was standing on my seat watching what was

happening, more and more people were going onto the pitch.     I saw some

people being given the kiss of life, others were being put on hoardings

and taken to the far left hand c o m e r of the ground while others were

just lying there having been covered up.    It was obvious they were

dead.

At 4pm (1600) there was an announcementover the tannoy asking

for people still in the stadium to stay     calm and    keptin the ground.

At 4.20pm (1620), Tony and I left the ground going back the way we

had come in.    There was a lot of peoplemilling about looking dazed.

We went back to the car to see if Eddieand Adam were there but they

weren't . After leaving a note on the car, Tony and I returned to the
MCNIVEN                WILLIAM   DERRICK


ground to look for the other two.    We looked around for about half an

hour and it was now 5pm (1700) but we couldn't.    We returned to the

car but Eddie and Adam still weren't there.    I then used a phone at a

local house to phone home to see if there had been any contact.

However, there had not been.

After talking to a police man we were advised to go to Hammerton Rd

Police Station, arriving there at 6pm (1800), where we reported Eddie

and Adam missing.    We then went to a Boys Club to wait for any news.

After we had been there for about an hour a policeman with pips on

his shoulder stood up and said he had a list of names of people who

had been reported missing but had been found safe and well.    There

was about ten names, one of them being Adams'.    We were then asked to

return to the police station where a senior policeman went to find

where Adam was.

After a lot of confusion this senior policeman asked Tony and I to

return to the Boys' Club.    We still did not know where Adam was but I

phoned his mother to let her know Adam was safe and well.

At 8pm (2000) we asked for any more news but were told that the list

they had read out earlier with Adam's name on could not be traced.

After another hour we again asked for news but there was nothing new.

I again phoned Mrs SPEARITT to tell her Adam was safe but that we

couldn't find Eddie.    At 10pm (2200) a senior police officer stood up

in the Boys Club and said we would be put on a bus and taken back to

Hillsborough.     Before we left we met two people called       and

      who were Social Workers who stayed with us while we were at the

ground.

We arrived at Hillsborough at 10.40pm (2240) and found the conditions

there appalling.     It was dark, cold and damp with the only lighting

caning from a generator.    We found that the gymnasium had been turned
MCNIVEN                WILLIAM   DERRICK                                    6


into a temporary mortuary which was something we had not been told to

expect.   We were left for about two hours to fend for ourselves in

terrible conditions.

I saw the Chief Constable at the ground who I complained very

strongly to regarding the conditions.       His assistant could not

apologise enough.    We were then taken into the gumnasium under

protest and shown photographs of what we were told was all the

people who had died.     I didn't recognise any of the photos, so we

went to the Northern General Hospital arriving at 0050 hrs.      We

were taken to the Intensive Care Unit where we were shown four

young lads on life support machines.       This was very distressing but

we didn't recognise any of them.    We were then shown a male aged

about 40 who we recognised as being Eddie.      He was in a very bad way.

I then phoned Mrs SPEARITT again to tell her about Eddie and that

although we had not found Adam he was believed safe and well.         We

then went to another hospital where we looked at more people in

intensive care but couldn't find Adam.

At 2.30am (0230) on Sunday 16th April (160489) we returned to the

ground to look at the photos again which was distressing as the

victims were barely recognisable.    At the ground we asked to look

at the photos but were told that it wasn't worth it as there was

now only one person unidentified.    We were taken into the mortuary

where we saw the body of a young child.       It was not Adam.

At 3.10am (0310) we returned to the Northern General where we met

Eddie's brother, Robert.    On the advice of the hospital the three

of us returned to the ground so that Robert could look at the only

unidentified bod/.     I felt that the things being asked of us were

very hard to bear.

On arriving at Hillsborough I asked a senior policeman to show
        MCNIVEN                 WILLIAM      DERRICK


        Robert the last unidentified tody.         However, he said he should look

        at the photographs first.          I didn't understand this but on looking

        at the photographs I saw there ten new photos that had not been

        there previously.     One of these photos was of Adam SPEARITT which

        was confirmed by Robert who then identified him in the mortuary.

        After the identification had been done a police officer apologised

        to Tony and myself.     I told him I couldn't accept this as had we

        had earlier been told Adam was alive, we'd been shown photos of victims

        of which Adam was not among and I had phoned his mother to tell her

        this.     He replied it was a lack of conraunication between that side

        of the gymnasium and this.

        I wish to add that after having been shewn the photos of victims

        the first time we were then just left to fend for ourselves.         There

       was just no organisation or communication at all.

        On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), together with Edward SPEARRITT,

        Adam SPEARRITT and Derek McNTVEN, I went to the semi-final at

        Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield.

        As we got to Leppings Lane, Derek and I split up from Edward and Adam

        because we had seats for the West Stand with Edward and Adam going on

        the terraces.

        Derek and I got into our seats at about 2.45 pm (1445), which were in

        the centre of the stand behind Pen 4.         I noticed that the pens either

        side of Pens 3 & 4 were comparatively empty considering what time it

        was.

        Around about kick-off time, I noticed that Pens 3 and 4 were very

        packed and just after I saw people being lifted from the terraces up

        into the stand I also saw people climbing the fences behind the goal.

        It started to get people lying on and by the back of the goal net and

        encroaching onto the pitch.

        A Police Inspector then ran onto the pitch towards the referee and

        the match was stopped and the players went off the pitch.

        I also saw people lying on the pitch and I could see seme of them were
CURRAN                  ANTHONY   THOMAS                                      2


dead.     After we were told we could leave the ground we made our way

back to where we had parked the car.       We waited about half an hour but

Edward and Adam didn't return to the car.

We went back to the ground and were told there was no one left in the

ground.    On returning to the car we put the radio on and it said at

least fifty people were dead.

We went to Hammerton Road Police Station at about six o'clock (1800),

enquiring about Edward and Adam and asked to describe them.

We then waited in a Beys' Club for about an hour.      A senior Police

Officer with three pips on his shoulder stood on a chair and read out

round about eight names, one being Adam SPEARRITT, saying these people

are known to be safe and alive.

We then went with the Policeman to a Police Station for him to find

more details about Adam, but he said he could not find out where the

list had came from.

We went back to the Boys' Club and there phoned Mrs SPEARRITT, and

told her Adam was alive, but we didn't know where Eddie was at that

time.

Seme tours later we went to the gymnasium at Hillsborough and looked

at photographs of the people who had died but could not see Adam or

Eddie.    We then visited hospitals and eventually found Eddie and the

Doctor told us to get his wife straight away, because of Eddie's

condition.

We rang her and told her to come straight away, we also told her we

had not found Adam.    We eventually ended up back at the hospital and

there saw Eddie's brother Robert SPEARRITT.      The three of us Robert,

Derek and myself, then returned to the gymnasium which was being used

as a mortuary and there Robert identified a photograph of Adam and

then we all identified Adam's body.

Dear Mr. Anderson,


I    am    writing        to   you as      I     understand that      you    are        responsible         for
discipline within the South Yorkshire Police Force.


I am      the   father of Adam Edward Spearritt who was                      tragically        lost in the
disaster        and   I   myself    was    in     the   intensive    care    unit       of    the    Northern
General Hospital for three days.


I wish to complain that an                 officer (whom I believe to be P.C.                  Illingworth
of   the    track     side     serial     ) neglected       to discharge     his    duty,      in    that he
failed     to    open     Gate   4 in      the    perimeter fence,     despite          my    loud    appeals
directly to him and his close proximity to our position.


I consider        his     failure   to    act     had   a   direct   bearing       on   the    loss    of   my
son.
Please record my complaint and place in hand the neccessary procedures.


Yours Sincerly,                                  8 0 U T H YORKS. POLICE

COMPLAINT AGAINST POLICE - EDWARD SPEARRITT

In the absence of Mr Wright I am forwarding a copy of a letter received
from the above named in which he makes an allegation against a member
of this Force.

I should be obliged if you would undertake the investigation on our behalf
and would inform you that I have asked Mr E N Taylor of the Police
Complaints Authority to supervise the investigation.

A copy of the letter was faxed to Detective Superintendent Beechey on
23 September 1989 to avoid any delay in receipt of correspondence and
consequent delay in the service of a Notice under Regulation 7-

I enclose a copy of my letters to Mr Taylor and to the complainant Mr
Spearritt.

Yours sincerely

      NATURE OF *                      COMPLAINT


           On Saturday, 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, a
           disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

           Anthony Dennis Leigh, of                Huyton, Liverpool, was a supporter in
           Pen 4, and has made the following allegation:

          Together with other supporters he shouted at a Policeman walking along the
          perimeter track to open the perimeter gate to let them out. The Police Officer
          turned to the supporters and appeared to mouth the words "Shut up you dickheads."
          Mr Leigh feels this officer should have helped him and the other supporters.

          He describes the Police Officer as middle aged, well built with a grey full
          moustache and greying hair.                                   ,

          Enquiries suggest you may be the Police Officer referred to by Mr Leigh.

Dear Sir
RE: Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Investigation

Thank you for your letter of the 2nd March and we are grateful for the
information contained therein. There may be the need for us to request
from you certain documentation or information which we have not otherwise
been able to gather, in which case we will revert to you.
When you speak of the facilities you intend to use for the interview, we
obviously would welcome the opportunity of being able to know in advance
what documents are to be referred to, what film or video material is to
be used (and to give us the opportunity of seeing the same with Client
prior to the actual interview itself) and what particular points are to
be addressed.
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,
Re: Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Investigation

Further to our letter dated 8th March 1990.
We are aware that there is a BBC T.V compilation video available
with some fifty minutes of footage on it.
We would ask that a copy of that video be forwarded to us so that
we can view the film with our Client, as soon as possible.
We look forward to hearing from you in respect of the above in due
course.
Yours faithfully

      Dear Sirs,

      Re: Hillsborough - Superintendent B. Murray

      We refer to our telephone conversation on the 12th June when we told you
      th a t we had received Leading Counsel's advices.     Our Client has obviously
      not seen this Opinion because he is away on holiday, and he will not be aware
      of its contents until we m eet with him on the 22nd June.

      Leading Counsel has advised "that if the interviewing Officers intend at
      any stage to use video film of the 1988 semi-final Superintendent Murray
      should not agree to be interviewed". Leading Counsel gives this advice as
      he believes it is a potentially dangerous and misleading way of interviewing.
      It was for this reason th a t our Mr. Manning telephoned Detective Chief
      Superintendent Foster to seek assurance on this particular point.

      The position th erefore is th a t if our Client accepts Leading Counsel's advices
      we shall want th at assurance from you. If on the other hand, notwithstanding
      Counsel advices, Client decides differently then we will let you know.



      Yours faithfully,

                HUltbpsoughi IntfiffvtOT Qt.Supt-Murray-
     Thank you for your letter of 19th June.
     I      have tried to reach you a couple of times so as to
advise by telephone, but with no success, so I thought I would
let you have my views by letter.
      If Supt Murray elects not to be interviewed in
conjunction with the use of the 1968 video film, the
investigating officers have two options, namely;
              (1) they accept the£ position and interview him
              without showing him the 1938 video, but questioning
              him nonetheless on the 1988 semi-final, as his role
              in that has been understood by them; or
              (2) they do not interview him at all►

     obviously (1) is to be preferred, but it is a matter for
the officers' discretion.
     2 hope this deals with the difficulty adequately.

Y0urs sincerely,.




                                                                       TOTAL P.0£

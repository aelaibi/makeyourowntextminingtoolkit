I    oai 1 d    not     sleep          that       night          and       despite          attempts            to     do      so     could       not

get     any      proper           sleep          for       about       a    week       after          the     event.             On      the     Tuesday

and     after         the        persistent                demands          of    my    Wife          I went         to     my      local        G.P.

Doctor                           of                                                         who       examined            me     but       said       that

there          was    basically              little          he       could       do    and       preferred               not       to     give       me

any      tablets            but       said       I was       obviously                suffering             from       shock          and      after

effects          and        to    just       take          things          easy       and    let       time       and       my      own     youth

do     the      rest.            As    I    said       after          about       a    week       I    started            to     sleep         more

normally             but     even          now    I    still          have       recurring             emotions             regarding             the

situation             and        my    sleep          is    not       as    it    should          be,         this        obviously              then

effects          my     work,          I    had       to    take       some       time       off       work       after          the       tragedy
                ■»
that        being       the       Tuesday             itself.              Like       most    people            who       have        to    justify

t h e i r fown        living           I    find       it    very          difficult          to       take       time         off       work     and

it     is      very     unusual             for       me    to       take       any    time       whatsoever                off.           but    I    have

been        conscious             that       apart          from       the       actual       day       I     took        off       tny w o r k i n g

ability          lias       been       severely             affected             since       the       time       of      the       tragedy
                                                                                                                                                  ♦
although             now     I    am       starting          to       overcome          my    emotions               and       get       back     into


full           working           practice.



It     is      obviously              impossible                 for       me    to    say at         this stage               how       long     the

effects          will        be       with       me    but       I    think       this        will          be c l e a r l y        seen       from        the

Statement,              I    have          sufferedboth                shock          and    severe            emotional                 upset        from

the     events          I was          forced          to    witness.

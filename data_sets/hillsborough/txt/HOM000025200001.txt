   Dear Sir,

                                 Football Trust - I T   Fund Initiative.

   Further to our in itial submission of information on the Initiative on the 18th
   October, I am pleased to enclose additional information.

   The I T Fund and Football Trust - I T Fund Initiative Committee w ill be pleased
   to answer questions or provide any further information upon request.

   It is the view of the Initiative that the scope for the Initiative, it s potential
   for impact on the behaviour of young people in trouble and at risk w ill be
   furthered by the provision of additional and coordinated community development
   assistance to local and major football clubs and other local community bodies
   interested in participation in the Initiative.  Such assistance is required to
   ensure the best application of resources, programme development and c l o s e '
   financial and programme monitoring of work supported.

   Yours faithfully,




  David Bell,
  Deputy Director.

                 FOOTBALL TRUST - I T   FUND INITIATIVE.


In 1988 the I T Fund was invited by the Football Trust to launch the
Football Trust - I T Fund Initiative with the aim of encouraging the
development of a number of new local community-based projects using
football and football related issues as a significant element of
programmes for young offenders and young people, 'at risk'.

Prior to the Initiative the I T Fund had in the period 1978-1988
distributed approximately £35,000 to directly initiate or sustain
football activities related to its area of interest.   Grants have been
made to support 'Junior' or 'Youth' clubs and leagues and five-a-side
teams.   Funds have been allocated for kit, playing equipment and
floodlighting, improvements to facilities, surfacesand transport, etc.
In addition the Fund has always provided a wide range of support to
other sporting and outdoor pursuits and adventure activities.

Following discussions with the      Football Trust an initial grant of
£25,000 was provided to be held by the Football Trust but distributed
by the I T Fund at its quarterly Committees following the launch of the
Initiative in mid 1988.   In the current period 1989-90 the Initiative
has been allocated £50,000 by the Football Trust (a doubling of the
award). Since the launch of the Initiative 29 grants totalling £89,125
have been made from resources provided by the Football Trust in
addition a further 10 grants totalling £34,135 have been provided from
resources available to the I T Fund.

GUIDELINES AND CRITERIA

The National I T Fund Committee has established a Working Party under
the Chairmanship of Brian Ware,0BE, former Principal of Brathay Hall
Outdoor Education Centre in Cumbria.   Following consultation and with
the support and advice of experts in the field the Working Party seeks
to   guide the establishment,     operation and development of     the
Initiative.

The policy guidelines and grants criteria established by the Working
Party are closely related to the objectives and criteria of the I T
Fund.   The Initiative has been developed within the Fund's traditional
concern to support local, community-based initiatives for those in
trouble and at risk in areas of need.   Since funding has been provided
from a source independent of the Department of Health it has been
possible to relax the guidelines normally applying to Fund grants and
in particular to support project working with young people up to the
age of 21 years.

The Initiative has been targeted:

     To communities in need in the most vulnerable    and   disadvantaged
     areas of England and Wales.

     To encourage the involvement of girls and young women as well as
     young men and to extend the range of projects supported to relate
     to the current concern for those aged 17-21 years.

     To provide support in multiracial communities.
     To encourage football organisations, clubs and other    sporting
     bodies to become more aware of the needs of local young people,
     and consider how their facilities and skills might be made
     available to the wider community.

-    To assist in the development of local responses directed to the
     provision of alternative programmes for young offenders and those
     at risk and to promote the prevention of crime.

     To assist local communities in the development of programmes which
     will encourage the growth of self help and community confidence
     and the provision of opportunities for skills training, personal
     development and enterprise.

TARGETING

The Initiative has effectively drawn an initial response from the North
of England, and the West and East Midlands, although enquiries have
been received and projects are under development in a wide range of
inner-city and rural areas including London and the South West.     This
targeting to areas of high need      and poor provision will continue with a
focus on the areas of Yorkshire and Humberside, East Anglia,   the South
East and Wales.   Over 15 grants have been made in the North of England
and 12 projects have been supported in the West Midlands.

A significant emphasis has been placed on projects working with the
black and Asian communities with 11 projects supported.      A further
eight projects are targeted to work with young women and girls.    Over
14 schemes have involved initiatives based on problem Estates in Towns
and rural areas.   Eight projects have involved partnerships with other
national or local sporting bodies, voluntary agencies and key statutory
bodies. Three projects have been given major grants to provide broadly
based community development and skills training opportunities through
sport.

BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS - GENERATING RESOURCES

The launch of the Initiative has provided the opportunity for the I T
Fund to demonstrate and extend its role as a community development
agency. The Fund has provided technical assistance, support and advice
to new and existing projects and through its established role as
'honest broker' has drawn together partners and fostered inter-agency
cooperation.

THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION

One example of this development role and the building of partnership
has been the Fund's role with the Football Association in developing
the 'Highgate Harriers - Inner City Coaching Initiative' in Birmingham.
The Coaching Initiative has been launched following a conference held
at Aston Villa in 1986 on 'Initiatives to combat hooliganism'. The I T
Fund has had a long association with I T Officers in Birmingham and has
in the past provided a number of grants to the Aston Manor Coaching
Centre, The Midlands Goalkeeper School and Highgate Harriers F.C.
                                    .3 .
The continuation of the Coaching Initiative has been made possible
through a new funding partnership and further inter agency cooperation
between the I T Fund, the Football Association, West Midlands Police,
Birmingham Social Services and Community Recreation and        Leisure
Departments and the Sports Council, League Clubs and the County F.A.
As a result, the I T Fund is now working with the Football Association
in the development of similar schemes in Avon, in Huddersfield and
other parts of the country.

THE SPORTS COUNCIL

Following meetings with senior regional staff and leaders of the Action
Sports programme targeted to areas of need contact has been made with
regions of the Sports Council and information on the Initiative has
been provided.

An example of cooperation is the 'Football into the 1990's' scheme
jointly supported by the Sports Council of the South West, the regional
coaches and the six County F.A's in the South West.      Including the
counties of Avon, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Wiltshire and
Gloucestershire.   The scheme is targeted to 'low and non participant
groups including significant members of young offenders and young
people at risk' in the non metropolitan county towns and rural areas
where there is a lack of provision of youth and sporting activities.

Additional contact has been made with the Sports Council for Wales and
the Sports Councils in London and the South-East and the West Midlands
involving further joint support for project initiatives.

THE POLICE - CRIME PREVENTION

Details of the Initiative have been made available to the Association
of Chief Police Officers' Sub Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting
Events' and have been circulated to Police - Football liaison officers
and to Community Relations sections of local police forces.   The past
experience of the Fund has established the very valuable role played by
local officers, who often acting in a voluntary capacity manage and
train local youth teams and organise local footballing tournaments.
This role has also been acknowledged by individual awards made by the
John Hunt Award Trust in association with the I T Fund.

As a result of the Initiative a number of projects have been supported.
In the West Midlands the YMCA Football and New activity Project, West
Bromwich. In Derbyshire support has been provided for the Young People
in Care Football Project in Chesterfield,   'Off the Street' Football,
Buxton and the Field Lane Football Club in Derby.    In the North East
the Initiative have supported the Stoneygate Estate Neighbourhood
Project, Gateshead, in association with the Gateshead Multi Agency
Crime Prevention Initiative and in the South West the St. Pauls-Bristol
City Coaching Scheme with the Somerset and Avon Constabulary and
Bristol City F.C.

JOINT LOCAL AUTHORITY INITIATIVES

The Initiative has supported projects in association with local
authority sports, recreation, leisure and community service departments
in Carlisle, Birmingham and Stoke-Upon-Trent and is involved in project
development in Leeds and Luton.
In 1983 the Lord Mayor of Stoke used the prestige of the office to set
up contact between the City of Stoke, Stoke City Football Club and
other towns and cities against which Stoke City were playing away.
From this initiative developed a voluntary scheme which has involved
the Council, the Club, parents, police, local schools and large numbers
of young people drawn from the many deprived areas of the City.

The Scheme involves organising regular events around 'at          home'
fixtures. Visiting groups of young supporters are invited to Stoke for
a welcome at the Town Hall and to play friendly matches against local
teams.   Following a lunch, supporters and local young people join
together as guests of the Club to watch the afternoon fixture.      The
Scheme involves young people of all abilities not only team members and
aims to overcome the problems caused by 'visiting supporters' on the
streets and in grounds. It seeks to replace hooliganism by comradeship
and common purpose, widening the horizons of all involved.      Support
from the Initiative has allowed the continuation and the extension of
the Scheme.    The success of the initiative has led to the Matchmates
Scheme being finalists in the Sports section of the BBC 1 'TV 'IT'S MY
CITY' COMPETITION.

LITTLE LEAGUE FOOTBALL

The Football Trust - I T Fund Initiative has supported Little League
Football in the Northfield and Selly Oak, Handsworth, Ladywood and Soho
areas of Birmingham.   The Northfield League provides for young people
of all races from Footballing ability is not a factor taking part is
more important than winning.      Saturday morning games and regular
training sessions draw support from local schools, parents, police and
The City Council, The behaviour of all concerned in the team must be
above reproach.    In Ladworth support from the Initiative has allowed
the extension of football facilities to the age group most at risk of
entry into crime 13-16 years.

In addition the Initiative has supported the continued development of
the Carlisle Sports Five-A-Side Soccer Project.       The project was
founded by a former school caretaker in cooperation with local parents
and youth workers and with the aid of regular publicity provided by the
Carlisle Evening News, advertises the existence of street based
five-a-side teams drawn from local estates.    The project has created
sporting opportunities for thousands of young people and over 100 are
involved weekly.

CURRENT AND FUTURE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

The National I T Fund as a government sponsored initiative is uniquely
placed between Central and Local Government,        the Statutory and
Voluntary Sector, Sports and Recreational bodies the Community and
other grant and resourcing agencies (including charitable trusts).   In
addition to its Grant Making Role, it is a development agency concerned
to promote Departmental and Social Service Inspectorate concerns for
the development of Intermediate Treatment and related services for
those young people in trouble and at risk.    This is achieved through
the additional action areas of building capacity within the community
with the aid of voluntary effort, advocacy, technical assistance and
community development skills and assistance in the identification of
and mobilising of additional resources.

The Fund is currently working with Footballing and Sporting Bodies and
other national and voluntary agencies including Professional and local
football clubs in the promotion of schemes with Manchester City F .C.
The Community Programme in Professional Football and the Football
League and a range of sports and voluntary bodies in Durham, Leeds,
Humberside,   Avon,    South Wales, London,     Cumbria   and   Evesham.
Worcestershire.    Recent local examples of projects supported under the
Football Trust - I T Fund Initiative are enclosed:-

1652 - Stanfield Junior Football Club, Anfield, Liverpool.

1654 - Football Community Link Project, Wolverhampton, West Midlands.

1656 - Apex, Avonsdale F.C, Tottenham, London.

THE FOOTBALL TRUST

The Fund is currently engaged in initial discussion with the Football
Trust and with other relevant bodies including the Sir Norman Chester
Centre and the Oxford Centre for Criminological Research and the
Football League on the further development of the Initiative.

A further application for the renewal of the Initiative will be made to
the Football Trust later in 1989 for consideration early in 1990.    In
addition the Fund will be making proposals for the extension and
development of the Initiative.
                                    WHAT IS MATCHMATES

    Matchmates is a concept designed to foster good will and friendship
    throughout sport, by providing a framework which is flexible enough
    to be used by clubs, sporting agencies and local voluntary groups
    through linking children from neighbouring cities who may not normally
    have the opportunity to be involved in sharing experiences of sport
    and friendship.


                                 SO HOW DO WE KICK OFF?

    For your Matchmates to succeed you must have:

    1.     An organisation or group which is directly responsible for the
           operating of Matchmates. This is you.

    2.     The involvement of:

           a)   Your local junior schools.
           b)   Your professional football league club.
           c)   * Anappointed Co-ordinator.

    3.     Cash - but not as much   as you mightthink.

    Before we go into our step by step approach it is important that we
    examine what the above elements of the Scheme do. Firstly, yourselves.

    You need to:

           Get together for the benefit of your Scheme-

         1 • Schools.
           Contact your local Education Authority for permission to approach
           the Schools in your area for both the teachers involvement and use
           of the facilities, school playing fields, changing rooms, canteen
           facilities, etc.
V
     2. Professional Football Club.
           Persuade your local club to give you either free entry or a reduced
           rate of no more than 50% of the usual price. As you go on through
           the pack you will find additional information which will illustrate
           to you this is not as difficult as it first might seem.

     3. Co-ordinator.
           At first you may think that this job can be just done on a voluntary
           rota basis if at all possible it needs to be one person. Do not
           rule out acquiring professional help. Again, additional information
           of where this person might come from can be found further on in the
           pack.

What Does It Cost?


If we break down what we need it is not as difficult to price up.
Here we go:-


Visiting Party    :    5 Coaches
                   : Catering costs for 10 teams of 13 people= 130
                   :   20 Supervisors/Helpers
                       Match fee


Hosts             :    2 Buses
                   : Catering costs for 10 teams of 13 people= 130
                   :   20 Supervisors/Helpers
                       Match fee


How Do We Get The Cash?

There are a number of approaches which could provide the money
separately or in combination.

First, make a basic charge to participants.
Second, sponsorship from supporters club, pub, social club,
local industry.
Third, there are many grants - albeit one-off, available. To get
you started you can find this information in the directory of charitable
trusts which is available from your local library.

To start you off here are a few you could try (no promises mind):-

             Your local Round Table
             Your local Lions Organisation
        -   Buffalo's
        -   Sports Council
             City Council
             Youth and Community Service

Organise some fund-raising of your own. It does not have to be a bind.
Done right, it can produce a good return as well as being a lot of fun.
                APPROACHING YOUR PROFESSIONAL CLUB


We mentioned earlier in the pack an essential element of your
Matchmates was the involvement and support of your local club
particularly in terms of financial support, e.g. reduced entrance
fee .
                                  You are proposing a scheme
which will make a significant contribution to attitude and
behaviour in the sport of soccer. This is something which every
club needs to address for the long term future of the game.

Here is a list of points to consider which you may find helpful
in setting your approach at the right level.

a)   You have the support for your scheme from Sports Council
     and Football's Family Face.

b)   The Matchmates Scheme has been tried andtested around the
     country and proved effective and successful.

c)   You are making a major contribution towards the benefit of
      soccer at what is low financial output for the club.

d)   Your scheme provides an opportunity for the club to be
      involved at grass roots level with it's community.

e)   We are involved in a network which gives your group and
      your local club the ability to make a contribution to the
      game both locally and nationally.

Given the above, you probably now realise   thatwhat youhave got
is an attractive and viable proposition.
SAMPLE LETTER TO PROFESSIONAL CLUB




Dear Sir,

We are interested in operating a Matchmates Scheme in this area.
You may already be familiar with the Scheme. However, please find
enclosed an outline and framework of Matchmates.

The principle aims are to foster friendship in sport with youngsters
who could be vulnerable and susceptible to negative aspects of soccer
matches. The Scheme is supported by the Sports Council, Family Face
of football, the Minister of Sport and the Football Trust and is
considered to make an important contribution to the game.

Matchmates is not designed to replace any existing organised initiatives,
it is intended to compliment and involve such groups.

Given that Matchmates would be impossible to operate without your
support, we would welcome the opportunity to meet with you to discuss
the feasibility of running such a scheme in this locality.

Yours in Sport,
MATCHMATES - Information for Schools

1   Inform children and parent/guardian of actual costs:
                     £1.50 each participating child
                     £4.50 "        "         adult

    This amount covers:

                      Transport to and from morning venue and junior
                      match, to and from afternoon league match at
                      Stoke City.

                      Entrance into ground (undercover seating)

    It will be necessary for each school to collect the cash and make
    payment, in cheque form to "Matchmates". The Leisure and Recreation
    Department of Stoke-on-Trent City Council will then deal with all
    finance and transport arrangements on behalf of Matchmates.

2   Catering

    You will need a group of volunteers/parents who are willing to supply
    a small packed lunch for each child (both home and away team), and
    light refreshments for adults/helpers, ie tea, coffee, biscuits, etc.
    Also, a suitable venue. At a later date you will be given the exact
    numbers attending. A fairly accurate approximation would be:

    Home and Away team     comprising of 26 youngsters and 10 adults.

    Catering costs can     be kept to a minimum by:

    (a)   The host parent providing a packed lunch for their own child and
          one visiting child, possibly made up as follows:

          -   2   rounds of sandwiches
          -   1   packet of crisps
          -   1   chocolate covered biscuit (Kit-Kat, Mars, etc)
          -   1   apple

          (However you make them up they should all be standard)

    (b)   Alternatively you may wish to raise the relatively small amount of
          cash required for your catering. This, of course, could be done
          through the usual methods, eg sponsorship, activities, donations
          from local groups, pubs, clubs, etc.

3   Please remember to ensure your pitch and changing rooms are available.

4   Precise details and times of the days events, from the welcome at the
    Town Hall to the departure of the visitors, will be sent to you no
    later than one week before the event.
LEISURE & RECREATION * PRESS «tt-lCfcSR • LEISURE & RECREATION • PRESS RELEASE



On Saturday, 29th April, 1989, the City of Stoke-on-Trent plays host to
a party of school children, their friends and teachers from Leeds.
Children from the two cities are coming together as part of the
'Match Mates' Scheme which involves primary school youngsters from the
two cities playing football against each other in the morning before
going together to watch the professional match at the Victoria Ground
in the afternoon.

'Match Mates' is a concept designed to foster good will and friendship
throughout sport by providing a framework which is flexible enough to
be used by clubs, sporting agencies and local voluntary groups through
linking children from neighbouring cities who may not normally have the
opportunity to be involved in sharing experiences of sport and friendship.

Our visitors from Leeds will be greeted by the Lord Mayor at the Victoria
Hall, Hanley at 10.00 a.m. After a formal welcome and outline of the day
ahead, they will then be assigned to a school from Stoke and taken
together to that school's football pitch. After playing a twenty minute
each way game, the two schools will eat their lunch together, so becoming
friends before going to watch the professional game between Stoke City
and Leeds United.

This event is being televised by BBC Television as it is a contender in
the ’It’s Hy. City' competition in the category of projects which benefit
the community.

A detailed timetable of the day's activities is enclosed for your
information.

            An Initiative for A s s o c i a t i o n Football in South West England


INTRODUCTION:

1.   The Sports Council (South West) and the Football Association have developed
     proposals to expand the o pportun ities for participation in football in the
     South West.     The proposals will benefit, to a large extent, young people
     living in disadvantaged areas including young offenders and young people at
     risk.    It is hoped t herefore that they will be of relevance to the
     Intermediate Treatment Fund and can be considered for grant aid support
     from that organisation.

PROSPECT AIMS:

2.   The aims of the initiative are:

     (a)    To increase the opp o r t u n i t i e s for those who wish to play association
            football in the South West.

     (b)    To give special a t t e n t i o n to young offenders, young people at risk and
            those living in areas of disadv a n t a g e not only in the cities but also
            in sparsely populated rural areas.

     (c)    To recognise the needs of                 women   and    girls    who      may    wish     to   play
            footbal1.

PROPOSALS:

3.   The project will concentrate on a number of areas of work to complement and
     augment the w ork of the Football Association already developing in the
     region. In particular-.

            courses to train            Police and Probation Officers as coaches     will be
            offered.

     (b)    Existing coaching c e ntres                will be augmented              to     provide    greater
             opportunities in d i s a d v a n t a g e d areas.

      (c)   Liaison with education authorities will be developed to increase the
            involvement of school teachers in coaching children, including girls.

                        Neighbourhood Centre, Liverpool Personal Service
                        Society, but has established a voluntary management
                        committee.

Previous grants:        1532, £411   Football Kit and Equipment   1988.

Project description:    The Stanfield Junior Football Club is run by local
                        parents in the Anfield area of central Liverpool
                        adjacent to the Liverpool City F.C and has developed
                        from the Thirlmere Football Club.   Liverpool 5 is a
                        densely populated area of local authority terraced
                        housing built in the 1880's with newer areas of
                        cooperative   housing development.    The area     is
                        lacking in facilities with a wide range of social
                        problems and high levels of unemployment. There are
                        large   numbers of young offenders,      those   not
                        attending school, in residential care and at risk.

                        The Club is affiliated to the Liverpool Football
                        Association and to two local leagues; the Waversley
                        Junior Alliance for the 15-16 year age group and the
                        Scotland Road Junior league for those aged 11-12
                        years.    The club has facilities for       5-a-side
                        training and matches and through the summer plays in
                        the    Merseyside   Police   Football    Tournament.
                        Following successful seasons the club membership has
                        grown and there is a demand for places and kit and
                        equipment that is beyond the means of unemployed
                        local families or single parents.

                        In addition, with the support of the Thirlmere Road
                        Centre and L.P.P.S the club wishes to develop a new
                        objective, that of broadening the horizons and
                        aiding the understanding of young people from other
                        regions.   This will present young people with an
                        opportunity for travel and adventure directed to
                        children with limited knowledge and imagination who
                        often are denied annual family holidays away, due to
                        adverse economic circumstances.   It is intended to
                        create opportunities for residential experience and
                        activity   by competition in     away   competitions
                        including   the Canary Cup in Norwich and        the
                        International Youth Tournament, Scotland Cup, in
                        Ayr.   Transport and facilities will be provided in
                        association with LPPS and it is hoped that such
                        experience   will lead in future years       to   an
                        involvement in European travel and tournaments.
CONTD...1652 - STANFIELD JUNIOR FOOTBALL CLUB, ANFIELD, LIVERPOOL.

Frequency:              The teams meet on Friday evenings and for Sunday
                        matches   and   provide   associated   social    and
                        recreational opportunities during the week and group
                        visits   to league matches on Saturdays.        This
                        initiative will extend provision for long weekend
                        and other residential experience.

Clients:                Over 60 boys and some girls aged 10-16 years drawn
                        from the local estates with additional helpers
                        including older young women.

Volunteers:             The teams are     managed, trained and provided with
                        social support    by a voluntary group, many of whom
                        are unemployed,   but who have personal skills related
                        to football and   outdoor pursuits and youth work.

Statutory support:      The application is supported by a Social Work
                        Liaison   Officer   working   with   the   Thirlmere
                        Neighbourhood Centre and the Club has use of a local
                        recreation ground and school gymnasium in winter.

Staff observations:     The request results from the successful application
                        of previous support provided by the Initiative in an
                        area of high need and poor youth and           social
                        provision.    Resources will allow the Club to meet a
                        heavy demand for training and playing opportunities
                        and to meet a need identified in the           Report
                         'Football and Football Hooliganism in Liverpool'
                        June 1987    (Sir Norman Chester Centre). This drew
                        attention to the damaging regionalist prejudice and
                        parochialism evidenced by young people in Liverpool
                        and the need to recognise that any legitimate
                        community approach to football must have at its core
                        not only a collaboration of local attachments, but a
                        knowledge of and respect for other cultures and
                        other communities. This new Club Initiative results
                        from growing confidence and awareness of the social
                        role of football for those in trouble and at risk.

                        A grant is recommended from the Football     Trust
                        I.T. Fund Initiative.

Committee:              2 5th October, 1989.

Previous grants:        None.

Project description:    The   project has been developed by the        NACRO
                        Wolverhampton    Youth Unit in consultation     with
                        Bilston United Football Club, the Wolverhampton
                        Youth Service and The Sports Council of the West
                        Midlands and will operate in the Parkfields.   Rough
                        Hills and Pond Lane neighbourhoods three miles south
                        east of Wolverhampton and including the        large
                        Blakenhall hall Estate.    The area has no otheryouth
                        facilities and is made up of a multi problem
                        community    living in council flats and      1950's
                        terraced housing. The area contains many unemployed
                        and single parent households and is adjacent to a
                        'red light' district.      The area has a very diverse
                        local ethnic population with large numbers of black
                        and Asian youths.

                        With the assistance of the NACRO Unit and detached
                        youth work skills, groups of disaffected young
                        people have been identified through organised street
                        surveys and consultations with local young people.
                        As a result a range of needs and problems identified
                        by local young people have emerged.    However, the
                        desire to play football and related sports has been
                        paramount.   The result has been this new project to
                        develop football for local boys and girls and the
                        organisation of regular football training sessions
                        on a weekly basis with special programmes for the
                        school holidays.   A particular feature will be the
                        aim to involve parents in the operation of the teams
                        and to build in a close association with a semi
                        professional   football club which has      achieved
                        success within the West Midlands League and the
                        Walsall Youth League.     Coaching will be up to
                        Football Association standard.

                        Facilities are available in the centre of the area
                        with   a   pitch sized recreational     space    area
                        immediately adjacent to the Bilston ground, and with
                        changing and social facilities at the Club which is
                        currently unused during day and evening periods.
C0NTD...1654 - FOOTBALL COMMUNITY LINK PROJECT, WOLVERHAMPTON, W. MIDLANDS

                        It is intended that a full time development worker
                        will be based at the Club and will organise training
                        and match and holiday programmes, liaise with the
                        club, provide training and social support and youth
                        leadership and will maintain good relations with
                        parents.   The local community and the statutory
                        services will make referrals to the Project.     The
                        connection with the local club and approaches to
                        Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C will ensure the prestige
                        of the scheme and the quality of sports provision.
                        Video equipment will be used to aid coaching, but
                        will also be a facility for raising awareness and
                        social skills and examining problem behaviour.

Frequency:              This will be an intensive scheme and will provide
                        weekday, evening, weekend and holiday programmes.

Clients:                The Unit has liaised with local police and agencies

                        and criminal behaviour, resulting from under age
                        drinking and street corner groups. In addition glue
                        sniffing theft, petty vandalism and under age sex
                        are significant.   The project will target boys and
                        girls of all races aged 10 to over 16 involved in or
                        at   risk of entry into crime       and   antisocial
                        behaviour.

Volunteers:             Assistance will be provided by the membership of the
                        Bilston United Supporters Club and through local
                        churches   which are the base for other        NACRO
                        projects.   Also contact with local services will
                        provide a network for the attraction of voluntary
                        skills in addition to the support of parents.

Statutory support:      The project has been developed with the advice of
                        the Social Services IT Section and the Wolverhampton
                        Youth Service in respect of its recent        policy
                        review.   The Youth Services have agreed to be
                        partners in the appointment of the key worker and to
                        take funding responsibility following the first
                        year.

Staff observations:     This   project is the result of inter          agency
                        cooperation   and is a partnership of       agencies
                        responding to a local survey of juvenile        crime
                        issues and the lack of alternative recreational
                        provision.   The Sports Council of the West Midlands
                        are expected to provide joint funding for the first
                        year appointment of a key worker.    The project is
                        also a partnership with a very successful local semi
                        professional football club.    The project will be
                        monitored and given community development support by
                        the NACRO Wolverhampton Youth Activities Unit.

                        A grant is recommended from the Football    Trust

In responding to the Green Paper the Fund,
am ongst many others, felt confident in dra w in g on
the experience of the DHSS I.T. Initiative (launched
in 1983) concerned with young offenders under 17
years, in the belief that a number of the successful
features o f the LAC(83)3 initiative could be equally
successful with young adult offenders in the 17-21
age group. The Fund certainly endorses the
statement in the Green Paper that "m aking young
p eople face up to their offending a n d its
consequences has been one o f the successful
 features o f the Intermediate Treatment Schemes for
 juvenile offenders". The Fund also endorses the
 statement that "a m ajor objective o f the crim inal
 justice system is to reduce crime as well as to
 punish offenders".

The Fund considers that much of the success of the
I.T. Initiative has been due to the inter-agency
m anagem ent of facilities involving statutory and
voluntary agencies, the local community and local
magistrates. In social crime prevention schemes,
inter-agency co-operation has been equally
important, with groups of concerned individuals

serious social problems associated with a high rate
of juvenile unemployment, was producing a smaller
than expected number of applications. Various
avenues into the region w ere explored and a
number of voluntary and statutory contacts made.
As part of its Development Programme, the Fund
was invited into Rochdale to assist specifically in
the stimulation of voluntary projects with the aim of
 diverting young people from involvement in the
 court process. These approaches did increase the
 number of applications received from the region,
 but the increases w ere short-lived. It w as therefore
 decided to organise a consultation for practitioners
 in the region, in conjunction with the North W est

         Returning to the Green Paper: it is the Fund's view
         that 'punishment in the comm unity' could not be
         organised effectively from a national centralised
         base: rather, decisions on implementation should
         be taken at a local level. The groups taking these
p:/- .
         decisions should be inter-agency in composition,
         with community representation in addition to that
         from the probation service and other statutory
         agencies. They might also include representatives
         from local magistrates (which w ould provide some
         judicial supervision). Some such groups already
         exist in the juvenile justice field. These provide the
          probation service with the opportunity to contract
         with the voluntary and statutory agencies
          p articipating in the inter-agency group to provide
         the necessary elements of individual programmes.

         O p eratio n from a local base w ould ensure that the
         inter-agency groups w ould be able to respond to
         local circumstances, concerns, and facilities and
         make full use of local community effort. In addition,
         such local groups might assume an overall
         responsibility for the instigation and co-ordination

Taken together, these figures demonstrate a
g ro w in g awareness that local authorities are no
longer in a position to support voluntary groups to
the extent that they have in the past, and an
increasing reliance on charitable sources to fill the
funding gaps left. O ne in ten projects planned to
a pp ro ach the private sector for future funding; one
for exam ple had costed out each com ponent o f its
program m e and asked local businesses to sponsor
specific activities. W h ilst the involvement of local
firms in supporting projects is a very welcome
development, the increased time which is
 necessarily spent on fundraising and negotiating
 has a direct effect on the time given to planning
 and operating activities.

 I.T. sector, nor any lack of dem and for services.

Invitations to nominate individuals and projects for
the 1 9 8 9 a w a rd s have been sent out and the
trustees are hoping for an even b ig g e r response. In
considering w ays in w hich these selfless efforts can
be more w id e ly publicised the trustees w ould
w elcom e ideas and suggestions. The possibility of
locally o r regionally sponsored nominations
through local rad io o r television and the local press
is being explored. O r it m ay be that some national
companies m ight wish to sponsor special aw ards
for efforts to curb or prevent particular aspects of
juvenile crim e w hich are o f m ajor concern to those
companies. These aspects m ight include vandalism
on new estates, dam age to public facilities, shop­
lifting or prevention of solvent abuse.

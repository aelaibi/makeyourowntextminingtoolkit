         The rt~ have been few changes to Britain's football                  facilities
for decades. Since this match in 1910, only one major stadium has
been constructed. Then, police were a rare sight, these on duty
to protect Prime Minister Asquith, not to guard the thousands who
flock to see their favourite clubs. Many believe the problems
associated with modern day soccer are a result of lack of
investment.

         In many cases our grounds are in the same state as.., as...
as they were when people had outside loos. Our grounds haven't
changed, people's homes have changed, and we do put vast number.-
of spectators into very primitive and humiliating conditions.

         ■r was the rioting of the early                   '80s that eventually forced
f o v - 11 to change. The traditional family image replaced by huge
steel fences to keep the hooligans off the pitch. Of the 20 clubs
now in division one,               16 have some sort of fence, that leaves           Just
fours Arsenal, Queens Park Hangers, Luton, and West Ham which do
not cage in their supporters. But the fences will now come dovn
at several clubs. Both Spurs and Derby County have joined
Liverpool in deciding to tear the barriers down.

         What has happened in football up to now is that measures
have been taken that were anti-hooligan, and also separate
measures were taken relating to safety.                      I   think the time has come
now where both of these problems must be faced together,

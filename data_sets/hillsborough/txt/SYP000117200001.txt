            Saturday           13 A p r i l       1989       I was     assigned            to S e r i a l      5 with         other

            Briefing           in N o r t h      Stand.           Duties        to    include          security          of    car       park        and

            BBC     units       situated             in L a p p i n g s    Lane       car     park,         turnstiles          19-22           for

            the     Notts,        f a ns.        Barriers          were      erected and manned                      by P o l i c e       officers

            at     two    points          creating           a sterile          area.         One      barrier        at      the    end        of

            South Stand              at    a    point        level     with       turnstile            E,    the     second         at    the        side

            of     blue     st e e l      gates       n e ar    to m a i n      entrance          to L a p p i n g s       Lane.          Once        the

            19-22        turnstiles             opened         there      was     a steady          flow       of N o t t s .       Forest           fans

            all     of w h i c h       were      very well            behaved.

            At     approximately                2 , 3 0 pm     I had      cause       to     escort         two L i v e r p o o l        f a ns      from

            t he    sterile          area       back     to     the L e p p i n g s        Lane     end.         I r e m a i n e d at           the

            Leppings           Lane       end    du e    to     the    l a r ge      amount       of    fans.         1 was         in    company

            with      other      officers.               I assisted             with       the    crowd        control.         The       crowd

            seemed        to    be     increasing              in n u m b e r s      by    the    second.            The      fans       were        very-

            aggressive           and       abusive           towards       officers.              I could          see     fans      climbing

            over      turnstiles               and    over      the    top      of    the     gates.           The    whole         crowd

            seemed        to    be     pushing          forward        continually.                 Mounted Police                  arrived

            from      the      sterile          area     and      attempted           to     push      t h e fans        back.           Th e

horses       were         being    pushed          about      and      hurled          abuse       and    anger       at    by the

fans.        The       fans,      th e    majority          of w h a m       arrived          late,       were     mostly         worse

the w e a r       for      drink.         I wa s      informed          by w o r d       of m o u t h      that       the     ’kick

off     had       been      delayed          for      15 m i n u t e s ,     this message                was    relayed          to    the

fans.        The      horses       managed            for     a s h o r t t i m e to m o v e             the    fans    clear          of

the    blue       gates.          It     then      became        apparent          that       there       was     some      sort       of

trouble         to    the       front     of L e p p i n g s      Lane       as    most       of    t he M o u n t e d      Section

moved       in t h a t      direction           leaving          one    Mounted          officer,,         th e    fans      were

again       pushing         towards          the    blue      gate.          There       was       continual          abuse       from

the    fans.          A    short       time     la t e r    recall         the     blue       gates       being       opened.

The    following            scene        was    terrible,             fans    were       pushing,          running,          fighting

their       way      through       th e      gates       like     a    stampede,           people         were     being

carried         through.           Again        anger       and       abuse       was    directed          towards          Police

officers.             One       fan was        pulled       from       the    crowd with             two       cans    of    beer.

Others       asked         if    they     could       stand with             us as       they were             frightened.                  I

have    no      recollection              of    any        stewards checking                  tickets,          I saw       one       of

the    stewards            stood       flat     against           a wall          to    avoid being            injured.          The

gates       were       eventually?             after a        short        t ime,       pushed      together           to a l l o w

o n 1y o n e / 1 w o       farts t h r o u g h        at a t i m © .         Fans were           f i 11e r e d t h r o u g h          by

the    Mounted            Section        and    told        to    have tickets            in full          view       for

examination.                I was        not    aware         of a n y s t e w a r d s .

At    3pm    I can         recall        hearing        the      crowd       inside        the      pitch       cheering.              I

assumed       they         had    gone       ahead with           the      match.         This       aggravated             the       fans

out s .id e .        T h e a t rno s p h e r e b e c a m e q u i t e         volatile.

A    short    time,         Inspector           Harvey,          who    was       stood       c l os e    by me       received a

radio       message         that       the     fans     had      invaded          the    pitch,          all    available

officers          onto      pit c h .        Myself,        DC    Fairclough,             DC C r a i g i e ,      Inspector

Harvey       and      other       officers          immediately              ran       back    towards          the    blue       gates

in    the    sterile            area,     ran      past     the     Police         Control          Room       along       the

gangway       and         onto    th e    pitch.           1 could         see     a    lot    of    f a ns     running          about
                                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                                     R81

on    the    pitch       shouting.               I immediately                  ran    to w h e r e        I could          see      -fans

climbing          over       the    metal        fencing            of    the       West    Stand       terracing              directly

behind       the       goal .        I ran       towards            the    fencing.             I could          see      fans        b ei n g

lifted       up    onto       the     second          tier      of       terracing.            When        1 reached             the

fence       1 could          no t    believe          what      t    saw.           I saw masses            of    people,            young

people       squashed             against        the       fe n c e .       I saw       one     girl,       her      lips        were

blue,       her    face       was     purple,          she      had       vomit       around         her    mouth         and     nose,

her    eyes       were       closed,           it w a s     obvious            she w a s       dead.        As    I continued                    to

look    1 realised what                    had       happened            and    saw more            people       squashed

against          the    fence        horrifically               disfigured,                s o me    not m o v i n g ,         others

crying       out       for    help        others       screaming               in s ho c k ,        other     f an s      were        walking

over    other          people.            The    fans       were         s t ill     climbing         over       the      metal         fence.

X ran to w h e r e            a gate           had    been      opened          I, c o u l d    see     fans      being          crushed

as    they       tried       to      escape          through         the       gate.        I went         back      to     the       fence,

climbed          onto    the        advertising              boards        and       began      to    pull       people          up f r o m

behind       the       fence.         I r e ca l l         a supervisory                officer         pulling           me     and

shouting          "Tell       them        to    get    back         away       from     the     fence” .          I started                 to

shout       to    the     fans       as    instructed.                   Numerous          fans      then     ra n     to      the      left

side    of a d i v i d i n g          fence          and    started            to    shout      abuse       at    me      saying            “W h y

don't       you    do    something.                  People         are     dying       you     bastards."                " I t ’s y o u r

fucking          fault       you     bastards."               "Why        don't       you      get    in h e r e . ”           1 shouted

until       X was       hoarse.            I went          back      to     the      fence,         it wa s      horrific,              I

could       not    get       over     the       fence,        I c o u l d n ’t get             into     the      terracing             to

help    and       people          were     dying       in f r o n t         of me.          I went         back      towards           one

of    the    gates       I could           see P o l i c e          officers          inside         the    terracing             b e i ng

pulled       back,        pushed          and abused            as       they       tried      to    climb       over       the

dividing          fence.            I could          see    bodies          being       passed        over       the      fe n c e ,        some

were    dead,          some       almost        dead       others         badly       hurt.          I began         to     help       to

Policewoman-                  1    again       went       back       to the        fencing and                continued          to       help

to    carry        people          o u t ■1 w a s        continually             pushed         out           of    the    way       by    fans?

who    by     this       t im e     were       helping          the     Police         with     the       injured.              1 heard             a

supervisory              officer          stood          nearby       shout        get    all    the          fans    b ac k     of f      the

pitch        to m a k e       room       for       the    injured-              1 turned        and att em pt ed                to    move

wandering           fans          towards          the      centre         of    the     pitch a ga in              coming       up

against        anger          and abuse.                 1 can       remember          seeing        other          Police       officers

trying        to    resuscitate                people        who      were       dead.        I again went                 back       to       the

fencing         by w h i c h        time       the       terracing          was      clearing.                There       was    still

bodies        at    the       front.           I can        remember            seeing       a young           girl

approximately                 16-17       years          squashed          against        the f e n c e         again,          blue,       her

eyes    open,!                                                                            she w a s           still       clinging             to

the    fence wit h                her    right        hand,      he r      face     turning          a    p al e     yellow          colour

again        she w a s        dead.           I tried        again         to    get     through          the       gate    1 was          this

time     elbowed          out       of    the       way     by a      fan.         I d o n ’t k n o w          how    long       all       this

took     to    happen,             it s e e m e d        like    a    life       time.        I then           noticed          most       of

the    fans        walking          on    the       pitch       begin       to     run    towards             the    ’Hop*       end       of

the    pitch where                 the N o t t s . F o r e s t          fans were.              My       initial          thought          was

*O h m y      god,       if       they    get       to    them       the    same       sort     of       thing       is    going          to

happen        over       there*.              I set       off    running          and     began          to    pull       the    Liverpool

fans     back.           They were             very       angry       and abusive,              the       fans were             then

cordoned           off    by a          line       of P o l i c e     officers           across          the       centre       of    the

p i t ch .      I ca n        remember             seeing       photographers                whilst           I was       in th e         midst

of    the     incident             standing           and    taking         photographs,                 o ne w a s       stood       at       the

side     of me.           Why       was       he    not     helping.             They are        like          vultures,             picking

up the w o r s t          photograph                they     c o ul d .         It s i c k e n e d       me.

When     all       the    fans          had    left       the    stadium,            1 walked            back       towards          the

terracing           and       saw       the    blue       barriers          that       had    g i v e n way.              The    pressure

must     h a ve     been          unimagineable.                 They       looked        like       t wo      pieces       of       twisted
                                                                                                                    PAGE

  pipe      cleaners.

  There      is m u c h m o r e       that   I can   remember            bu t    it   is v e r y    jumbled        and

  c o mes    back       only    as    flashes    in m y m i n d     and         I cannot     remember         at    what

  point      it h a p p e n e d ,       1 will   never     as long        as     1' live     forget       the      sight

  that      me t   my    eyes    as     Ireached     the    fe n c e ,    the         feeling      of b e i n g    useless

  and    very      frustrated           because    Ic o u l d   not      help         the   people who        were

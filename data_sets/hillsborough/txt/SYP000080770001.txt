                    My seat was       in the S ou th S ta nd uncovered            seats adjacent           to the West

                    Stand.     The Police     control         box was about       ten yards        to my    left and

                    s li ghtly behind me.          It was about         1.30pm    133Q when         I took up my match

                    viewing     position.

                    The    build up to the game was             no different       to any other match.

                    At about 2 . 4 0 pm 1440       I noticed that         pens 3 and 4 on the West S tand

                    terraces were full        but    the areas      either       side were half empty.                The

                    W or t h S tand which was       opposite was well            populated but there were               still

      ^             plenty of spare       seats.

         ^          At a b o u t ,2.53   1453 1 noti ced that           people were      being      pulled up from the

                    terraces     into the West S t a n d seats.            About    two minutes         later    I noticed
    d-
                    people     climbing    over    the fence from         pen 3 into         pen 2 .

                    At 3 .00    1500 I noticed a po 1 i ceroarytf'Timb along                 the   railings     that

                    separate     the South S t an d seat,j^and Hest S t an d terraces                   in order       to get

                    to the Felice Control           R qojiK    He then began banging on the                  front and

                    side    of the   b o x . . I ^ fotTld not unde r s t an d why he d i d n ’t a pp ro a ch the

                    control    box from the w a lk wa y and go            in via the door.

                    I saw that       people were     climbing      out of    pens 3 and four and standing

                                             I did not see a great deal

                                     I can only state          that the area was
                                                                                        of    crowd m ov ement

                                                                                                                      behind



                    I then saw a WPC also           climb the      railings       up towards        the Police        control

                    box .

                    More and more        people were      climbing over the             perimeter      fencing.        There

                    were Police Officers           gesturing      for    people    to    push b a c k w a r d s „Many more

                    supporters were        being    pulled up into the seating area.

                    At about 3.05pm        1505 about         forty Police Officers            came from the S outh

                    S ta n d a nd made    their way to the area behind the g o a l .                    Suppo rt er s       at

                    this    stage were beginning          to spill       into the goal         area.

A Police Officer            ran onto the         pitch and the game was s t o p p e d.             There

were a lot of         people     in the goal are a as the               players made       their way

off the      pitch.

There were Police Officers                 on the fencing          h e l p i n g people   climb over.

Suppo r t e r s    began making         their way over         to the area       in front      of where       I

was   sitting.        Many of them         looked pale and were             sweating.

A couple of N o t ti n gh a m Forest             supporters      began hurling abuse at               the

Liverpool         s upporters who were           clearly upset.

At about 3 . 1 Qpm       1510    I saw a young          lad carried over towards me and

laid on the         ground.       There were about          four people around            him including

a .Police Of f i c.e r .      The      lad was    being   given the kiss of life

by members         of the group.          I cannot      recall     who exactly was         giving mouth

to mouth.         After a few minutes             people ar ou nd him began           cheering        for a

few moments         before    resus ci t at io n    continued.

I can only describe             the     lad as being white,           aged between        14-20.      My

view was      obscured by the            people ar ou nd him.

My a t t e n t i o n was then drawn to a white male with a large                          build.      He

was wearing         grey trousers which were               round his ankles.           There was        a

large     brown     stain on hi's underpants              and he was unconscious.               The

people who         carried him over           began trying       to    rescusc'itate him.          I did

not see his         face.

1 then saw tWe Police               had formed a line across               the   centre    of the      pitch.

Injured      people were        being     s t re tc he re d over      towards    the k o p .

I saw an/ a m b u la nc e arrive and drive towards                     thex West S t a n d .    At this

pSKjjnt^J m e r e we re 1 iteral ly thousands             of    people     on the    pitch.

The   fire    brigade a r ri v e d and         instructed supporters around me to move

to the sides         in order       to make a gangway to              carry out     casualties.

As t h e ,injured       people were        carri        over towards        the wall at        the side

     As    I was     going    back      into the groj/nd I saw a man being s t re tc he re d out

     of the ground by a group of                   people          consisting       of stewards,        St Johns

     I went     back     inside /nd saw a young                 lad ofi a stretcher.                He was aged

     Liverpool        s h i rX»     He was    conscious         but w an t ed to go to sleep.                 I

     helped     caV ry him outside and remained with him and kept talking to him.

     During     the time          I spent with him            I could see that the man I had seen

     carried out was              being    given m outh to mouth.                  This    continued for what

     a pp ea r ed to be a long time and                  I never saw him regain consciousness.

     I told a Police Officer who was with me that he                                   cou)/a go      back   inside

     as    I would     remain with the young                  boy.     The       po 1 ip^man   left but      returned

     Ln.      He was still          conscious when he was                 placed      in the ambulance.

     I went     back     into the         ground and      remained there              until about       ten minutes

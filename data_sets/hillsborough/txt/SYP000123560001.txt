At 3,.00 pm (1500) as a result of information received on our personal

radios,      the Serial and Inspector DEWS attended the Leppings Lane                                                                      gale.

The Leppings Lane gate was designated for the arrival and admission of

Liverpool, fans.,                     On my arrival at the gate there were                                  perhaps fifty

officers already in attendance,                              but there only appeared to be two

turnstiles           in use.             I could see that on tne otner si as of                                     v,he

P o 1ice Officers move to stop these                               illegally entering but due to the

A steward moved to the gate and continued to hold the gate closed by

what    looked like two                   calliper bars situated at the top of the gates.,

A few seconds           later a Police                 Inspector told us all .to                             be prepared for

-'incredible.           1 linked arms with other officers                    close to me and we

formed a cordon perpendicu lar to the gate to prevent supporters

 rushing into the open western et\d of the Leppings Lane                                   ter race,     which

w-asf u l l     and to      channel    them down behind the Leppings Lane terrace,                                  to

 alleviate the pressure outside the gate.

The gates were opened and up to 1,000 supporters                                 rushed m ,       many were
        ' ~                      "

 in obvious            state of shock and distress,               some even being            carried oy

 others.         Many were abusive and smelt of intoxicants,                           and      j. heard one

 supporter say,            "WHY WEREN'T THE GA1ES OPENED SOONER?"

 As they came in some supporters tried to show their                                  tickets.        Aboui,

    minutes after the gate was opened I heard over my personal                                       radio tor

’ our Serial          to go to the front          of the Leppings Lane terrace.                     Led by

 Sergeant KNIGHTS we went onto the pitch via the stand close to the

 L. e p p i n g s L ane gate.

 As I ran onto the pitch X could see people                            crushed up against the

 perimeter fence            in the terrace behind the goal mouth,,                         I could see

 their        arms for the fans to move backwards.                        There was also a line                of

 photographers            close to the fence taking               photographs.           I could see a

 line of hoardings behind the goal                      that would hinder             possible       rescue

 attempts,            so I began to remove the security pins and take down the

 h 0a r d j.n g s .

 After        perhaps a minute         1 looked       up and saw that the crush ai the

fence         was worse and some          people looked to be i n serious di -ff 1 cul lies,

 some unconscious.              1 could see that the gate                 in the mi adIe pen was

 open but due to the             rush and pressure of people trying to get out,                                 it

was     impossible for P C ’S to get in and help the                          injured.

As a result of this              1 ran to the gate to the first                     pen (western end of

I saw that             police     officers        were     trying      to    pull       down the       fence wi i,n

their      bare hands without                 success       so at      this       point    1 climbed           over     tne

spiked       railings          and saw a         ' p i l e 5 of    people a i l         laid down         on    top ot

outwards.under             the      pressure.           There were          perhaps 50-60           people        in this

pile     with     some at         different         levels        of the     pile moaning and struggling

to     release         themselves,,         There were            others who were              cyanosed and

unmoving.

After      climbing        o v er    the     railings       I had      to    fight       my way     to    the     front        of

Witlh a burly supporter              nearby we .began to pull the people out of the

pile..     Many "Of these were .entangled with one another and so it was

very difficult to separate them,.

As I dragged people out of the pile,                        those who were          cyanossd I tried

to give mouth to mouth or nose and heart massage                                to those whose          puise

I couldn't feel .            I d i d n ’t have much success.

I decided that those              I pulled out and not showing signs of life would

receive 6 guick breaths?                6 pumps at heart massage anu                    then .oe passed

on to officers and fans at the railings who would then pass the

casualties to the            pitch for       proper attention,,             At this      point     i saw

that several P C ”3 were a t t e m p t i n g           to   pull aown t h e        fencing with their

supporters        to pass      it on to the gate.

     I saw a large              crowd gathering outside                    the     turnstiles,           fighting          and

     f rant it to gain ertt r y .                  People were           screaming        and shouting at                  the

-officers              inside     to open the            large        door as      people, were          getting          crushed

     oft the other          s ide of          the    doo r .      I tou 1 d see          that the       1 ar ge steel door

 was        bowing        under     the       pressure          of -the    people        pushing        on    it.     1

     could hear           people       screaming         on     i-ne other        side     o4    the    go   or .     rtf Lei     a

     few minutes           the    door was          opened and a flood of people                         came        in    the

     door,       some     being     carried with their                   fast, o -tf      the ^ lout »         Nurne, v ou^i

     people were           gasping        for      breath,,       1 could see            the feelings           were        very

     high as        people       protested at            the doors          not    being opened.



     After       the    initial        f lood of       people we made              our way to the l...ep o :i,ng s Lane

     terrace.,         via the      side       of the         ground,,     As we made our way to the                            pi ten

     J could see           that     the       s~eppi. n q s    Lane      ter race       i n front      of the goal          was

     full     to    capacity,            I    saw that persons were                being        crushed against                  the

     fence       (perimeter         fence)         unable       to move,,         The    exit     gate was -open,                But

     however        due    to     the     crush the persons were                   unable       to break        free,.           It

     became        obvious        that       numerous         persons at      the       front were a l r e a d y

 w i d t h of the gate-                      We    tried to warn the              crowd to move              back    to assist

down to the Le ppi ngs Lane                   end of the ground.

We    began to walk         down the          pitch towards                the Leppings         Lane       end.     there

were    no players         on the, pitch and as                  I w a l k e d down the g r o u n d           I could

As    I got    closer' to the Leppings                    Lane       and    I could see         that       several

police       officers      were      stood on the              fences       and were a t t e m p t i n g      to    puli

were    clearly unable               to move.

There was an a l m i g h t y           crush going             on and       people       behind      the    fences       were

in a state       of     pari it:,.     On    looking       to my       right         I saw that a gate             benma

attempting        to    pull    peoole        over       the    fences.           I could see         that    the

bottom half           of the    gate was           blocked       by a pile of             people who         had been

of    rank    (pass an inspector)                  was    giving       instructions .through a

them on to the            pitch.        At    this       stage all          the      people    I carried through

were    alive,        although        they were          complaining            of    injuries such as             crushed

dragged anyone            clear,       I left       them on the             pitch and         returned to the

dead,     and    by this       time         several       officers       had gat        into the        pen and had

begun to        pull    people         off    the    pile    from the           back.     This was          possible as

other     people -on the          terraces, had             retreated and there, was a space                          of a

               i n structed          us to    go down to the L e p pings Lane                      end.    By this       time the

               players were            off    the       pitch.,

               At     that stage           I could see       people        on the      pitch at the L e p pings             Lane

the terraces            behind the goal,.

At     this    time     I could see that             the gate       to    pen three was           open and           in

fact     I spent       time with a number               of' other       officers       trying        to    clear     the

gate w a y of     people w ith the              intention of getting               onto     the      terraces.

About     the same       time     I remember           seeing     a senior        officer with a

megaphone,,       by the       gate,,       trying     to organise         people.,       Unfortunately

there was a lad,              who was       still      alive,     who    had     his    legtrapped            right

I was    tapped on the             back and saw that o f f icers were following Sergeant

in the m o u t h of         the    gate and          I assisted          in e x t r a eating         people.       Those

had    to work       over    him.

I climbed to the             top of       the fence and began                    to    press    over    the    small

                During     this      time      I wo r k e d with Police C o n s t a b l e 92 Price,                and our

arrival          at the       iar^e      concertina          doors     I saw a large           group ot

spectators             standing        inside        the ground        near    the     gates.     As    I approached

I was met          by a torrent               of    insults     from these       spectators who were

de man ding        that       the     gates        be. opened," and that         people        outside were             being

“crushed and t r a m p l e d to death.

At       this    time    I. noti c e d a strong               smell    of alcohol        in the area.

I then stood             in a cordon along with other                         officers at the           right       hand

side       of    the gate wh i l s t           they were        opened.,

When       the    gates       opened       c r o w d s 'of    people    surged       into the     ground

sweeping rne to the                   side.         As the     rush of       people     coming    into      the     ground

sufcsi ded        I was       to 1 d to go          i nto    the g round whe re the re was              t roub 1 e            3.

On       reaching         the    fence        I saw an elderly man and a woman                    pressed up

against          the     fence        their faces were              purple and       they a pp e a r e d    to     be dead

 1 then         ran to the          gate      in that        section    of fencing.            On reaching          the

qate       I saw       it was a l r e a d y open.              I then began a s s isting           other          officers

to       pul i people •thro u g h the gate.                     Howe v e r    this was made        d i fficult           due

to the          bodies    being        compacted.             After    E 3 bodies        had been dragged out

 I heard         someone        shout „ "THEY ARE ALL. DEAD UNDER HERE."

On       looking       into     the    space made after               the    bodies     were    removed       I could

see a large             c o m p r e s s i o n of bodies and            tangle    of arms and           .i.eg s.     a    ti ien

began       pulling       bodies         dragging           them over       to the     edge    of the      pitch.,

Some       of the       bodies        a p p e a r e d alive     but    injured others a p p e a r e d             dead.

                       At S. 30          prfi (1430)    1 commenced my meal                 in the     gymnasium of        the    stadium

                       with the           rest      of my serial,,       (under     the      control     of Sgt 2916 K N I G H ‘1S) .

                       the        turnstiles.          They were a g g r e s s i v e and using offensive                   language,
                                                                                                        page:         2

saying,       "Open 'the gates,          people are          getting       killed out there," and

" T h e r e ’s -fucking trouble          out     there,      y ou'd better         do something."

Almost     all    the    people who         spoke     to me      smelled strongly of alcohol.,

1 his abuse       came    from the major i.ty of                 people    entering     the ground and

was    directed at myself and other'officers.                              I then    looked through the

t u rnstiles and         I could see s o m e b o d y         in the       crowd outside       on the floor

and struggling           to get       to his feet.,Also            people were ■cl imb'ing over               the

wall,    over     the    t u rnstile      into the         ground and everyone entering was

extremely, agitated,            and a number were                 p h ysically aggressive.

The    conc e r t i n a gates at        the side          of the    turnstiles were, obviously

under    extreme        pressure      from the outside as                 they were     bending       towards

me..    After     a time      (which seemed            longer      that    it a c t u a l l y was)    the

concertina        gales were         opened by a Police Officer                    (u n k n o w n ) and a

s;te ward,,      This    released a flood of                pa o pie wno were         i n a d i s t r e s s e a anu

most    just     rushed      past    towards        the    pitch.

As a unit we then made                our way to the              front    of the -Loppings Lane

terrace,       via a gate        between the           terrace and         the stand.        We     continued

onto    the    pitch behind the goal                 where       I saw the     people      in the     terrace

oushed up against             the    perimeter         fence,      due    to the    number     of    people     in

that    section of the           terrace,.          The    people at the        front      of the     terrace

were    unable      to move      at ail,         and even at        this    stage,     it was apparent

that    some     p e o p 1 e were    dead or        c1ose to d e a t h .

I made my way to the                e m ergency exit         gate    situated       to the     left    side     of

the    goal.      This    gat to? was    open,       but    due to the       extreme       pressure     of

people,       it was     e x t r e m e l y difficult        to    pull    people    from    the     terrace.,

With other        officers      we formed a chain-,                passing     the dead and          injured

from    the terrace          back    onto     the    pitch.        Some    officers a t t e m p t e d to get

             the     crowd        in the    terrace     to move     back        by shouting & making             gestures,

             but     they       received verbal         abuse and and            I even saw      items,      ma i n l y    coins,

                   I    could see          that      the    terrace     in front            of the        goal was full to over

Lane     end of the            ground.         In view of this,                Inspector S E W E L L directed

myself ahd 9 Police                   Const a b l e s * who were           close at hand,            to make        our

way    to the. Lep pings' Lane                 end    in an attempt              to alleviate         the    problem.,



On    route       to the L a p p i n g s Lane end             I saw a problem d e veloping at a set

of    3<3r^ s blue           coloured       c o nee r L i via cioo,' s «       .s. saw   p b r s u fi^ u 11molny        ovet

the doors          in an effort, to gain entry,.                         I could see through                the

t u rnstiles           that    persons were           on the floor             outside     the      ground and due

to the       crowd they were                unable     to get       to their        feet.        Pers o n s were

screaming at us thro u g h the turnstiles                                to open the doors             or    people

would       be    c.rushed .

After       what a pp e a r e d ,1'j ke several              minutes        the    door was         opened and a

large       flood       of    people     entered shouting                and     complaining at          the      crush..

|\iume rous were             gas p :ing f o r breath sorne c 1ose                 to u n c 0ns c :i.ousness        t he

ma j o r i t y    visibly       shocked,,



After       the    initial        flood      had died down              1 took my officers             to the       front

of the Leppings                Lane    terrace        via the south              side    of the      ground.        As we

made     our way onto            the     pitch,       I could see           that     the Leppi n g s        Lane

terrace          in front       of    the    goal was        full       to over      capacity,,        As    I looked

at    the    front       of    the    terrace        1 saw    that       persons were         being      crushed

against          the    perimeter        fence       unable     to move.           The    bodies afJpeared to be

s i:< 0 r ss ven deep.                The    ex i t g-atte was          0 pen however , due           to the       vo 1ume

On our arrival           we were met by fans who                  screamed and           pleaded with          us to

The    gate was        bulging     due       to the       pressure    being    exerted on         it.     The

gate was        opened       for approx         one minute      to ease       the   pressure,,          As the

then she breathed*.                      I, then    pulled her out a bit further                        but      her       leys

It was       obvious         at     this    point       that we      could not get any more                      out the

the fencing            beside        the    gate and began           pulling        people         over.         Several

c hildren were             passed to the                front and we          pulled them over.                  Several

                                                                                                        I

After we got all                   the    bodies     out onto        the     pitch and they were                    taken to

screaming and              pointing         at     us angrily.

After      a while         1 made my way onto                  the    pitch.

My    colleagues were                standing        around       in small groups/               many     crying,           some

Fans     too,      sat     crying         on the     pitch and trying               to    console       each other.

At about 4.40              pm      (1640)       I was     instructed along with some                      other PC's                to

s t retching          from the       road right across               the w idth of the turnstiles.

Crowds        of    people were          still      arriving        f rain e i the r direction,.             There were

a t ' least        half a dozen men                climbing       over ’the walls and gates                                            j

Some    were at shoulder                height,         some at waist          hei-ght and some were

dragged out- along               the    floor.                                            '

had to     pull many         people        through over           the    top of them             inevitably

minutes      must    have        been s e r i o u s l y    injured.         The    first was a white male,

man-.to my side- and               placed him on the grass                   in the     recovery         position.

He was     blue       in the       face     but        breathing     steadily.        I returned to. him

After     the    crush had           receeded. I was aware                 that the mesh at eitner                          side

                 at Sheffield for the semi final football match between Nottingham

We* all travelled to West Bar Police Station by transit van and paraded

there for briefing at 9#r» (0900).      Chief Inspector KING conducted the

briefing, Superintendent BATES was officer in charge.        After briefing,

personal radios were issued, one radio between two officers, but it

was found that there wasn't enough radios to go round. So myself and

PC TATTERSHALL teamed up with PS SWIFT having one radio between the

three of us. We were then joined by two officers from the HQ Drug

Squad, who were attached to our serial working in uniform, one of whom

was PC 3211 PRIESTLEY.     The other Drug Squad officers name I don’t

know.   We we re each given a packed lunch.

Our allotted     duty was to attend at Midland Station and escort     the

Notts Forest fans and Liverpool     fans who would be   arriving by train,

separate them at the station and put them on a number of double decked

PSV's provided by South Yorkshire Transport. After the fans were

placed in their respective buses they were transported to the

Hillsborough Stadium being escorted by 2 P C ’s per PSV. Then marshalled

off the buses and into the stadium. The P C ’s would then return to the

Midland Station.

We attended at the Midland Station and. commenced our duties at 10am

(1000) that date.

My serial remained at the station all the time, not travelling with

any of the football fans    on the P S V ’s.

All the fans     who arrived at the station were well   behaved and

co-operated with our requests. All appeared to be d e c e n t ,   genuine

football fans from both teams. There were exceptions when one or two

of the younger element from both Notts Forest an i Liverpool tried to

get through the cordon and into the city and using all sorts of

reasons«   The snooker tournament being one of them.

Each of these were searched and when football tickets were found on

them they were sent to their respect P S V ’s without putting up much

argument. This was the way in whi^hrmy serial dealt with the fans

filtering the non-fans through tWe, stat|Sn,gates» but the vast

majority did what they were requested to do. There were no unpleasaht

situations at the station, everything was good humoured having a

laugh and a joke with some of the fans from both sides..

At about 2.25pm (1*423) we were informed by the British: Transport

Police that all the expected football fans who were travelling by

train had arrived at Midland Station and that they were not aware of

any large groups of fans still being in the rail system.

In view of this, my serial along with other officers from other

serials,   boarded the P S V ’s at Midland Station and were transported to

the Hillsborough Stadium.

The route taken by the driver of the PSV in which we were travelling

took us along Middlewood Road past Hillsborough Park and right into

Leppings Lane.    I noticed that there were large crowds of people

walking along Leppings Lane towards the football ground.      These people

were walking on the pavements and into the road on both sides of

Leppings Lane. As we neared the corner of the road where the entrance

road is to the turnstiles at Leppings Lane, the area was completely

swamped with football fans.    I could only see Inspector SYKES who was

standing on the corner to the entrance and he was totally surrounded

with Liverpool fans.    It was like a sea of faces in that area

stretching from half way along the pavement from the junction with

Vere Road and well past Gate C at the Leppir*gs Lane turnstile.      This

area of the turnstiles was wall to wall people who seemed to be packed

into that area.    I could see several fans climbing over the top of the

gate.   I did not see any Police Officers in this area, unless they
                                                                    PAGE      'Ar
                                                                    SE173

were lost in the sea of people.     I could see two mounted offie«fs*who

were completely surrounded also and were quite obviously struggling,

to control this crowd of. fans.    It would be fair to say that this. are<a

at this time w a s totally congested with f a n s tryiitg tq get into the

ground   at these turnstiles and still more large numj&ers of fans were

converging on Leppings Lane from the direction of POnistone Road                  i

Middlewood Road.
With difficulty the driver of the bus in which we were travelling

managed to work a way through the fans making their way along Leppings

Lane from the direction of Penistone Road, towards the turnstiles at

the rear of the West Stand.    I could hear on other officers'    radios

that officers at the Leppings Lane turnstiles were shouting for

assistance.    I couldn’t make out any specific request only calls for

assistance and more mounted officers to attend at this location.         I

have worked football duty at Hillsborough stadium on more than

several occasions during my service,    including a number of semi

finals, but I have never seen such a large number of fans at the

Leppings Lane end at that time of day, the area was totally over-run.

This would have been at 2.50pm (1450).

At about 2.55pm (1455) we arrived outside the gates to the North Stand

in Penistone Road and debused.     My serial went straight into the

gymnasium where we were to be held on standby as a reserve serial.           We

managed to get a hot drink and were just about to eat our packed

lunches, having only been seated for a matter of a minute when

Sergeant SWIFT told us we had to leave because we were required on the

track in front of the West Stand.     We immediately left the gymnasium

and went into the playing area of the stadium.      This was before 3pm

(1500), because as we entered the playing area,     I saw players from

both teams on the football pitch warming up.

We walked along the track in front of the North Stand towards the West
                                                                      PAGE       :

Stand and when passing some fans in the North Stand I heard some of

them "hissing'*.    As we made our way along the track, there was no

indication to us at this time, that anything was wrong in the West

Stand of the stadium.
My serial a| this time, including myself consisted of PS SWIFT, PC

TATTERSHALL, PC MCKENZlE, PC AKRED* PC TAYLOR, PC PACKER and PC

COOPER. We reached the corner of the track between the North Stand and

the West Stand, and without looking too carefully I got the

impression that the area was not as full as the West Stand appeared to

be.   As we began walking along the track in front of the West Stand

the noise was deafening.     The whole stadium seemed to be shouting but

I didn’t take any particular    notice at this time, this sort of

behaviour not being unusual for a game of this importance. PC Packer

was in front of me at this time. As we made our way further along the

track towards the South Side I began to sense something was not quite

right.   I   could see at this time that there   werealready three   other

Policemen standing on     the track in front of us.    As I neared   Gate 4, I

realised that the people in the    West Stand    were not shouting but were

screaming.
I realised then that something was seriously wrong and I heard people

in the crowd screaming,    "Let us out," "Oh God help us."     I looked at

the people in the crowd and I could see by their faces and that people

were crushed up against the fencing and they were clearly in a

desperate situation.     I immediately grabbed the officer on the track

and asked him to get some assistance to us.       I knew that I had to open

the gate to get people out, even if it meant getting a bollocking.           I

can remember thinking,    "If you*re wrong Phil lad, you'll get a right

bollocking for this."     I then went straight to Gate 4 at the fence

behind the goal posts and shouted to Sergeant SWIFT who was a number

of yards away from my position to my rights      "I*m opening the gate" and
                                                                    PAGE     6
                                                                    S2173

1 opened the gate. PC 3198 AKRED was with me at this time.

On opening the gate, the crush was so great that the people behind the

s*.fety f&fjfcing in this stand coul,d not move to free themselves. With
       '.1 ^              '           'r
PC 3198 AKflfED., I immediately bigan pulling people out from the crowd

and thrraugh =the gat«,'&nd on to the track.   Most of      people that we

pulled out initially were able to walk and did not have a n y apparent

serious injuries. Each and every person that we pulled out from Pen 4

took a great deal of physical effort, not one of them came out easy.

Each one was trapped in one way or another by various parts of their

body.
After a short while, at Gate 4, we were joined by Sergeant SWIFT and

we continued to pull these people free. On more than several

occasions jackets,    pullovers, shirts etc were ripped on peoples backs

in the effort to free them.

There was no doubt that the people in the stand were desperate for

their lives.    The best description would be to say that people were

drowning in a sea of people.     All the faces that X saw at the front

were pale, grey, white or blue all with panic and pain written all

over them.     The people at the front couldn’t scream for help, only

stare, screaming at you with their eyes.       There were many whose eyes

were closed.

Whilst we were standing at the gate,    I could see two men on the floor

at the gate opening, we were frantically pulling people out as fast as

we could to try and get to the people at the front, but as soon as one

was pulled free the space was filled with another and pressure was

still being pushed forward from the back of the stand.

I got down on my hands and knees and grabbed hold of one of the men

who was >on the floor face down, hanging out of the gate into the

track.   I put my arm under his armpits and tried pulling him out.

Whilst I was doing this,    people who-were being pulled free above m
                                                                    re

were standing.on my back to get to the track, other o f f i c e r s present

grabbed hold of me and other parts of the man and with a great deal of

physical effort we managed to pull him free.        We carried him to the

grass area behind the goal nets, put him down, established |hat he M^is

breathing and alive, he muttered some word* and we left him and

immediately returned to the gate and continued pulling people from the

pen.       I became aware that the man we had pulled out from the floor

was in fact being attended to by another officer.

It is difficult to say how many we physically pulled from the pen but

it must have been in the hundreds, most of whom were walking, some

unconscious, some dead, some collapsed.        The ones who were brought

out unconscious were tended to immediately by whoever pulled them out.

They were brought round by slaps across the face or if they were

collapsed mouth to mouth resuscitation where necessary.             I didn’t

count how many times I did this,      I. couldn’t guess.   As time was

passing more arid more officers were arriving at the scene, this was

quite obviously within minutes of opening the gates even though we

seemed to have been there a hell of a long time before anyone actually

came, but it was only minutes.

The main problem was that no matter how many were pulled from the

front, the crush was so great from the back we couldn’t, relieve any

pressure to get to the people at the very front or sides who were in

serious trouble.

It became obvious that pressure needed to be released from the rear

where there was now space appearing.       Officers were telling or

shouting to people to move back from the front but they wouldn t so

the situation continued.

I made a request to one Inspector who Was standing on the grass to get

a serial in through the back to pull the people out.         Whether he did

or not I don't know, he seemed a little non plussed and walked away.

I can remember pulling a boy of about 16 years from the crowd who had

a broken arm.       By that,   I mean,   I could clearly see that the bone in

his right forearm was broken.            He had somehow managed to pull himself

above the people i.rvf tfw crowd and shouted to us that he had broken his

arm.       With another officer, we managed to grab,him and pull him

through the gate and on to the track.           He just thanked us and walked

off.       Most of the ones who were pulled out, who were agile, thanked us

and were crying, thanking God that they had got out.

As more and more officers arrived at the scene, they began to tear

down the fencing with their bare hands, trying to get to the people in

the pen.       Some even tried to kick it down.      Some officers were hanging

over the fencing and pulling people over quite clearly in some danger

of falling into the pen themselves.

At this time I moved away from the gate and started checking the

people laid down on the grass.            I cannot remember how many were laid

on the grass at this time but my estimation would be in the region of

about 30 to 40.       Other Police Officers were engaged in attempts to

revive people.

I. made several attempts to revive people with artificial resuscitation

and whenever I thought 1 felt a pulse I would shout any medical

personnel who were near at hand.             1 seemed to have found more dead

than alive.

The situation in this area was quite chaotic, bodies all over the

place,      people wandering about crying, screaming, shouting, Police

Officers and what few medical personnel were there trying frantically

to revive people.

After some time at checking bodies and making several hopeless

attempts to revive people it became obvious to me that there was

nothing more that I could do.            I was feeling absolutely physically

shattered.       By this time all the people in Pen 4 had been pulled out
                                                                            PAGE     9
                                                                            S2173

          and there only remained the dead bodies in Pen 3, a large number of

          which had been taken out and placed on the field.

          During the most frantic moments pf trying to revive the people on the

          grass,, timers were no medical personnel to speak of and the St John's

          Ambulance Brigade consisted of what I could see, two old men and one

          young boy of about 12 ~ 14 years who was totally overwhelmed by the
          situation.     Although on saying that, once they had gathered their

          senses, they got stuck in and worked very hard.

          With regard to the behaviour of the fans,    I can say that the ones who

          were seated above the pens were shouting and screaming abuse, but the

          ones who were on the ground got organised into groups and helped us

          with the injured etc by carrying them on advert boards and were a

          credit to themselves.

          As I have previously stated I have worked football duty at

          Hillsborough on quite a number of occasions and have always been

          impressed by the pre-planning and organisation of the duties and crowd.

          I would consider it one of the best policed grounds in the country.

          Whatever happened on this occasion to cause such a tragedy can only be

          speculated upon, but again I have never seen as many fans at the

          Leppings Lane end at that time of day.

                Further to my previous statement dated 10th June 1989 (100689).

                I recall that I attended          a woman in her early twenties,        in one of

                the pens, in the West Stand but I do not remember which one.                  At this

                time 1 was with PC3198 AKRAD.             Together we carried the woman onto

                the pitch and attempted to resuscitate her, but were unsuccessful.

                Whilst on the pitch, we were joined by a dark haired man who stated he

                was her husband.

                  My duty on this day began when I reported for duty at Sam at Barnsley

We were transported to. the West Bar Police Station where after a

briefing, we were sent to our alloted duty which was (10.00am) at the

Midlands Railway Station where we were to escort the Liverpool and

Notts Forest football fans which would be arriving- by train onto a

number of P S V ’s which were provided by the South Yorkshire Passenger

transport company and escort them to the Hillsborough Football ground

2 P c ’s Per Bus.



At approximately 2.10pm most of the fans had arrived by train, so

serial 16 and a number of other officers from other serials boarded

a PSV and we were taken to Hillsborough. Our route to Hillsborough

took up past the West stand (Leppings Lane) and we could all clearly

see the crowd congestion which was building up around the area of

the turnstiles and still streams of supporters were converging on thi

area from the direction of Penni. stone Road. With some dif f i culty the

bus managed to carve a path through the crowd and we dispersed from

the bus outside the main stand gates on Pennistone Road. The time was

approximately 2.40pm as Phase 2 of our serial was to be "held in

reserve" we went to the gym area of the ground and obtained a hot

drink.
At approx 2.55pm PS 2379 Swift explained that we were required on the

track by the West Stand.



As we went out onto the playing area track I noticed that both teams

were out on the pitch and warming up, at this time there warn- no

indication that there was any trouble at the Lappings Lane end of the

ground.



At this time the officers present with me were PC 4g Hoo#on PS- 2379

fSjwift Pc 3198 Akred, Pc 1453 Phillips Pc 2083 Packer Pc 2,185 Cooper Pc

12 Taylor and Pc 1368 Mackenzie.



It was when we walked behind the goal of the Leppings Lane end that I

realised something was wrong. The people in the centre of the

terracing were all shouting,   "Let us out please" always trying to

attract our attention.   It was then that I noticed some people at the

very front Of the crowd who were quite obviously dead. They had a grey

mottled skin and were in a position that suggested that life was

extinct. F u r t h e r observations revealed other people were crushed up

against the wire meshing of the safety fence and that if they stayed

there their life wouild be seriously threatened. Other members also

saw this scene I heard Pc 42 Hooson shout,     " I ’m opening the gate      and

he went to the gate to the left of the goal, I went to the gate

further up the track which had been opened by Pc 12 Taylor and I began

to pull people out of the crowd, but we found it difficult as people

were so jammed up that it was taking 4 Pcs to pull one person out. The

crushing was so severe that there were bodies on the floor of the

terraces where only their heads were showing the rest of their bodies

were covered up by other bodies and people standing on them. All the

time people were walking on anything they could stand on ie heads and

shoulders in order that they could climb over the safety fence.



As the area abound this gate got jammed up with eager supporters

wanting to help I went to the gate further up the track where I helped

PS Swift and other officers pull people out of the ground as with the'

                                                                   S3332

previous gate with some difficulty.



I then climbed onto the fence and helped supporters climb over this

fence.   I took hold of a yourfg boy who was passed to me by his father,

I do not know what happened to this childs father as he was lost again

in the crushing that was still going on. People were shouting      pegging

for me to help them but I could not get to them.



I looked again at the front of the terracing and noticed more people

had lapsed into unconciousness and were turning blue in colour,.



After a few minutes of helping people climb the fence I decided to go

into the terracing (3) as a space had cleared and try to help some of

the injured. The sight that awaited me as I dropped down from the

fence was horrifying,   there were bodies lying everywhere some quite

obviously dead some dying.



I immediately went to two males at the bottom of the terracing one in

his teens and one in his early 30"s . The older of the two was barely

alive with a very faint pulse and was making gurgling sounds.    I opened

his airway and showed a Liverpool supporter how to keep it in that

position. All this time I was being stood on by panic stricken

supporters who were still trying to get out over the fence even though

the danger of being crushed was over I then went to the young lad

lying next to me who in my opinion was dead but I still opened his

airway in an attempt to revive him. I then noticed a Senior Officer

and asked him to get medical attention onto the terraces to which he

replied,   "We can't get, him out here" At this time this was impossible

as the gate was still blocked off by people gding through and the

fence was about 9* high.
                                                                   PAGE"     5

                                                                   WWWWS




I left these two fans in the hands of the young Liverpool supporter

and I went to another young person in his teens who was laid

approximately   <*h4lf way up the terracing, He had, fid pulSf and wasn't

breathing but had some colour still in his face So $ attempted mouth

to mouth resusitation and heart massage but to no avail.



By now people were thinning out and more police officers were on the

scene and the main priority seemed to be just get the bodies dead or

alive out of the terracing. All the time we were being helped by the

Liverpool supporters.



One thing that I noticed and reflect back on was that at no time

whilst I. was on the terracing were there any sign of expert medical

attention on the terracing.   1 imagine   they had too much to do with

the fans on the pitch, but people died because of this.



After a while we cleared the terraces of the bodies and then were told

to form a line along the first line of barriers from the wall.



We were told this was because the crowd were getting angry, but I did

not see anything untoward considering the circumstances.



Whilst we were seated on the terracing wall, surveying the scene a

photographer entered the terraces and attempted to take a photo of all

the property lying on the floor and it was only the quick action of

some Police Officers who saved him from a lynch mob.



Later SGT Swift collected our serial up and we went to the gym area of

the ground and then onto Claywheels R T Dept awaiting transport home.

                     On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489)       I commenced duty at Sam (0800) at

                     Barnsley Police Station and was transported together with Sergeant

                     SWIFT, Serial Sergeant, PCs HOOSON, TATTERSHALL, PHILLIPS, PACKER,

                     MACKENZIE, COOPER and TAYLOR.       Taken to West Bar Police Station at 9am

                     (0900) attended briefing in the gym at West Bar.          After briefing,

                     walked down to Midland Station, Sheffield to take up duties as Serial

                     16, control of fans alighting from trains at station.          Fans divided

                     into two exits from station.       Continued with these duties until

                     approximately 2.30 pm (1430) when together with rest of Serial was

                     transported to Hillsborough Ground by a public transport which had

                     been laid on by South Yorkshire Passenger Transport.

                     At approximately 2.45pm (1445) the bus went via the Lepping Lane end

                     of the ground and at this time I noticed that the roadway and nearby

                     adjacent rflads were filled with a very large crowd of fans.           This

caused the bus to slow down, and I commented to other officers that

this seemed a very large crowd so near to the kick-off time.

Alighted from the bus on Penisto,ne Road end and entered the ground via

the main Police access road.                           .     .

Together with rest of the serial, went into the gymnasium lifid at this

time we were preparing to take our meal.      We had only been in the gym

for a matter of one or two minutes when we were informed by Sergeant

SWIFT that we were required to go to the track in front of the West

Stand.    At this time we were not aware of why we were required to

attend.

I walked onto the track, walked past the North Stand and round the

track side to the West Stand.     At this time the two teams were on the

pitch so we walked to the West Stand and saw that there was a large

crowd in Sections 3 and 4.     Did not pay any particular attention to

other sections of the stand.     At this time I was unaware of any

emergency.    I saw that the crowd were surging forward towards the

front of the fencing of the stand, but took this to be just normal

actions of the crowd at any big game.     I turned to face the crowd and

s«|tw fans crushed up against the barriers.    Many appeared to be in deep

distress and totally crushed against the barrier.      Many further in the

crowd shouting,   "We’re being crushed, open gates."

1 then saw that   people at the front of the crowd were going blue in

the face and were apparently unconscious, only being kept up by the

weight of people at each side.     I shouted for people to try and ease

back, but they were uriable to do so.    Went to Gate 4, directly behind

the goal with PC HOOSON and Sergeant SWIFT and the gate was opened.

The crowd began to surge to the gate and together with Sergeant SWIFT

and PC WpOSOfcjj, I began to pull people out of the crowd.        Many were

in panic and many were ignoring our instructions and just climbing

over people who had already stumbled.    Saw three men trapped by their            j

legs laid on top of one another at the base of the gate and was unable

at first to release them due to the weight of the crowd pushing against

them.      ...
Eventually ffianaged to free them and pull them onto track;"         By this

time th<|r®v^s a large number of fans already on the track and pitch,

many looking for friends and shouting.         Many were shouting at the

Police to try and get more fans out.         I went back to the gate to try

and evacuate more people, one man repeatedly tried to return to the

crowd through the gate,        impeding our attempts to get people out, and

he had to be physically held away.         This man had been pulling at

Police Officers,        including myself as he tried to fight his way back

into the crowd.

One man from the crowd jumped over people trying to get out, of the

gate and as a result caught my head with his feet and knocked me to

the ground.         I returned to my feet and continued with my efforts to

re 1ease peopie.

I saw a gap appearing towards the rear of the stand and I shouted for

people to go back, but this was ignored.         I shouted for them to look

round and see that there was room at the back, but this was also

ignored.         As the crush eased, together with other officers,    I went

into the Stand via torn fencing and I saw the body of a young woman

laid on the ground.         With other officers I carried the woman out of

the stand and onto the track.         She was blue in the face and did not

appear to be breathing.         Together with other officers,   I attempted to

give rescusitatioTi, kiss of life and heart massage.        The woman

appeared to be in her mid-twenties and was wearing black trousers and

a red top.         Joined by two men, who stated they were doctors,    they

examined J,he woman for signs of life and then informed me that she was

dead.
I looked around and saw that, numerous       other bodies were on the track
                                                                   PAGE      4

at this time, together with a large number of fans and large numbers

of the Emergency Services.     I was knelt on the ground at the side of

the woman when a man came to me, looked at the woman and became very

distressed.     He stated that the woman was his wife #nd, heygave the

name of Steve JONES.     Because of his distressed state he      left with

the body of his wife and another Liverpool fan who,was assisting him.

I then went to assist other officers pulling bodies onto the pitch.        I

then saw the body of a young boy, aged approximately 12 years, wearing

a light bomber type jacket.     He was laid on the pitch at the rear of

the goal.     I went to assist another officer to carry the body of the

child down the pitch towards the exit between the North Stand and

Spion Cop.     I was relieved by another officer who took over the body

of the child.

I went, back to the West Stand and covered a body laid on the pitch

behind the goal with my anorak.     I was then joined by Sergeant Swift,

who told us to remain where we were.     By this time the majority of the

bodies had been carried away either by fans or the Emergency Services.

Together with Sergeant SWIFT and other officers from our Serial,

walked back down the pitch to the gym and all were totally exhausted.

All the Serial appeared to be shocked and after regaining our

composure we were taken to Claywheels Lane where we were given cups of

t ea .
Shortly after 6 pm (1800) we were returned back to our Divisions,

transported by a driver from Claywheels Lane.     Our transport, being

left at West Bar.

As a result of trying to evacuate people from the stand,      I received

straining to my arms, bruising to both legs and a large bruise and

swelling at the back of my left hand and bruising to the top of my

left, arm.

         that this match would b e ,any different from the ones I have

         previously worked on, which had always run smoothly, although I did

         think that, the large group of fans outside the turjfstiles at Lepping

         Lane prior to our entry into the ground appeared to be larger than

         normal, but I am unable to say for what reason this might be.      Even so,

         at this stage I did not anticipate what took place a short while

         after.

                   Further to my original statement dated 22nd August 1989 (220889).

                   I refer in my statement to removing the body of a female from the

                   terraces to the pitch.          The woman’s husband joined me on the pitch.

                   I have viewed a mortuary photograph (reference no                    , Exhibit

                   no                ) of Christine Anne JONES (35) and recognise her as being

                   the woman that I have made reference to.



                   1 viewed a photograph of the clothing worn by JONES on 15th April 1.989

                   (150489)    (reference NA 35, Exhibit                > and I recognise the ski

                   type trousers.           I do not recall the *T' shirt but recall she had a red

                   top on which would have covered the 'T * shirt, this red top is not

                   pictured.



                   I Have viewed a video tape (reference VRM/2, exhibit No                       )
                                                                          PAGE   2

and at, tape reference 0241 to 0245 can see a female lying on the gym

floor she is wearing a red top similar to the one worn fay JONES.               A

man is bent over the body.       This man is d r e s s e d similar to the husband

of thi woman I refer to on the pitch, the video does not show the mans

fa c e .



I have indicated on a sketch plan of the terraces, the position from

which I recovered JONES's body.         The position is indicated by a blue

dot.       I have signed this plan,   (reference LA/1, Exhibit             ).



I mdved      the body ontothe pitch assisted    by PC NOOSAN, taking it

through      a tear in the wire fencing.     The body was placed on the pitch

and I have indicated on a sketch plan of the pitch the approximate

location.       This is indicated by a blue dot.     I have signed this plan

reference LA/2, Exhibit                 )»



I refer      in my original statement, toassisting to carry the body of a

12 year      old boy along the pitch.    I have viewed a mortuary photograph

of Thomas Anthony HOWARD (1) reference                , Exhibit           , and

recognise him as being the boy I refer to in my original statement.



I have viewed a photograph of the clothing worn by HOWARD on 15th

April 1989 (150489),      (reference NA/1, Exhibit                > this is

similar to that, worn by the boy I refer to, in particular the jacket.



I have indicated, on A sketch plan of the pitch, the approximate

location at which the body was lying when I first saw it.           The

                   At 0800 hours on Sat 13th April 1989 (150489),               I reported for duty at

                   Barnsley P/S for onward transmission to Sheffield for 0900 hours

                   briefing.



                   I was in a Police Serial with Sgt HOWARD being the Supervising

                   Officer.     After briefing at West Bar, our Serial was deployed to

                   Midland Railway Station to keep opposing fans separated and headed in

                   the correct direction for thei r respective buses to the Shef f ie1d

                   Wednesday Football ground.             During this time the general behaviour and

                   attitude of all fans was good.              We were there until aprox 1445 hours,

                   when we were transferred to the football ground where we were on

                   standby for any further deployment that was required.                We had just got

                   ours*Ives a drink when we were told to leave it and go to the Leppings

                   Ln end of the ground on the track behind the goal.
                                                                    PAGE         2
                                                                   S 3331




I would say we were at the back of the goal for about 1438 hours«          The

football players were still kicking the ball about and hadn't kicked

off y e t .                                                                          'j



The thing that immediately took my attention at this tirn

fold. The centre terrace was already packed solid with people

complaining of crushing.      I. also noticed that the left hand side

terrace and the right hand side terrace still had what appeared to be

plenty of room.



From this time on, the crushing got worse with all number of people

crying out for help (ie, Save my son, save my girlfriend, help us, get

us out, etc, etc).      The pressure got worse after the game kicked off.

I have been to the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground on odd

occasions to do football duty and there have been big crowds but I ’ve

never seen this sort of trouble before.



It was horrific.      The Liverpool fans were crushing and killing their

own supporters.     The supporters were that tightly packed together

there was no way they could move,     particularly at the front.



Obviously the fences were solid and the two gates at either side of

the centre standing terrace was the only exits available other than

possibly getting them over the top of the fence.



All our Serial worked like trojans.      What each individual Officer did

specifically   I   can’t fully say, other than to immediately get the two

gates open and get the fans out.
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                       S3331

Initially I went to the right hand gate looking towards Leppings Ln

end.     I was stood just inside the gate with one leg on the steps and

one leg on the fence dividing the centre and right terraces.        I was

pulling and lifting fans up and over the fence from the severe

crushing at this corner.



After a while and in the panic,     I was pulled to the floor, a drop of

about three feet, by a desperate fan.       1 managed to get up and get out

onto the pitch, having assisted the fan who had pulled me down and

whom I had fallen on.     I think he hurt his back.    ,1- had by now been

replaced by another Police Officer doing the same job.



I then went to assist at the other gate at the left hand side of the

goal .    In part i cular Sgt, HOWARD, PCs HEASON and AKRED were there ,

possibly others, but they were the ones 1 bring to mind.



At this gate it was like "Hysell" stadium,      bodies on top of bodies

believed dead and/or injured.      Liverpool fans were climbing over the

top of them.



From the level of the top of the steps at this point is a drop to the

terrace level below.     Consequently, the torso's of the bottom bodies

were laid on the top step and their legs hanging down to the terrace

and because of the severe crushing, the legs were trapped, making it

almost impossible to pull them out.



Fans in sheer panic made the situation almost impossible for the

Police.    Some were obviously drunk and very abusive.     Some were

lashing out and hitting us.     fome had to be forcibly dragged away,

whilst the good fans took them off us behind the goals and sorted them
                                                                                            PA<JE ' 4
                                                                                            S3331

out-     These were the fans who were hindering us trying to get fans out.



I remember thinking that, that many bodies were pulled out, that it

was difficult, to find a patch of green grass behind the gbaL to lay                                    *

the bodies down.               Other Officers there at this point took over from us

once we'd put them down, giving mouth to mouth, etc, etc.



Doing what I have described was done until the terrace in the centre

was relieved of pressure, have received help from the emergency

services.         A couple of the front, fences were open.                      How,   I don't know.



Some L i v e r p o o l   fans    were      hysterical    and   difficult,   probably

understandably           so,    but   it    didn't,   help   the   situation.




Eventually by the time most- of the bodies were either taken away or

being seen to on the pitch by other Officers and volunteers, we were

as a Serial led away to behind the stand near the gym.



We then had a hot drink and eventually taken to Claywheels Ln and

taken back to EM, going off duty at 1830 hours that day.



In conclusion,           I would like to say that I have never seen such panic

by football supporters in my life. Some had had beer, some fought with

us and some some fans like other Police Officers deserve a medal

for the way they helped under such a horrific and distressing

situation.



The fans behind the goal were their own worse enemies,                             crushing

forward so blatantly irresponsibly.
                                                                        PAGE      5

         I was terribly distressed at what I saw and it hurt like blood hell to

         see children, girls, boys, men and women dying in front of me without

         being able to do anything that would immediately relieye the situation.




         The memory of what I had seen will stay with me for the rest of my

         life.

              JAMES OSCAR PACKER

              POLICE CONSTABLE 2083 - B1

              On Saturday 15 April        1989<150489),   I came on duty at Barnsley Police

              Station at 8.00 a.m . (0800) and travelled to West Bar Police Station,

              Sheffield,    parading there at 9.00 a.m .(0900) that day.

              My initial duties were on Serial 16 under the supervision of Police

              Sergeant 2379 Swift and we were deployed at Midland Street Railway

              Station to supervise the arrival of fans at            the station and         to escor

              them to their respective buses to the ground.

              These duties were carried out until about 2.30 p.m.(1430)             Most

              supporters we dealt with at the station were good humoured and not

              under the influence of drink.         The only trouble I encountered were

              supporters not wearing team colours, trying            to get; into the City

              Centre. Carrying out this duty I was paired            with Police Constable 3198

Akred and I was issued with a Police radio.

At 2.30 p.m.<14304 our serial and others were transported to the

ground on a Yorkshire Traction bus.       On route to the gfound from about

one mile away there        % lot activity with numerous fans heading

towards the ground whtj wfere boisterous, but generally good humoured.

The closer we got to the Leppings Lane end of the ground, the denser

the amount of supporters became and the more boisterous they became.

On turning right to go past the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground,

I could see thousands of supporters, most of which were in the area

between A and C and onto the road.        These supporters were chanting,

jumping up and down and being generally rowdy.        The time would be

abdut 2.50 p.m.(1450)    I could hardly see any Police Officers around

the area of the entrance probably due to the numbers of fans outside

the ground.   I remember Police Constable 1368 Mackenzie saying to me,

"They’ll not get that    lot in there."

We then went, round to   the ground and intothe gymnasium to await

further instructions.    Almost, immediately we were deployed onto the

track in front of the West Stand.

We went onto the track and     walked up in front of the North West area

of the West, Stand.   Police Sergeant Swift deployed us along the

front of the West Stand.     The time would be exactly 3.00 p.m.(1500) as

I remember the game kicking    off.

I walked along the front of    the stand,    I could see the central    section

was full, but, I could   see that there was a lot, of room in the      North

Section and the South    Section, especially towards the front.

As I walked past the Central North Section and Central South' Sections

I could see a great swell of people, many at the front were screaming

out about being squashed, but I initially put this down to the fans

behind them surging forward    and chantingas the gdme had just started.

As I reached the end of the    Central South Section, I turned to       face
 ^                                                                           PAGE         3
                                                                                               S 1086

the crowd and stopped.             It was then I could see many children and

females being crushed against              the wall and crash barriers.               At the

front end a number of people were screaming and,                    shouting for us to get,

them out.        0ne man shouted from about the middle that there was a man

at his feet who was ;deac|.

At t h i s   point,   I r e a l i s e d th at this w a s not just the n o rm al      sort       of

crowd    Surge   and    that   nobody   could   move   in   this   section   of     the       crowd,.

I shouted over to the officer              at Gate 3 to open the gates in order to

get, at least some of the fans             out and to escort them back into the

area at gates 1 and 2 in the Southern Sect ion.                     At this t ime the

seriousness of the situation was not clear.

On the gates opening it was a mad dash and a number fell forward and

were having to be pulled out by officers.

Initially I was escorting fans who could walk away from the gate and

sitting fans down against the crash barrier who were obviously

injured.       A number of the fans who were coming out who weren’t badly

injured were almost, hysterical and were being abusive towards myself

and other officers.

At this point, I could see that the incident, was far more serious than

I first thought and with an Inspector I went, onto the pitch in order

to stop the game and to stop fans from running onto the pitch.

A number of fans did run onto the pitch and with other officers I

formed a line across the IS(Eighteen) yard line.                      The fans were angry

and aiming their aggression first at Police, then at, rival Nottingham

fans in the Kop end of the ground and also at, cameramen who were

photographing the incident.              I assisted to pull a number of cameramen

away from the area and away from the Liverpool fans.

A short time later many more officers came and I assisted in forming a

cordon across the halfway line* being positioned toward the players

tunnel.

        Many of the Liverpool fans who came onto the pitch were crying or

        hysterical.   A number of them also showed al3 the symptoms of being

        drunk, their eyes were glased, their speech was slurred, they were

        unsteady on their feet and their breath smelt strongly of intoxicants.

        Thie overwhelming opinion I got fipom th® supporters I s p o k e t o was that

        the F.A. was to blame for them not being given the other end of the

        ground»

        For over half an hour, fans roamed around the pitch, some obviously

        looking for trouble as they roamed about in groups,      running from one

        section of the pitch to the other.

        As the fans started to disperse,       I attempted to find my serial as I

        had become detached when I was instructed to stand in the cordon.           I

        eventually joined up with Serial' 14 under the supervision of Police

        Sergeant 1341 Crawford and I escorted fans down the Leppings Lane end

        towards Penistone Road.      Most of the supporters were quiet and subdued

        as they walked away from the ground.

        I eventually re-"joined Serial    16 outside the main entrance to the

        ground on Penistone Road at about 6.00 p.m. (1800)      F rcim there we

        returned to Barnsley where we were stood down at 6.30 p.m.( 1830)

        My radio had been taken from me shortly after the game had started by

        Superintendent Murray.

        I must comment that at the time of the incident I heard no

        instructions over the radio due to the noise from the crowd.        The

        radio had been working well up to then and radio messages were

        received very clearly up to going on to the track.

                 At 0800am <0800) Saturday,       15 April    1989 <130489),   I reported an duty

                 at Barnsley Police Station to attend the Hillsborough Football Ground

                 where the Semi-Final for the FA Cup between Liverpool and Nottingham

                 Forest was to be played.        I paraded on at Barnsley Police Station

                 where we were briefed by PS SWIFT who was in charge of the Police

                 contingent from Barnsley who was attending from 0800am <0800).             This

                 cont ingent consisted of PC PACKER, PC TAYLOR, PC MACKENZIE, PC

                 PHILLIPS, PC HOOSON,       his probationer, WPC AKRED and we were later

                 joined by E police officers from a squad from Sheffield Headquarters.

                 From Barnsley we attended at West Bar Police Station at approximately

                 9am <0900) where we were briefed by Chief Inspectpr and

                 Superintendents regarding our duties for the day.             These wet# to ,,

                 consist of reception of both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans at

                 the Midland Railway Station at Sheffield where they were to be

diverted to S lots of PSV buses which were to be waiting for them at

separate ends of the station.         Two officers were then to be delegated

to each bus to travel up to the Hillsborough Football G r o u n d where

buses would be emptied and fans directed into thf ground at the ’

appropriate ends»      We were also i’^structed to matke searches of fans as

they came friSm the station.



Approximately 1015am (1015) this date, along with other officers,          I

attended at the Sheffield Railway Station to commence duties as

instructed.      However,    once at the Railway Station the serial which 1

was attached to were instructed to take up position outside the main

entrance to the Railway Station to' intercept any fans who managed to

slip the police net within the station and attempt to go into town

with a possible chance of causing trouble.         This we did and on a

number of occasions had to divert fans back to the buses which were

being laid on for them.         Most of these fans, although very noisy, were

well behaved and no violence occurred and there was very little

suggestion of drink.



At approximately S.30pm (1430), this date, all fans had arrived by

trains and along with other officers we travelled up to Hillsborough

on a P S V .   The route which was taken was through Hillsborough

village itself on Middlewood Road and then into Leppings Lane.          Whilst

travelling along Middlewood Road,        I noticed that there was a number of

fans still walking towards the ground.         We then turned into Leppings

Lane and I noticed that there was a large volume of fans well into the

number of thousands,        still waiting to get into the ground.   The area

in front of the turnstiles was packed to capacity and the fcrowd was

spilling out bhto the road itself.         There were a number of police

officers who were at the scene, who were attempting to control the

crowd.    As we were travelling towards this part of the ground,           I

noticed 2 separate fans who,     in my opinion, were extremely drunk and

were having to be carried by 2 friends, one under each arm.            I also

noticed a youth who appeared to be approximately 25 ^eaf&j, jumping
                      '           '                            '*. t-,;.
in and    out of the road,   putting His fist& up topassing vehicles.

In my opinion, from the view I had from the PSV's, there appeared

to be a number of fans who were drunk.      As we passed the turnstile

area,    I also noticed a number of supporters climbing onto the top

of the walls and turnstiles, obviously entering the match, either

without producing tickets or trying to enter without tickets at all.

The officers who were on duty at this point in no way could stop

these youths doing what they were      doing due to the circumstances          of

the rest of the crowd, which were obviously pushing to obtain entry

as quick as possible, as the time at this point was approximately

quarter to three <1445).      We then travelled from the turnstiles

along Leppings Lane towards the roundabout at Niagara.        All along

this road there were still hundreds of fans still walking towards

the ground.    We then travelled to the Nottingham Forest side of

the ground which was on Penistone Road North entrance and this was a

totally different scene.      There were very few supporters awaiting to

obtain    entry and everything wasquiet.   We were    instructed to go

to the gymnasium as we were a reserve serialfor the match          itself

and there we obtained a drink.



About 3.00pm <1500) this date, we      were instructed by Sergeant SWIFT

to attend with him onto the perimeter track in front of the

Leppings Lane track.      We had Jheen in the ground approximately one

minute when we were given these instructions.        We walked on the

perimeter track to the Leppings Lane end where we were instructed

to take up positions along the track facing the Leppings Lane end.

 •                                                                  S349E

I walked up the end of the Leppings Lane Stand nearest to the

Police Control Room.    There I remember    being stoodwith PC PACKER.

At this time it was     obvious that there was a      largenumber ofpeople

in the crowd in the central section- and there w e r e ^ number of people

who were being pushed against the fencing.      There were screams coming

from the crowd, but at this time it appeared that it was just a ’push’

that was; being made by fans from behind and it was not evident to

myself the enormity of the incident.       I saw a number of youths open

the small emergency gates and burst onto the track.      Officers then

pushed them back into the crowd as it was felt that they were

trying to invade the track itself.     This sort, of action is normal

procedure at a football match.    However, within a very short space

of time,   I am unable to say what, but I would estimate about 30

seconds to a minute,    I think all officers realised that the position

was more serious.     I did not see at this time any deceased persons,

but it was obvious that the people on the front were gradually having

more pressure put on them.    The 2 small gates were then opened and

fans were pulled out of the crowd.     The initial fans which came out

were, although short of breath and some were suffering slight crush

injuries, were well     and appeared to be alright.    I began to direct

these fans into theside enclosure under the      police control   box and

still not realising the enormity of the incident.       1 remember one fan

stood on the track jumping up and down, shouting and watching the

game from the track and not making any attempt to go to the other

gate.   I got hold of this lad and pushed him towards the side

enclosure.   This continued for a short while and then we began to

realise that the problem was more serious, at which stage we began

to take the advertising boards down which were on the pitch itself, to

allow more room to bring spectators out onto.      During all this time I

began hearing the fans screaming for help and shouting for us to do
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         S349H

something.   We were also being spat at from the crowd.        We then

continued dragging people out and gradually they appeared to be

more seriously injured, but still there were no persons deceased that

were pulled out.                                                    /



While we were stood a t ■the fencing I saw a woman,       I believe with,

dark hair,   in a reef anorak,   pressed up against the fence and either

her husband or boyfriend was stood behind her, also in a red anorak

with his arms up to either side of her head,       pressing against the

fence in an attempt to shield her from the pressure.          At this stage

this woman appeared to be alive.        I then continued in assisting fans

who w e r e being pulled out by officers at the gate, the gate was

only sufficiently wide enough for one fan to be pulled out at a

time and only sufficient at the maximum of 3 officers to be at that

gate pulling them out.     Any more officers at that gate would just

have blocked it off totally.        I therefore stood back and assisted in

getting casualties onto the pitch.       We were joined by other

officers immediately and some officers began climbing on the

fencing in an attempt to pull people out of the crowd.          However,

people were that tightly packed that it was a l m o s t    impossible for

one officer to pull persons up, although some officers did

manage it.    People then began climbing on top of each other in

an attempt to escape and all were in total panic.          I then remember

turning and looking at the couple which I previously described

and realised that the woman had gone blue in the face, her eyes

appeared glazed                                             It was obvious

that she was deceased.     Her partner was also vomitting from the mouth,

but appeared to be alive.        I then looked further back into the

crowd and I could see an old man who was being squashed and

appeared to be losing total consciousness.        There was no way th&t
                                                                       PAGE

we could get, t,o any of them.   I then noticed that the fencing,

the actual wire meshing, was beginning to buckle and gradually

get worse and buckle to something like 6-12 inches.        We then
-iv”                               :
had the problem of a public order situation on the, pitch its#lf

and I remember one youth screaming and shoutipg that his sister                 ■ 'A,,' ■



was still in there and was suffering from asthma.        1 told fflw to

stand back and allow t^s to get as many people as we could out,

but in th| panic and emotion, which one cannot blame, he

continued to try and get to the gate to get his sister.        However,

this did nothing more than hamper the police officers who were

trying their best at that stage.       I then remember seeing a man who

I presume was with his Son at the front of the fence.        He too

had his arms pressed up against the fence, trying to protect his

son who was in a very distressed state.        However, still there

was no way that, we could get to these people.       The only way to get

to them was through the gate and a few over the top.        However,       it

was all so obvious or appeared obvious,       that had more bodies climbed

onto the fence to try and pull them up, this could have led

to the fence collapsing into the crowd and causing even more

deaths and injuries.     At this stage, although we could see

people were dying and people going under the crowd and losing

sight of them,   it did not appear from the gate that I was at

that there was anyone deceased being pulled out.         However,    the

enormity of the incident was becoming more and more apparent and

police officers were desperate in trying to save people.

Supporters both on the pitch and in the crowd itself were shouting

at officers and spitting and trying to get them to do more, but

there was no way the officers in this area,       including myself*,

could do any more.     Then as more fans were trying to get outy the

gate itself got blocked by the enormous number of persons trying to
                                                                         PAGE    1
                                                                         S3492

get through a small gap at once.      I remember at this stage that a

large man who I believe had a white top on was trapped with the top

half of his body lying on the track, on his back and from his, |Waist ;

downwards was trapped within the terracing over the entrant® -of the

gate.   Along with other officers,    I attempted to pull at his arms to

pull him out while other officers were frantically shouting ,#t us to

do this.   We tried but were totally unsuccessful and this was due to

the amount of pressure on his bottom half by the fans at the gate.

This caused a large jam at the gate for what seemed an eternity? no

one appeared to be coming through this gate.



I do remember PC TAYLOR stood hanging from the fencing, attempting to

pull persons out of the crowd itself.       At this point I stood back and

looked at the whole scene and I could see that fans were being pulled

up to the top of the seating area by other fans and fans were climbing

over the side fencing, assisted by the supporters.        There were a

number of fans swearing and shouting at us on the pitch and both from

the terracing and the youth I mentioned earlier as trying to get his

sister, had to be chastised on a number of occasions by officers,

although the officers appreciated the situation he was in and no

attempt was made to lock him up, even though there was sufficient

evidence there.   Whilst all this was going on, a number of officers,

in c 1u d ing my s e 3.f , was trying to wave at fans to tell them to move back

out of the stand itself, but I remember seeing a small crowd just

jumping and cheering as though nothing was going off.         However,    I do

feel that anybody with a bit of common sense would have known there

was a serious problem at the front of the pitch.        There were a number

of senior officers who were trying to organise the officers,         but there

was a large number of fans milling in and out of other policy officers

which hampered instructions.     However, along with other officers, we
 Mk                                                     PAGE                   i
 W                                                      53492

made two lines either side of the gate and we began to drag, people

out, stwo officers per person, and dragging them onto the pitch with
      r                                                 '
instructions to commence resuscitation.      This was commenced and then

we ise^an to try and form a conveyor belt, and deceased bodies were

being passed along the line onto the pitch itself in the hope that

medical attention could be given to them immediately.       However, as we

were pulling these people out it was quite obvious that they were

deceased?    this was due to the colour of the face, the smell and it was

obvious from looking at the clothing that they had lost all bodily

functions.    The terrace suddenly appeared to become almost empty and I.

could see a number of bodies piled Up and a crush barrier collapsed.

Part of this crush barrier was thrown by a fan at the police officers

who were on the fencing, attempting to save lives.       I believe the

barrier did hit a police officer.     The people that I had seen at the

front of the terracing had just disappeared and 1 have no doubt that

these persons fell to the floor when the pressure was taken off.           I

remember during the incident, although 1 cannot say at what point,         I

saw approximately 4 or 3 fans seem to step backwards among the

crush, shouting, approximately at the location of the crush barrier.

We then had to move bodies which were on the pitch further in in an

attempt to give us more room for the other bodies which were       being

pulled out so that any first aid that was possible could be given.

Once all the bodies were out, I instructed 3 or 4 fans with

advertising boarding and I placed a man on the boarding and began

running Howards Penistone Road end of the ground where other people

were being taken for treatment.     The man that was on this was

obviously dead at this stage.     However,   it was in an attempt to get

him to the medical team, hoping    that something could be done for him.

When I got    to that end there was a large number of bodies at    that

corner and I placed the man down and left him for the medical staff to
                                                                  PAGE    9
                                                                  53492

check him.   I then ran back to the Leppings Lane end in order to fetch

further people from there.   However, on my return all the bodies and

casualties that were to be moved had been.   I then took up position on

part of the fencing that hasd been pul l®d away on the instruction of a

senior officer to sto| people going ip and out of the crowd.



Sometime later, Sergeant SWIFT rounded up as many of our serial as we

could find, and he walked us off via the Penistone Road end.    We were

taken round near to the gymnasium and sat down.   Also at the st^rt of

the incident, when we began moving advertising boards, we were also

forced to remove journalists away who were insistent on getting

pictures.



In conclusion, one of the main problems onto the track area was the

size of the door at the 2. gates.   It was only possible to pull one

person at a time through these gates and. with the terracing being

below the level of the pitch itself,   it made it that persons had to

be pulled up as well as out and this caused the wedging that

occurred at the gates.   Had the terracing been level it would have

been a matter of pulling persons straight out and I believe more

could have been saved,

I recall that when all the bodies were removed, a serial of police

officers made a line in front of the remaining Crowd in the

enclosure, but when a scuffle occurred between a police officer and

                 At 8.OOam (0800), Saturday 15th Apri1 1989 (150489),            I reported for

                 duty at Barnsley        Divisional Headquarters,     I formed part of Serial   16

                 with PS SWIFT in        charge.

                 We then travelled through to West Bar Police Station Gymnasium where

                 we were detailed        to attend supporters arriving by train at the

                 Midland Street Railway Station,         in Sheffield City Centre.     I was

                 issued with a personal radio.

                 About 10.15am (1015) the same date, we arrived at the Railway Station,

                 our role being that two Officers were to travel through to

                 Hillsborough by bus with supporters,            then return with the empty bus

                 for further supporters,       the Senior Officer in charge of the station

                 duties.     I cannot renumber who directed our Serial to remain with the

                 public exit and direct any football supporters through to the correct

                 exit for transport to the ground.          Nottingham Forest supporters were
                                                                    PAGE   ; SE
                                                                    £33186

directed to the exit near Pond Street, Liverpool through the station

car park to the transport.

Numerous supporters attempted to avoid catching the awaiting transport

and continue by foot into the City Centre,.

Most of the supporters were in gooct spirit' of mind and agreed to our .....

direction, although many slipped through.                                .

On numerous occasions when supporters were questioned about tickets

they stated they hadn’t got any and were collecting them from friends

they had arranged to meet in Public Houses in the City Centre.

One fan I can describe as being in his late twenties, wearing a denim

jacket and jeans, managed to pass through the public exit.        I saw as

he was passing me a glint of a gold pin beneath his jacket and

attached to his shirt,   believing he was a football supporter I

approached him.   I saw he had all the characteristics of a drunk.          On

stopping him I asked if he was going to the match, this he denied, his

attitude being quite   aggressive.    I pulled back his   jacket and saw a

Liverpool   supporters badge.   I then escorted him to    an awaiting bus

with the aid of another officer.

A further   5-6 youths passed through the public exit,    I stopped them.

PC Packer   joined me as I asked them where they were     going, they

replied that they were collecting tickets from Sheffield City Centrf.

I told them no one was to go into the centre if going to the match and

began to muster them to the Liverpool buses, as I did so one of the

youths, about 20-22 yrs, with dark brown short hair, produced a

Merseyside Police Warrant card.      I then believed their claim to be

true and allowed them to pass.

I. heard on a number of occasions over my personal radio calls about

fighting around the town centre, one of which I recall taking place

outside Force Headquarters, Snig Hill.

Our contingent continued these duties until about 2.40pm <1440) when
^                                                                      PAGE

about one hundred supporters arrived by train and boarded the last

bus.   We boarded an empty bus and began the journey to Hillsborough

via Suffolk Road* St. Mar y ’s Road, Upper Hanover Way, Hanover Street,

Nethertfrwjrpe Road, Hoyle Street and onto Infirmary Road.

I saw on Infirmary Road large numbers of supporters mostly Liverpool

walking in the direction of the ground, many of which were drinking

from cans of intoxicants, the route being littered with empty cans.

Once on Langsett Road,    crowds of supporters increased dramatically and

vehicle traffic was very heavy causing slow progress.        At its junction

with Holme, Lane I. saw a chip shop completely full of supporters.

Travelling from Middlewood Road,    into Leppings Lane crowds of

Liverpool supporters merged into one mass, many drinking from cans.

On drawing level with the Lepping Lane entrances to the West Stand,

the bus driver stopped 1 was seated on the nearside of the bus away

from the offside looking at the offside at the turnstiles, the road

was completely clogged with pedestrian supporter traffic.        I saw a.

number of Police horses in attendance,    but due to the sheer volume of

the crowd,    I could not see any foot officers.   I saw approximately

five supporters climbing over the perimeter fence to gain entry.

Other supporters were standing on the gates on the pavement.

MOst of the crowd were in an aggressive and agitated mood and the

atmosphere was electric.     A supporter banged on the front offside of

the bus just behind the driver, by the stairs.     The driver asked if we

wished to get off the bus here, but suggested that we would have

trouble getting in.    The time was about 2.55pm <1455).     Someone

suggested that we move round to the Penistone Road North End, this the

driver did.    On rounding the roundabout Penistone Road North it was

completely different, very few supporters walking towards the ground

to the Nottingham Forest turnstiles.     Our bus stopped and we made our

way into the ground via the Main Police access.
                                                                   PAGE     A

Sergeant SWIFT asked us to remain in the Gymnasium prior to getting

our meal as a precaution of being needed.    I had just sat down, there

were approximately one hundred officers eating*     I listened to th^

Police traffic on the 'radio and heard from an officer at the Lapping; -

Lane*turnstiles that they were having problems with the crowd and they

required further officers assistance.

The time was about 3.00pjn' <1500) a seniorofficer replied   on the radio

that he had five serials ready to go and where were they required.

Sergeant Swift then came over and said we were going.     Once outside

and our serial was together he directed us onto the    track around the

pitch, entering via the field entrance of    the North Stand and S pi on

Kop corner.    We were to take up a position on the track by the field

front of the West Stand.    I was aware that the kick off had taken

place, but did not see any football being played.     On reaching the

corner adjacent to the North West enclosure at the West Stand,

Sergeant SWIFT directed us to spread out along the track.      I walked

down to gate 3 and stopped with the Officer covering the gate.       I

remember PC TATTERSHALL also stopping,    1 looked at the Centre South

enclosure of the West Stand and saw that the crowd was very

dense, only being able to see supporters heads and not their

shoulders.

I passed on my regards to the gate officer, who was standing back from

the gate by the billboards, but watching the crowd at his section, he

acknowledged me,   in doing so gate 3 opened and five youths ran out onto

the track.    The gate officer and I ran forward and pushed the supporter


back into the centre South enclosure and pushed gate 3 closed.

We stepped back to our original position.    I believed this incident

was the start of a pitch invasion.    I looked at the enclosure again

and still believed nothing was wrong.    I saw,supporters climbing over

the partition fence between the Centre South enclosure and South
                                                                   PAGE      s
                                                                   S3188

enclosure and being pulled up from the centre South enclosure to the

West Stand seated area.     Supporters around the centre of the Centre

South stand began spitting and throwing things at us, abuse and

gesture*.   Again,   I thought it was just a rowdy crowd.   Still I

believed the enclosure (Centre South) was crowded, but safe and

comfortable.    The gate officer began to speak onto his personal radio,

I couldn't hear what was being said due to the volume of the crowd.          I

placed my radio to my ear, radio traffic was intense, non stop.         1

heard a transmission that one gate was breaking under the weight of

the crowd, but do not know to which area of the ground it referred.

Then gate 3 burst open again,    I dropped my radio to my chest and went

to stop three supporters along with the gate officer.       I took hold of

one young man and began to push him back to the open gate.      There was

a solid line of standing people in the gate.      I saw people pushed flat

up against the fences, two to three yards (yds) back into the centre

south enclosure,     peoples heads were just disappearing under the mass

of the crowd.    I saw a man in his twenties scrabble onto the top of

people and began to run on peoples heads and shoulders towards the

pitch perimeter fence.     I let go of the supporter and began to pull

supporters from the gate, other officers joined in, we couldn’t pull

people out fast enough.     The gate was so narrow, with the gate opening

outwards onto the field,     it prevented assistance from the right and a

lean to support on the left gate pillar prevented assistance from the

left of the gate.     Three officers or supporters could only enter the

gateway at one time to pull because of the tight space.      The step

up from the centre south enclosure caused people to trip over, falling

to the ground, then on top of each other.     The gate became eight deep

in fallen peopie-» so tightly packed that they could- not be pulled

free.   As one supporter was pulled free your momentum followed the

supporter back oilto the field, other supporters and officers then took
                                                                            PAGE        6

your place at the gat© pulling.            I climbed onto the low wall to the

left; of gate 3 still facing into the centre south enclosure and pulled

rftyself u|> .onto the pverhang.      I gestured for the crowd to move back

With/my arms» th# supporters to the centre of the centre sotith

was happening.        People were reaching up to me, but I couldn t reacH

them, the spikes on the overhang digging into my arms,

I climbed down and went back to the gate.            I p u l l e d further supporters

free and in doing so X saw a gap between the legs and bodies of people

at step level.        There I saw a m an ’s face, about 40-45 years, I tried

to reach        him, but couldn’t.   I could hear him shouting,"Help me.

Help me"        and as I watched the crowd fell back over him ?and I never         saw

him again.        I began pulling at people in a hurry to free him.         Each

time someone        came from the crush 1 fell back with them.        I again lost

my place        the gate was too narrow.    I moved to the right    of gate 3,     but

before the start of the Centre North enclosure.             I saw a stocky man,

aged about 28 years, with a white and blue striped dress shirt, support


by the crowd, about 3-4 yards (yds) from the perimeter fence, he

was still, normal in colour, but his eyes were glazed

                             People around him did not appear to be aware or

care.   I saw that the section of fence was bowed out near the low wall

about one foot.         I saw two girls in their late teens about 18 or 19

yrs, both pinned up against the fence, both of the girls were blue.

The first one nearest gate 3 I didn’t really get a good look at and I

cannot recall her appearance, the one to the right had long mousey
            I
brown hair to the shoulders, straight and plastic square fashionable

glasses, her head was at an angle to her right and bowed, she had

                                       bpen mouth,   her lips were purple, her

skin was pasty and blue, her eyes half closed artd glazed,            I knew she

was dead.        Her right hand protruded through the mesh, her right

forearm bare to the elbow, both were blue her fingernails also purple,

she had rings on this hand on three fingers.         I cannot remember their

description.     t took a hold of her hand in my palm, it was cold, very
                ■                                                   .    ,
cold.     I trled to find a pulse, but couldn’t.      1 turned away from her,

1 -couldn't fac'l""tjfte -other girl or reach to them, J was now in a daze

of shock.                                                                i.

An Inspector, who 1 do not know or recall, approached me from the

field.     I repeated to him that the two girls were dead.         He just

pushed past me and climbed the fence trying to reach them.               I knew he

couldn’t, he was shorter than me.

I returned to Gate 3 and began to pull people out,         I don't know how

many.     I then saw a girl,    I later discovered her name to be                 f r oiti

Essex.     She was fourth     down in the gate with four people on top of

her, she was wearing a        light green jumper she was bent around the

left hand gate pillar at gate 3.        She was unable to move and I

couldn’t reach her.       I   moved to the left side of the gate, got down on

my knees and leaned in        to within a foot of her under the left lean to

gate support.       I was unable to get my arms in fully to reach her, she

was falling into unconsciousness.        I shouted at her to keep her awake

and clapped my hands in front of her face, this seemed to work, but I

was getting in the way from people pulling in the gate.             I began to

stand and in doing so a man,       in his late twenties, well built, about

6'0",(6’0) wearing a white dress shirt open at the neck, shouted to

me.     He was standing at the left hand gate pillar, but unable to move.

He shouted,    “I ’m not bothered about me, but get the boy." I turned, to

where he was looking, about three feet <3’)to the left of the gate but

against the perimeter fence there I saw a boy I now know to be

             10 years,   of _________________________________     Dohcaster,

told him to calm down and breathe steadily, this he did.          I told him

my name and then instructed him to reach up and climb as hard as he

could, he tried,but just didn't move.      I climbed the fence      and

reached     over to him.   I couldn’t reach,    I called to the man to help,

he took hold of the boys left arm stretching it to reath me.             I could

just touch his fingers* but couldn’t get a grip.          I Climbed down and

reassured him. I returned to the gate,         looked in and in doing so

someone     grabbed my shirt at the throat and began to pull me into and

through     the gate to the crowd.   Two buttons gave way and my tie fell

off.
I saw a man about H5 yrs,     wearing a black leather dress jacket

standing 2-3 yards     (yds) from the gate, he appeared conscious and I

shouted to him if he was alright and whether he was on firm ground or

not.   He replied he was.     I called that I was going to stand on him.

He nodded back.      I took a hold of the top of the gate with both hands

and swung inside the gate from the left, placing my right foot on hit*

right shoulder then quickly swung back to the inside of the perimeter

fence to the left, bending my legs to prevent kicking anyone in the,

crush below me.    I pulled myself up by the arms so my left arm was over

the overhang, my armpit on the spikes.          I then suspended by my left

arm and began to pull out the boy.      He wouldn’t move.      I yelled at him

to climb,    I had him by the left arm, the man in the white shirt

beneath me began to pull at his left arm and people around him, seeing

what I was doing, began to pull him as well.          He began to move and

once his behind was above head height I pushed his behind with my

right arm as an officer,     1 don’t know who,     pulled him over and on the

spikes and to the track.      I couldn't hold on any longer,     I was

exhausted.     I wanted to help more, but couldn’t.       I climbed out with

the assistance of other officers through the gate.        The boy had been

passed, I believe to another officer.      I didn’t want to leave him.          I

followed, he was placed on the field and I examined him for serious

injuries.   He said his stomach and left leg hurt him.

We then carried him to j,he p l a y e r s injury room where he was laid on a

table, he began to fall asleep.     1 feared that he had internal injuries

and to prevent him falling into sleep and then a coma, I talked to him

non stop.   He seemed to improve.

Another couple came in, one girl in a sling from Grimsby and a young

man, both were agitated, but soon left to seek medical attention in

Grimsby.

A further couple entered, the girl being Susan, she was deep in shock

and complained of chest and abdominal     injuries,    plus crushed ankles.

The boy was worried about his friend, who had brought him to the

match, named Nigel, wearing a green jumper.

I went to look for him, outside I saw a Liverpool supporter who was

swearing and very aggressive to officers at the players tunnel.           He

wanted to speak to the manager about the incident, the officers

eventually moved him away.    I went back over to the West Stand,       people

were lying all over the field, some worse than others, all being

attended to.   On reaching the Centre South enclosure,         I saw that the

crowd had moved back or cleared and people were laid many deep to

about 6 yards (yds) back from the fence.      I do not know their

condition. Supporters at the back were turning in revulsion,          others

gestured angry and shouted abuse at rescuers.         I began to walk back

and saw the West Stand goals being pulled down and some supporters

shouted from the pitch to stop asking what they were doing.           Sergeant

SWIFT found me and asked if I had seen the others, I hadn't,          I said

that I intended to remain with the boy, which he, agreed to.          I began

to walk back to the tunnel, an off duty nurre approached and asked

         what help she could give,   I just pointed to an arriving ambulance and

         said try there.

         I returned to the boy and continued our conversation and contacted his

                     We then continued through to the Northern General Hospital by

       >. hospital casualty a nurse approached and said there was fighting in

         the main entrance between supporters.    I went to assist, but when 1

         arrived there was already police there.

         I managed to get a lift to Claywheels garages and joined another

         Serial returning to Barnsley.    We arrived back at Barnsley Divisional

         Headquarters at 8.00 pm (S000), where I went off duty.

         I could not help feeling guilty of the helplessness of the incident,

         being unable to get to the injured or dead an unbearable loss.     I have

         worked a previous semi final, the year before with the same teams and

         supporters, their attitude and conduct was of the same nature, many of

         the crowd were drunk and aggressive.     I worked that particular game at

         the Penistone Road North turnstiles, these turnstiles ran smoothly,

         although the atmosphere was tense.     I saw the North Stand seats after

         the match and many had been ripped apart.

                At 8.00am (0800) on Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty in uniform

                at Barnsley Police Station.

                I was briefed by Police Sergeant 2379 SWIFT who was. the Sergeant in

                charge of my Serial No. 16.        We were informed that our duties would

                consist of public order patrols at the Midland Railway station,

                Sheffield.      All officers of serial 16 then went by transit van to West

                Bar Police Station, Sheffield for briefing at 9.00am (0900).

                We were briefed by Chief Inspector KING in West Bar Gym at 9.00 am

                (0900)
                Afterwards we were issued radios, one, between two officers,                I was

                paired up with       Police Constable 2185 COOPER who took charge of the

                radio.    We left West Bar about 9.40am (0940).            Our Serial arrived on

                foot at Midland Station        at about 9.50am (0950). There v^e joined two

                or three other Serials who were also deployed on public order duty.
                                                                   PAGE     2
                                                                   £31359

The instructions given to us at briefing were to the effect that, all

Liverpool and Notts Forest supporters would be directed from the

trains to separate ends of the station, where they would board special

buses which would transport them to Hillsborough.      Officers would

accompany them on the buses to the ground and return on the empty bus

to repeat the journey.

Our Serials,   however, did not get involved in this particular duty as

we were instructed to take control of the station exits and try to

establish which football club supporters were from their respective

clubs.   The senior officer giving this instruction was Chief Inspector

KING who attended at the station personally.lt was apparent that not

many supporters were travelling by rail, either from Liverpool or

Nottingham.

Those that did pass though the ticket barriers were good humoured and

co-operated fairly well with Police instructions and guidance to the

relevant buses.    There were some, however,   that avoided stating that

they were in Sheffield for the semi final match,

I did not witness any public order incidents at the railway station.

I did not see anyone in a drunken state or in possession of any

offensive weapons,   prohibited articles or alcohol.

I did not conduct any personal searches of people at that 1o cat ion.

At 2.40pm (1440)., myself and Serial 16 officers boarded a Sheffield

city double decker bus, together with serial officers. We were then

instructed to leave the railway station and attended at the

Hillsborough Football Ground, again to be given further instruction.

As we travelled from the railway station through the city and out       onto

the main roads towards Hi 11sborough, traffic    was moderate at that

time and an odd football supporter could be seen making his way on

foot towards the ground.
I observed a few supporters in possession of     cans of beer/lager.    They
                                                                    PAGE        3
 •                                                                  S1359

appeared good humoured.        ■

As we got closer to the ground, so around the Middlewood Rd area, near

to Hammerton Rd Police Station,    I saw large groups of supporters, some

Of   whom were obviously drunk going towards the ground on foot.

■They w e r e walking on both sides of Middlewooct Rd» some wandering into

the roadway.    At this point there was quite a heavy traffic build up.

We move slowly towards the ground and turned right into Leppings L n .

As we did so I could see a large gathering of supporters heading for

the ground.    There was a lot of shouting and singing.     It was at this

point that the big match atmosphere because obvious.       As we drove

towards the ground the driver of the bus had to take great care as

people filled the roadway.

As we neared the Leppings Ln end of the ground,     I could see Police

Officers on foot and two mounted officers near to the large blue gate

by the Leppings Ln turnstiles.     There appeared to be hundreds of

supporters at that location, all obviously waiting to get into the

ground.    There was a lot of shouting, all supporters seemed to be

making their way towards that small area outside the ground.

I remember commenting to a colleague that they would never get that

lot in the ground.

As we passed Leppings Ln we were continually confronted by supporters

making their way towards the Lepping Ln turnstiles.       These must have

numbered thousands by this point and. again the driver of our bus had

to take great care to avoid any pedestrians being knocked down.          Some

of the fans punched the sides of the bus, some shouted abuse,      others

just chanted and sang.

I remember that while on public order duty at the Railway station, all

radio transmissions appeared controlled and calm*     A noti cable changed

in radio transmission became apparent from about S.45pm (1445) onwards.

A lot of the transmissions were connected with th® situation outside-
                                                                     PAGE      4
                                                                     S 1359

the Leppings Ln end of the ground as calls for further assistance were

made »    ^

I do nat recall exactly what was said at that time or by which

,0'fficer <s) *   As we got ot the small roundabout at the junction with

Penistone Rd, I could still see hundreds of supporters making their

way to the Leppings Ln end.

Then we turned right into Penistone Rd and right again into the gfoutlei

by the North Stand.

There we all entered the gym to await further employment.         After only

a couple of minutes or so I remember bearing a radio transmission

requesting any available sergeants to report immediately to a senior

offi ce at the gym.

I then saw Police Sergeant, SWIFT approach a senior officer and almost

immediately I heard the officer say something like all you lads to the

West Stand.

We then walked out of the gym and all our serial walked onto the track

in front of the North Stand.       I could see that the ground was packed

with supporters.       The Kop was full as were both North and South

Stands.

In front of me I could see that West Stand.       I saw Police Officers

lining the perimeter track.       I could not say how many but I was able

to see onto the pitch.       At that time the two teams were on the pitch

but the match had not started. This would be about 2.55pm (1455).

As I passed the North Stand and turned left to walk towards the West

Stand,    I could see a small number of officers stood away from the

perimeter fence which enclosed       the standing area beneath the West

Stand.

Myself and other members of my serial walked up towards the goal mouth

area on the track.       As I walked in front of the fence,   I could see

that the supporters behind it were squashed and packed in like
                                                                              PAGE    5

sardines.

The evacuation gates from this area were all closed at this time.

I stopped behind the goal and faced the fans.             With me at that time

was Police Sergeant 2379 SWIFT, Police Constable 42 HOO&ON, Police

Constable 319$. AKfWp£.        There were other officers but I capnot recall
                      \                              "V          "
                                                                 •         ... ■■
their names.

I recall saying to Police Sergeant SWIFT we've got to get              these gates

open and let the supporters out.

No instruction was given to open these gates,             but it was obviously the

correct course of action, therefore with the above four named officers

we opened the gate at C N 4 .

As I arrived at that location (CN4) I could hear loud cries to ’get us

out*.          I have never seen as many people crammed into an area such as

t; H c ltf n



1 recall seeing a lad of about &-~ 10 years of age at the very front of

the fence near the wall bottom.          His face was squashed up against the

fence.         He could not move or speak.   A supporter stood directly behind

him, spoke to me in a calm but terrified manner "Get this little lad

out".          I appeased him briefly and together, after talking to t l a d

and this supporter, we got the boy away from the fence onto the floor

where we manged to wedge him between this man's legs by sitting on the

floor under the metal framework supporting the fence.                I believed he

was at the safest possible place for the           time being. I then      started

to pull supporters form the crowd through thenarrow gate               at CN4.

The crowd were packed so tight that we could only get them out one at

a time.         Some managed to climb on top of their mates and rpll over the

crowd and fall out head or feet first.          At the time the crowd were

shouting, get us out, tear down the fence and also ibuse towards the

police officers.

I also         remember some supporters -shouting 'stop the game'      repeatedly.
                                                                        PAGE
•
                                                                                    t
                                                                        S 1359

It was only at that time that I realised the game had started.

As I looked into the same crowd I could see people wedged between

others who looked apparently dead.

After a few minutes of working to get people out I recall the first

maji we got out who appeared dead.       We laid him on the ground behind

the goal.    He was a white man approximately £5 years 5* 9 - 5— 10,

heavy   build, tee-shirt,   jeans (short hair).    I assisted two other

officers (names/numbers unknown) in an effort to revive him but he

looked dead.    First Aid Officers then took over.       I. returned to Gate

CN4.    Again I assisted officers AKRED, SWIFT and others.          Another

youth was passed through the     gate.     I took this youth onto    the pitch

with another    officer.    As we laid him down I sawthe ground covered

with bodies.    All apparently dead.      People were walking around

crying, screaming,   panicking, hysterical.

T. remember noticing that this youth had been sick.        I laid him down

and assisted    another officer with mouth to mouth     and heart massage.

We manage to    pump more vomit out of his stomach.       We were assisted a

short time later by a civilian who stgated he was a doctor.            I s.ould

not feel any pulse on this youth.        I remember the doctor   had sustained

a cut to his head as blood was running down his face.         The doctor

assisted myself and another man who appeared on the scene.            Apparently

this second civilian was also a doctor.

After a few minutes I. felt a weak pulse apparent in the youth.           Heart

massage and mouth to mouth were continued and eventually two fire

officers appeared with oxygen equipment.

Other supporters came to our aid and it was decided that this youth

could possibly be saved.     We then placed him on one of the billboards,

ripped away from the side of the ground by the supporters and other®*

to be used as a stretcher.      The youth was laid on the board and we            .*■

carried him towards ambulances which were stationed in the passageway
    A                                                                    PAGE
    W                                                                    S I 359

between the North Standi and Spion Kopp.

The youth was there left in the care of the doctors and ambulance

staff.           I can describe this youth as 4bout 18-20 years, white male,

3   *    slim, fair hair*          light trousers,       t ’shirt.    I then returned to the

West Stand and again assisted colleagues to eyacltate supporters.

By the time I returned I could say about a quarter of the pitch was

occupied by dead bodies or p e r s o n s seriously injured.

1 have no ideas of any times during this event                       but when I returned I

noticed Police Officers at the back of the supporters that remained

inside the standing area of the West Stand.                       Gaps began to appear and

some supporters were able to leave as they entered, back through the

tunnel from Leppings Ln.

I recall shouting to the supporters, go back,                        look behind you, you can

get out.          But a lot took no notice at all.               They simply panicked and

kept pushing forward.               One supporter was wedged between the floor

inside the standing area and the track.                     His legs were trapped under

the volume of bodies and his torso was half out of the gateway.

Eventually we got him out.                   All efforts were hampered due to the fact

that the gates were too srnal 1 in both size and number.                           I saw some

supporters and police officers literally tearing and kicking at a part

of of this fence in order to get a female fan out.                           The fence wire

eventually became detached from its mounting frame and numerous fans

clammered to get out.

I never saw the little lad mentioned at the early part of this summary

again.       I don’t know whether he got out or not.                  I was approached by

an officer later and informed that the youth we took to the ambulance

had come round and was conscious.

I- r e c a l l    seeing   a   cordon   of   police   officers   later    spread   across   the

centre      of    the   pitch.

When the area at the ^est Stand had eventually been cleared I noticed

            all kinds of personal property lying around on the floor, shoes,

            coats, scarves, jumpers etc.    I remember being approached by two

            supporters while sat on a wall near the West, Stand.   They personally

            bore no blame on the police.

            I recall other incidents involving hysterical supporters screaming at

            the other officers on the pitch.    I did not witness any assaults on

            Police.    I suffered no physical injures.

            As I stated earlier I do not recall particular times in relation to

            specific events after entering the ground.

            I recall returning with Police Sergeant SWIFT, Police Constable AKRED,

            Police Constable HOOSON and Police Constable COOPER to the gym area

            where we were supplied with a drink.    From there we all went by

            transit van to Claywheels Ln.    I. believe we were then transported to

            Barnsley Divisional Headquarters where I. retired from duty at 6.30pm.

                  My name is Richard DEWS and I am an Inspector in the South Yorkshire

                  Police stationed at Attercli ffe.



                  On Saturday 15 April      1989 (150489)   I commenced duties at 8.00am (0800)

                  to perform duties in connection with the Liverpoo 1/Nottingham Forest

                  Semi Final at Hillsborough.



                  At 9.00am (0900) this date I attended a briefing at West Bar Police

                  Station where I received duties with serials 11-16.              The duties and

                  serials are as outlined in D Division Operational Order.              Our role

                  initially was to supervise Liverpool fans arriving at Midland Station

                  on the normal services train.       They were loaded onto public transport

                  and then taken to the ground.

At least two Police Officers travelled with each PSV so that their

conduct could be monitored.

 the ground was to report at the gymnasium for r#deployment.            •••



During the time we were at the Railway Station Liverpool fans were

good natursd and my officers had an excellent rapport.



I liaised with Inspector HARPER who was supervising the Nottingham

Forest Supporters at the Railway Station.     He did not require any

further assistance,   I then travelled to the Hillsborough Ground

arriving at Penistone Road at approximately 3.00pm (1500).



When walking along Penistone Road, towards the gymnasium there were

very few Nottingham Forest supporters waiting to go into the ground.

I believe these had attended in the hope of being able to buy a ticket

at the ground but had been unsuccessful.



I went into the ground, as I approached the gymnasium door I was met

by Chief Inspector SUMNER who asked, me to take some serials to the

West Stand where there was a pitch invasion.     I set off with a number

of other officers to deal with this incident.     Some officers were from

my previous serials, others were not.     On walking into the playing

area I saw that the game was still in progress in front of the West

Stand.'



The crowd was shouting and roaring and I saw spectators were still
                                                             *



coming over the fence of the playing area.     As we got past the halfway

line,   I saw a Police Officer run onto the pitch from the West Stand

and go up to the referee,      I then told my officers to form a cordon

across the pitch to sweep the spectators back towards the West Stand.

The West Stand terracing is fenced in and divided into sections by

iron railings.

             ..V                  .                 .




As we started to sweep them back and approached the fence of pen 3, I

saw fans crushed up against the wire mesh.      Some people were reaching

through the fence screaming and shouting for us to help them.        I went

up to them to try and reassure them and realised then that some of

them appeared to be dead.      Whilst up at the front I realised that the

crowd were still pushing forward and crushing the people at the front.

I saw people lapsing into     unconsciousness before my eyes. It    was not

a deliberate surge and on     looking out into the crowd it appeared they

were all leaning forward and this was creating a slow momentus of

crushing.    I stood up on the front and shouted loudly,     "Push back,

y o u ’re crushing people at the front."   I also made a pushing motion

with my arms.      It had absolutely no effect whatsoever.   Other officers

by this time had jumped onto the small wall and were gripping the wire

mesh and were shouting in     a similar way to myself.



People at the back of the     crowd were being pulled up into   the stand

above them and I had fears of someone being trapped onto the spikes of

the separating fences.



I continued to shout and all I could see were staring faces which were

not responding to our requests.



The tunnel to the rear of this enclosure did not appear to be blocked

at this time and a space had tisen created.     All it needed was for the
                                                                   PAGE      4
                                                                   S3568

crowd to start to move back and it would have helped to relieve the

pressure»



I was conscious that there were no police officer* to, "t|ie rear of the

crowd .



J. made a transmission to control to ask for officers to come in from

the rear of the stand to get, them to pull back, to do what was

required, but I had no recollection of them responding to the call.

You will appreciate that due to the shouting and screaming and people

milling around on the pitch,    it was near enough a sheer impossibility

to hear the radio, even though I held it next to my ear.



I stood back to take stock of the situation.      Immediately in front of

me were a number of people trapped on the fence in a large pile.      I

saw that the gate to the number 3 enclosure was now open and officers

were in     the gateway, one of whom I identified was Chief Superintendent

NESBIT. He had a number of     officers with him so I remained in situ.

I saw that some officers were near number 4 gate, giving assistance.

People were still climbing over the fence and coming ovSr the top of

number 3 pen.    We assisted them to the playing track.



I then made a request for bolt cutters in an effort to create another

opening into number 3 terrace.      Again I do not know if this message

was received or if in fact they ever came to our location.      I then saw

Police Officers and spectators kicking at the fence to my right and by

pulling the wire back they created an entrance into this enclosure.

This still being pen    number 3.   I immediately went to this space and

started     to assist in bringing people out from the enclosure onto the

playing area.
                                                                      PAGE    5
                                                                      S3568



You will appreciate that some of the bodies that were removed from the

enclosure were either unconscious or dead and as Officers came to the

entrance to carry people away I was telling them to see to them to            '

give what aid they could.



Casualties were building up on the pitch behind the goal area and I

told Officers to take them further onto the pitch so as not to cause

obstruction for ourselves.       Whilst we were helping people one man who

was conscious became trapped in the wire and whilst we Were trying to

assist hirn people were jumping on him and over him and other people

who were trapped to get on the pitch.       I do not blame them for this,

some of them were injured), some had cuts.      They had been trapped for

so long that once they became free they wanted to get out of that

situation.     The young man was eventually freed and moved on to the

pitch.      I continued to help at this location where both regular

Officers and Special Constables were involved in carrying people away.

Spectators and Police Officers were involved in removing the bodies

from this particular area.       I was conscious that one young man, a

Liverpool Supporter, was stood up and the pile of casualties was above

his knees.     Until then I had not fully appreciated the enormity of the

t ragedy.



I then saw that the enclosure was now empty of casualties but was full

of Police Offi cers and the remaining spectators.



I looked around the area of the goalmouth where I saw 8t J o h n ’s

Ambulance people and Police Officers involved in giving various types

of artificial     respiration.   An ambulance had come down the pitch to

number 3 enclosure.      I then noticed that the Fire Service were in
                                                                    PAGE      h
                                                                    S 3 56S

attendance with some of their members walking about with oxygen

bottles which they were giving to people who required that service.



I then became conscious of -some hostility between the Police

Officers and spectators in the pen and told the officers to come out

of that area onto the pitch and they did.     1 remained in that area of

the pitch as they did.



I remained in that area purely as a containment exercise when suddenly

I became aware of a skirmish in the number 3 enclosure.       I looked

round and saw a stocky built uniformed Police Officer running out of

the enclosure.    He had his head in his hands.    He was not wearing a

helmet and he ran onto the pitch.    Two other officers followed.        I was

unable to speak to them but I understand that they had been into the

enclosure with a Scenes of Crime Officer to take photographs and this

had upset the spectators.



We then appeared to be in a state of limbo.       Officers were stood about

in groups on the playing area.    Spectators were still ripping down

boardings to make makeshift stretchers.     I then started to re-group

what was left of my serials which would be five Sergeants and 15

Constables.   All of us, without exception,   by this time were in a

state of shock.   Police Officers were walking about the pitch crying

and I ensured that they were comforted by other Officers.



Whilst I was on the pitch a number of supporters kept trying to pick

an argument with me stating that it would not have happened if

Liverpool had been allowed to use a larger stand.       I pointed out that

this was nothing to do with me and they all accepted it and said they

were upset.   At no time was I threatened with violence but it appeared
                                                                    PAGE     v7
                                                                    S3368

to me that they only wanted to argue.



I   later attended at Penistone Road to, load the Liverpool fans onto the

bus to return to.the Station.      In the main the spectators were very

very subdued as wer#. my officers.     So far as I recall, only two bus

loads left that location.       I put my remaining Officers onto one of the

buses where they sat in silence.



Whilst 1    was   stood outside on the pavement, a young man came to me, a

Liverpool supporter and asked for the directions to the Northern

General Hospital and how he could make enquiries regarding his

friend.     I started to obtain details of the casualty number when one

of his friends started shouting,      "I’ve told you not to speak to those

bastards.     You bastards did this, murderers."    He then went on to say

we had opened the gates and had caused the problem.



I   initially wanted to go and remonstrate with him but decided it was

better to ignore the remarks, not knowing all the facts, than creating

a scene.     This remark really hurt me as all the Officers who were

with me had given their all in an effort to help the crushed

supporters.



At no time did I see any of the Club Stewards in the ground.       I have

referred to my problems with the radio but would add that everyone

appeared to be so engrossed in their respective duties that they did

not or could not hear any radio transmissions.



t handled many, many casualties.       Some had lost their lower garments

whilst being in the crush, others had wet themselves, been sick, so

one car\ apprectate the smell Jit this particular location.
                                                                  PAGE

My main involvement, was passing the people on to other Officers to be

taken away and the only one I handled at that time who I feel that I

could   recognise, again was a young girl/woman being carried out with

dark brown spiky hair,    long at the sides, wearing what appealed to be

a brown coat or dress.



Many young officers responded to their responsibilities with vigour

and determination and were a credit to the South Yorkshire Police.

Some climbed over the fence into the pen to lift people out and on

occasions gave artificial, respiration whilst others had to stand on

the fence and shout at people to pull back.



The things that really stick in my mind weres™



•13      A young policewoman coming up to me and asking what she could

         do.   I told her to get the crowd to push back.   She then left

         me and ran up the fence nearly to the top and was shouting and

         screaming at the crowd in her determination to get them to

         respond.



23       This was the depth of bodies that had built up in the well of

         the terracing.



My own feelings are that I shall never forget the helplessness and

frustration I felt when 1 went to the West Stand.



Here I am, a well paid professional with nearly 28 years service who

has attended and been involved in many public order situations and

attended many courses to improve my professionalism, yet here I was

         when I was most needed by the community, when I could have given most

         help, thwarted at the first hurdle by a 'fence' with strands of wire

         approximately one eighth diameter.



         I could touch them, speafe. to them and nothing more.

                    On Saturday 15th April 1989,          <150489),   I commenced duty in full

                    uniform at Police Headquarters, Sheffield.              I then attended at the

                    gymnasium at West Bar Pol Stn for a briefing at 9.00 am (0900).



                    After the briefing I walked to the Midland Stn, Sheffield to take up

                    duties as part of West Bar Serial number 16.              On arrival at the

                    station I was engaged in the control of football fans a 1ig ht ing from

                    the trains.     Both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans arrived at the

                    station and were segregated and directed through separate exits and on

                    to P.S.Vs, which were waiting to take the fans to the Sheffield

                    Wednesday Football          club.



                    At approximately 2.30 pm (1430), together with the rest of my serial,

                    I travelled to the          ground on a P.S.V*
                                                                      PAGE              2

At approximately S.45 pm (1445) 1 was still on .the        PSV iii Leppings

Ln.   I saw there wa$ a large crowd of fans still outside the ground,

and a large number Of people walking

vfrom the direction of Halifax Rd along Leppings Ln towards th^t

entrance.     On our arrival at Penistone Rd,     I alighted from the bus and

walked into the ground via the main police access road.



together with the other officers from my serial I went to the

gymnasium where we were to report for standby duties.         Almost as soon

as we had arrived, our serial was instructed to go to the perimeter

track in front of the West Stand.       I understood that there was       a

problem with the crowd but 1     did not know exactly what.



I walked onto the track in front of the West Stand.          I noticed that

the football players were on the pitch, although I cannot say whether

the game had in fact started,    or if it was the pre-match warm up.               At

this time I was not aware of anything untoward.          I continued round the

track until I got to the centre of the West Stand.         That was when I

noticed that the people directly behind the fencing were screaming and

shouting at us to do something as they were getting crushed.



I was spat at by a number of the      fans. I saw that    the people at       the

fencing were being crushed up to the fenceand a young         girl aged       about

15 years old was extremely squashed.       Sbhe was crying and obviously

distressed.     I bent down to her and told her not to panic it would be

alright.    The people round her were trying in vain to push back away

from her.     She was in pen no. 3 area to my     left of the railing, which

divides pens 3 and 4.     There was   no way of   getting to this girl.        I

initially shouted to the crowd to push backwards, but I realised
■ZL                                                               PAGE-      3
W                                                                 S3328

immediately that this was of no use.                 A youth aged about          16 years   old

climbed up onto the         fencing.        I climbed onto a metal bar in front             of

the fence and helped him over.              Once on the track I told him to stay

there and he did, as;'requettedii             Other fans followed suit and I he 1 ped

them climb o v e r the fence and onto the perimeter track.                       I was

then joined by a number of male officers who also start*! polling

people over the fencing.               As they were taller and stranger than 1, I

moved out of the way, thinking they would get more people out quicker

and relieve the crush around the girl.                 There was nothing more; I could

do at this point so I went to gate number 4, which had been opened.



Some fans were climbing over the railings which divided pens ,;3 and 4„

I was assisting them out of the gate.                  It was at this point that one

supporter who was standing at the gate in pen no. 4 refused to move

out of the way.       He     became abusive and continually swore at me, saying

he'd got out of the          crush and was watching the match.                I realised, the

game was still being played.               I had to forcibly move this man out of

the way onto the perimeter track.                  I assisted other fans out of the

gate.       People in pen 3 were hindered by the centre railings and had

difficulty climbing over them in order to reach gate 4.



I saw that some of the perimeter fence had been pulled down,                          people

were being carried out and laid on the pitch.                    As other officers had

joined me at the gate I left in order to see if I could help anyone

else.       I made sure that everyone laid on the pitch had someone helping

them or rendering first aid.



I assisted a fireman who was giving the kiss of life to a heavily

built man aged approximately 25 years, who was wearing black tracksuit

bottoms and trainers.              We were subsequently joined by a doctor who
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S3328

         took over until an ambulance arrived and the man was conveyed in

         that.     At one point a couple of fans on the pitch were becoming

         aggressive towards fans in the North Stand.        I spoke to them,

         eventually calmed them down and they left the pitch area.        Police

         Officers and fans carried o t h e r injured people off the pitch to. the

         gymnasium.     I went to the gymnasium and in that area saw a number of

         ambulances.     I helped clear a route for them.     I subsequently went, a

         directed,    onto the North Stand for a debrief, following which I

         attended at the casualty bureau at Ecclesfield Training Centre and

         carried out duties there.

                 I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police Force,

                 currently attached to the Drug Squad at Police Headquarters.            Prior to

                 15 April,   1989 (150489),    I volunteered to work in uniform at the semi

                 final   held at Sheffield Wednesday Stadium on Saturday 15 April 1989

                 (150489).      The teams playing on that date were Liverpool and

                 N o 11 ingham F orest.

                 On the morning of Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489)          I commenced duty at

                 8.00 am (0800) and attended at briefing held at West Bar Police

                 Station at 9.00 am (0900).

                 I was attached to West Bar serial 16 under the command of PS SWIFT and

                 our initial duties consisted of attending at. Midland Station where

                 both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Fans were to arrive and supervise

                 their conduct at the station and ensure that they were directed into

                 the awaiting PSV and together with two Police officers per PSV they
                                                                   PAGE       2
                                                                   83694

were to be escorted to the ground.

On completion of the briefing we were provided with a packed meal, and

after consuming this we walked to Midland Station as a serial.      On

arrival there at approximately 10.00 am (1000) We remtifted there and

carried out our duties as previously stated.

At approximately 2.30 pm (1430) that date our complete serial boarded

a PSV and was conveyed to the Penistone Road end of the Football

Stadium,    On arrival we went directly to the gym where we were to be

held on standby.    I am unsure of the time at this stage, however,' I

can recall that on our arrival at the ground there was considerable

Radio traffic, all relating to problems being suffered at the Leppings

Lane entrance to the ground.     1 cannot recall any particular officers

however the situation sounded very hectic.     We were immediately told

to leave the gym and go onto the track surrounding the pitch and go to

the Lepping Lane terraces where problems were being encountered.         As

■far as I. am aware we were not told what the problems were at that

particular end of the ground.    As we walked round the track to the

Leppings Lane terraces I can recall that the match had not started.

At that stage there were only ’Area' Police officers from F Division

bn the perimeter track.    Those 1 recognised were P C ’s tiARSDEN, WALPOLE

and BROOKES.    As I got to the Leppings Lane end of the ground the

Liverpool supporters were throwing coins and verbal abuse at the

Police officers.    They were also spitting at them and shouting

’Fucking murderers,   do something.’   The whole feeling of this crowd

was one of aggression directed towards the Police officers on the

track.     It was at this stage that I actually saw the crowd inside the

pen and I realised what was happening.     I saw people being physi cally

squashed against the mesh, their faces bulging through the holes, they

were vomitting on the person next to them and those that could still

talk were crying out for help.    This crush went back for 3 to 6 rows
 A                                                           PAGE     3
     ’                                                                    S3694

and the sound was one of people crying and a wailing sound that T. have

never heard before.      The supporters behind these were still hurling

abuse at the Police and spitting at them.        As I passed behind the goal

at the Leppings Lane end of the ground the crush inside the pens

seemed t o b e   getting worse,   I could see children and teenagers being

physically crushed against the mesh, their faces were turning purple,

their eyes bulging and vomit and saliva trickling from their mouths.

I then saw a man of about 40 to 50 years, white hair, and grey jacket,

he was at the front of the crush and his face was totally distorted

with being crushed against the mesh.         He had turned purple and it was

obvious that he was dead.         I realised that if something was not done

there were going to be more deaths in that pen.

At briefing that morning I had been issued with a personal radio the

noise from the crowd was such that I could not hear anything at all.

I called control several times on the radio but I. heard no response.

I do not know whether they heard me or whether the noise was such that

1 could not hear     them acknowledging my call.     Again I can remember

shouting down the radio that there were dead people in the crowd.             The

scene and the sound at the front of those terraces was unbelievable.

I was now near to one of the small access gates that lead into the

terraces, and I realised that this must be opened immediately in an

attempt to get into the people inside.         I looked round for a

supervisory officer but I could not see one.         Together then with

several other officers using our own initiative we opened the gate at

the left of the goal leading into the terraces into the centre pen.

On opening the door I intended to enter the centre pen area and try

to render what assistance I could, however once the door was opened

outward it became apparent that the crush was such that no one could

enter the pen,     in fact the supporters inside were crushed together to

such an extent that the two or three actually in front of the door
                                                                PAGE      4

could not get out, they were wedged together.

Together with several other Police officers I began to attempt to

force the supporters back, to relieve the crush, however I immediately

realised that this was futile and there was no way that this crush of

bodies could be forced back.   I then began dragging out supporters

from the pen, these however were the ones that had been stood several

rows back they were climbing over the heads of the ones at the front

who were still crushed together so that they could not move.    As we

were helping these fans out onto the pitch they were striking and

kicking out at the Police and hurling abuse at them.    It was obvious

that the majority of them were drunk and on several occasions I was

struck and kicked by these supporters.

As I helped the first initial wave of supporters out they mainly

appeared alright and they made their way round the track to the North

Stand.   After this first wave had come out the supporters that we were

helping out were in a worse condition, although I would say that most

of them appeared to be still breathing.   It was during this that I

lost my uniform helmet, my tie and my Police spectacles,   recovering my

helmet later on that day.   I pulled one supporter out who was wearing

all denims, and he appeared to be still breathing, as I pulled him

onto the pitch he vomitted, and at that point I was joined by

Inspector HARVEY and together we walked him around on the pitch until

he had calmed down and was breathing more normally.    I then left this

man with Inspector HARVEY and rejoined other officers at the gate.

During all this time we were still being abused by the rest of the

crowd inside the pen and numerous supporters who we had already got

out onto the pitch were fighting with myself and other officers in an

attempt to get back into the pen;

On -several occasions I had great difficulty convincing these people

that they could not go, back in and that they werS only getting in th«i
                                                                       PAGE      5

way of rescue attempts-     The majority of them after being initially

very aggressive towards me would simply break down and start crying,

and slump down onto the pitch.

It was at so|ne point during this I cannot recall exactly when that I

realised that the game had actually started, as I led a fan out Onto

the pitch and handed him over to other Police officers who were stood

behind I saw the game in progress.

As,I looked along at the fence away from the gate to either side 1

could still see people trapped who were either dead or very near to

death that we still couldn't get to.

I then saw PS KNIGHTS and a Policewoman stood on the hoardings several

yards from the gate,    lifting supporters over the fence.       I joined them

and assisted in lifting several      fans over this fence and handing them

down to officers     who were stood on the track.     These were all still

alive through in a various state of health.

As we lifted one     supporter over I realised that, there were no Police

officers to hand     him down to so I climbed down still holding this

youth.   I carried him onto the pitch whereafter I ascertained that he

was in fact still breathing.      I left him and returned to the fence.          I

then saw Superintendent GREENWOOD stood talking to PS MORTON on the

perimeter track.    PS MORTON then ran off towards the gym area.           The

pitch in front of the Leppings Lane end was littered with people, the

majority of whom appeared to be alive although numerous were being

tended by Police officers and other supporters.         I realised that the

match had^ been stopped at some stage.

I then heard a siren and on looking towards the gym area I saw a St

Jo h n ’s ambulance corne onto the pitch and drive towards the Leppings

Lane end.   It stopped directly behind the goal and a St Johns

Ambulanceman alighted from the vehicle.

<%s I got to the gate leading into the centre pen n u m e r o u s ,other

officers were still there and we were joined by Chief Superintendent

NESRIT who organised us into a funnel leading out from the gate onto

the pitch.     I realised that several Police Officers were now inside

the cent re pen, rendering first aid to fans on the terraces.           These

officers   inside   began to pass out bodies to us and w e ^ e r e   then

passing them down the funnel onto the pitch where other Police were

tending them.       It was obvious to me that the vast majority of these

fans were dead.       Their bodies were limp, their faces were purple, they

were covered in vomit, and they all had several items of clothing

missing or hanging off them in tatters.

Chief Superintendent NESBIT joined officers inside the pen and was

assisting in handing bodies out to myself and other officers who were

on the track.

Occasionally someone would shout,       "This one’s still alive" and that

particular body would be rushed out through the gate and laid onto the

•Field where ambulancemen had now joined Police officers and other

supporters in rendering first aid.        The sight of these bodies was

terrible as none had any apparent injuries other than purple faces.

They were obviously suffering from crush injuries.

.I remained outside at the gate helping to lift bodies out and onto the

track.     I. remained there until the front part of the centre pen had

been cleared, then together with other officers I entered the pen and

we formed a cordon approximately half way up the terraces, to preserve

the scene.       The terraces were littered with shoes,      items of people’s

clothing, money, spectacles etc.

As I stood in this cordon I looked onto the pitch and saw that other

officers had formed a cordon across the pitch at about the centre of

the field, thereby containing the Liverpool supporters and the injured

and keeping them from the Nottingham Forest supporters.          1 also saw

that Police and supporters were pulling the advertising hoardings down

that were round the ground and were using them as stretchers to carry

bodies to the gym area.

All daring this time we were being subjected to continual abuse from

Liverpool supporters who were above us in the seating in the West

Stand, they were also still spitting on us and shbuting,    "Fucking

murderers" and “This is all your fucking fatult."

After-a period of time the word was passed along the cordon to return

onto the pitch.    I did this and along with several other officers

broke up numerous fights that were taking place between Liverpool

supporters.    It became apparent that these fights were the result of

one fan blaming the Police for what had happened and the second one

apparently defending them.    Once this situation had calmed down, 1'

remained on the pitch together with other officers assisted in

carrying the wounded to the gym area and also attempted to get the

fans that could walk unaided off the pitch.     Several supporters asked

me if the match had been postponed and after asking other Police

officers I was informed that it in fact had been.     During a luill in

this action I met PS MORGAN and after conversing with him for a period

of time we obtained a drink of water from a bucket brought round the

field by a man in a tracksuit who was an employee of Sheffield

Wednesday.

Once the pitch had cleared I made my way to the gym at the rear of the

North Stand.   On my arrival there the scene was one of organised chaos

with ambulances all over and the injured laid out on the floor.        The

gym was being used as a morgue.

Supporters were constantly arriving with injured people or dead ones

on makeshift stretchers.     I then met up with DS GLOSSOP and together

with him we were assigned to security on the gym door with the

instruction that no injured were to be carried into the gym as only

the dead were being took in there.    Any injured were to be placed
                                                                           PAGE    a

         outside on the ground where ambulancemen and Police officers and off

         duty hospital staff were caring for them.

         I assisted in loading the injured into ambulances, and at one point I

         esibrfel % man who stated he was an off duty Merseyside Police Officer

         not ID him however he broke down at the sight in the gym and I took

         him outside provided him with a drink and left him sat down.      I

          returned "to DS GLOSSOP on security duty at the gym door.

         Once the scene had settled down all offi cers not involved with

         anything at that time were directed to the North Stand, as we were not

         required any longer as security for the gym door myself and DS GLOSSOP

         made our way into the stand, where we joined DC KETTON, DC GIBSON and

         DC PRIESTLEY and other officers.    A short time later Chief Inspector

         BEAL told us that if there were no other duties we had to perform we

         could stand down.    In company with other officers I then walked back

         to West Bar Police Station, where a de-brief was held by Chief

         Inspector DONNELY.    On completion of which we were informed we could

         go off duty.

         I terminated duty at S.00 pm (S000) that night at Police HQ.

            STATEMENT OF EVENTS AS REMEMBERED AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND ON

            APRIL 15TH 1989.
Approx 10.00 am I a r r i v e d at the Football Gr ou nd with my colleague

                        The    bulk     of the morning was        spent    checking    through

t echnical      equipment and a rr anging             the    layout    of the    commentary

pos it io n   'For Matc,h of the D a y ’ .

13,00    Approx I spent the most of the lunch break inside the mai n

office and        r ec eption are a of the           club.

1 4 . 0 0 p m - 1 4 . 3 0 p m Approx,     1 was   situated.in the dressing room area of

the   club and also           down the      players    tunnel.        At no time was       I aware   of

crowd    problems as          1 had no visual         contact, with the         terraces    during

this time „
At about       14.30    3 left      the    players    dressing    room area and       p roceeded to
                                                                                                          PAGE           t
                                                                                                          SS4S3

the BBC        comm en ta ry    position w ith my             colleague,         comemtator Joh n llotson.

The    c omme nt ar y    position was         s it uated on top of the main stand and

provi ded a good view             of the terraces              s ur ro unding      the   pitch.

O n settling down          in our seats we then had tinie;M t t k e                        stock     af the

crowds        irv the ground.         To my right         I could see that, the N o t t i n g h a m

f o re s t    fans a p p e a r e d to be     in position         in their         stand while at          the

Leppings R oad end it was quite obvious that, the Liverpool fans were

still        arriving,      I would        like to say that a lt h o u g h the             terraces        looked

very full         behind the      g o a l — - I w ould        not have       been qua li fi ed      in crowd

control,        to be able       to state         if the terrace was too full.                    (Time now

A pprox 2 . 5 0 p m ).

At 3 ,0 0 p m the m at ch started and                I was      bas ic al ly       c on centrating       on the

game.         At about, 3 . 0 5 pm I was aware            of fans          c 1 inibing'over the ferics

behind        the Livepool       goal.       My    reaction to this was               to think      that    they

were    being      s qu as he d as    the    terrace area was very full.,.                  I saw Police

0 1'fleers trying to p u s h fans ba c k i n t,o t h e t e r ra c e a r e a ,                  1.n my h o n w s t

opin io n the fans,            although      spilling         over    onto       the area behind

the goal        an d dead ball        line,       gave   no    indic at io n of wanting           to disrupt

the m atch        ( especially as at          the    other      end Peter B e a r d s l e y had just

come     close     to scoring).            They just      had no where             else to go.       As    the

pitch got more           crowded the         referee     then stop pe d the match,

I think        in the early stages            of fans         climbing       the fence,     the Police

O f fi ce rs    1 could see,         o bviously thought              the    fans were out      to    cause

trouble.          Later after        the    play had been stop pe d                it became   obvious          that,

something        else was wrong — a lt h o u g h              it was       impossible     from the view              I

had from the          comm en ta ry    position just what                  the    problem was.

At about 3 . -15pm I left             the    commentary         position and went           down to the

P lay e r s    tunnel    to join my         colleague D e s m o n d L y n h a m , t hroughout             the

next 30 minutes           I stayed         in the tunnel         w ith D. Lyn ha m while            he

                                                                                                       S2423

the air.         During        this     time     dazed and shoc ke d fans were             being a l lo we d

u n e s c o r t e d to wander         up the        tunnel    to the    dressing     room area.        At    one

point a Liverpool                fan,    seeing       that a t e l ev is io n    camera was        in the

tunnel and also that D e s m o n d L yn h a m had a m i c ro ph on e and                            'obviously

going       to broadcast          from the          tunnel   area,     tried to Shout        into the

m i c ro phone,       whe n    I asked       him to move        up the tunnel,         3 was    he ad -b ut te d

in the face.                  I would       like to make       it    clear    that   the fan did not

a pp ear     to have        been drinking,             but was       very shocked as he had said - he

had m a n a g e d to get out             of the       crowded       terrace   behind the Liv er po ol

goal     by Standing and walking                     over    bodies.

I feel, that          the     h e a d- bu tt in g    incident was more          total, f ru s t r a t i o n than

a n yt h i n g   else,.

Later       on   (tame unknown)             I left     the tunnel       area and      proceeded to the

L iverpool        goal      area.       There       I saw several       bodies     .Lying on the floor.

At    the    time     Ithought        the    people were        uncons ci ou s ••••■ it was     not until

later,       whe n    I     saw some         of the same       bodies    near    the BBC     vehicles       that 1

d i s c o v e r e d t h e y w e r e :in f a c t d e a d

The    rest of the day was                  spent mai nl y      in the    dressing      room area,      where

we had set           u.p a m a k e - s h i f t   t e le vi si on studio.        I finally      left   the

ground at Appro;-; ten minu te s                     past midnight.

These are the             facts as       best as       I can    remember      from the     day and     not

from seeing and               reading       subsequent        reports.

                        I    have    been          employed          in    my    present         capacity           as    Operations        Manager            4o r

                        Since       1986        <000086)         I    have       had     liaison           with     the     Police     regarding            match

                                                                                       S3770

         It is common practice on match days for Leppings Lane to be closed for

         a period of time to allow the police to transfer fans to their various

         modes of transport      i.e.   train,   coaches,   cars.    This normally occurs

         just as the game is closing to an end.



         The buses use standard diversions when Leppings Lane             is closed.         The

         drivers are made aware of the closures by radio.



         On the -15th of April'.. 1989 (150489,)      even though the Leppings Lane was

          closed earlier than normal,       it caused no hardship because the standard

         diversion was implemented.



         Leppings Lane      is only used by 3 SYT services.          It is not    classed as a

         main bus route,      it is primarily a link        road between Peru stone Road and

         Mi dal ©wood Road.      In a period of an hour there would, only be 8 buses

         operating on this section of the road.,



         A request was made to divert buses away from Leppings Lane prior to

         kick off.       This was just done and no questions asked.              I have no

         knowledge of the exact time that the request was made.



         In short,      closing Leppings Lane     is very common place on match days and

         would not appear as an unusual          request.




                                                                                      SIGNED

                 in pairs at         the rear of the west Stand at the               Leppings      Lane end of

                 the stadium.            Our duties    included crowd control            and public order

                 policing.

                 1 have no record or recollection of any incident of disorder or other

                On Saturday,        9th April,        1988 (090488)        I performed duty at

                Hillsborough in connection with the FA Cup Bemi Final Match being

                played between Liverpool and Mott i righam Forest..

                My duties were          in re Iat ion to the West titand,' Leppings Lane and                         the

                serials that         I was in charge of were detailed for duty in the seating

                area of that stand.                Prior to the match I remember being                    in the area

                between the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the rear of the stand.                                         I

                the kick off I was called into the seating area of the West Stand due

                to problems        in that area.          I have no recollection of any events                       in

                relation to the wooden gates at the rear of the West Stand which are

                at the entrance to the tunnel                 leading to the Centra.I             pen,     standing

                area.     Prior to my being called away,                  as far as 1 can remember those

                qat,es were open and people were passing through them normally..

                I went    into the seating area of the West Standi and saw that                              I,he

                people at the front of that seating area were assisting                                  people from

                the standing area in climbing                 into the seating area..                  Together with a

                number    of the officers            in my serials we went to the front of the

                seatj.rig area of the stand to prevent this,

                For some time prior to the kick off and certainly during the whole of

         There     was     also       a    problem          due     to       tickets             having           been        passed b y p e o p l e

                   On Saturday 15th April                1989,    (150489)       I was on duty at Hillsborough

for    every m atch at Hillsborough,                     I went          through the m a t c h order

allocat-e       particular          gates     for     individual          officers,                                    •

This     I left to PS CHAPMAN,                  though       I u n d e r s t a n d that these         officers                ,*

work     in the same          position each week.               S e r g e a n t CHAP M A N then took his

At    10 35am    (1055)       I spoke        to the whole           of     the serial       2 in the N orth

Stand.     I went        through          the details         of the match order, leaving                    the

sergeants        to    identify       officers         for    particular          duties.       I s t r essed to

these     officers          that    they needed to be fully aware                        of the     e m ergency

e v a c u a t ia n p r o cedures          a n d p o i n t e d o u t t ot h e m the 'f a c t t hia t t h e u p p e r

s e c t i i o n of the       south stand was made m a i n l y                  of timber        and any       risk of

fire was        greatest       at    that     end.

At    1110am     (1110)       I spoke        to the w h o l e ' o f       serial     3 in the        upper     level

of    the South Stand w h i c h was where                    that    serials       duties were,             The

responsibility              of giving        individual        officers          their     particular        duties

in line with the order.

At    1120am     (1120)       I briefed         the stewards             who were w o r k i n g - i n     the S ou t h

S tand    both upper and             lower      levels.       This       took    place     in the upper           level       ■

of the South Stand,                 I exp l a i n e d to the stewards                the    procedures         to be

f o l lowed     in the      event     of an eme r g e n c y e v a c u a t i o n after w hich               1 a sked

if there were any queries                     or doubts.        There were           none,      I reminded         them

that     their    duties were             in the S outh S t a n d w hich was                co n s t r u c t e d ma i n l y

of woo d and that any                likelihood of a fire                   in the ground was greatest

at the end,           I exp l a i n e d    that a capacity               crowd was e x p e c t e d and that

sa f e t y was    of     paramount           importance and that                 it was     essential that          the

stewards and Police must                       work    in close liaison.                If there wa«s any hint

of any     problems         they were told to                contact a Police Officer                   of w h i c h           «

there were        over 20 work i n g            in that       stand.       I asked the stewards                if they

had any questions               or a n t ic i p a t e d any   problems'at. that             s t a g e . two

problems were               ident i f i e d by stewards       who     had worked the Semi               Final        the

previous year,               these were;

IV       Suppo r t e r s without         tickets     jumping        over     the   turnstiles

2.       Exit ai.siss from the stands being congested during the game by

         officers           taking    up positions there.

Following -.'that briefing I spoke to the sergeants in Serials 2 and 3,

advised         them, of these         two   points and        instructed them to              inform

Co n s t a b l e s    under    their    command accordingly.               From that moment             I

pa trolled t hose areas                I had 'responsibility for               i.e.     S outh S t a n d and

perimeter            track.    There was a slow build               up of     crowd from that time,,

though       it a p p e a r e d that N o t t i n g h a m Forrest        supporters          were arriving

in greater            numbers     than the Liverpool            supporters.         I made       comment        on

this     to several           officers as       I spoke       to them during my patrol.                     I

recall       sometime         before 2pm       (1400)    visiting       the    room under         Lne South

S t a n d where        the    cameras and       crowd    counting m a c h i n e r y         is held,, The

comment was made               by someone       in there      that     there were           12,UuSJ in the

ground, at           that    time,    and at the     same      time    the    previous year          there       had

b e e n . 20,   000     in the ground.

S o m etime      ar o u n d 2 pm      <1400)    I noticed       problems were           being     ex p e r i e n c e d

wit h my        radio.       There was ah intermittent                bussing      type     noise w hich made

re ception very              poor and difficult          to understand.            At   this     time       1 had an

earpiece        extension         in use.      I. took   this    off    but    it made        no difference.

I made my way to the                               ' and spoke with Superintendent. G R E E N W O O D
                                      ’t u n n e l ’

and S e r g ea n t C HAP MAN.          Th ey con fir med      tha t they were e xp e ri e n c i n g

similar         problems.        Inspector HARVEY         joined       us and made           similar        comment.

He   then stated that                he w o u l d go to the Police Control                  Room and advise

the staff of the problem. As he was about to go I saw one of the radio

techni c i a n s walk i n g          along   the   perimeter        track     towards me.         He was with

on the'‘way         to the Control         Roo m to sort           out       the   problem. By 2 . 3 0 pm

(1430)     the      size    of the    crowd had        continued             to     rise and the            noise           t

were     creating was         considerable.         R e c e p t i o n of     radio messages was            poor

due     to the      noise    created by the           crowd and the interfepence                 earlier

At 2. 4 0 p m     (-1440)    I was at     the    players      tunnel         w h e n I decided to walk

two     pens w hich were almost            full,      but were         not    posing any undue

the game ready to start. I was unaware at that time that there were                                                or

had been any problems with s u pporters outside the ground at the

Leppings        Lane end.      I am not      sure     if t his‘ was          due to    continued
 :Lnterf erence            on the     radio      or the     volume      of noise         g e nerated by the

 crowd,,       I think       it was        probably a c o m b i n a t i o n of the two.                  The    game had

been u n d e r w a y for a few minutes and                        I was at        the? track      perimeter           near

to     the     tunnel.       Supt.        GRfcElMWOOD was also          there and we were

moving         on a number           of    photog raphers who were                congregating aro u n d              the

tunnel w a i t i n g         for Mr CLOUGH,              the' Not, t i n gharri Forest Manager                 to take

up his         position        in seats          immediately behind              the    "dug out",,

As     the     p h o t ographers were m oved on                  it w o u l d    be about 3. 0 5 p m           (1505)

and      I was about          to take my place              just     inside       the tunnel        when        I. looked

 towards           the L e p p i n g s Lane       terracing and saw what a p p e a r e d                  to be some

sort 'of commotion taking                        place    i m m e d iately      behind the goal.               I made

 I made my way              round to that             location,      Supt.       G R E E N W O O D was    some 20 yds

 in front           of me,    and     there were          other, 'officers either               there      or making

 their way there.               When       I got      to the     section        of the terrace            to    the

officer's were              trying        to   pull     people    through.        I went       to the gate and

t ried       to assist         but    the      gate was     so narrow that              only a certain number

of officers               could be effective,              otherwise we were                 simply getting           in

each others way.                Just       inside       the gate     I could see that              injured        people

were       piled         on top of        each other,       unable      to move.         Police     officers were

pulling            them out a n d onto            the    perimeter      track,         but    this was         proving

d i f f i c u l t y as many of the               injured       in this       pile of bodies          just        inside

the     gate were           un c o n s c i o u s and unable        to assist           themselves         iri anyway.

1 stood on the a d v er t i s i n g                boards      on the     perimeter          track and shouted

to the         crowd further              back   to     push backwards.           The t^cod of. a large

sect i o n of this            crowd was angry,              and they were              shouting abuse           back at

the metal       fence       into    the    outer    pen and       I remember      that    there was

sufficient          room    in the     outer    pen for       them to climb down from the                   fence

fairly easily,, Some               officers    had made          their way     into    this     outer      pern

% n d were ass i s t i n g      people      over.     Despite       tHis    there was      still many

people     crushed and          unable      to move at the front              qf the     centre      pen.       On#;

or two m a n a g e d to        climb over       the    perimeter         fence and onto         the track,             I

went    back    to the        gate and started to assist                   bringing    bodies      out     from

the    terrace and take             them onto       the     pitch,       I did not know w hich were

dead and w h i c h were            simply unconscious,              I just    helped to       pull       them

from    the         terrace and take         them onto        the    pitch where       other officers, St,

John A m bulance           staff     and others were att e n d i n g           to them.       Onl y slowly as

the dead and          injured were          brought       onto    the    pitch did      it become

slightly easier             to bring more          from the       terrace,     through      the    gate and

onto    the    pitch,       I alternated        between as s i s t i n g with this and helping

of time as this             continued       until     the    central       section of the         terrace         had

been    cleared.       During       this    time    I cannot        recali    having     heard any         radio

messages,       but     the    noise      from the     ground was          deafening.      When    the

terrace       was    clear     there were many of the fans                   obviously       in a very

distressed          state,     some were       crying       together       in groups,      others        were

shouting abuse at Police                   officers -- some abuse was               directed at blaming

Police     officers         for what       had happened.          That     criticism was always

directed       in the terms          ’Its your        fault,      you should have          given     us more

tickets.’

1 became aware             that a Police        cordon had been formed towards                     the Spion

Kop end       preventing Liverpool             supporters           going    to that     end*     As order

began to slowly             restore,       and the     pitch      cleared of bodies           I tried       to

assem b l e      a serial          of officers      together.        Those    I a s s e m b l e d were

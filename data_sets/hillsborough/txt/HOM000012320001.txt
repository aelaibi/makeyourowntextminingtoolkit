HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT

I offer the following re-drafts of passages from the version
considered at the Home Secretary's meeting this morning:


     (i)    page 4, replace third,    fourth and fifth sentences of
            paragraph at bottom of page by


            "Lord Justice Taylor rightly reminds us;that without
            work by the police many sporting events would be
            chaotic and could not be permitted to take place.
            He pays tribute to the police for their service
            which he says is often thankless.                  I want to add my
            personal tribute to his and to thank the police for
            their invaluable efforts in maintaining order at
            sports events.


    (ii)    page 6, replace first complete sentence at top of
            page by:


            "I shall look carefully and sympathetically at the
            case for making these changes against the background
            of recent changes the^criminal law".

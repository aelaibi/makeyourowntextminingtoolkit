Date:       19 September 1997

To:     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith




I attach transcripts for the first two days of Taylor’s Inquiry (on Public Record Office file HO
397/38, with its pouch). They were here after all - my apologies.

Sheffield

I have worked up a timetable for our journey to Sheffield next Wednesday (24 September).
This is attached. We will pick you up from home between 9 and 9.30. You should be back
by 11 p.m.


Liverpool

I also attach drafts of the letters we need to send to the people whom we are inviting to our
opening session in Liverpool on Monday 6 October (Draft A) and to the smaller private
sessions afterwards (draft B). I should be grateful for your comments on them quickly -
I would like if at all possible to write to all these people next week. (Mike Ward, who is
mentioned, is one of Paul Pugh’s staff).

The plan of campaign for Liverpool now looks like this

        Sunday 5 October

        1605 train from Euston arrives Watford Junction at 1621 - reaches Liverpool Lime
        Street at 1903. Travel to Judge’s Lodgings by official car - there is accommodation
        for you and Graham (the Home Office Press Officer and I will be in a hotel)

        Monday 6 October

        0830     -     car to Merseyside Maritime Museum, Albert Dock. Met by me and
                       Press officer.
A:\S-S\OIS.DOC
       0930      -       press ‘photo-opportunity’ - we issue a press statement on your behalf,
                         but there is no press conference and you do not answer questions.

       1000      -       opening session in the lecture theatre - up to perhaps 150 people
                         present, mainly family but including Hillsborough ‘experts’ from
                         Professor Scraton’s project. You (or I, or both) open the proceedings
                         briefly with an account of what your Hillsborough task is all about -
                         then people have their say. No press. Goes on till 12.00 or 12.30.
                          All recorded by stenographers.

       1300      -       lunch (with Chief Constable? - if so travel by car - only a couple of
                          minutes away).

       1430      -       we start holding interviews with family members (in the ‘Boardroom’),
                         again recorded by stenographers.      I have a list of 9 families who
                         want to make their case to you personally. I recommend we plan to
                         see one every 45 minutes - with a view to giving them half an hour
                         each or a bit longer, up to 40 minutes or so, if they merit it. This also
                         gives you a break between meetings, which I think could be helpful.

                         I am currently working out the details. One possible timetable would
                         be

                          1430 - family 1
                          1515 - family 2
                          1600 - family 3

        1645     -       car back to Lodgings.


        Tuesday 7 October

        0900         -   car to Museum.

        0930         -   more family meetings, as follows

                          0930 - family 4
                          1015 - family 5
                          1100 - family 6
                          1215 - family 7

        1300         -   lunch (I suggest we take this privately, in the Boardroom)

        1430         -   last meetings

                          1430 - family 8
                          1515 - family 9

A:\S-S\015.DOC
       1600      -    we finish. Car to Lodgings and then station - trains leave from Lime
                      Street at 1645, 1745,1945 (but not 1845) and are in London (Euston)
                      just under 3 hours later.



Presentation hv the Family Support Group

The Group will make its presentation to you on Tuesday 30 September, at your office in
Queen Anne’s Gate. I am discussing the details with them. There will be a verbatim record.
The presentation will not involve Walker or Houldsworth - 1 have asked the Group to arrange
for you to see them later (in London, as this is more convenient both for you and for them).


Other possible meetings in London

As well as the Family Support Group, Walker, and Houldsworth I am arranging for meetings
at your office here with Professor Scraton and with a Mr Ball. Mr Ball has asked (over the
telephone) to see you - 1 would have put him down for a session in Liverpool except he lives
in Aylesbury and would rather meet you here. I attach his letter to you, just sent to me by the
Support Group.

All these meetings should happen during October ( I hope in the first half of October). They
and the Liverpool and Sheffield visits should be the sum total of meetings with those affected
by the disaster, unless you decide you would like to see anybody else (or see anybody twice).


Friday 26 and Monday 29 September

I have to be out of the office on these two days due to a longstanding family commitment.
But I will give Graham some phone numbers on which I can be contacted (in Scotland).

noti c e d that       they were m a i n l y N o t t i n g h a m Forest               s upporters        and as        it

closer       towards       the kick       off     time        it came    chaotic,       still      1 would          say    in

the mai n        they were N o t t i n g h a m Forest             fans    but    there was        no trouble at

all    from them,          I was aware          that a lot         of them had been.

The   bulk       of the      fans   I would         say had       passed by us by 2 . 3 0 p m             (1430hrs >

making       there way to the ground.                         I remained wit h the           stall      along       with

                          w h i 1e t he ma t c h s ta rt e d &                  a 11 e n d a d t h e rrta t e h .

At ar o u n d 3. 1 0 p m - 3 . 1 5 p m        (1510            1315hrs)    I saw fire          engines &

ambulances          pass     by me & noti c e d that              they were        from Da m a l l       Rd fire

s tat i o n & a m b u l a n c e s   from Derbyshire,               on seeing         this    I realised

s o mething       serious       had happened.                 Within minutes         s upporters        started

coming       back    passed      us & we o v e r h e a r d        that    people      had been ki l l e d &

injured        inside.

The   fans were           ob v i o u s l y s h o c k e d & dazed,        some    of them had          corne from

L e p p i n g s L n & had a c t u a l l y       been      involved       in the      disaster.          A lot of

the N o t t i n g h a m Forest        fans      didn't appear            to a c t u a l l y know what           had

h a p p e n e d only that        there were          injuries.

At no     time      either      before     the m a t c h or after            did we       have any        problems

w ith any of the            s upporters         behaviour.

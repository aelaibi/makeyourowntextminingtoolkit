                      Responding to Daily Mirror report on Hillsborough


Responding to a report in today’s Daily Mirror, about the Hillsborough tragedy, Assistant
Chief Constable Ian Daines said:

“Reports about this particular video tape continue to add confusion to an already complex set
of circumstances. The Chief Constable has always said that any new evidence surrounding the
disaster will be examined in detail. There is no new evidence in the article published in the
Daily Mirror today.

“The tape in question - from a closed circuit television camera showing the disaster unfold on
the Leppings Lane terraces - has never been ‘missing’ and it was made available in full to both
Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry and to the coroner’s Inquest. Its existence has never been in
doubt.

“The camera which took the pictures were indeed in working order, otherwise there would
have been no tape to submit as evidence.

“What officers have previously explained is that the live transmission of the pictures into the
police control point at the time was of poor quality. This meant that they had to rely on the
view from the police control room and on information from officers on the ground. It has
always been assumed that the interference on their screen was caused by television equipment
being used to transmit live coverage of the FA cup semi-final which was not a factor when the
equipment was tested earlier in the day.

“As has been explained before, the confusion over ‘missing’ tapes seems to arise from the fact
that two other tapes recorded at the ground on the day of the disaster were stolen overnight
from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s recording suite in a locked room in the stadium.
One would have shown a disused area of the complex and the other would have shown
turnstiles. Neither tape would have been relevant to the tragedy and the motive for the theft
has never been established.

“We understand that enquiries are being conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service but
have not yet been concluded.”

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

I am writing on behalf of Lord Justice Taylor
to thank you and Chief Superintendent Genders
for so kindly giving us your time on 22
September to accompany Lord Justice Taylor on
his visit to the Belfry for the Ryder Cup. He
found the visit most helpful, and was
particularly grateful that Mr Genders gave up
his time to accompany us on the visit round the
course.

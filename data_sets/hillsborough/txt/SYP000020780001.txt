                                                             18th May 1989




  Dear Mr. Dear,



              I understand that your enquiries into the Hillsborough tragedy
 include the possibility of making recommendations about the way in which
 the disaster was handled.    I was responsible for co-ordinating the churches'
 response at the Boys Club and at the gymnasium on the afternoon, evening and
 night, and also the clergy input at the Medical Legal Centre.    If, indeed,
 you are enquiring into the way in which the disaster was handled, and you or
 an Officer would like an opportunity to discuss my reactions and learning
 from that situation, I would be only too happy to be interviewed.    I do
 have some thoughts on the need for improvements to the major incident plans,
 and the role which the churches can play in that context.

                  I look forward to hearing from you.

                                 With every good wish,

                                         Yours,




                                 p •p . Stephen R. Lowe

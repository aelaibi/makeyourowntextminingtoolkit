Bi 11 i/fgham, is like me a B r i^n CLOUGH^p<o 1 lower.

T h jf -four of     us decided we would               like to at t e n d the FA Cup Semi              Final

an d    I. was able to obtain four tickets                      for the m a t c h from a business

a c q u a i n t a n c e who    is a dirait£rr,of/Darlington Football                    Club.      The

ticka<€s were         for the S c ^ u t/f 2 l t m d ,    Gangway       1, Row G , Seats         16 - 19 and

w^rre in dividually               <V / Z

                                                                   /

At about       10.30am         1030 on the          15th A p j f x i 1969    150489 the four of us             set

off    from home        for Sheffield.               Mv/sori is 13 years         of age and we thought

we were       going     to have a great day and as two of us were Forest                              fans

and two Liverpool               fans    it would mean that             two would      come back a little

d i s ap po i n te d and two w ould be happy.                   I couldn't       have been further

from the       truth.         We set off with ample              time    to reach the          ground and

a r r iv ed   in S he ff i e l d at about         12.30pm       1230 w h i c h was      some    two and a

half    hours      before       the kick     off.       This   journey w hich took us along                   the

A1 and the MIS was               uneventful      and there were              no other supporters

evident.         I was        driving    the vehicle        containing my           party and none        of us

were    familiar with the               location of H i l l s b o r o u g h Football           Ground,

we arri v e d      in S he ff i e l d    on the Halifax Rd and we t r avelled along                       this

road    to the       island at Leppings Ln to                  locate    the ground and then find a

suitable       parking         space.     This    initial      journey along Halifax Rd was

purely for         that       purpose and     I was      not aware       of any supporters           in this

road and       1 paid no particular                 att e n t i o n to what was happening.               We

returned along Hal ifa:< Rd and found a tem p o r a r y                       car    park on an

industrial         site       near to a Comet warehouse.

We     remained with the vehicle                 for about       fifteen minutes and then

commenced        our journey on foot              to the ground.              The time w ould now be

about     1245 and        1 would say we were about a mile from the ground.

As we     r e -entered Halifax Rd,               I saw supporters             sitting    on the grassed

area at       the side of the            road and they were             eating sandwiches and some

were     drinking         cans of beer.

The    supporters           i saw were wail                behaved and          there were           no signs     of

drunkeness,           exactly what              I would have expected on an occasion                             like

this.        After walking about                   halfway along Halifax Rd we were a p p r o a c h e d
                                                                                                C               offfcACES

spare t/fckets.              We told them no and then they turned Vneir a t t e n t i o n

to    fysople following              us.        I cannot        recall      seeing a n y b o d y who sold any

tickets.          I was a m a z e d to see so many                     people attending an all                   ticket

m a t c h without a ticket as                     I would not dream of going without                            one.     Our

j o u r n e y along Halifax Rd was without                           incident and at no stage did                       1

see any       incidents          of drunkeness              or unruly behaviour a l t h o u g h                 I did see

suppo r t e r s     carrying         cans of beer.

We turned         into L e p pings Ln and a p p r o a c h e d the ground.                            There were         very

tew supporters              in the         road at this time and we were able                           to walk along

the    road freely and without                      obstruction.              I do not        recollect         seeing

any Police          presence in this               road until we a p p r o a c h e d the turnstiles                      in

Leppings Ln.              I a p p ro a c h e d a Police Officer                  in the turnstile area and

e n q uired as        to where           our    stand was and he directed us to the South

Stand.        I saw that           there were o r ganised queues at                         this      location

wait i n g    to enter         the ground and                I was     not aware         of any       large     gates       in

this area.

The    four of us then made                     our way to the seats                   i h^ U i/ ^ S q u th S tand and

found them without                 difficulty.              My first        impressions were             that     I

was    in a m a g n i ficent             stadium.          We w e r e / 4 e a t e d    in the Leppings Ln end

sections         were    very sparse of spectators.

At about 2.50pm            1450     I observe^Ahat           pens 3 and 4 had filled up to the

extent      that there was a lot of swaying w h i c h                        I feel   was    caused by

supporters         still    entering      those     pens.

Just      prior    to 3 . 0 0 p m   1300 the two teams            came onto the field of               play

and      I did not       pay any     particular a t t e n t i o n to the          crowd build up.

The      game started w ith the spectators,                    myself        included,      being oblivious

to what was         happening        behind the Liverpool              goal.      I had not w i t nessed

an y     crowd    crush or surges          in the    pens      1-7 prior        to the kick      off.

S h o r t l y after the kick off             I noticed one or two               Police Officers

running along the touch                line to the goal at the                  Leppings Ln end.          It

was      obvious    that    they thought        that tb^re was tj^oubj^? as spectators

from doing         this and then I noticed a suddren surge                        forward and to the

side     of this     crowd.      At this    stage      I saw that there was an               increase       in

the    number    of spectators        climbing        over   this    fence and some were            being

lifted out of the             crowd into the seated area of the West Stand.                           Some

supporters were also             trying    to climb over         the dividing        fences which

separate      the    pens.

B y this    time     in between watching          the m atch and observing              the Leppings

Ln end,     the s i tuation became out of hand and e v entually the Police

started to help the             spectators    over      the m esh fence which was                quite

high and difficult             to climb.     At this     early stage        I was      not aware of

any gates       either at the front          of the fencing          or at the      rear      of the

pens,    although       if they had have been open               I think     I would have          noticed

t hem.

The    spec tators were         helping    each other        over the fence and even t u a l l y

there must       have       been about 300 spectators            on the     cinder    t^ack       behind

the goal and there were so many that they spilled o y /e r                           onto the       pitch.

At this     point of time a senior Police Offi c e r i r y k flat cap raced onto

the    playing      surface and tried        to attract       the ^/ft tent ions       of the      referee.

The    players      continued     playing    football        a n d / t h e y were at the N o t t i n g h a m

come     i n t o/i. h e ground from the Spion Kop area.

My vie^s were that they had no                idea what was           happening and thought

clearly there was going             to be a riot         so they foy*lfed themselves               into a

w hich was opened and streams               of supporters           came out onto the            pitch.      I

saw that      these s u pporters were         carrying        other    supporters who were

injured and they were             laying    them down on the           pitch.       Some     of the

injured       immediately got up but others                 remained moti o n l e s s    on the

ground.

At this       p o i / t t in time    it must be noted^that           it was    only t h e Livejyftool

suppor^rs         who were a c t u a l l y     earring      the spectators and

helj/ing them to get free                  f r on^/xhe pressures     of the ter t^»fc i ng .       As

stated the spectators were                   laid>fn the        pitch and othrer spectators

tried    to resuscitate             them       both heart mass a g e and mouth to mouth.

I recall       seeing     two y a a / g     girls    near to the     corner fence,       m a r k e d A2 on

the    plan and they were             both worked on for a long              long time by people

who    I think were         supporters.            They event u a l l y gave up and      coats were

placed over         their    heads.         This    incident    had been pointed out to me                  by

rny uncle and        I did not        pay any further a t t e n t i o n to the girls and as

such    I am unable         to describe        either     of them.

I then saw a young            boy aged about           10 years who was        brought    onto      the

pitch and         put down near        to the touch        line    (marked A3 on the        plan).

Again,     a l t h o u g h my eyes >stfere focussed on him all               the time,    1 am unable

to describe        him apaj?% from the fact that                  he was    the first    person to be

Spect a t o r s    in the stand where              I was and     in the terrace    below watc h e d

O f f icers    and after      speaking        to them briefly they m oved out of the way.

He was     o b viously a first aider,                a doctor or someone with medical

knowledge.         This man         tried franti c a l l y for another         five minutes         or so

and e v en tually all         the     people who had        crowded       round this    lad let out a

great    cheer.         He had star t e d to breathe.              All    the spectators       m    the

                                                                                                 S2534

stopped breathing after                some    time,      he got him breathing          for a second

time and he was             placed    in the    recovery      position.         I then saw tour

spectators          looking ar o u n d for a stretcher and they went to the wall

near    the gate          in pen    i and they tried to pull a wooden hoarding                    off

the wall.           Four Pol i c e Of ficers went across             to them and at first             it

looked as          though they were          trying    to hinder     but after       having a

words w^x h them,            they helped the spectators              to    pull   the hoard^fig off

the /C a .1 1 .     The spectators          then took this        over    to the boy ^ m d he was

  4ced       onto    it an d t ra ns p o r t e d to the far s        o    f     the ground.

'firmly believe            this boy was alive when Vfey took him away,

Whilst       this was       happening an ambulance a r r i v e d behind the goal                 and a

number       of bodies were          put    inside./It      was    not    clear    to me at    this

stags what          the    casualty s i t uation was        but    it was obvious       there must

have    been a number             of fatalities.       This a m b u l a n c e   started to rock

about and          it was    then that       I noticed about        four spectators,          later

jo i n e d by two Police Officers,               and they were kicking              the wire mesh

fencing       from    its supports with their              feet.     Their      bodies and hands

being against             the side of the ambulance.               The fence event u a l l y     became

free and          I saw    large    numbers    of spectators        escape      from the    pen towards

the    pitch.

1' then saw spectators               from the West S tand starting                to dismantle all

the    notice       boards    below them and they were              carefully handed down to

other    spectators and tr a n s f e r r e d onto the              pitch.       These   boards were

then used to transport                the    injured across        the ground and to a mbulances

At    this    time    the Police Officers were still                 present       in a line across

the field,          still    believing      there was a p o s s i bility of a riot and                I

then saw a number

                              of N o t t i ng ha m Forest jrup porters          climb over     the fence

at the S pion Hop and they started d ismantling                           hoardings     behind their

goal    and they carried them down to/my end of the ground.                                They then

joined       in with the Liverpool             supporters      in carrying the          injured across

the    pitch.

T here were      only a few Police Off i ce rjy/*ge tt i ng          involved wit h helping               to

carry the stretchers            across    the j n t c h and helping        in the      revival       of

a b s o l u t e l y negative and y o     one    seemed to be    in charge at all.                It was

the Liverpool         fans whsr took      the    initiative    in dealing with the

e m e r g e n c y situation,    prevailing at the time.             E v e n t u a l l y a full     half

of the    playing area was         covered with distraught L i v e r p o o l i ^ n s .

 ram my       location    in the stand         I could hear the       publi c ^ d d resa      system

quite    cl ear ly and     I heard the L i v e rpool Manager, jftfrmy Dfl^(jfi^SH,

appeal    for    calm over      this   system.      There was      n c f need,   the    crowd were

calm and asked those who w e r e n ’t injured to move                     of-p-the playing area

to the    si des .                                             ^    S '

I saw one       incident where a ne w s reporter t^afs taking                 photographs          of

dead bodies and distraught and anarv fams grabbed                          ho id— al— h iiri an-d—

there    was a scuffle and a lot of shouting                  taking      place.       The Police

came from nearby and after               breaking    them up they         led the      camera man

away.     They should have taken his               camera off him.                               .

I w i tn es se d one other       incident       near to the    p 1ayp/s     t u n n e l an« this was

where a number         of supporters       congregated aro/rid the^BBCygramera.                      Ihey

were    not   causing any       problems.        They were    voicing      tha€r opinions            at

the    lack of    control      and a sking why did it happen?               Whose      fault w&s

it?     Why was      it not avert e d ?        After a very    long time when most               of the

bodies    had been taken to waiting a m bulances                   located near        the S p i o n K o p :

it became       evident    of the horror         of the   incident.

Steel    barriers      capable of w it h s t a n d i n g 50 tons      pressure      I could see

had been flattened and            it was only then that            the    injuries      be^atfie

apparent.        As the fans      left the ground the Police               n e a r t h e      centre

line began to disperse            slowly.        I saw that    beyond y rfe      goal were

large qu antities         of   personal    belongings;        shoe|if boots,        coats,       scarves

                                                                                                            S2534

were    gathered        in one big heep.

We    left    the ground at about 4 .30pm                  1630,      passing       spectators who              stood

in silence.            The Police        outside      the ground a t t e m p t e d to make              their

presence           felt by stopping         cars,     asking       them where        they were         going and

stopping           groups and single          spectators and asking                 trie same.

There was no trouble                outside      because       people were          too upset about what

had happened.                It was     not until      I got       back to the        car and s w i tched on

the    radio that            I heard of the horrific, number of fatalities at                              that

time    being 74.I had believed                 initially that                one    or two had been

k i l l e d but      never    imagined it to be that many.                    As     the    reasons/for           this

disaster           unfold,    the   r e s p o n s i b i 1 ity of   crowd o b s e r v a t i o n / m o n i t o r i n g

and    control        lies fairly a n d squarely with the Po 1 i                              As   they were

s i t uated        in the    control     tower using the             close     cijjrcuit monitors           and

using     the       radios    to give     instructions,             it was^ob v i o u s     that the opening

of a gate and           letting      fans     in would       r e s u \J /r i n them getting          into the

ground and seeing              the game as quickly J& s               possible.          With      pens 3 and 4

being     overfull          it should have been Jan easy                  instruction to deploy some

Po l i c e O fficers         to direct      late arriving            supporters        to the outer             pens

w hich were almost             empty.           /

The    horrific        irony    is that^^e          had a situation that               the Police         had no

idea of how to control. J They are                        c 1e a r 1y trained         in c o n t r o 1 1 i ng    r io t s

and violence yet              the>yC»ere unable           to control         human tragedy.             By being

first aid trained              tjfey should have been able                   to make       some    c o n t r ibution

to the s i tuation / very few did.

Because       the gate was          opened,      many who          did not have tickets              gained

entry and           contributed to the              problem unintentionally.                  I believe          that

by making           the game all       ticket        it is far easier           to gain entry            into     the

ground than           it is by paying           cash.

We    now look at the           consequences          of having m em be rs hi p            cards.        In a

si t u a t i o n    like the    15th April           1989 150489 entry to the ground w ould

have     been much slower,             causing a terrible' build up outside.                     It    is

easy     to say that          by being a member and having a m e m b e r s h i p              card you

must     get to the ground a little               bit earlier.         We did because we

tr a v e l l e d a long way but            not everybody thinks        that way and           people        get

delayed        in traffic.        If this game had been by m e m b e r s h i p            card the same

si t u a t i o n    could have    happened,      spectators     outside without             cards

waiting        to get       in and the      pressure would have built             up in the        same

manner.            The gates    would have to be opened to relieve                     pressure and             to

prevent a dangerous              sit u a t i o n and the fans who have had their                   cards

taken away           could then gain entry and cause              problems.

The Gove r n m e n t must        realise the tragedy at H i l l s b o r o u g h          is due to

i nterference          by Government,        Local Aut ho r ity and Police              in trying          to

restrict members              of the    public as spectators         from moving          freely and

safely a r o u n d our grounds.               If the divisional and             perimeter       fences

were     not       present    today,    this tragedy w ould never have ari s e n as                    the

s pectators would have m e r e l y moved from side to side to avert                                the

pressure.            The    penning    in of spectators      is a serious breach of the

H e a l t h and Safety at Work Act as far as                 safe access and             egress       is

concerned,           in an eme r g e n c y e vacuation situation.

Football           Clubs must    be    left to manage      their own business without

i nterference          from outside        bodies unless     they r equest            s pecialist      a dv i c e

an d assistance.

It will        be    interesting       to see how the Offi c e r       in Charge         of S u r v e i l a n c e

a nd Deployment             of his Force will a lley the          blame        for this     tragedy.            9b

passionate           fans    do not know the      cause.     Tho u s a n d s    do.

I would be willing              to at t e n d the Lord Justice T A Y L O R 's Judicial

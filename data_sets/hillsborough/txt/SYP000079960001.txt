            I have been a supporter of L i/erpool Football Club for several years

            and have attended several \g#nes.                 I am not a/season ticket holder,                   but

            am a member of the Berwick Liverpool Supporters Club.                                 I obtained a

            ticket for the semi-final              which was to ¥ e        played on Saturday 15th

Sheffield and Hillsborough Football Ground.             We left           house about

10.30am    (1030)-10.45am    (1045) and stopped once at a garage on route

where I had some food, we were there for about              10 minutes.    1 do not

know the name of the garage or its location.

We were not involved     in any traffic hold-ups and arrived in Sheffield

at about 2.30pm    (1430). The mini-bus was           parked in a side street and

it took about    15 minutes    to walk to the ground. During the time I was

walking to the ground I did not see any trouble or any people drinking

outside    public houses.   The streets were very busy with fans going

towards the ground,    these were mainly Liverpool           fans.

On r eachi ng the turn/fti les which 1ead to the West Stand I saw a large

crowd all around tJne turnstiles,         all     pushing trying to get    in. There

was no queues jc^t a large crowd, I saw two Police on horses and

some on f o o t , t he Police were trying to sort the crowd out but because

of the numbers they couldn't do nothing with the crowd.

We had all walked towards        the ground together but on reaching the

ground we all got split up and at this time              I was on my own.    I joined

the mass of people and made my way towards the turnstiles.                 I was

pushed towards the turnstiles,         even if you did not want to you had to

go because of the amount of people all              pushing towards the

turnstiles.

I got to the tur nst ile ^ after being          pushed and shoved around a lot and

went through the ti         tile and handed my ticket        in. After    I had gone

through the turnti          lere w a s n ’t an;              ng, there was more

room inside. When I was       in the queue or c r o w d , I saw a lot of people

being    pulled up and climbing over the tur/isti 1 e into the ground.

Once    inside the turnstiles     I made myN«afy to the stand,       I found my way

by seeing the letter on my ticket displayed on the wall,                 I went up the

steps to the stand,    I did not see any stewards and no-one checked

my ticket before    I got to the stand.           I did not see any of the people       I

had travelled to the game with.

On reaching the stand I saw a mass of peopla/'in the stand and it was

very difficult to get to my seat. When I/got to my seat there was

someone sitting     in it,   I did not move Juris person as I saw that people

were being    pulled up into the s t a n d ^ r a m   the terrace under ne at h. There

was just a mass of people irw theyftand,             standing on seats and in the

aisles,    it was very overcrowdetf. By the time I had got to my seat the

game had been stopped but the                        e still on the field. By this

time   I had been joined b y         ___________ and we were standing

about the fourth row from the Vr-8-ntc
                              -Tre-nt of the stand on the right as you

look at the pitch. From this point I could look down into the terrace

behind the goal and I could see         people were being      crushed in the

terrace.    I saw people being     passed over the head of the people          in the

terrace and into the pitch,        some of these       people appeared to be

injured.At about twenty past three          I decided to leave the ground with

           we sent down the steps at the rear of the sjtand, the same way

as   I had entered.   As I crossed the area at the /ea r of the stand

before    I got to the turnsti les I saw a Folijreman helping an injured

lad he was aged about 20 to 24y r s . The ljra appeared to have an injury

to his stomach,     he was   in a lot of p*utm and his legs kept giving a way,

I took one of his arms and the Policeman held the other a n d we took

him to an ambulance,      ^-do not kurow if I would recognise the injured

youth again,    the only w^iingJ r can remember about his dress          is that he

was wearing jeans,

After this            and myself went back to the mini bus, and waited for

the others 1,0 come back. We waited for over an hour before the others

returned and then went home.

Once   I had seen people     injured on the terrace        I did not stay to watch

as   it was not a pretty sight to I left the ground pretty quickly.

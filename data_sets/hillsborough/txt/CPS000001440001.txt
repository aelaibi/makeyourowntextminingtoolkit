       Dear Sirs

        RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

       I note the proposal to seek a judicial review of the decision of the Crown Prosecution
       Service not to intervene in this case.

       The Hillsborough Family Support Group are now pressing for disclosure of material
       held by the CPS. They requested this several months ago, but we indicated we would
       not disclose until after we had decided whether to intervene in the prosecution. We
       have now considered this question further.

       From correspondence with the solicitors for South Yorkshire Police it is apparent that
       the current view of the Assistant Chief Constable is that the police will not consider
       voluntary disclosure until such time as the judicial review proceedings are concluded.
       I have written to the solicitors today indicating that I propose to give voluntary
       disclosure at this stage. I await their response.

        I attach a copy of a letter I have sent to the HFSG and you will see from it that the
        CPS view is that we should make voluntary disclosure. We do not consider that the
        existence of judicial review proceedings provides proper grounds for withholding
        disclosure. Appreciating the need to be fair to all parties, we will deal with disclosure
        in an even handed way. Therefore if we copy material to HFSG, we will copy it to
        you. If we give facilities for inspection, we will make the same material available to
        you.

        Yours faithfully

       Dear Madam

       RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

       I understand that you spoke to Mr Booth on 30 December 1998 on the question of
       voluntary disclosure in this case. I thought it would be helpful if I wrote setting out
       the position of the CPS.

       Given the enormous public interest in the case and the overriding need to ensure that
       there is a fair trial, the CPS is anxious to be as open and fair as possible. This means
       being fair to you the prosecutor as well as the defendants. I am sending a copy of this
       letter to the solicitors for the defendants.

       In our view, the course most likely to achieve fairness would be voluntary disclosure
       of some of the material we hold. However, as you are aware, the South Yorkshire
       Police do not necessarily agree that voluntary disclosure is appropriate at this stage
       and they have, through their solicitors, suggested a delay until such time as the
       judicial review proceedings are concluded. Accordingly I have written to them
       indicating the CPS view but also asking whether there are any further reasons they
       can put forward which might influence our view. I have asked for a reply on or before
       6 January 1999 so that I can write to you before the hearing on 7 January 1999 with
       the CPS decision in principle.

       I refer to ‘some’ of the material. I know that there have been discussions about the
       material held by the CPS. It is not our intention to disclose material which attracts
       either legal professional privilege or public interest immunity. For example, we will
       not voluntarily disclose copies of counsel’s advice, our own internal memoranda and
       opinions nor correspondence with the police. In effect, the material we are proposing
       that we will disclose will comprise copies of witness statements and accompanying
       exhibits. Of course, disclosure will be even handed and we intend that any material or
       facility we make available to you will also be made available to the solicitors for the
       defendants.




                         Crown Prosecution Service   •   Working in the interests of justice
You will be aware that the material we hold does not comprise original witness
statements as, to the best of my knowledge, they are held by the police.

It appears from correspondence that you have already acquired a large amount of
material as you have pointed out differences between versions of the same witness
statement. To avoid unnecessary duplication, it would be very helpful if you could
provide a list of the material you already hold so that we can see what further material
you require. Alternatively, you might like to indicate on a copy of the schedule we
provided what further material it is that you require.

I will endeavour to make a decision before the next court hearing but will write again
in any event.

Yours faithfully

       the current view of the Assistant Chief Constable is that the police will not consider
       voluntary disclosure until such time as the judicial review proceedings are concluded.
       I have written to the solicitors today indicating that I propose to give voluntary
       disclosure at this stage. I await their response.

       I attach a copy of a letter I have sent to the HFSG and you will see from it that the
       CPS view is that we should make voluntary disclosure. We do not consider that the
       existence of judicial review proceedings provides proper grounds for withholding
       disclosure. Appreciating the need to be fair to all parties, we will deal with disclosure
       in an even handed way. Therefore if we copy material to HFSG, we will copy it to
       you. If we give facilities for inspection, we will make the same material available to
       you.

       Yours faithfully

        Dear Madam

        RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

       I understand that you spoke to Mr Booth on 30 December 1998 on the question of
       voluntary disclosure in this case. I thought it would be helpful if I wrote setting out
       the position of the CPS.

       Given the enormous public interest in the case and the overriding need to ensure that
       there is a fair trial, the CPS is anxious to be as open and fair as possible. This means
       being fair to you the prosecutor as well as the defendants. I am sending a copy of this
       letter to the solicitors for the defendants.

       In our view, the course most likely to achieve fairness would be voluntary disclosure
       of some of the material we hold. However, as you are aware, the South Yorkshire
       Police do not necessarily agree that voluntary disclosure is appropriate at this stage
       and they have, through their solicitors, suggested a delay until such time as the
       judicial review proceedings are concluded. Accordingly I have written to them
       indicating the CPS view but also asking whether there are any further reasons they
       can put forward which might influence our view. I have asked for a reply on or before
       6 January 1999 so that I can write to you before the hearing on 7 January 1999 with
       the CPS decision in principle.

       I refer to ‘some’ of the material. I know that there have been discussions about the
       material held by the CPS. It is not our intention to disclose material which attracts
       either legal professional privilege or public interest immunity. For example, we will
       not voluntarily disclose copies of counsel’s advice, our own internal memoranda and
       opinions nor correspondence with the police. In effect, the material we are proposing
       that we will disclose will comprise copies of witness statements and accompanying
       exhibits. Of course, disclosure will be even handed and we intend that any material or
       facility we make available to you will also be made available to the solicitors for the
       defendants.




                         Crown Prosecution Service   •   Working in the interests of justice
You will be aware that the material we hold does'not comprise original witness
statements as, to the best of my knowledge, they are held by the police.

It appears from correspondence that you have already acquired a large amount of
material as you have pointed out differences between versions of the same witness
statement. To avoid unnecessary duplication, it would be very helpful if you could
provide a list of the material you already hold so that we can see what further material
you require. Alternatively, you might like to indicate on a copy of the schedule we
provided what further material it is that you require.

I will endeavour to make a decision before the next court hearing but will write again
in any event.

Yours faithfully

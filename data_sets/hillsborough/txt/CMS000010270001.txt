               SPEAKING NOTES (FINAL VERSION)

               PLANNING ASPECTS OF TAYLOR IMPLEMENTATION



               Introduction


               Good, afternoon,.   [Ladies and] Gentlemen,              I work in the .Planning

               Policy Directorate of the Department of the Environment in L o n d o n .

              My- responsibilities include planning policy on sport and

               recreation.    Since taking up my post in A p r i l , one of my main tasks

               has been to work on a forthcoming guidance 1note on this subject*

              One of the key issues it will address is ail-seater Football

               League stadia.


               I work closely with colleagues in the D e p a rtment’s Sports and

               Recreation Division, who are r e presented'here today. At

              Ministerial level, both olannin g poli ’y and sports poixcy are part

               of the same portfolio.     This further guarantees that the

               interactions are closely considered, -


              Colin Moynihan,      as Minister for Sport and Planning,                     took a very

              close interest in Taylor implementation. We had a most

               constructive •
                            'meeting with I      StOtt ? AI thur Sandford and Andy

              Williamson in June.     Robert Atkins,      his successor., will be taking

              an equally close i n t erest. He has asked me to congratulate you on

              holding this seminar,     and to convey his good wishes.

                 Government policy


                 As you know, the Government accepts Lord Justice Taylor's

                 recommendation in his final report on the Hillsborough disaster

                 that all-seated accommodation should be introduced at all League

                 grounds for reasons of safety,        public order and spectator comfort.

                 The Government's objective is to achieve all-seated accommodation

                 at all First and Second Division .grounds from the start of the

                 1994/95 season, and at all Third and Fourth Division grounds from

                 the start of the 1999/2000 season.


                 The Government recognises the planning implications of achieving

                 ■all-seated accommodation.      Many clubs will need to redevelop their

                 grounds to varying degrees.       It-may for example be necessary to

                 enlarge the stadium and/or the sits. Some clubs,            probably a

                 smaller number/       will need to transfer to new lot;at Ions.    For

                 instance the present site may not offer scope for proper

                 redevelopment, For historical reasons,        some grounds are unsuitably

                 sited,       in residential areas,, with poor public transport and

                 inadequate parking.

           I     indicated earlier that the Department is preparing a new

           Planning Policy Guidance Note on Sport and Recreation- The Note

           will specifically address the implications of "Taylor",                                although

           it will also cover a much wider field than football stadia.

           It will be, addressed,              like all such Policy Guidance Not&s,

           p r i m a r i l y .to local planning author it las. It will ask them t;> giv-

            sympathetic consideration to development proposals designed to

            achieve the aim
            of all-seated accommodation.                 It will explicitly urge them to give

            due weight to the improvement of safety,                      public o r d e r , and

               spectator comfort,          and to the implementation timetable.                   This m      xn

               addition to-' the normal planning considerations,                        such as traffic,

               par king, access to public transport,                 and possible c o n f l i c t     rfith

                to consider too.


                Clubs


                It is vital for clubs and local planning authorities to work

           . together. It is well worth approaching the local planning

          ' authority at the earliest possible opportunity when considering

                redevelopment or relocation,              and' certainly before settling on a

                definite scheme or site- That will give you an idea how the

                options look from a planning point of view, The local planning

                authority may be able to assist in identifying possible - *tc s, and

                in firnd;:•/>. up specific proposals.           If you decide on a proposed new

                 location without consulting the local planning authority you will

                be asking for trouble.            I n ’addition,     talking to them may enable you

                 to influence the local development plan, which will provide the

                 framework for controlling development in the area.

                     There are other bodies which need to be brought in at an early

                     stage:

                     - the police and emergency              services, on crowd control and          safety;

                     - public transport operators,            such as British Rail;

                     - the highway authority?

                     - any o^her local author.iti.es whose areas may be afcfected;

                     - generally,           the local authority recreation department,            who

                       will h a a n            interest in   community leisure facilities;

                     - the i egional c o u n c i ^ t ’or     sport and recreation, when multi- use

                       facilities are under consideration;

                       and of course the Advisory Design-Council on design matters.


                     There will ba^aa extra £imensicm wjher

                     stadia                                             oompc t ^ pnT,       are "envisaged. "

                     These may well have regional implications.                      It will be worth

                     talking to the county council,-any regional planning organisation,

                     and the DOE regional office.


                     All this can -seem a daunting task.           In some cases it; may be worth

                     thinking about appointing knowledgeable professional planning

                     consultants. As proposals take shape it can be well worth

                     considering setting up a project team to bring together the main

                     bodies concerned and help drive the project forward.

                   You will also want to take account of likely public reactions.                     Any

                   application is bound to be controversial, and will require a lot

                   of work with the local community, from the beginning,                  I don't mind

                   in the least mind queueing for quarter of an hour or more to get

                   into the tubs station after taking my young son to see his

                   favourite team at Highbury,    But if 1 1heard a major club proposed

                   to. relocate to my neighbourhood I might for example wonder if I. -

                   would be 'involuntarily marooned on- Saturday afternoons. The views

                   of residents    - whether they are behind you or against you - are

                   bound to influence the local council. And you will of course waist,

                   to make sure that the views of committed club supporters who are

                   residents are heard.


                   District Councils


                   The key local planning authority to approach at the outset is the

                   district council,    or where relevant the city or borough council,

                   It is to the district council that a future -planning application

                   will be submitted.    I t •is the district council which prepares the

                   local plan. This sets out detailed policies and specific proposals

                   for the use of land,, and should, guide most day-to-day planning

                   decisions.


                   The new Planning Policy Guidance Note will nake clear that the

                   district council is expected to take the possible relocation of a

                   club to a new site into account in preparing and reviewing its

                   local plan,    It should look both at whether a new site is feasible,

                   and at what uses should be permitted on the existing site. When a

                   club is not relocating,    the local plan may still                need to take,

                Now is a good, time to influence local plans, as many are being

                prepared or reviewed. Over.the next couple of years,                      the amount of

                the country covered by local plans is expected to increase from

                one quarter to three quarters.


                If a planning application will be going forward before a new,

                post-Taylor local plan is in place, this need not be a

                disadvantage.        The planning authority should still consider the

                application in the .light of the safety, public order,                     spectator

                comfort, and timing considerations I mentioned earlier. The new

                -guidance note..will ask them to do so.


                In looking at applications authorities will also always have

                regard to the extent to which -multiple-use and non-football

                leisure ‘facilities would be incorporated in a development, to the

                benefit of the local community as a          whole. It can be seen as             a

                waste of a scarce resource for land          to lie unused for long

                periods,   especially in the inner city. There may be scope for a

                partnership' which can improve the a r e a ’s leisure facilities.


                County councils


                Outside the metropolitan areas,         county councils are planning

                authorities, as well as o s t r i c t     .M.ncils. .It is often well worth

                Approaching the county at an early stage.                  X should also mention

                that counties prepare structure plans', -which provide the strategic

                framework ,for planning and development control at local level.

                Sometimes the relocation of a large ■ stadiun; may s** of sufficient

                   Unitary Development Plans


                   There are no county councils in metropolitan areas, There

                   districts prepare what are k n o w n 1as unitary development plans               (or

                   UDP); part 1 equates to the structure plan and part II to the

                   local plan. Again, now is a very good time to discuss major

                   redevelopment proposals with planning authorities in the

                   metropolitan at e a s , because they are all currently preparing' their

                   first UDPs,
         i
                   Green Belts


                   a   word about Green Belts. There is a general presumption against

                   inappropriate, development in the Green Belts.                Because of the size

                   of the .structures involved,   football stadia cannot be regarded as

                   appropriate development within an approved Green Belt. Very

                   special circumstances would be needed to justify setting- aside the

                   general presumption against inappropriate development-.


                   Detailed Green Belt boundaries are set out in local plans. The

                   Department's guidance .to local planning authorites states that

                   they should be altered only in exceptional circumstances,                after

                   consideration of.development opportunities within urban -areas. The

                   procedures for making and reviewing local plans provide

                   opportunities for full public consultation on any proposals to

                   alter boundaries/   before decisions are taken.

                   To put it another way,    it would be extremely difficult to obtain

                  planning permission for a football stadium in the Green Belt,                    it

                   reminds me of a notice at the back of the Army and Navy stores

                  near my office - " D o n ’t even think of parking here".             D o n ’t even,

                  think of developing in the Green Belt unless you - and the local

                  planning authority - are convinced there is no alternative.

                  Amending      the local plan to take a site out of the Green Belt so

                  that it could be made available for development would require very

                  strong justification in terms of a clear absence of any reasonable

                  alternative.    It would be rare indeed to get an application fox a

                  major inappropriate development on a Green Belt site1 approved on

                  the basis of “exceptional circumstances".

                 The regional offices cannot intervene in any disputes which may

                 arise with local planning authorities after an a pplic ation,has

                 been made. The Department can however become formally involved in

                 a planning application in two ways.      If an application is refused,

                 or not determined' within a set period, there is a right of appeal

                 to the Secretary of state, ‘fhis should be regarded as a last

                 resort, not least because it can be a lengthy business. The

                 Department can also become involved when an application is called

                 in, •which means that it will be decided by the Secretary of State

                 rather than the local planning authority.


                 Local authority associations


                 You may like to know that the local authority associations are

                 setting up. three working parties on Taylor implementation, They

                 will look at the planning,   community development and safety

                 aspects. The Football League will be represented, giving an

                 opportunity to feed in your thoughts ana experience. The idea is

                 to spread best' practice., and to define any areas where further

                 work needs to be d o n e . The working parties' are due to produce

                 reports later this y e a r , for practical use by clubs and local

                 planning authorities.   This shows a commendable willingness to

                  cooperate.

                  s o m e thing           like        ' I t ’s all           your     fucking          fau lt ,                  murdering                 bastard."               I

                  then        saw the          man who            h a d a s k e d me        for       help,                 hit        the          abusive         supporter.

                  This        man then           seemed           to     realise        that         his          friend               was          dead and           I told

                  help        others          but      felt        helpless           and       told       friends                    to       stay with            injured

                  friends            or      relative             and       get a P o l i c e         Officer                    or St.             John's

                  started            breaking               up    the       advertising              boards                 to    use          as     stretchers.                  A

                  young         lad t h e n           walked           up    to me     and asked                       me    for       s o me         water,        the       only

                  t he     substitutes                 sit a n d            walked     him       up t he r e .                    When          I reached              the

                  player's              tunnel         I saw           th at    there       were       problems                       with          supporters            wanting

                  to     go     up      to    the      tunnel           a n d PC      Dennis          Webster                    asked          me     to     give      him a

                  hand        to     control           the        supporters           which          I did.                     I n o t i c e d as              s o o n as        I

                  assisted              him     to     push        back        the    supporters                       t ha t     there             wa s     a very       strong

                  smell         of      alcohol             and    the       majority           of    fans              were          the w o r s e           for      drink           and

                  slurring              their         words.            I then        saw       one    supporters                          who        was     particularly

                  the      worse          for    drink            approach           Desmond          Lynarn,                the       Tv       presenter,              and        he

                  started            to      g iv e    his        version          of w h a t        had        happened.                       He     wa s      complaining

                  that        he     had      been          in a       c r u s h at    the       Leppings                    Lane          e nd w h e n a P o l i c e

abusive          to    both myself                a n d PC W e b s t e r          and would             h av e    been       arrested           in

any     other         circumstances.                    At       this      stage       I d i d n ’t r e a l l y         know        the

severity          of w h a t          had       happened          but      was    extremely             a n g r y at        being

verbally          abused and                threatened             by L i v e r p o o l       supporters               who    had

obviously             been       drinking          heavily.                The    supporters             who a p p e a r e d         sober

were     helping            to    restrain             their       fellow         supporters.




A short          time       later          I was       approached            by a m a n           from     the B B C         w ho    asked          if

I knew what             the       casualty             number        was     for       people       to     telephone            wa s      the

BBC     swi t c h b o a r d       was       being       jammed.             I told        him      I would         find       out      for      hi m

and     went      to an          office          and    tried        to     get    through          to H a m m e r t o n        Road

Police        Station            to    get       the    telephone            number          but    when         I got       through           t he y

were     unable         to a s s i s t .           Th e      BBC     man     then       said       they were            going        on air

in e i g h t      minutes             and       desparately             needed         the    nu m b e r .        I then        contacted

PC     Ryan      in the          Police          Control          Box      who    asked       me    to     hold        on as        the

number        w as     just       coming          through.              1 then         gave       the    number         to    the BBC. m a n

and     return         to    the       player's             tunnel.          I stayed             there      for       a short         while

until        it was         announced             that       the     ga me       was    cancelled.




I then        returned            to       the    D i r e c t o r ’s e n t r a n c e         in    case      there          were any

problems          the re .            AT    this       time       I estimated             that      there         were       about        40

people        dead.          When          I got       to    the     main        reception          at     the     D i r e c t o r ’s

entrance          obviously                all    the       staff       were      extremely             upset      so       I stayed           at

the     d o or    and       refused admittance                       to     the    people          who     were        trying        to    get

in.      At      this       stage          I tried          to   take       in w h a t       had    happened            but    found           it

was     very      difficult                to    believe          t h at    such a tragedy                 had     occurred.               I

then     found         out       that       93    people         had       died    and       difficult            as    it was

continued             with my          job and          tried        to     comfort          members         of    staff       at      the

             D i r e c t o r ’s e n t r a n c e       to       return        to    the    gymnasium         vi a      the   perimeter

             when      I was     overcome             by       emotion and             began       to    cry.      Mr   Douglas         Lock       in

             my    composure          and    returned              to       the   Police        room.       I w as      given      a drink          by

             someone       and     then Chief                  Supt     Mole       asked      if    I was       Ok.     I replied            that       I

             was.       I sat      there         for       a    few minutes              when      I was    approached            by C h i e f

            Dear Sir

            Re:    Coroners Act 1988    Paul Carlile And Others
                   Hillsborough Inquest

            We write further to our letter of 15th April 1992 which enclosed
            a Memorial on behalf of the next of kin of six of those who lost
            their lives in the Hillsborough Disaster of 15th April 1989.

            There are certain details which we would wish to add to the Memorial
            for your assistance:

                  Omitted from the bundle was the middle page of the letter sent
                  to the Coroner by John Glover and dated 15th October 1990.
                  We now enclose a copy of that middle page which we have numbered
                  "50A" for inclusion at the appropriate point in Appendix 1.

          J 2.    Also omitted was the transcript of the Inquest Hearing relating
                  to Ian Glover on 4th May 1990. We enclose herewith a copy
                  of that transcript.

             3.   On Page 45 of Appendix 1 it is said incorrectly that "The jury
                  never heard from Joseph Glover himself". His evidence as given
                  to the jury appears at Pages 52 to 66 of Appendix 1. It is
                  however our submission in relation to his evidence that the
                  ruling of the Coroner in relation to the "cut off point" prevented

                                                                         Continued .

                him from contributing relevant evidence.

    We further enclose herewith letters sent personally by your Memorialists
    which are in support of their request that you grant leave under
    section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988. Included with these is a
    letter from Doctor Steven Crosby who is the General Practitioner
    of the Parents of kevin Williams.

    Yours faithfully

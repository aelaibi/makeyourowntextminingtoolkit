2 2 3 5 fiutcher,            I a c c o m p a n i e d a bus f u l 1 of Liverpool                      fans, from the

M i d l a n d S t a t i o n to Hi 1 Fsborough.                   The L iverpool              fans were all           dropped

off at the L ep p i n g s Lane end of the ground,                                   a lt h o u g h    I remember a _

c ouple       of fans w an t e d to get off                     prior       to this         saying        they had

arranged          to meet            friends.        T hese     requests         were       denied.

On arrival              at L e p p i n g s    Lane      I was    sur pr is ed       by the       large amount             of

people who were m i l li ng about                         outside          the   ground,       they were           just

hanging a ro u n d and                 it did not appear as though they were                                 being

Policed.            A large           number      of these       fans,       I would         say the m a j o r i t y were

d rinking         beer       from      cans.

A ft er     the fans had got from the bus,                                  w ith 1632 and 2S35,                 I made my

way from L e p p i n g s              Lane    to the Police                Room. -We went            down Vefe Road

a nd      into P e n i s t o n e Road*             As    I w a l k e d along Pen is to ne R oad towards

the Police Roo m                 I can femember            the    perirrietsr; walls            of the h ouses             in-

P e n i st on e Roa d were                littered with empty                beer     cans and bottles,,                  A ga in

fans were w a n d e r i n g               about    but    not as many as at the L e p p i n g s Lane                           end

of. the ground.

W h e n we got to the Police Room                          I got a drink and sat down outside                                  the

P olice Room.                Whilst        I was sat       having a drink               there was a constant

stream of prisoners                       being 'brought         into the Police Room.                       I do    not

know which team these                        s upporters        had    come      to see but most                 of the         <*

p r isoners were              the worse' for             drink.

SeYg,eant Wright                 a r r i v e d l a short      time     later,       I saw him go             into    the gym

a r e a then        into      the Pol ice. Room,              w h e n he     came out of the Pol ic e R oom

he       i nf ormed us we             had a | o & to 'do.                               „             ;
W it h P olice C o n s t a b l e         16,32 and others,           I went         f rom the .area of the

P olice R o o m -and under               the N o rt h S ta nd along            the    passageway.               /

Once       in the    p a s s a g e w a y there was a lot of smoke and                        I thought, this

was the       reason why w 8 had been called out*                              As a serial              we made a

s earch of the          toilets          to’ the      right     of the     passageway and also                      the       bar

areas and food selling                    premises         on the     left of the          passageway.                About

half way along             the     passa ge wa y on the            left hand side            I came           to a room

w here      pies were        Being       prepared,         1    saw smoke was         coming from this

room.        I saw a       c ardboard tray on w h ic h                pies were         stac ke d and had been

scorched.                                                                                      .■ '                       ,



A f t er    this,    w ith Po li ce C onstable                  1632 and other          officers,             1 was only

were with us,            I went      to area          "N W ' and then through to the area                            near

to gate        'A”. O n c e        at this          location      I saw that         there was a              large

number       of fans still           outside          the ground.          I saw through a glass                      pane

to the       right     of the       gate       that    people      cnrTthe o t h e r ^ i ^ e           were ^ e l n g

made my w a y           into       this area        there was a streap of liquid                       running      down

a lo ng the edge            of the wall.                I looked         up towards       the toilets and saw

a number          of men u r in at ing           up against          the wall.

I have          per fo rm ed d uties           in this       location on a number                of    previous

wh en     I have        p er f or m ed duties at             this    location,          the m ain task          is to

search          incoming       supporters.              These      s upporters were            not    being s ea rched

this area,             a m an and w oman            coming      to us,      I think       they had either               one

                      were     first    opened and            I can remember          telling supp or te rs        to slow

                      closed again.

                      As    the gates were: closed,                I saw a number            of officers        running     towards

                      location than on a normal m atch day.

                      Once     in the S o u t h S tand           I made my way down an aisle t o wa rd s                  the

On behalf of the Chief Constable, Mr. Wright, I am gathering information to
enable the Force to present evidence to the forthcoming Committees of Inquiry.
This exercise has no connection with the investigation into the policing of
the F.A. cup semi-final which is being conducted by a team headed by Mr. Dear,
Chief Constable of West Midlands.

What I require from you is a self-written account of your actions on the 15th
April 1989. Please note that this is not a CJA statement and it should be
written on plain paper.  It would be helpful if your account could include the
following information.

1.      What time did you come on duty?

2.      To whom were you responsible?

3.      Where were you deployed, and did    you get deviated to any other
         location?

A.        What did you see that is in   any way relevant to the incident?

5.        What did you do?

Please begin the account with your full name in block letters, your rank and
number and your sub-division/department.  Please conclude the account with
your signature.

The   officer handing you this document will inform you how and when toreturn
it.    Please return it promptly and provide as accurate an account as you  are
able.

Please contact any of my staff if you have any queries or concerns in
completing the account.  Force Headquarters telephonists will connect you with
someone who can help.

Thank you for your assistance.

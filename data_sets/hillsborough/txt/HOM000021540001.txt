Dear Mr Dent

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

As part of his Inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor is now looking more
widely at issues of crowd control and safety at sports events.
An aspect of particular interest is that of identity cards, and
more especially the type of membership scheme envisaged in the
current Football Spectators Bill.

Lord Justice Taylor is aware, from formal submissions already
received, of the reservations felt both by yourselves and the
Football Association as to the merits of such a scheme. He
recognises that striking a balance between catering for the needs
of the responsible majority and dealing with the problem of an
unruly minority is not easy, and is anxious to hear in more
detail of alternative ideas for tackling these problems. It
would be helpful to know whether you could let Lord Justice
Taylor have written comments about this in advance of any meeting
with you which he might want to arrange.

I am writing in similar terms to the Football Association and the
Football Supporters' Association.

                                         Yours sincerely

      Dear Mr Kennedy

      I would like your advice on parts of two letters (attached) received in
      connection with the Hillsborough Inquiry.

      Davis Arnold Cooper represent Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and Hammond
      Suddards represent South Yorkshire Police as well as on a personal basis
      the Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson.

      The issue I request advice on is in relation to the agreement you gave to
      give all parties permission to test the broken barrier, (I enclose a letter
      from ACC Jones to Hammond Suddards which gives the guidelines).

      Davis Arnold Cooper have requested a copy of the test results of the Health
      and Safety Executive which form part of the evidence submitted in our file
      to you. Hammond Suddards request the same information but additionally
      seek the conclusions drawn by the H.S.E.

      It seems to me that the results are not a problem but I have doubts at this
      stage about releasing the conclusions before your decision is made on any
      criminal prosecutions.  I would welcome your decision on this point.

     Further could I ask you to consider item 3 in the Hammond Suddard’s letter
     over the Eastwood file. No 8 9 4 5 . This is retained by us but is not a
     material document submitted to you in the file. I have examined the
     contents and it does mainly relate to the implementation of membership
     schemes following a letter (copy attached), from the football league to all
     clubs dated 5 March 1 9 8 7 . Although a number of important issues are
     mentioned such as the safety certificate and capacities I see no reason to
     withhold it.


                                                            Continued...




      PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T
                                     2.




I would suggest we retain the original and provide a copy, albeit first
with the permission of Eastwoods Solicitors.

Yours sincerely

     Dear Sir

     Hillsborough Disaster

     As you are aware, this firm are instructed to act on behalf of
     Sheffield                             Wednesday                             Football                     Club with                     regard to                    the           civil
     litigation                               arising                        from the                       Hillsborough                           disaster.


     The             Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police is pursuing                                                                                                                        a
     claim                   for              contribution                                    in the                  lead actions                        of        Chapman                     and
     Rimmer                          against                         the                   Club              and              Eastwood                  & Partners                       (the
     consulting engineers                                                           to the Club).                                  The trial has been fixed
     for              the             beginning of October                                                       in both these                            actions,                   and          a
     great                   deal                 of           preparation                               work             must           be        undertaken                    by             the
     parties                         involved                          to            ensure                that               the        trial            takes            place                 in
     October                         without                         any unnecessary delays.                                                       One of the central
     aspects                         will be the technical expert evidence to be obtained
     in relation to such matters as the broken barrier 124A in pen
     3 and                      that part of barrier 144 which was removed from pen 3
     prior to the semi-final.


     On the 18th October 1989 I wrote to Mr Mervyn Jones as I was
     concerned at that stage that the Health and Safety Executive
     had              yet to complete                                               their tests                               in relation to                         the            broken
     barrier,                          and the further barriers that were removed from the

                                                                                                                                                                    Contd../..

        ground on the 7th July.               Experts had been instructed by the
        parties     to the civil claims to advise                 upon the    adequacy or
        otherwise of the broken barrier amongst other matters.                       There
        followed correspondence on the same subject culminating in the
        letter from Mr Jones of the 4th December stating that sampling
        of    the   broken    barrier     could      be   undertaken    by    the   experts
        involved subject to certain conditions.                   It was also stated in
        that    letter      that   it   was   not    his    intention    to    return   the
        barrier to the custody of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
        Indeed, the return of the barrier would not take place until a
        decision      had     been      reached      by    the    Director     of    Public
        Prosecutions and HM Coroner had concluded the inquests.


        The experts involved have now agreed,                    upon instructions from
        their Solicitors,          to an agreed programme of material testing
        to be carried out on the broken barrier.                   The experts involved
        are

        I would now ask that the barrier be released to our experts,
        subject to the conditions laid down by the Crown Prosecution
        Service as stated in the letter of the 4th December from Mr

                                                                              Contd../..

        Mervyn Jones.       Dr Weaver of Halcrow & Partners has written to
        the Health and Safety Executive to provide an undertaking that
        the     barrier    will   not    be   tested    or    examined    without    the
        specific agreement of all parties.               A copy of this letter is
        enclosed     together     with    the       agreed    programme    of   testing
        following the meeting held on 5th April between the experts.


        I also refer to the test data collected by the                      Health   and
        Safety Executive in relation to the broken barrier and other
        barriers.        It has been agreed by the experts that the release
        of this data may well save            them the need for a great deal of
        sampling or testing of the broken barrier.                It is not our wish
        to obtain any documents showing the                  findings   or conclusions
        drawn by the Health and Safety Executive, but simply for the
        parties to have the factual test results so that the experts
        can make their own findings or conclusions.


        I should be grateful therefore,               if you will ask the DPP to
        kindly release copies of the test results of the parties as a
        matter or urgency.         I do of course confirm that the HSE                or
        other expert retained by the CPS will be welcome to attend any
        further tests carried out.


        A copy of this letter has been sent to Mr Heyes of the Health
        and     Safety    Executive     and   the    Solicitors     involved    in   the
        litigation.


        I look forward to hearing from you.

         Dear Mr. Sharp,

         Hillsborough '                                                              -     ■

         I understand from Mr. Mervyn Jones that-you have taken over direct
         control of what has been previously referred to as the West Midlands-
         inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

         I represent the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and his insurers
         in respect of civil claims arising out of the disaster and I am also
         representing Walter Jackson personally in respect of the inquiry.
                                                                                                                                               ♦
        As you may know, there will be a civil Court hearing commencing
        early in October to determine civil liability as between the South
        Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and Eastwood &
        Partners.  In this connection, I am aware that there is certain
        documentation in the possession of the .West Midlands Inquiry which
        I think would be of evidential value in the civil actions and which
        I would suggest could be disclosed to the parties to the civil
        actions, without any prejudice either-to the criminal or
        disciplinary aspects of the inquiry.

                            possible to prepare a similar.plan from the

                        comprehensive plan is altfeady in existence, this
                        could fairly be disclosed to the parties to the
                        civil action.

                 2.     I understand that there has been further testing
                        of the broken barrier 124ft by the Health & Safety
                        Executive, in association with Professor Smith of
                        Sheffield University.- Such testing and any
                        opinions expressed by the experts may be expected
                        to be of particular value to the High Court Judge
                        dealing with the. c?ivi 1--triais-, because they may
                        be expected to t-- entirely neutral.

                3.      We understand from Eastwoods' Solicitors that a
                        number of Eastwoods' files were taken into the
                        possession of the West Midlands Inquiry, ..where
                        they now remain. We ‘are particularly interested
                      . in file number 8945, which relates' to work
                        carried out by Eastwoods in response.to the
                        Football League's anti-hooligan initiative of
                        5th March, 1987,, which was passed by-Sheffield
                        Wednesday to Eastwoods--on 10th March, 1987. This
                        file is potentially extremely material in the
                        civil action.


      I should say that I have-previously made requests in respect of
      items 1 and 2 to Mr. Mervyn Jones-> wh©:indicated that, although he
      could not oblige at that time, he was ic&eping an open mind and
      would, be prepared to reconsider.

      I consider it to be of overriding.importance that a fair conclusion
      is reached at the civil proceedings- but, even so, I would accept
      that you would not wish to disclose documents which might materially
      pre-judi-tre:the:-con t imring- -conduct-of ;yomr -iaqutry-oir- -any prosecution--- -.
      o r .disciplinary actibh.. I                          ;i eahnot-.se.e:how any of/-
      the documents identified at items l.r Z and 3 above could fall into
      such a category and I would ask you .to consider releasing them, on
      the basis that we will be responsible for. the cost, .of copying and
      delivery and will undertake to -provide further- copies to the other -
      parties to the civil action, as soon as possible after receipt.

      I look forward to hearing from you.


      Yours sincerely,

 On Saturday,   15th April     1989 I went to watch Liverpool Football Club play

 No t ting ham Forest in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough,      Sheffield.      I

 was going with my friend, |                 | We went on an Amberline Coach.      When

 we got to the coach station             and I were on different coaches.    On the

 coach that I was on I met Philip Hammond and Ian Southgate.          I did not know

 Philip and Ian well.        I played football now and again against the Boys Brigade

 when Ian and Philip were playing for the Boys Brigade.



Whilst talking on the coach we agreed to meet inside th£,_ground.



         and I had tickets for the Leppings Lane end of the.Hillsborough ground.

W h e n we arrived at the ground ______ and I were body searched and had to give

in our tickets.         We got into the Leppings Lane terrace at about   1.30p.m. where

we met Philip and Ian.         All four of us were on the terrace to gether as the
stadium slowly fi lled up.


                    \


By about 2.45p.m. we just could not move, the terraces were that packed.

There was a number surges.        When the players came out onto the pitch for the

kick off there was a big surge and I was pushed f o r w a r d and thereby separated

from Ian and Jason.        I kept hold of Philip's hand.     With the surge Philip

and I were m o v e d further down the terrace.     We were m o ved just over half way
down the terrace.



The pressure of the crowd became unbearable.         Although I tried to keep hold

of P h i l i p ’s hand he slowly slipped out of my grasp, with the pressure of the

crowd.    With a further surge which occurred at about 3.02p.m.        Philip was pushed

forward and disappeared from my view.        I did not see him again.



The pressure was unbearable.        I couldn't breath because my chest w a s killing

me.   I tried to'make my way back up the terrace to get out.         Eventually,     I

got out through the tunnel at the back of the terrace when the police opened
the doors.
INJURIES

I sustained bruising to my right shoulder and chest.                      My ribs were also sore

and bruised.



On Monday,     17th April I vent        into work        because    I was       anxious to ensure that

my work colleagues knew that            I was all        right.     I did       not want them telephoning

my parents, u p s e t t i n g them.     I did not        do much    work.



On Tuesday,     18th A p r il I did     not go into work.         I could not get out of bed.

I did not want      to move.



On Wednesday,      19th April I went into work in the morning but could not do

anything.     I was sent home.         I went to see my General Practitioner - Dr.

of                                                     Liverpool.        He spent about 5 minutes

examining me and 30 minutes talking to me.                   I could not talk to my parents

about what h a d hap pened and how I felt.             Dr.         was however able to help

me   in this regard.      He did not prescribe any treatment.



T h e r e a f t e r } I r e t u r n e d to work on Monday, 24th April.



I have now r e c o v e r e d from m y physical injuries.          I was okay after a couple

of weeks.     I do h owe ver continue to suffer from the psychological effects

of the disaster.



For a couple of w e eks after         the accident I tended to wake up in the night

and not be able to get the disaster out of my mind.                      I was very depressed

in the week after the disaster.             I did not want to know.           I did not want to

go back to work.        I w a n t e d to stay at home in the house.



I felt as if I had k i l l e d Philip and was responsible for his death.                  I had

hold of his hand.        He was only small.         With other p e o p l e ’s help I am now

beginning to get over this,           and feel better.         I realise now that once I lost

P h i l i p ’s h a n d I just had to fight for my life.



My w o r k ’s coll eagues are he lping me to get over the tragedy.                I also go to

friends houses where we talk about the disaster for hours - this helps.



I now feel angry about what           is being said about the disaster ie.           that it was

caused by h o o l i g a n s and drunkeness.      I do not accept that this is true.
All the memories of this horrific traged y f l ood back into my m ind whenever

I hear about the public             enquiry on the r a dio or on the television or read

about it in the papers.              I feel that I v:art to cry but I cannot.



I am a keen supporter of Liverpool Football Club.                     I normally w a tch their

home matches from the Kop when I                  am   not working.   I have been to a couple

of matches since the tragedy.                   I have not enjoyed them.     I do not feel like

watching football.             When the crowd surges I get flash backs of what h appened

at Hillsborough.

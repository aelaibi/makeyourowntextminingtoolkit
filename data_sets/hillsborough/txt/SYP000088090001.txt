              On S a tu r d a y   15th April          1989   (150489)     I a t te n d e d   the FA C up S e mi -f in al

              match,     played b et we en L iverpool             and N o t t i n g h a m Forest at the

              a nd have       been a s eason ticket            holder     for the      last 5 years.



               I t r a velled to the game              by car wit h my hustand,                              my b rother

Ln standing area having             obtained that          from Anfield,



We stopped once on route                to the game at^ a         pub on the A616 about             7

miles     from the ground.        I can't     remj thbe'r its name.           We had a drink and

som et hi ng    to eat.      There we re ya number          of other Liverpol             s upporters          in

t here    including Sir H ^ rry j/flVERMORE.               Most   of them were drinking                 but

there was       no drunkeness.          We were     sub je ct ed to some delays              on our way

there,       at the end of the M&3 and on the m ai n                 road down          into Sheffield,

s im pl y due to heavy traffic.              We e v en tu al ly     parked     in S he f f i e l d at

about     1.40 pm (1340)        on a road     past the       psyciatric        hospital       about       10

mi nu t es walk      from the ground,



Wh i ls t walking       down to the ground          I y/eceived no Police               dir ec ti on or

escort,       but   I did see Police        off j/!e r s stopping a nd searching               c a r s,

vans and       coaches and s ea rc he d JC\hem for alcohol              and were taking            cans

a nd bottles        off them.     That/was        the only Police a ct ivity              I saw from

We a r r i v e d at the g round at about            1.50 pm       (1350).      The queues were

quite     small     and we w a lk e d    straight    in.     As we got to Ime ground, ____

went     to the shop next        to the ground to buy some                swjrets.        Whilst

He had a big         round face and a ginger iri.Qustachafy he was most abrupt and

rude,     he shouted at us to get            in the g r \ u n d /     We e xp lained we were

As we      e ntered the ground we went                     to the     right   of Xpfe West      S t a nd to get

on to      the terracing,           having        been the re f o r j f ' a.ndr knew that       you    could go

that way.          I was     not aware          of any signs directing            us to go that or a n y

other way onto the terracing.                        We went      round     into the terracing and

made our way to the                centre se ct io n slightly to right                  of the goad about

our    programmes,          there were only about                150— 200     in that a rea at that

At that      time there were              no    problems with o ve rc rowding               or any other

unusual      incidents.            As time went            on more a nd more      people       came   in,    but

just a steady flow.                 After about 20 minutes,                           who    had been to the

toilet      came back and told us that/he                       had found a better            viewing

It was about 2.35             pm    (1435?       when we     finally got to our m atch viewing

positon.          By this     time       I noticed that          it was      becoming more         crowded

Jbshind the goals and this                     got worse as       it got closer         to   kick    off time.



Just     before kick off            I realised          it had become far j^tYse than                normal

and    in fact som et hing was going wrong.                          Peop 1 e/4oy now were         c 1 imbing

over     the     front    fences     onto the          pitch.     In £€ct        I saw one       lad climbing

over     people's        heads     to get      out,     he was j f    skin head with a denim jacket.



It was strange            in that        people at the front of the                  pens were      in obvious

distress         but just     behind them people were acting as normal                            and    it was

clear     that they were obli vi ou s                  to what was         going   on just       in front    of

them.          People    then seemed to              collapsing as they got out onto the

pitch.          More and more        people          camaf out onto        the   pitch a nd e ventually

the m at ch was          st op ped and         the teams went         off.



Just    after      that    I d eci de d        to go and help as             I realised that        it was

becoming         a serious       situation.            Together w i t h _________ I went          down behind

the West S tand and down the tunnel                         into the area behind the g o a l , at

this     time     it was    fairly       empty and we           climbed through where              the fence

had been         pulled up onto          the     pitch.



Just as we         reached the terracing                 I heard a tannoy a n n ou nc em en t asking

for any medical            a ss is t a n c e    to    come onto      the    pitch.    By/ no w    I realised

that     people     had died as there were about 6 bodies                            covered      in the area

be h in d the s t a n d .        W hen    I got on the          pitch      I looked    round and took my

coat off.          I saw     ywo P o l i c e w o m e n giving        resuscitation, to a person to

the    left      of the goals as you                 looked forward and just             in front       of the

by line.          They both a p p e a r e d to be           in some        distress and there was

a n o th e r    lad there who was              o bviously a friend of the victim,                   he was

                  I said to them that           I was a nurse and did they want any help,                          the one

                  giving m ou th to m o ut h sat up and            I took over.           We tried     r es us ci ta ti on

                  dead    lad shout i ng out ^ f i l i n g      him to wake       up.     I went and got my             coat

                  and    covered the       ladj^    face

                  My    coat was a denim        patched       patterned jacket with a sip up front and

                  large    padded shoulders.               In it was a packet       of    chewing     gum,    at      least

                  two ticket       stubbs and a few           coins.     I have    not seen my        coat since,

                  After    leaving this       body    I saw a man        lying    on the floor        in obvious

                  distress,       he was    nearer    to the terracing,           he wasn't        dead,    he was

aV                spe ak in g    saying    s omething about       his    back or his        legs.     There were a
     r-i
                  number    of    people trying       to     lift this man onto a hoarding.                  I went        over

                  a n d a d v i se d them to be more          careful    in case    of back        injury.       We     put

                  this man on a hoarding and                 car ri ed him up the         pitch.     I s u p p or te d the

                  end w ith his head and            carried him.



                  This m an was very heavy,            a very big        lad.     He was     in his    late 2 0 ' s

              a lm o st    c ollapsed so          I told them to            put him down.            I put him     in the

              r ecovery        position and a /St. Johns man                   came over        to him and        I went          back

              to the other            end.      1 don't know whether             he died or not,           but he was

              alive when           I left.

              arrived.           The doctor         called for oxygen and the ambulance man brought a

              tank and         put     it over his face.              I left then and           I didn't     see what

              close       to tears.            I told the fans         to    leave him alone.           I then returned

                                                                                              S3235

the heavy       lad on the hoarding.



On that       day    1 was wearing       blue jeans 7j/^?hi te t r a iners a nd a white T

s h i rt                                                 d describe myself as 5*3 with

ihort brown          curly hair    swespt h, ck and        plump build.



In m y o pinion the Police              just d i d n ’t seem to Wjrffw what       to do,     there

were a lot standing a ro u n d a s if they wereystunned.                        It was    the fans

that       took the    lead    in the    rescue.     The / o l i c e   put a cordon across         the

gr ou nd and they h in dered us taking               people     up the ground,       in fact we

had to shout at them to move                outy6f       the way.      At the other      end of the

g r o u n d there was     no o rg an i s a t i o n a nd no one      took    charge of the

situation.



T here was      no defibbu 1ator *y^ailable to assist                  in the   resus ci ta ti on of

people       or stretchers av^i^lable.             All    in all    a distinct    lack of niedi c a l

e q u i p me n t and tpersonnj



It cert ai nly needed an earlier                tannoy a n n o u n c e m e n t to let people know
                                                                              A/ & Z Q '
what was       going    on because       once   one was made by K e nn y D A L G L I S H it

calmed things          down.



The    gates    in the fence at          the front were       poor     in the fact    that    they

were       too small and not       enough of them.



I must       say that    I did not       see the    barrier     break      in Pen 3 and    I was     not

near       it when    it broke.

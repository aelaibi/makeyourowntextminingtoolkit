jjp O R T OF’FIRgT MEETING OF WORKING PARTY
RELATING TO HOOLIGANISM AT SOCCER MATCHES

1.       The problem of Hooliganism and Vandalism a t Soccer Matches has been brought
         to a head in South Yorkshire with the trouble caused during and after the F.A .
         Cup Sem i-Final match between M anchester United and Leeds United held a t the
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Glub Ground earlder thl® y ear, and in view of that
         trouble tihare shduld be n® m ore Semi°-Final m atches in South Yorkshire until the
         hooUgaflBism problem has been beaten.

2.       It m ust be emphasised at the outset that the Police did a magnificent job both
         to the forw ard planning and in policing on the day and no criticism of them is
         intended by this report. However, a num ber of trouble m akers in the crowd
         attending the match caused damage, injury and some alarm to the piddle and,
         unfortunately, the public have come to expect a certain type of behaviour from
         Soccer matches of this so rt and, in particular, to expect it from those involving
         certain clubs.

3.       The Working Party consider that the m atter m ust be tackled on a National level
         a t the root cause of the problem . Central Government m ust face up to the problem
         and tackle the causes at the root.




4.       W hilst the problem needs to be tackled on a National level and may take some
         tim e to solve, the Working Party consider that they owe a duty to the people
         of South Y orkshire to take im m ediate action to prevent wanton violence, damage
         etc. associated with football hooliganism which people of South Y orkshire,be they
         football fans o r otherwise, generally deplore.

5.       On this basis the South Yorkshire County Council calls fo r legislation to give
         them the power to ban any proposed sporting event within South Yorkshire where
         they, having considered all the information and evidence available to them,
         consider there to b© a real danger that persons attending o r attempting
         to attend the event will cause injury cr damage to persons and property o r cause
         fea r o r alarm to the residents in the vicinity where the proposed event is to take
         place.

6.       It is considered that the approach coupled with a realistic use of the power does
         not run away from the root cause nor does it move the problem onto someone
         elses doorstep in that the powers should be available to all County A uthorities.

7.       The Working Party have considered the effect of the Safety of Sports Ground
         Act 197 5,in p articu lar Section 10, and feel that the Act has little relevance to
         hooliganism and no relevance to events taking place outside the ground and thus
         consider that this Act does not contain the necessary legislative powers now
         required. They nonetheless consider that the power of the Secretary of State to
         designate a stadium under Section 1 should be exercised much m ore freely so that
         all stadia where large crowds could be attracted are automatically and properly
         brought into those arrangem ents, as only in this way can the County Council be
         satisfied that within the ground proper action has been taken. Furtherm ore the
         Working Party consider that Hillsborough Football Stadium should be specifically
         designated under Section 1 of the 1975 Act.
The Working Party went on to consider a aiunber of other m atters connected with
soccer hooliganism.

(a) Hie number of unruly persons attending soccer matches looking for trouble
    is a m inority of the total attendance.      It is likely that these persons are
    not "supporters" of th eir declared team but use the soccer m atch as an excuse
    for violence and vandalism.

(b) Separation of fans before during and after the m atch should alleviate problem s,
    in p articu lar the policing.

(c) The cost involved can be m easured in extra policing, damage to property both
    public and private, and personal injuries including ambulance and medical
    attendances.

(d) Hooliganism and intoxicating drink in many cases go hand in hand.

(e) Many fans turn up at matches without tickets and when unable to obtain tickets
    a re naturally disgruntled. This frustration may find an outlet in physical
    violence.

The m atters considered in the preceding paragraph m erit amplification in
consideration of the powers now called for by the County Council.

(a) Tttie unruly m inority can be tackled on two fronts. F ir s t th eir exclusion from
    grounds and special transport, secondly their identification if they do a rriv e
    a t the ground whether o r not they gain admission.

    (i)     exclusion of the unruly elem ent could be partially achieved by stric t
            control of ticket allocation especially at all advance ticket events.
             Tickets to bonafide club supporters (on the lines now operated by
             som e clubs) coupled with exclusion from special coaches and trains
             of those without tickets may discourage soccer hooligans who are
             attempting to get to away m atches.

     (ii)   identification of the unruly elem ent can a ssist the police in preventing
             trouble arising.                                                          a



(b) Separation of fans during and after the matches is alrea<fy practised eg.
    coaches of fans arriving shortly before kick off at separate entrances
    etc. High fences inside the grounds to separate fans can cause problem s
    especially where coupled with staggered release of fans; the problem s include
    fire and safely factors particularly where fans wishing to get out push the
    crowd in front, quite ap art from the legal considerations of claim s of false
    im prisonm ent It m ust also be appreciated that putting people in "cages"
    may aggravate the problem s eg. damage caused when fans break out. Ticket
    allocation control can a s s is t also with separation of fans but much depends
    upon the stadium layout, in p articu lar the num ber and location of entrances /ex its.
                               - 3 -



      (c) Policing inside the soccer ground is paid for toy the club but policing outside
          is not. At the M anchester /L eeds Sem i-Final th ere were four tim es as many
          police outside the ground as there w ere inside. The costs of these extra
          police (many loaned from other forces) falls on public funds. Those prim arily
          responsible for the cost of damaged property and injury to people a re those
          causing such damage and injury (although the cost of ambulances,hospital and
          medical treatm ent is usually irrecoverable). However, quite apart from the
          difficulties involved in identifying the individuals concerned,those suffering
          from acts of violence and vandalism will generally pursue any remedy
          against a guaranteed source of finance rath e r than the individual perpetrators
          who may be "men of straw ". In consequence, fo r property damage the claim
          is made under the provisions relating to rio t and for personal injuries under
          the Crim inal Injuries Compensation Scheme,and hence again the burden falls
          on public funds. The Working P arty however, considered that the cost of
          all these m atters should fall upon those responsible fo r attracting such a
          larg e crowd in the firs t place, although whether this should be the Football
          Association, the Home Ground o r the Teams involved in the m atches may
          need som e fu rth er investigation.

      (d) Drink should be banned at Football Grounds, on Special Soccer Trains and
          Coaches, and discussions with M agistrates/Licenced V ictuallers/B rew eries and
          all other interested parties should be initiated to see whether the closing of public
          houses/off licences in the vicinity of the grounds on the day of special m atches
          could be achieved.

      (e) To avoid disgruntled fans who a re unable to obtain tickets reso rtin g to
          hooliganism and vandalism, every effort should be made to discourage persons
          attending without tickets. This involves again the C lub/B ritish Rail/Coach
          O perators in a co-ordinated effort to see that ticket allocations and tran sp o rt
          of ticket holding fans produces the desired result.

10.   The powers now sought by the County Council should not be exercised in an oppressive
      m anner and indeed som e built in checks (eg. appeal to a M agistrates Court) would
      be perfectly acceptable. In addition there should be power to the Council to waive
      any prohibition notice upon receipt of satisfactory assurances and guarantees
      (breach of which should c arry sanctions). Such assurances and guarantees would
      vary in accordance with the circum stances but may well includes-

      (a) Strict control of ticket allocation, distribution and sale.

      (b) Code of procedures and conduct to be operated by coach firm s.

      (c) Full compliance within the grounds of all anti-hooliganism m easures proposed
          by the Police.

      (d) Payment (covered by insurance) by the relevant club of all police, ambulance,
          medical(hospital costs and compensation fo r personal injury and property damage

      (e) Control of supply of liquor on the m atch day.
                                - 4 -



11.   It is appreciated that the m ajority of Football fans are law abiding citizens and may
      oppose such radical powers as those now suggested,but it is hoped that people
      will accept that the County Council m ust deal with all fans according to the sam e
      rules and no doubt those who a re law abiding will appreciate the necessity for
      the m easures now proposed and accept the inherent restrictio n s on personal liberty
      in the realisation that if the m easures a re successful all will accordingly benefit.

12.   The Working Party also considered the penalties for the various offences caused by
      soccer hooligans and welcome the increased penalties now proposed in the Criminal
      I aw Bill a t present before Parliam ent.

13.   RECOMMENDATIONS:

      (I)     An immediate approach should be made to the Football A ssociation/M inister
               of Sport to ensure that no further Sem i-Final m atches a re held in South
              Y orkshire.

      (ii)    An imm ediate approach should be made to the Home Secretary for the
               Hillsborough Stadium to be designated under Section 1 of the Safety of
               Sports Grounds Act 1975.                                                      ^jj

      (iii)   The County Council (possibly involving the A.M.A.) should seek the
               legislative powers referred to in this report.

      (Lv)    Further discussions be held with M agistrates/L icenced V ictu allers/
               Brew eries e tc ., to get agreed a procedure for banning the sale of
               intoxicating liquor on certain m atch days.

      (v)     That the County Council follow through these recommendations with positive
               action assisted by a co-ordinating offlcer/m em ber/w orking party.

      (vL)    That an approach be made to the Football Clubs staging m atches
               necessitating the attendance of police over and above the num ber generally
               deployed, regarding a financial contribution from the Club towards
               the cost of police provision outside the ground.

      (vii)   That an immediate approach be made to the proper authority demanding
               provisions for stlffer court sentences, e .g . detention and curtailm ent
               of leisure to be adm inistered to offenders responsible for hooliganism
               a t football m atches.

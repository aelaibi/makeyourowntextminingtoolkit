                                    HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
                                         15 APRIL, 1989

  1. The Authority have now completed a careful and detailed examination of the report
  and the evidence relating to the individual complaints arising from the Hillsborough
  tragedy on 15 April, 1989. We have considered Mr Anderson's memoranda, submitted to
  us in accordance with the provisions of Section 90(5) of the Police and Criminal
  Evidence Act, 1984, and his letter of 10 April, 1991. We have noted your force's
  proposals not to prefer disciplinary charges against any of the officers who are the
  subject of complaint and your reasons for these proposals. However, as I told Mr
  Anderson on the telephone, the Authority were disappointed that he did not explain
  your reasons more fully. We have also taken into account the views expressed by Mr
  Sharp, the investigating officer.

  2. Having considered the evidence relating to the complaints against Police Constable
  Smith, Police Constable Illingworth, Superintendent Marshall or Superintendent Green­
  wood we have concluded that the evidence in respect of these four officers does not
  justify disciplinary proceedings and we agree with your proposal. if

  3. We have also considered those complaints which have been laid against Chief
  Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray which allege that they were in
  'neglect of duty'. These complaints raise difficult issues. In reaching our conclusions
4 we have borne in mind the decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions as one
  factor amongst others. As you are aware we do not accept that culpable misfeasance
  and neglect of duty are coterminous nor that, even if they were, we would be bound (as
  far as discipline is concerned) by the decision of the Director not to bring criminal
  prosecutions. We have, throughout, borne in mind the definition of neglect of duty set
 out in paragraph k of Schedule 1 of The Police (Discipline) Regulations, 1985.
4. The incident which gave rise to the tragedy a t the Hillsborough Stadium on 15
April, 1989 would not have occurred had sensible and simple steps been taken to secure
the safety of spectators in Pens 3 and 4 on the Leppings Lane Terraces. It is clear
that the basic cause of the disaster was overcrowding in these pens.         We have
concentrated on this m atter.
5. In reaching our decisions we have taken into account various m atters which can be
advanced as arguments for taking no disciplinary action on the grounds th at to take
such action would be unfair and/or oppressive. Amongst such m atters we refer briefly
to the following:
           a. the passage of time since 15 April, 1989;

           b. the various consequences arising from the earlier hearings
           before Lord Justice Taylor and the Coroner;

           c. the e ffe c t of the extensive media coverage of the incident
           itself, m atters associated with it and the hearings referred to in
           b. above;
           d. the perception that if any officer is charged he may be seen
           as a scapegoat carrying the blame for the acts or omissions of
           others;
           e. the recent promotion of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
           the fact th a t he took over the match arrangements devised by
           someone else and his b elief th a t th e plan had o p e ra te d
           successfully before;

           f. the anguish which both Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
           Superintendent Murray must have experienced as the result of the
           tragic and unexpected events on 15 April, 1989, and

           g. the e ffe c t that disciplinary action against any officer would
           have on the morale and well-being of the South             Yorkshire
           Police.
6. Despite these factors it cannot be denied that the police, under the control of Chief
Superindent Duckenfield, assisted by Superintendent Murray, were de facto in control of
the ground a t the relevant time and had responsibility for the safety of the spectators.
In the opinion of this Authority there is sufficient evidence to support disciplinary
charges on the following grounds:

           a. Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, as the officer in overall
           command, failed to address himself properly to the problems
           involved in, and the plans for, crowd control even before the
           spectators arrived;

           b. failed to monitor the numbers of spectators entering Pens 3
           and 4;
            c. failed to take any action when Pens 3 and 4 became obviously
            overcrowded;

            d. a u th o rised G ate 'C ' to be opened and, to g e th e r with
            Superintendent Murray, failed to take any steps to control the
            movement of those who entered the ground through this gate a t a
            time when it was, or should have been, clear to both of them
            that Pens 3 and 4 were, or were likely to become, overcrowded.

7. In the view of this Authority responsibility for the safety of those in Pens 3 and 4
and blame for overcrowding in those pens should rest with those in the Police Control
Box from which the pens could be observed, the deployment of police manpower could
be directed and the decision to open G ate 'C' was made with its attendant responsibil­
ity for controlling those who entered through it. The Authority are conscious of the
complex circumstances which may have contributed to the tragedy, but we do not
accept that the fact th at there may be others who are also in some way blameworthy,
should cause us to decide against the recommendation of charges under the Regulations
if, as here, the evidence is available to support such charges. You will appreciate the
Authority are concerned solely with the evidence in respect of the m atters which are
the subject of complaint and not with mitigation which would only become relevant if a
breach of discipline were to be proved against an officer who            is the subject of a
charge.

8. For these reasons th a t the Authority have decided to recommend under Section
93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that the following charges be
brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield:

           i. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of
           the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           acquaint himself with the planning and problems related to the
           control of the semi-final.

           ii. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of
           the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           monitor crowd numbers in Pens 3 and 4.

           iii- Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1
           of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           act when Pens 3 and 4 were obviously overcrowded.

           iv. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1
           of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           control the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening of
           Gate 'C'.

9. We have given separate attention to the degree of responsibility attributable to
Superindent Murray. We concluded that in view of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's
very recent appointment , and promotion to his position as Divisional Commander,
Superintendent Murray had a special responsibility to assist and advise Chief Super­
intendent Duckenfield particularly in view of Superintendent Murray's greater exper­
ience of policing a t Hillsborough. He was aware th at authority had been given to open
Gate 'C'.
10. We therefore recommend under Section 93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 that Superintendent Murray also be charged with:

            Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of the
            Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to control
            the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening of Gate
            'C'.

11.    We have also carefully considered the allegation that Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield was deceitful and misled senior police officers and members of the public.
We do not agree with the investigating officer's conclusions that this m atter is not
substantiated. It is clear th at Mr Kelly, Mr Kirtin and Mr Mackrell were told by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield th at Gate 'C had been forced, and that there had been an
in-rush of Liverpool supporters, ^ h ile we are aware that he did not wish to encourage
a hostile reaction which might impede rescue work we share the opinion of Lord Justice
Taylor that this did not require anyone being told a falsehood.         This misleading
explanation led to serious allegations being made against Liverpool supporters in general
causing grave offence and distress.

12 We have, therefore, decided to recommend under Section 93(1) of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield also be charged
with:

            Discreditable Conduct - contrary to paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of
            the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he acted in a
            manner likely to bring discredit on the reputation of the force or
            the police service.

13.   I would be grateful for your response to our recommendations as soon as possible.

14. If you accept the Authority's recommendations we shall be minded, in view of the
exceptional circumstances affecting this case, to direct th at the charges are heard by a
tribunal, in accordance with Section 94(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984.

15.    I would particularly request that you maintain the confidentiality, of this
correspondence until such tim e as the procedures laid down in the Act for determining
the disciplinary charges to be preferred have been completed. This will involve not
informing those against whom we are agreed that no charges should be preferred until
the whole m atter has been resolved between us.

          Dear Mr Hayes

          HILLSBOROUGH 1989

          In response to our recent telephone conversation on 10 May 1991 I write to
          say that I have now had the opportunity to study the copy of the Police
          Complaints Authority letter of 7 May 1991.

          I have set out, in this letter,         the detailed reasoning which lay behind the
          recommendations and conclusions         in my Complaints and Discipline reports in
          respect of Chief Superintendent         Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.   In
          addition, I have made reference         to the points and issues raised by the PCA
          in its letter.

          It cannot be argued that the PCA is not bound by the decisions of the
          Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the criminal conduct issues
          because the PCA has to consider whether or not the complaints are
          substantiated and whether disciplinary charges should be laid. However, it
          could be argued that if the evidence required to prove a criminal offence
          is identical to the evidence required to prove a disciplinary offence, and
          the decision of the DPP is that there is insufficient evidence to prove the
          criminal offence, then it follows that there will be insufficient evidence
          to prove the disciplinary offence.

          The PCA is of the view that the ancient criminal offence of "culpable
          malfeasance" is not coterminous with "neglect of duty". That is to say the
          least, arguable.   Every malfeasance or culpable non-feasance of an officer
          of justice, which includes a police officer, in respect of his office, is a
          misdemeanour at Common Law.    The case-law arises predominently from very
          old cases which arose out of failure to do things required to be done
          because of the accused’s office, (see CROWTHER s CASE (1593) Cro. Eliz. 654
          and R v WYAT (1705) 1 Salk 380). The cases indicate there is an offence of
          a public officer wilfully neglecting to perform a duty which he is bound to
          perform by common law or statute but the neglect has to be wilful and not
          merely inadvertent.    It has to be culpable in the sense of being without


                                                        1
reasonable excuse or justification.     In this sense culpability is not
restricted to corruption or dishonesty but has to be of such a degree the
misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest.  It would
be for the jury to decide whether the evidence revealed the necessary
degree of culpability in performing a duty badly which would include
"neglect of duty". (R v DYTHAM (1979) 2QB 722).

It does not appear to be   necessary to prove that by so doing, or not doing,
the accused intended to   gain some personal benefit or advantage but itmay
be that in appropriate cases, e.g. a Registrar, there must be a beneficiary
to whose interest there has been no proper regard.

From that it can be argued that the       offence of "culpable malfeasance"
requires proof of a degree of negligence or recklessness which is closely
akin to "neglect of duty". It is my view that the mental element required
to prove "culpable malfeasance" is the same as for the disciplinary offence
of "neglect of duty".      In view of the DPP’s decision in respect of
"culpable malfeasance" it would be quite wrong, in my view, to pursue
disciplinary charges of "neglect of duty", particularly as the Inquest Jury
brought in a verdict of "Accidental Death".    The Inquest jury’s verdict of
"accident" taken together with the DPP’s decision not to prosecute for
"culpable malfeasance" is a powerful argument, in my view, for not pursuing
disciplinary charges of    "Neglect of Duty".   It would appear that the PCA
has taken cognisance of the fact that each case should be considered onits
merits and has decided that in all the circumstances it is "fair and
appropriate" to bring disciplinary proceedings.        I find this view a
difficult one to support but should such proceedings follow then it would
probably be appropriate for any accused officer to be served with a copy of
the DPP’s letter of decision, after consultation with the DPP.

There can be no argument about the definition of "neglect of duty" which is
clearly set out in Schedule 1 of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.
The definition, I suggest, is one which rules out any suggestion that it is
one of the disciplinary offences where the mental element necessary for a
finding of guilt is less than that for most criminal offences. The offence
requires proof of neglect, and it is at least arguable that it is not
sufficient merely to show that the act or omission was caused through a
lack of due care.

The PCA,   in its letter at paragraph 4, makes it clear that its
deliberations have been centred upon the core of the issue, that is to say
the overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4, but in paragraph 7 of the PCA letter it
is recognised that there were "complex circumstances which may have
contributed to the tragedy".    My view is that the core issues are too
complex a matter to say that the tragedy would not have occurred had
sensible and simple steps been taken to secure the safety of spectators.
(Para 4 of PCA letter) . Hindsight is not appropriate, foresight is the
issue.

The passage of time since 15 April 1989,          of itself,    is not an
overwhelmingly persuasive issue, but taken with the decision of the DPP and
the verdict of the Coroner’s Jury it is certainly very persuasive.

Similarly, the earlier hearings before Lord Justice Taylor should not be
conclusive either to prosecute discipline charges or to discredit them. It
should not be forgotten that those hearings were not based upon sworn


                                     2
testimony, whereas the Coroner’s Verdict of accident, was.        What the
transcripts of the Inquest reveal is a matter for you, as are the words of
the Coroner and his Jury. I wonder if the PCA have had the opportunity to
study these transcripts,     particularly those of Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.   Those transcripts of evidence are
over and above my Investigating Officer’s report which received the PCA’s
certificate of satisfaction before the Inquests were concluded.         The
evidence given at the Inquest was probed thoroughly by skilled lawyers
representing the complainants so they must be relevant to any consideration
as to discipline.

Neither would I dismiss so lightly the detrimental effect that the
extensive,  and often contradictory media coverage has had on the
possibility of a fair hearing for any accused officers.    It is the chance
of a "fair trial" which is important, more so than the anguish of the
accused officers or the morale and well-being of South Yorkshire Police.

Now to address the specific disciplinary offences proposed against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield.

(i)      Neglect of Duty in that he failed to acquaint himself with the
         planning and problems related to the control of the semi-final.

         The only clue in the PCA letter as to how this offence could be
         proved is at paragraph 6(a):-

         "Chief Superintendent  Duckenfield, as the officer in overall
         command, failed to address himself properly to the problems
         involved in, and the  plans for, crowd control even before the
         spectators arrived."

         My report at paragrapahs R22 to R47 covers the aspects of written
         instructions available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield before
         the event.    Paragraphs R48 to R58 cover what he actually did
         before the event. Although I have not studied the transcripts of
         evidence given at the Inquests, I am of the view that Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield did enough in his planning, orders and
         briefings to satisfy     the requirements of theSouth Yorkshire
         Police Standing Instructions.     Time was short;    he was newly
         promoted into an area where Hillsborough events were prominent;
         to a considerable degree he had no reason not to take the well-
         tried and overtly successful South Yorkshire Police System as he
         found it;   he received the best possible advice and followed it;
         and he knew that on the day he would have a very experienced team
         working with him with reserve resources available to deal with
         unforeseen contingencies. It is difficult to see how the proposed
         disciplinary offence could be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

(ii)    Neglect of Duty by failing to monitor crowd numbers in Pens 3 and
        4.

         I can add nothing to paragraphs R91 to R98 of my report. Given the
         facilities available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on the
         day he did not, and could not monitor the crowd numbers in the
         fateful pens.   The issue is linked to the question of whether he
         should have done so, an issue addressed at some length in my


                                     3
         report, and to the South Yorkshire Police policy of the day that
         the crowd would find its own level.

 (iii)   Neglect of Duty by failing to act when Pens 3 and 4 were obviously
         overcrowded.

         Paragraphs R103 to Rill consider this matter and the crucial
         question is whether or not Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was
         aware that Pens 3 and 4 were seriously overcrowded, in time for
         him to take action to alleviate it.       My report discusses this
         issue at some length and raises the problems there would be in
         trying to prove such an assertion.    The overcrowding might well
         have been obvious to others, but that begs the question.

 (iv)    Neglect of Duty by failing to control the movement of supporters
         subsequent to the opening of Gate C.

         In support of thischarge I would refer you to paragraphs R142 to
         R143 of my report.     There can be no doubt that the opening of Gate
         C was a life-saving act; that having opened Gate C, Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield monitored       the situation inside the
         stadium;   that other important matters were competing for his
         attention;  and I    draw your attention to paragraphs R147 to R156
         of my report.     Paragraphs R157 to R178 contain the arguments
         setting out the difficulties of proving the charge.


In so far as Superintendent Murray is concerned     the PCA is proposing   only
one disciplinary charge:-

(v)      Neglect of Duty by failing to control the movement of supporters
         subsequent to  the opening of Gate C.

         In support of  that charge the PCA points out thatbecause of Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield*s recent promotion and appointment,
         Superintendent Murray had a special responsibility to assist and
         advise Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, particularly in view of
         Superintendent   Murray’s    greater   experience     of   policing
         Hillsborough.

         It is not absolutely clear but the PCA seems to be suggesting that
         it was right that Superintendent Murray should act on the orders
         of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to give directions for Gate C
         to be opened, but he should have gone further by virtue of his
         greater experience, and given orders for police officers to be
         deployed to receive those spectators who entered the ground
         through the open Gate C.

         It seems that the PCA takes the view that either Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield, or Superintendent Murray, or both of
         them should have controlled the movement of spectators subsequent
         to the opening of Gate C.

         The question of individual and subordinate responsibility is
         considered inmy Complaints and Discipline Report in respect of
         Superintendent Murray at paragraphs Rll to R14.  The paragraphs


                                      4
         which relate to this particular disciplinary charge are at R.28 to
         R.36, but particularly R43 to R55 and paragraphs R43 to R55 and
         paragraphs R56 to R58.

          It could be argued that either the point of view of Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield is taken, i.e. that he had to rely on
          the officers in the command structure using their discretion to
          act to the situation as they saw fit, or he should have given
          specific orders himself. If that be so, then it seems quite wrong
          that two senior officers should face a disciplinary charge arising
          from the same failure to act.   The police structure of individual
          discretion, responsibility and accountability suggests that if any
          officer is to be disciplined for this offence, it ought to be one
          or the other.


Finally, I turn     to   the   proposal   to   discipline   Chief   Superintendent
Duckenfield for:-

(vi)     Discreditable Conduct by acting in a manner likely to bring
          discredit on the reputation of the force or the police service.

          The PCA feels that it is clear Mr Kelly, Mr Kirtin and Mr Mackrell
          were told by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield that Gate C had been
          forced and that there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters.
          The PCA accepts there was a need to deter hostile reaction which
          might have impeded the rescue work, but this did not require the
          telling of any falsehoods.

          The PCA suggests that the misleading explanation given by Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield to the persons named above, resulted in
          serious allegations being made against Liverpool supporters in
          general causing grave offence and distress.

          Paragraph R233 of my report in respect of Chief Superintendent
          Duckenfield addresses the point, and the paragraphs that follow
          indicate some of the possible defences (NOT mitigation) which
          Chief Superintendent Duckenfield could raise should he be called
          to answer the disciplinary charge.

         I am not aware of what was said about the matter at the Inquests,
         if the matter was raised at all.   Also I would draw attention to
         my Complaints and Discipline Report in respect of Mr Walter
         JACKSON,  then an Assistant Chief Constable,       where  similar
         questions are addressed at paragraphs R47 to R50.  In that report
         there is an explanation as to how a misunderstanding could have
         arisen (paragraphs R53 to R62).  The report on Mr Jackson is with
         the South Yorkshire Police Authority because of the rank held by
         Mr Jackson at the time.

          In my report on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield paragraphs R240
          to R244 discuss the question specifically.

In conclusion, may I say that the PCA letter points out that it is concerned
solely with the evidence in respect of the matters subject of complaint, and
not with mitigation.   Although the Inquest transcripts may bring to light


                                          5
matters not covered in my Complaints and Discipline Reports, the problems of
proving the disciplinary offences proposed by the PCA are formidable.

I hope that this letter will assist you with your considerations. All of
the information contained therein is covered in the Complaints and
Discipline Reports already submitted to you.

I shall be considering the PCA letter further in consultation with Detective
Chief Superintendent FOSTER of West Midlands Police and I will contact you
again in the near future.

Dear Chairman

COMPLAINT BY MR TREVOR HICKS

With regard to the above I have read the letter sent by Mr Stephen Walker and
the accompanying correspondence from Mr Trevor Hicks and noted carefully the
points made.

Following the appearance of Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield before the
Hillsborough Inquiry, a question was asked of me by Mr Bob Westerdale, a
reporter for the Sheffield newspaper 'The Star' regarding the possibility of
disciplinary action against Mr Duckenfield. This was due to him apparently
having misled a senior officer concerning an instruction he gave for certain
gates to the Sheffield Wednesday football ground to be opened.

I asked the question be put to us in writing and it was as follows

     "Chief Superintendent Duckenfield aisled his Assistant Chief
     Constable (Operations) regarding the opening of gate 'C'.
     Pending the outcome of the Inquiry what is the Force going to
     do about it?"

In the absence of a public complaint, the decision as to the requirement for
the commencement of an Internal discipline investigation is solely a matter
for the chief officer to whom that responsibility has been delegated by the
Chief Constable, and at the relevant time I was that officer.

I came to the conclusion that pending the outcome of the Inquiry the
commencement of any internal discipline investigation was inappropriate.

There were a number of reasons for that decision, including the following:-

1.   At the time a Public Inquiry under the chairmanship of Lord Justice
     Taylor was examining in considerable detail the conduct of Chief
     Superintendent Duckenfield on the day in question - Saturday 15 April
     1989 - and any parallel inquiry under police discipline regulations by
     the South Yorkshire Police would in my view have been both inappropriate
     and unnecessary.
Councillor Sir John Layden JP                                      9 August 1989


2.   Furthermore, as the Inquiry was still on-going and Chief Superintendent
     Duckenfield available to be recalled as a witness, had I initiated an
     internal inquiry whereby a formal discipline notice would have been
     served on Mr Duckenfield, including the caution "he was not obliged to
     say anything concerning the matter in question", I could have been held
     to have improperly interfered with the Inquiry process.

     The point I am making is that in furtherance of the generally accepted
     overriding public interest in relation to the Hillsborough Inquiry a
     decision had been made that the normal rules of evidence would not apply.
     It had been agreed witnesses would not be sworn, leading questions
     allowed, hearsay evidence permitted and, speculation was encouraged. The
     purpose of this was to encourage witnesses to make available to the
     Inquiry all relevant evidence and Information in their possession without
     hinderance of any kind.

     It has been established that where, police witnesses giving evidence to a
     judicial inquiry have been served with formal discipline notices in
     relation to the matter subject of the Inquiry, they cannot be made to
     answer questions which might incriminate them. The question in my mind
     was, "What would my position be if I caused the service of a formal
     discipline notice on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield then he had been
     recalled as a witness and despite the overriding public interest
     requirement had refused to answer further questions on the grounds of
     self incrimination, brought about by my commencement of the discipline
     process?".

3.   I also believe that had I knowingly and deliberately changed the status
     of Mr Duckenfield as a witness, at a time when the proceedings were in
     the custody of the Inquiry, I could have been held to have acted in
     'contempt of the judicial Inquiry'.

My problem was how best to deal with the question posed against the background
of the on-going Inquiry. In the event I said:-

     "Pending the outcome of the Inquiry, I have considered this
     matter carefully and it is ray view that no further action
     is required".

In summary, I have been asked what if any discipline action the Force intended
to take in respect of certain of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's
submissions to the Taylor Inquiry, before the outcome of the Inquiry was
known, and have responded by saying - for the reasons outlined - that "before
the Inquiry findings were known it was my view that no further action was
required".

I could, of course, have reacted differently by saying this was not a matter
in respect of which I would wish to make comment, or that I would comment only
when the Inquiry was concluded, but I was in regard to this latter option
caught by the question which asked specifically "What action is intended
pending the outcome of the Inquiry?".

In making the comment I did I clearly failed to appreciate the various
Interpretations which could be attributed to it and the Impact of the
statement on Mr and Mrs Hicks and possibly other people who have suffered
losses as a result of the Hillsborough tragedy.
Councillor Sir John Layden JP        - 3 -                       9 August 1989


It may have been more sensible on my part to have made no comment whatsoever
until after the conclusion of the Inquiry, or responded in some other way.

To the extent I have caused any anguish or distress to anyone by my actions I
am deeply sorry. That was never intended and the fact it has occurred causes
me distress also.

I trust my explanation is helpful.

Yours sincerely




Deputy Chief Constable

                           gate I believed at that time had been forced open, gate C.
                           If you look at my statement my interpretation was when the

                           "Why do you want the gate open because it is burst open
            B              already?".

                                 happened? - A. The reality of the situation is that shortly
                                 after the events had occurred many people were in a state of
                                 shock, and I thought it-correct to collect my thoughts and to

                           said to M r . Kelly that Mr. Kelly when he gave interviews to
                           the media, of which he gave a number later that d a y , he told
                           the media there were in fact two theories circulating as to
                           the cause of the disaster, the fa n s ' theory and the Policy
                           theory. the f a n s ' theory having been that the gate was opened
                           by the Police and the Police theory ,• as M r . Kelly told the
                           media and the world, the Police theory being that the fans had
                           forced the gate o p e n . Do you know"he had said that? - A, I
                           had no idea, s i r .

did not say I nad been asked for authority to open gates and I
had given it.

If you had given the impression that the cause of what had
haocened was of a gate being forced open at 3.15, you would
know that was not true? - A . 1 was asked for a quick
assessment of the situation.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I wonder, Officer, if you would
just answer the question. - A. I may nave misled Mr. Kelly.

     MR. KALLJPEIIS:        What you said was not true?               -     A.    Inthe
final assumption that        I had opened the gate, no.

What you said was not       true? - A. If I said- it. n o ,sir. it          was

                       (MORNING SESSION)



     MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir there are two farther calls on
the transcript that I handed in yesterday.  In fairness
to this Officer perhaps I should pat those to him as well


     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       That will only take you a
moment will it?

     MR. KALLIPETIS:     Yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Perhaps you would like to do
that now because I am going to interrupt the flow o£
evidence by something else which I will mention in a
moment.

            DAVID GODFREY DJCKSSFIELO recalled

         Further cross-examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

Mr. Duckenfield you recall that yesterday I handed you a
transcript of the tracks of: the tapes at SYMAS Head­
quarters.  - A. Yes sir.

And we went through the first call that came through from
Force Control.  -   A. Yes.

Do you still have that in front of you?         A. I have jus
got a copy.

You will see that on the fourth page there is a second
call at 15.08.13.  - A. Yes sir.

Also from Force Control - you will see the abbreviation
'F/C'.  - A. Yes.

And that was asking for ambulance to Leppings Lane end,
and then it says:

          "A big fleet of ambulances, immediately
          as many as you've got."

He is told there is one on its way:

          "We want more than one."
      §

                                    "Just hold on while we get the

                                    ambulance up there, w e 've got officers
                                    in the vicinity that can assess it
                 B                  foe ...

                        and then the tape is either indecioherable or cuts out.         —
                        A. Y e s .

                     Q. There is a third call over the page at 15.10.

                               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What page are you on now?

                             HR. KALLIPSTIS:      It is track 11.    It is the second
                        transcript sir:

                     Q. You see at 15.10.25:    Force Control:

                                    "Leppings Lane."

                 D                  "Hello love is Superintendent Clark
                                    there please."

                                    "Hold the line."

                        and it you turn over the page please you will see that the
                        call is transferred to Superintendent Clark at 15.1C.35.
                        The legend is 'Control':

                                    "Hello can I help you?"

                        Do you see that Mr. Duckenfield?     A. I have got "Just
  c                     to let you know ..... operation.." Is that the paragraph?

                     Q. Yes:

                                   "Just to let you know ...."

                        and then it is indecipherable I am told:

                                   "....operation....al1 the manpower
                                   from all over South Yor kshire....
                                   Leppings Lane."

                                   "OK.  Right we'll respond then thank
                                   you for your help."

                                   "Much obliged to you."

                       and that finishes at 15.1L.     -    A. Yes sir.

                            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you help about this
             H         Mr. Kallipetis.  I noticed in a report which I have seen



KL Harpham Ltd
                          3




from the Ambulance Service that there were two ambulances
there oefcre the matcn beg^n. 1=       r _c r._.

      MR. KALLIPETIS:         Mo sir, one was there.

      LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:           And one within a mile.

      MR. KALLIPETIS:         And one was on standby.

          LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:             We saw on the film that the
        Tohn's A m b u l a n c e single a m b u l a n c e comes on first and
it* seems to be quite a long time before one sees any^otne.
a-nb-ilpn'-e        What h a p p e n e d to the SYMAS a a o u U c s tna.
a c t u a l l y a t the g r o u n d ?   What h a p p e n e d to that, do you
know, in the early stages?
      MR K&T LIPETIS:    That stayed in situ according to
th<= olan to"act as the base for communications. _T' ^
Officers from that ambulance want to cne Lappings La, .
end to find out what was happening because t^'{,
sea ECO® where they were.        There wal ^.er. a -.all th.rou^
hv Roadouarters at 15.13 declaring t:iac v_ner= *<--• a major
                by that t i m s , 1 5 .1 3 , already ambulances has
arrived at Leppings Lana end in response to tie
call from the Police.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Am I under-ta.n^in 3 °occeccly
 that the ambulance that was on at the ground a» w• ~ •
 ambulanc0 on duty so to speak was not an operational
 ambu l a n c e , it was a communications ambulance *a= i-.

        y.R KALLIPETIS:    It is an operational ambulance sir
 Hnt-      vou will see from the plan the first amoulanc- on
 si^o d o e s not rush straight into the scene.  There has got
 ^■"bp an assessment of exactly what is required.     There
 a ? e JeverJl reasons for this, sir, which will oecoma
 a pparent.
          LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I don't want to              1
 •iust wanted to know why we had not seen u ac an eacLy
 s t a g - on the ground but I think you have explained u , and
 we will hear the evidence later.
       HR. KALLIPETIS:   You will hear why it is not a good
 iefea for the ambulances to go right on to the pi ten.

        lord   JUSTICE TAYLOR:        J/ery well, thank you.

       Now, Mr. Collins I understand that - of
  video that was shown last Friday as a compi
  about two and a bit hours out of many, many hour*                   .
  video.
                        MR. COLLINS:    Sir, that is right.

                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And I understand that there
                  ara parts of the remainder which have been looked at and
              B   which may be relevant, and it may be better that those
                  who are still going to cross-examine look at it before
                  they proceed.

                        MR. COLLINS:    I think so sir because bits may be
                   relevant to the Chief Superintendent's evidence because
                   they show the scene after the disaster had started.

                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    In that case it seems to be
   r-             sensible that we should do that now.   I understand there
                  are three ai;rerent sections, is that right?   One which is
                  photographed from the West Stand looking'dcwn towards the
                  pitch ....

                          MR. COLLINS:    Sir may I explain?  The first is
                  indeed that.     Ir is actually the unedited BBC film from
              D   that camera which is situated as I understand it in or
                  under the West Stand looking out towards the goal from
                  behind.     Parts oi: that are in the compilation but not all,
                  'The second is a compilation made after hours of difficult
                  work of a Police video camera from last year of the
                  Leppings Lane turnstiles showing the flows last year, and
                  indeed also of the state of the pens last year, and the
                  t i nrd , which I have not myself yet seen, I understand to
                  be six and a half minutes or so showing the zoom being
                  used on the opening of gate A, and the opening, I think
                  the first opening, of gate C.      That is my understanding.
                  I have not personally yet seen those two.
  O                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We know where the camera is
                  that shows gate C - that is the one on the extreme tip of
                  West Stand there,  Is that the same camera that can focus
                  on to gate A?

                       MR. COLLINS:    I think so.  Clearly the BBC contains
                  an hour's worth but I don't suggest that we look at the
                  whole of that period.   It is the period from three to four.
                  I would suggest that about the first fifteen to twenty
                  minutes is what we should see of that.   The last year
                  compilation is a total I think of about twenty five
                  minutes.  Again I don't suggest that it is necessary to
                  look at the whole of that, and we can look at the eariler
                  bit from the middle and a bit of the end perhaps to give us
                  a clear idea of what it is about-    The other as I say is
                  six and a half minutes and I think we can watch the whole
                  of that.

          H            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We will do that as soon as
                  that can be set up, and of course anybody who wants to see


larpham Ltd
                      5




more of it arrangements can be made.  I think it will take
about ten minutes to set this up but I think there is no
point m proceeding at t^ie mcrTient.

      MR. COLLINS: I think probably it would be desirable
to see it first because it may be there are matters which
will oe clarified and which will obviate the need for
cued tioning.

       Sir, I was just wondering what you were intending
about personnel.    It would seem desirable that anyone who
wishes to, who is here, if there is room should come and
particularly perhaps the witness and any Police Officers
w h o are about to give evidence.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   All these who are involved in
the Inquiry who are here may see it and as many of the
public as there is room for as well.  It will be in the
Mandela Room and it is being set up as soon as possible.

     MR. COLLINS:   Certainly I have seen two of them ana
I Know Mr. Glasgow has seen at least two of them.  We can
probably get some agreement as to which bits we can omit
and which bits we can show.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Does anybody else want to say
anything about this?

     MR. HYTNER:   Yes sir.  Just to fill the ten minutes
that we are waiting I want to make two points.  The first
is, which directly bears on this, my clients have
requested a view of the uncut videos, and obviously
relating to Leppings ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      All sixty nine hours?

     MR. HYTNER:   Not quite.  Only those relating to the
Leppings Lane terraces, and I think I ought to say that
the West Midlands Police and Mr. Collins 'nave agreed in
principal that that will be done, so those who wish, and
those who take medical advice as to whether they should,
will no douot in due course see that.

s u f f i c i e n t d e t a i l e d ins tru ct io ns to enable me to put
q u e s t i o n s and, secondly, I am not st all sure that
Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d st that stage was in charge.                       But, my
L o r d , can 1 -just indicate this and .put down a-marker
that so far is he was in charge at any specific period
i t . m a y be necessary, in due course for roe to ask him to
be r e - c a l l e d , o t he rwi se the qu es tio ns in due course can
be put to o th e r witnesses,
          L O R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:       Yes.   Well, not simply from
the p o i n t of view of pres sin g on with the Inquiry but
also b e c a u s e of fairness to witnesses, I would hope that
t r.s t c o u l d be a v o i o e d ,       Of course, there ere other
w i t n e s s e s end p e r hap s over the week end it would be
p o s s i b l e for i n s t r u c t i o n s to be complete.

          MR. H Y T N E R :   From the tenor of Hr. Duckin field 1s
e v i d e n c e , it s o u nds to me as though the questions ought
p r o p e r l y to be put to other w it ne ss e s in any event.

          HR. C O L L I N S : S i r , I wonder, perhaps to some extent
t n i n x i n g alo ud , but there is obviously, in relation to
what h a p p e n e d a ft erw ar ds, there must be s line to be
d r a w n for the p u r po se of your pr o ce edi ngs in this Inquiry
as to how far one goes into that aspect and, sir, I do
not k n o w w h e t h e r thought, perhaps, ought to be given
to that as Hr. Hyt ner has raised the point.

      LO R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR: 'Well, it arose the other
day w h e n Hr. H i c ks gave evidence.

       •HR. C O L L I N S :   Yes, indeed.
          LO R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:        And one knows, from what was
s a i d in e v i d e n c e , that so far as he came in contact with
the P o l i c e at a later stage, that is being separatel y
i n v e s t i g a t e d but ob v i o u s l y there must be aspects of the
o r g a n i s a t i o n w i t h i n an hour or two aft erwards which
are - s t i l l r e l e v a n t to this Inquiry.
          MR. C O L L I N S :    One enti rel y accepts that and I have
d e a l t w i t h that and cl e arl y the re ac tio n of the Pol ice
and, i n d e e d , the e me rg en c y servic es im m edi at ely     on the

                     L ORD    JUST I C E   TAYLOR:      Well,   I will    think    about   that,
    if          I may,        over    the weekend.

         MR. HYTNER:   I am grateful.   That                              is why    I tnoucht
    it was best to raise it at this stage.

                      HR.     WOODWARD:        May    I, sir?

                      LOR D    JUSTICE      TAYLOR:      Yes.

             MR. W O O D W A R D : Sir, the e n d e a v o u r of all those who
            her e to keep up With the evidence will be at t e m p t e d
          its full e s t and we will look at the videos but, sir,
    t h e r e may be a p r a c t i c a l prob l e m that does arise.      May
    I mention                  it,   sir?

                      L ORD    JUSTICE      TAYLOR:      Yes.

              MR. W O O D W A R D :      It is anticipated, plainly, that
    C o u n s e l for the Inquiry will be c-alling a c o n s i deraDle
          k!. of Po l i c e Officers.            Whilst the lawyers may

    t i » e s    o v e r the w e e k e n d to enable the matter to proceed,
    we c a n n o t make the same a s s u m p t i o n s in respect of
    t h o s e who may be c a l l e d to give evidence.

                 Sir     in order to ensure that fairness persists we
        w o u l d ask, if it can be accommodated, that copies s h ° “
        be p r o v i d e d of the videos to the Police Officers « o t
        they can be b r o u g h t and a r r a n g e d and it ensured tha

        L ORD   JUSTICE    TAYLOR:        Did you say       "copies"?

     MR. WOO D W A R D :      I do say "copies", sir, yes, because
the l o g i s t i c s of gett i n g ail t h s P 0 _ 2.cs u. fics.s c c s _.>£ ~
say on Mo n d a y or Tuesday or W e dnesday or w h e n e v e r to see
it may be impossible.

          MR. COLLINS:            Sir, my u n d e r s t a n d i n g is that once
th e r e exists a video in this form it is not too difficult
a task to make copies.                   I hope I am right in that
understanding.                 Of course we will supply Mr. W o o d w a r d ’s
clients            with a copy but we do        think perhaps that if they
w i s h to         make lots of s e p a r a t e copies it may be          a matter
that they sh o u l d deal with themselves rather than the
I n q u i r y p r o v i d i n g all the copies or West M i d l a n d s providing
all the copies because, as you appreciate, this inquiry is
p r o c e e d i n g - that is the Police inquiry - and there is
an awful lot still being done and one has to try to
c c n c e n t r s t s their effo r t s cn putting the e v i dence together
and a l t h o u g h I s y m p a t h i s e with Mr. Woodward, I do feel
perhaps            that if he wants a number of copies hecan make
them h i m s e l f off a copy to be p r o v i d e d .

          LOR D JUST I C E TAYLOR:       There are no objections ---
I t h i n k at one stage there were some probl e m s about
m a k i n g videos a v a i l a b l e generally.   Those have been
o v e r c o m e , have they?

          MR. COLLINS:             I am not aware of any problems.
I n s o f a r as there are any problems because they belong
to the BBC, the BBC as I unde r s t a n d it have been wholly
c o - o p e r a t i v e in r e l a t i o n to p r o v i s i o n and agreeing to
the p r o v i s i o n of m a t e r i a l for the p u r poses of the Inquiry,
p r o v i d e d , of course, it is for the p u r poses of the Inquiry
as this is.              So I do not anticipate any p r o b l e m from
that quar t e r but I will make quite sure there is none.
So far as the cl o s e d circ u i t is co n c e r n e d that, of
course, is a South Y o r k s h i r e Police video in any event.

         LORD   JUSTICE     TAYLOR:        Yes.

         MR. COLLINS:          A l t h o u g h it has been c o m p i l e d by
Wes t    M i d l a n d s so there is no p r o b l e m about that.

        L ORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:           There    it is, Mr.         Woodward.
 I s “that s a t i s f a c t o r y to you?

           MR. W O ODWARD :     Sir, it goes some way to a l l e v i a t i n g
 the p r o blem.       In f a i rness to the w itnesses, they all
 o u g h t to see as much of the m a t e r i a l as they can do
 b e f o r e they give evidence.

           LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:     Certainly.       I w o u l d hope -
 a f t e r all, we are t a l k i n g     about South Y o r k s h i r e O f f i c e r s
 and we are in S h e f f i e l d -       one w o u l d hope it w ould be
 p o s s i b l e for them to come        and see, two or t hree or four
 t o g e t h e r , perhaps, but if       you want to make copies it

s eems    reasonable       that   you ought    to be able      to make         your
own.

         MR. W O O D W A R D :   Sir, we have the       facility.             We
will     do that.           Thank you, sir.

          LORD J U S T I C E "TAYLOR:  Now, I think we might have
s u c c e e d e d in using up the time that was r e q u i r e d to set
up the film, or not?               No.  There are tec h n i c a l problems
I t h i n k w h i c h will just take a little time to sort out.
We c o u l d sho w this film now on the small video which would
only a llow a s mall number of people to see it.                  As I have
said, and I would adhere to it, that it sh o u l d be available
for a large n u m b e r of people to see it, it is going to
take about 20 m i n u t e s or so for people to come and deal
wit h it.           I don't know how long it will take them when
they get here, sc what I am tcld is that by about 11 o'clock
we s h o u l d be able to do this.

          N o w , is it g oing to be possible to proc e e d usefully
with c r o s s - e x a m i n a t i o n until then or does all cross-
e x a m i n a t i o n d e p e n d upon seeing the video first?    Hr.
G l a sgow, do you think ycu could proceed?                I will a d j c u m
if you think it is essential.

         MR.    GLASGOW:      No,   I do not,    sir.      May     I try?

         LORD    JUSTICE    TAYLOR:     Certainly.

          MR. G L A SGOW:   And if I get into an area where it is
t h o u g h t that I am putt i n g things that would be fairer to
the w i t n e s s if he saw the video, perhaps your or my learned
f riend Mr. W o o d w a r d would stop me.

        LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:      Very well,      let    us do         that
and    try and use the time.

                       Cross-Examined

Q. Mr. Duckenfield, as you know 1 appear on behalf of the Club.
   1 am concerned net to add to your embarrassment, but in view
   of the admissions you ~,ede yesterday, I would like to see
   what you now say about the Club's responsibility for what
   you called "crowd management".   Do you understand? - A. Yes.

Q. You will remember that on Wednesday afternoon you said very
   firmly to Mr. Collins in chief that you regarded the Club
   as being responsible for crowd management within the ground
   i n c l u d i n g the filling of the D e n s ? - A- Yes.

q . Would you now accent that the O D e n i n g of the gates, and I
    will put them in the plural if I may for the moment, that
        the opening of the gates without •warning anybody on the
        inside, whether or not that was tactically a correct decision
        its effect was to deprive anybody on the ins ce from their
        ability to manage the crowd that cane in? - A. My under­
        standing is that the Stewards should have been, in the
        location of the enclosure w i t h in addition Police Officers .
        in that location who were on public order duties end they
        should have accepted some responsibility in that area for
        their duties of crowd management and direction,

Q. Did you expect either your men or the Club's Stewards to
   be able to control or manage that crowd when it came through
   the gates if they w e r e n ’t told they were coming through the
   gates? - A. I would have expected that as the crowds came
   through the gates that the Stewards in the area would have
   assisted in direction of the fans away fron that tunnel.

q   .    Can 1 then take the two entries through the gates separately.
        The first as you now know was at    2.47? - A. Yes sir.

q   . And that as you now know was an unintentional, may I call
      it a bursting through because nobody intended that the
      crowd should come in, did they? - A. Yes sir.

Q. You saw that as it happened on the video? - A. Yes sir.

Q. And you were concerned at the time as to what the con­
   sequences of that might be? - A. Yes sir.

q   . Because you recognised that the whole object of the
      policing operation had been to control the crowd outside.
      You'nod? “ A- Yes sir.

Q.       And   to allow then; to be filtered through the turnstile
        system at a rate that the ground could safely consume? -
        A. Yes sir.

q   .       ^             _      that any breach of that system either
        deliberate;..or'.accidental'would potentially cause a very
                e a r l Aiic problem inside? ~ A, It could# yes sir.

Q. And since that possibility ;<was -in. your mi
   vi  J. tfeat as ~ach warning as possible be given to those



Q . why did you attempt to contact Mr, Locke? - A. I personally
    did not try and contact Mr. Locke, Superintendent Murray
    took that responsibility on himself.

Q, A." I right then in thinking that had Superintendent Murray
   not tried to do it, you would not personally have foreseen
   the need to contact anybody? - A. In my experience there,
   and it is difficult because it is with hindsight ....

Q. Forgive me being rude, could I ask for the answer first
   and then tell us what the reason for it is, if -hat does
   not sound rude? - A. On the cay in question 1 did not
   think of contacting Mr. Locke but Mr. Murray did.

Q . Would .you now like to explain why? Shy did you not think
    of it? - A. Because 1 was dealing with the incident as 1
    s aw i t .

Q . It
    ove

Q. That is very kind.  Who is the Chief Steward? - A. Mr. Locke.
   I am sorry, as I understand it it is Mr. Locke at Sheffield
   Wednesday who we liaise with,

Q. you thought that Douglas Locke, the retired Superintendent
   of Police, was the Chief Steward at this ground? - A. I
   understand that he is our contact and I thought he was
   a Chief Steward.

Q. who was responsible for the disposition of Stewards at
   the West End of this ground, who is actually in charge of
   them? - A. 1 cannot answer that question specifically.
   Do you mean from the Club's point- of view?

Q. Unspecifically. You always use that word and I don't know
   what it means in the context in which you use it. Give
   me any answer you like whether specific or general as to
   who was in charge of the Stewards at the «e?t «nd of tho
   ground or putting it bluntly .- - - A - A representative
   of Sheffield Wednesday Footbal1 Club.



Q. Putting it again bluntly, Chief Superintendent, you shou
   have known, shouldn't you, who was actually in charge of

         the stewards at various points in the ground? - A. On;' a .
         personal level, sir, ;it .is. my view -that I die not n e e d ’.to,
         know who was in .change.'""

    Q. Where physically was Mr. Locke? - A.        1 don't knew sir. •

    Q. Die. you know where-the Club's Control Box was, physically?
B      - A, Inside the main entrance of the South Stand sir.

    Q. Looking at the model we have got if we could have assistance,
       it is behind the p l ay er ’s tunnel? - A. Yes.

    Q . In- the back there? - A. Yes sir.

    Q . New i know you did not think it was necessary to contact
        Mr. Locke at all, but I have to ask you the question:     what
        did you think he was going to do if you had cot him on the
        radio or if any of your Officers had cot hi~ on the radio? j
        - A. I can only surmise what Superintendent Murray intended 'I
        to do and that would be to iniorrr. hir. that we intended to
        open the c a t e s .

    Q.   But Chief Superintendent, why on earth didn't you siraply
D        use the radio which you had been given to contact the
         Steward in the West Stand who was responsible for the
         Stewards in that area? - A. I d o n ’t know the technicalities
         cf the Sheffield Kednesday radio system and Mr. Murray
         took on that responsibility to contact Mr. Locke from the
         personal radio, cn the Sheffield Wednesday personal radio.

    Q. You say he took on that responsibility,       Might it not be
       fairer, to., .him to say that he realised that -something; fairly
       disastrous was going to happen if that cate was -opened and/;?.
                           on the:'inside that it was going to be        r
                  That is more fair to the Superintendent, isn't
       it? - A. Yes sir, he took a course of action.

    Q . V.’l.t
        was w e n
        he "'took .an independent course of action which i agreed        :
        wxth.

    Q. Subsequently? - A. But I would not disagree with it.

    Q. Despite the fact that it was plainly wrong.          Would you
       accept that? - A. What was wrong?

    Q.   To contact the man buried in the South Stand instead of
         contacting the man who was in charge of the Stewards whom
         you were seeking to co-operate/with? - A. I disagree,
         it is my view that the correct course of action would
         be to contact the man who was responsible for the Stewards

    Q.                    ’ICE TAYLOR: ..-Would.,it. have been, pc
H        f o r 'you        M,     +.« conununicate direct with those

Q.    1 am referring -fro any means.        - A. Oh.        Yes,

O . It would have been possible, would it, to have got in touch
    with either an Inspector or with the steward in charge in the,
    concourse? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q. W c i i , why not d o it? - A. Because it was nor done, my Lord.
   It didn't cross my mind.

O. Forgive me, Mr. Duckenfield. I understand you have properly
   said that it was an oversight on your part not to have tried .
   to do something of that kind, but that Mr. Murray did think
   of doing something., namely getting in touch with Mr. Locke.
   Is that right? - A. Yes, sir.

Q . In your        presence? - A. Y e s , my L o r d .

0. But he failed to get in touch w i t h Mr. Locke, coul dn’t get
   through,   b u t you then had been alerted to the idea of getting

Q. Ah.   A . The sequence of events is rapidly changing, and
   people are taking courses of action, and Mr. Murray, knowing
   the situation, took it upon himself to speak w i t h Mr. Locke.

Q. But you did not realise at the time he was doing'that? - A.
   No', isy Lord .

Q.    I see.

Q .          MR. G L ASG OW : And s o far as you were concerned, Chief
      Superintendent, the gates were being o p e n e d , a n d more
      importantly, the decision or the consideration to the opening
      of those gates was going on without you believing t h a t anybody
      on t h e inside was being w a r n e d ? - A. No, sir, only if they
      picked up the information on the talk-through system.

Q. Yes.   The whole r e a s o n .for- the club providing you with their
   own radios was so that you in the Police control box could
   direct stewards if necessary as well as Police Officers, was
            - A. Sir, you will have to ask Mr. Mole for the
   reasons.   I am aware that we had a radio.              '        "

              A
                            Chief Superintendent Mole, that the club has co-operated to
                            the extent of vast expense in providing every single facility
                            that the Police has asked of it, is not it? - A. Hr. Mole
                            agrees with the co-operation, sir.

                       G. It is right they have provided probably the best and most
                           expensive surveillance system in the country in the ground
               B         ' for the Police use? - A, It is an excellent system,

                       G. Exclusively at their expense? - A. 1 d o n ’t know about that,
                          sir.

                       G,   It is right that they provide not only the radio link within
                            the ground but that they provide you with the equipment so
                            that you can break into that radio link and contact their own /
               €
                            stewards directly?   That is right? - A. 1 d i d n ’t leftow that,
                            sir, but I will accept it if it is correct.

                       G.    You d i d n ’t even know that the Police control box had the                   ;

                            A. No, sir.

                       G. You at least knew they handed over exclusive control of the
               D          Tanncy system, did you not? - A. Yes, sir, for emergency
                          purposes.

                       G. And you knew that that Tannoy system was checked every single
                          game to the satisfaction of the Police? - A. Yes, sir.

                       q   . And despite the understandable criticisms which havebeen made
                             of it in this crisis that occurred, would you agree with me it
                   E         is in fact probably one of the best Tannoy systems in any
                             football ground in the country? - A. 1 can only speak of two,
                             sir, at the moment, and it is a very good system.
  o
                       G.   It is a very good system.   Can you think of anything else that
                            the club could have done, whether by way of manpower or
                            financial, expense which would have better co-operated with the
                            Police than what they did do? - A. No, sir.
                   F
                       O. On top of that, lest there be any misconception in anybody’s
                          minds as to the extent to which the club simply exploited or
                          took advantage of Police Officers to do their jobs, they
                          actually paid something like £50-, 000 to the Police to actually
                          provide the men every time they came to a match as big as
                          this, did not they? - A. You are talking about payment for the
                          resource?
                   G
                       Q.   Yes, the actual paying for the Police? - A. Yes, they would
                            pay for them, yes, sir.

                                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That is something that has been
                            established they have to do.

                           coming into the ground you in effect not only failed to take
                           advantage of all those facilities that had been made
                           available to you but you deprived the club of the
                           ability to co-operate in controlling the fans when
                           they case in.  Is not that fair?

              B                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   1 d i d n ’t follow the question.                           My
                           fault.  I lost the beginning of i t .

                                   MR. GLASGOW:          It is probably mine,           sir;

                  G. There are two parts to it, Chief Superintendent.  1 will put
                     them separately.  If you decide simply to open a gats and let
                     the crowd in en bloc you are overriding all the control
                     systems that have been set up and agreed upon? - A. Yes. sir.

                  G. And if you dc that without giving anybody warning either on
                     the telephone, on the radio or by word of m o u t h . you are also
                     overriding and ignoring all the communication systems which
                     have been set up? - A . I think the point he is mak in g , s i r , is
                     t h i s . I was attempting to save life and serious injury, and
                     in my consideration of saving life and serious injury I
              D      decided to open those g a t e s . The other .consequences at that
                     t i m e . whilst they were t h e r e , were not the prime


                  Q    .   Let me make it absolutely plain that I accept you acted in
                           good faith on the spur of the moment and that
                           which you made was a bona fide and perfectly honourable o n e ,
                           but you accept that it was a r.istake, do yc-u net? - a. -hat
                           are you saying was a mistake?

                  Q.       Not to tell people what you were doing? - A, Attempts were
                           made to tell people what we were doing.  In the crisis of the
                           moment the prime consideration was the saving of life and
                           serious injury, and than was a prime consideration.

                  O.       Chief Superintendent, I have accepted up to that: stage all

                           question yesterday. - A. Can you just clarify that? What did
                           I accept was a mistake?

                  Q. Opening the gate without warning anybody on the inside that
                     you were going to do so? - A, I think with hindsight....

                  G.       I see. - A. Pith hindsight 1 would say that that was a
                           mistake.  The point is that.at the time I had other

                               serial 20 behind gate A. forming a funnel.                      *

                            O. Were there two serials of Officers inside gate C who on their
                               own initiative could have formed up a cordon so as to control
                        E      the crowd as it entered? - A. Serials 14 and IS, sir.

                            O. Putting it bluntly again, you expected the Officers in the
                               concourse, of their own volition, to line up and form the
     O              -
                               cordon at gate C as they had done at gate A? - A. I did not
                               ssy gate C, sir.  I would say I expected them to take a course
                               of action which may assist when gate C was opened.

                        F   0. Without orders? - A. Without orders, sir.         If we had the time
                               to issue the instruction, but we did not.

                            O . Do you know when gate A was opened? - A. Somewhere in the
                                region of after the order for the gates to be opened, it was
                                after that, and I would think it must have been about 2.55.

                            Q . Yes.- I can tell you there is no secret about it, because this
                        G       we shall see on the video you are going to watch and can
                                be checked. That gate was in fact opened at 2.58, but that
                                means some 6 minutes after gate C had been opened? - A. Yes,
                                sir.

                            Q. Now, if you are right in saying that the order which you gave
                               was "Open the gates", it would appear that somebody thought
                               fit to delay for over 5 minutes before complying with that
          ■         H          order in respect of one of those gates? - a. yes, sir.

0 . Why do you think, that was done? - A. I have no idea, sir.             The
    instruction I gave was, "Open the g a t e s ” ,

Q. And did you not even know whether that instruction was being
   complied with? - A. Superintendent Murray gave the instruction
   over the personal radio to open the gazes.

G . Did you not know whether or not your order was being complied
    with? - A. I could only see on the video gate C,

G.   Would it surprise you to know       that one of the Officers under
     your immediate command in the      control box was sufficiently
     concerned to zoom in on gate       A, or did you not know that: the
     zoom was used at all? - A. I       d i d n ’t know that, sir.

Q„. But. if it is right, as we shall see that the 2 0 0 m was used in
    respect of both g a t e s , does that not show at least somebody in
    your immediate command and physical presence in the control
    cox was concerned to sou precisely wrat was happening       at tnose
    two gates? - A, Yes. sir.

G . That would be the reason for zooming in on them? - A. Yes.


Q.    A n d . Chief Superintendent, are you really saying that standing
     behind the men who were controlling those cameras and those
     screens you did net realise what they were doing, and d i d n ’t
     even see the results of what they were doing on the video
     screens displayed above you? - A. The activity in that control
     rocs at lO-to-3 or thereabouts on the 15th April was
     c o n s id er ao le , 1 have 7 monitors to watch, tne crowd scene and
     c>ther situations, and I did not keep a constant watch on every
     single screen.

G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Mr. Duckenfi e l d , I wonder if I can
     clarify s om e t h i n g . I think you have agreed with counsel that
     when gate A was opened,' without any instruction from you there
     were two serials had been put in position to receive them? -A.
     my Lord, I am aware of one, Serial 20.

G.    Yes, but Iunderstood yesterday that you did say  that when
     somebody in the control room said that gate A was going to go
     in anyway unless it was opened, Sergeant Higgins i think you
     said? - A. Yes, my t © r d .

G . You instructed that every available Gfficer should attend in
    two p l a c e s . One of them was in the North Stand to control the
    landings there for these people that were coming i n , and the
    other was on the perimeter? - A . Y e s , my L o r d .

G. W e l l , what I   was wondering is this : Why you thought it
   necessary to       give an instruction to warn people to control the
   crowd coining      through gate A into the North St a n d , but not the
   crowd coming       in through gate C? -A. It was the time factor, my
   Lord.

Q.   I am wondering - I would like you to deal with it - I am

                                      wondering t h i s . In the North Stand there are individual
                                      seats? - A, Yes, my Lord.

                                 Q.    And I suppose if s lot of people cose in there who are not the
                                      se-: holders there can be trouble? - A,   Very much sc.

But am I to understand that so Ear as the gate C and the
terraces are concerned your view was sin-.cly as it had
always been, that it was up to the Eans to*level
themselves oat because nobody had a particular place?
- A. Yes my Lord.   But behind gate C there is a safety
area.  Benind gace C theee is an arsa of sace ty crtoc to
the terrace.

You would not expect people wanting to go to the match to
remain there would you?  - A. No my Lord.


question tnat I was going to ash about that s i n d s
with respect to what my Lord has put to yco,         teaa j
c'.n-r. does Iffioottant to have what" my."learned friend
Ifr. Collins called a 'reception cormrdttes' at gate
                “  A . Yss

Because m gate A, as we can sea from the plan, those
coming tnrougn wars already channelled in one direction in
a relatively tight corridor.  - A. Yes.


Wheraas at gate C they ware simply going to soill into the
concoar.se ana unlsss controlled go straioht down the rs.
    h. Y 35 sir.

When the first - again 1 use the word "illicit”, the
bursting through entry at 2.4?  occurred,you have already
told the Inquiry that you ware concerned as to what the
consequences of that might be.  - A . Yes sir.

You had two means ot checking your concern.    One was to
loo* fit the video wnich was showing the entry through that
gate, would you agree?    - A. Yes sir.

The second was to do the rather more old fashioned and
less sophisticatad thing of looking out of the window into
the stand.  -   h. Yes.

Did you   do neither?   - A. I looked at both       sir.

And whan you looked out of the window, down      into the stand
a-s we see in the last photograph of the bundle, did you
not sea the impact that that small, relatively small, crowd
had on pens 3 and 4 when it came through the tunnel just
after 2.47?   - A. No sir.   1 d o n 11 recall any impact.

You didn't notice any effect on the crowd of the men
coming through the tunnel at 2.47? - A, My specific
recollection is that I didn't notice a distinct
difference.
                                   D.   G.   D U C KE MF I E L D




Let us look at the vidao because you say you looked at the
video as well.  If you did look at the vidao at 2.4? how
on sarch do ycu think you have forgcccen the fact that its
operator had zoomed up close on that gate to sea what was
going on?  - A. Sir I don't recall accurately where the
camera was tracking at a particular moment in"time.

But you did sea and look at the way in which the crowd
entered at 2.47 and what I keep calling the 'illicit'
entry.  - A. Yes sir.

And did you sea that although it has been very fairly said
that the tans walked in in an orderly fashion*at the"
a a cone entry wnen tne cates ware flung wide, a l a m e number
oc them ran through whan the gate was opened the first
time.    Did you notice chat?  - A. You are saying that a
large number ran through on the first ....

Yes , than t'nera ware a large number to be seen running on
the v i d e o . Than is what I am suggesting. -  h. Yes
there was a crowd rushing in.

Rushing you would use.     - A. On the first one, on the
occasion wnen tne P e n e s horse recovered the situation.

D ig you actually see tnat one or two or possibly three men
fell to the around    en that rush cane in?  - A. I cor. 1t
recall that sir.

Have you not seen that on the video, that there is what
looks like a scuffle and there is at least one, and
probably two, and possibly three men falling to the ground
in front o£ that crowd?  Did you not notice?  - A. No
sir.- I will accept that if you say that,           • '

By the time that crowd, in your word, rushed in vou had
already become concerned at the way in which the crowd
already in pens 3 and 4 were distributing themselves were
you not?  - A. It was filling sir.

N o , you were already concerned at the way in which they
were distributing themselves.       A. I had not iced earIier
that the central two pens were filling more so than the
wings.

Were you concerned about the way in which the crowd in
pens 3 and 4 were distributing themselves?     A. 1 was
aware the pens were filling sir, but had not got to the
point ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Hr. Duckenfield I think it is
a very simple question, I don't know that the answer may
be simple but that is the question and I wonder if you

     would please try and answer the question.       -   A.   I w a s n '-
     conc er ned .

0- You we r a n 1t concerned?    -   a. Not at that stage.

Q.        MR. G L A S G O W ; I thought that you told the Inquiry
     yesterday that ycu had - one of the few orders you "did’
     give - you personally had ordered a tannoy message broad­
     cast to those specific fans to distribute themselves more
     sensibly.    - A. That was much earlier sir.

Q.   Kcw much earlier?      - A. 1 think on reflection, remember­
     ing from my st at e m e n t , somewhere in the region of 2,30.

Q.   Sc some quarter-of-an-hour earlier cr 20 -inutss?          -
     Yes .


     A. Yes sir.*

Q.   And when you had that announcement made had the crowd in
     fact cic tr icctec itselt m the way ir. which you wan ted
     thee, to?   - A. 1 didn't monitor exact movements but there
     had been movement across the terrace.

Q. Had the crowd distributed itselc in       the way in which you
   wanted thee tr?  Sere ycu satisfied       with the aiccation
   which you could see in front of you       in pens ....  - A. I
   was satisfied with the situation as       I saw it,

Q. Obviously I as only asking about what you saw Chief
   Superintendent.  You are seriously saying that the view of
   the crowd building up -in pens 3 and 4 between half-past-2
   and quarter-to-3 was satisfactory in your view?   - a. Yes
   sir,

Q. Knowing as you did that there wasn't a single Police
   Orticer in tnat pen even at the- gates at the rear?                A. >
   Yes sir,                "

Q. You knew that, and you knew, like Chief Superintendent
   Mole, that no Sheffield Wednesday stewards wouId be there.
   - A. At the back of the pens?

Q. Yes,- -    A. Yes sit,

Q. And therefore, like Chief Superintendent Mole, you were
   relying upon the good sense of that crowd to distribute
   themselves evenly, or in Chief Superintendent Mole's
   words, to ease out to the outer pens.  - A. Yes sir.

Q. And you ate seriously saying to the Inquiry that from what
   you saw with your own eyes looking down on those pens they

Q. You actually went to the boardroom of the Club, because
   .they wanted to be told what was going on or. their around,
   didn't: you?  - A. Yes sir.

   who wars extremely concerned, you would agree?  - a. Yes
   sir.

Q. - Did you think about the consauences for the Club and its
    officers, that people might very reasonably write stories
    about the irresponsible behaviour of the Club stewards?
    Did you think of that?    - A, No sir, but at that time I
    had many things on ray mind, not the least of which was a
    disaster , ana it was 3. very tranic , very serious
    situation, and I was acting m what I thought was the best
    interests.

Q. Did you tell the Assistant Chief Constable the truth?                  -
   A. Yes sir.

Q. You told Mr. Jackson?  - A. Not until - it is difficult
   to say at what time, but I certainly spoke to him about

                                   _ MR. JACKSON: Sir, we indicated at the outset that
                             ray learned friend Mr. Hytner and I would not ask the same
                             questions but it is quite apparent that, those questions
                             asked by Mr. Hytner in fact covered the virtual entire
                             remit of matters I would have put to the Police Officers
                             in this case.

                                   May I associate myself with the questions and parti­
                             cularly accept the apology and observations made by the
                    H        Chief Superintendent.

          goes* out to them.      1 cannot say enough on tnat

    Q.    You have given evidence b e f o r e _the Inquiry according to
          your recollections? - A, Yes sir.

    °* o^her plople their recollections and their uncerstandxngs
       of*time, have you experienced any surprise or pe^p-e—    •
       - A. Yes sir.
    Q. in what and how in general has that been? - A. I h«v« «

       found with video tape a n d _information since chat my

                               d ^ o u Snders^anS that I t is out of synchronisation
           with what others recall? - A- Yes sir.

        Q . And is inconsistent in some respects with what others
            state? ~ A> Yes sir.
                                33         D.G. DUCKENFIELD


    Q.   For example you have told the Inquiry that you recall a
         message to the supporters in the West End terrace to move
         forward to allow others to come in? - A. Yes sir.

    Q.   Do you remember at what time that was given? - A. No sir.

    Q. Does it surprise you that there is evidence that that
B      indication was given some time between 2 o'clock and 2.15?
       - A. I am surprised sir.

    Q.   What was your impression of when that happened.  What is your
         impression of when that was given? Not what others tell
         you, but what is your persisting impression of when that
         happened? - A. I would have thought that might be later,
         sir.

    Q. According to evidence, another example, there is indication
       thac a request came iro^i ?ir• iic^roij.c.11 to cioow
       Lar.e. Do ycu have a clear impression, your own impression
       of when that occurred? - A. Yes sir, my perception was that
       it was about half-past-2 and the thing that sticks in my
       mine is the bus that went past and I wondered why he wan tec
       it closed.  I related that to 2.30.
D
    Q.   Are you aware in fact that there is evidence that that
         was given or will be evidence that that request occurred
         at about 2.17? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. How does that information and the knowledge cf that other
       evidence equate with your recollection.  Khat is your
       response to that? - A. I am surprised sir.
E
    Q. Another example, I d o n ’t intend to go through them all
       because the evidence will in due course be put before
       the Inquiry.  You will recall an endeavour by Mr. Hurray
       who was in the Control Box to communicate with Mr. Locke?
       - A. Yes sir.

    Q. What is your recollection of what it was that Hr. Murray
       was trying to say? - A. I can't remember sir what he was
       trying to say.

    Q. Yesterday an impression may have been received from your
       evidence that Mr. Murray was trying to tell Mr. Locke
       that the gates were going to be opened? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. Would you just like to think about it   for a moment and
       doing the best you can please try and   help us what your
       recollection is, or what it was that    Mr. Murray was saying,
       if you heard it? - A. I did not hear    it, sir.

    Q. So when you gave your understanding yesterday of what it
       was, what were you drawing upon in order to answer those
       questions? - A. An impression based on five weeks ago, sir.

                           o      You see Mr Murray did indeed endeavour tocontact Mr. Locke
                               I T , it w a s "not c o n c e r n i n g the words : ^ h e gates are go ng

                               - A. Yes sir.
                           O   If that is the case and that turns out to be the evidence,
                               how does that accord with your impression o_ wna    -
                      B        haooening at the time? - A. It would appear that I was
                               confused on the occasion, sir.

                           Q. May I ask you about the Control Room in which you were? -
                               A .* Yes sir.
                           o    We have seen the photographs of it, at the back of J*<est

                     rightly or wrongly, what is your understanding of them? - A.
                     More than one person can try and-communicate at once, and if
                     they do so difficulties occur with the messages becoming

 ; c r o w d was bui l d i n g , s o m e w h e r e a p p r o a c h i n g    2.45,    3 o'clock.

Q.   Did    you   also    call     fcr a mo b i l e     to go?         A.      I did.

     Lendrover made at your i n i t i a t i v e or did anybody else
     want it?     A.        No, my Lord, the s i t u a t i o n was that I
     was in the p r o c e s s of t h i nking about and requesting
     a Felice t r a f f i c mobile and s i m u l t a n e o u s l y the request
     ca^.e in fcr the Landrover.

Q.   From?   A.          From    someone       on the     ground      at the    Leppings
     Lane end.

Q.   S g it was a c t u a l l y from outside              the t urnstiles that the

     for it or s o m e o n e else r e s p o n d e d to that initiative?
     A.      Some o n e else would have r e s p o n d e d to the Landrover
     in i t i ative, sir.          I caused action to be taken for the
     traffic car.

Q.    This may be a p oint which p e r h a p s c o u l d be of assistance
      for the future.              It would seem, if the evidence is
      right that there was a public address system upon a Landrover
      b e i n g employed, that if there were tannoy broadcasts to the
      fans at L e p p i n g s Lane and they were not aware of that,
      that some t h o u g h t should be given to imp r o v i n g the means,

                       Cross-Examined bv MR. DYS6&

Q. Mr. Duckenfield,   I would like to take you back, please, to
   the control room at about 3.15 or thereabouts.   Do you
   remember that amongst the visitors you received at about that
   time there were Mr. Graham Kelly and Mr. Glen Curtain of the
   FA.  Do you remember them coming? - A. I certainly remember
   Mr. Kelly, and if you say there was another gentleman with him
   I will accept that.

Q. And together with Mr. Mackrell, the secretary of Sheffield
   Wednesday Club.  Do you remember him coming as well? - A. I
   remember Mr. Kelly and Mr. Mackrell.

Q. And they were anxious to know what was going on, and in
 - particular what you were proposing to do about it and whether
   you were proposing to abandon the game.  Do you remember that?
   - A. Yes, sir.

G. And I think you told them, did not you, it was going to be
   necessary to abandon the game but you did not want that
   decision to be disseminated just yet for the reasons you have
   explained this morning? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Do you remember also telling those gentlemen that the problem
   had been created by a gate, the gate being forced open by the
   fans? - A. I may have said that, sir, referring to the first
   gate, because I thought there was a gate that had opened at
   first.

Q.' By the first gate,- you mean gate C? - A. Yes.

Q . Are you referring to., the first time gate C opened? - A. Let me
    take you back to the conversation.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Where is the conversation? - A .     In
        the Police control box.                              .....

Q.           MR.. DYSON: - I n the Police control room, about 3 .15   A.
        Mr. Kelly came' in,- and I was asked what had happened.   The
        specific conversation I cannot remember, but I may have been
        loath to tell him exactly what the situation was at that
        point .

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What aspect of it? What had
        happened, or causation? - A. What had happened, my Lord.  The
        blunt truth that we had been asked to open a gate and that we
        had opened a gate.   I was not being deceitful. It was just a
        case of at that situation we were all still in a state of
        shock, one might say.

q   .       MR. DYSON:   So you accept you did not tell him the truth
        at that stage, that the gate had been opened as a result of
        your instruction? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You accept that, and you accept that you may have' said that
   the gate had been forced open by the fans? - A. I may have

                          referred to the first one, sir, yes.

                       Q. When you say "the first one” , what do you mean? - A. The first
                          gate I believed at that time had been forced open, gate C.
                          If you look at ray statement ray interpretation was when the
                          first request for the gates to be opened I said in ray said,
                          "Why do you want the gate open because it is burst open
                  B       already?".

                          iou   are referring to the first request? - A. Yes.

                       Q. But that gate was shut very smartly, was not it? - A. Yes,
                          sir.

                       0. And you knew perfectly well that it was not the influx of fans
                          as a result of that opening which had caused the problem, did
                          not you?-- A. Yes. that was not the major opening.

                       0. And you knew the real cause of the problem and the casualties
                          was the second opening? - A. yes, sir, that was the
                          possibility.

                       0. You see, I put these questions to you because Mr. Curtain and
                  D        Mr.   Kelly are quite clear   that they were told. Mr.Curtain is
                           clear that it was you who     said it, and    Mr. Kelly isnot
                           certain whether it was you or one of your colleagues.     At all
                           events, they are both quite certain they were told by the
                         ' Police in the control room that the casualties had been ./paused
                           by the gate being forced open by the fans?. - ' A. I wouldT|o as.

                       Q. Why were you being so coy about telling them what had
                          happened? - A.. The reality of the situation is that shortly
   f    2 ^
                          after the events had occurred many people were in a state of
                          shock, and I thought it-'correct to collect^ny thoughts and to

 {5 Av$ ^ v            Q. Did you know that subsequently and as a result of what you had
                          said to Mr. Kelly that Mr. Kelly when he gave interviews to
                          the media, of which he gave a number later that day, he told
                          the media there were in fact two theories circulating as to
                          the cause of the disaster, the f a n s ’ theory and the Policy
                          theory, the.fans' theory having been that the gate was opened
                          by the Police and the Police theory, as Mr. Kelly told the
                          media and the world, the Police theory being that the fans had
                          forced the gate open.  Do you know"he had said that? - A. I
                          had no idea, sir.

                       Q. Thank you very much.

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. KALLIPETIS:

Q. Mr. Duckenfield, following on from that, as I understand it at
   about quarter-past-3 ;you say you may have given the
   impression to Mr. Kelly that the cause of what had
   happened was a gate being forced open? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. Am I also right that at that time you knew that was not true?
   - A. In the overall picture a gate had been forced open.  Let
   me say this, my initial perception that was accurate, but I
   did not say I had been asked for authority to open gates and I
   had given it.

Q. If you had given the impression that the cause of what had
   happened was of a gate being forced open at 3.15, you would
   know that was not true? - A. I was asked for a quick
   assessment of the situation.

G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I wonder, Officer, if ycu would
     just answer the question. - A. I may have misled Mr. Kelly:

q         MR. KALLIPETIS:   What you said was not true? - A. In the
     final assumption that I had opened the gate. no.

Q. What you said was not true? - A. If I said- it. no, sir. it was
   not.

Q. In your'statement at the bottom of page 7 you refer to C gate
   being burst open, and at the top of page -8 you s a y :

                tiut at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved ;the
          situation and closed the gate".

     That is right,   is not it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you';speak to Mr. Kelly before or after-you declared a.
  ' major ‘incident? .- A.: I think it was. after; .sir..,                     :

Q.   Would you turn to page   12 in your statement,    please.-'

          "The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr. Jackson
          joined me in the Control Box and asked for an
          appraisal...."

     Is that right? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You told him at that stage:

          ”1 was unable to give an accurate account of what the
          situation was other than a possible pitch invasion....”

     - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You then go on to say that Mr. Jackson went to the pitch:

                          "Not at the moment, not at the
                          moment. "

                and then  there is a delay.  There is a pause on the line
                you will hear and then the caller continues:
           B
                          "We are requesting a fleet of
                          ambulances.  All ambulances that
                          are available to Hillsborough
                          please. "

                   A. Yes sir.

           QC              "So you have got quite a few
                           injuries then?"

                          "A lot of them.  Apparently at one
                          of the gates they have been pushing,
                          pushing ana shoving.  I understand
                          that one of the gates has collapsed
                          or broke."
           D
                Now can you explain how Snig Hill Force Control were
                passing that message through to SYMAS, which happens to be
                the same untruth that you told Mr. Kelly at 15. "l5. - A.
                I d o n 1c see as the second one is a completely untruth,
                we have a crisis situation, a very difficult situation,
                ana the Controller was -passing messages as quickly as I
                was firing to him.
           E
       Q.       Are you saying that you.supplied an untrue message to one
                of your Officers to pass on to Force Control? ■ -  -A. I
                wouldn't have passed on an untrue message.  The message
                would have gone from the Control Box from the Officer as'
                he perceived the situation. .                      :      ....

                moment beca-use a few minutes ago Mr. Kallipetis did ask
                you what information you gave to Police Constable
                Bichard, and then I think we got slightly sidetracked
                into something else.     Are you able to tell the Inquiry
                what you did tell Mr. Bichard to convey?     - A. Only in
                general terms that we would require ambulances my Lord.

           - A. I~was giving instructions on many things at^tnaL time.
           It"was a moment of crisis and a very tense situation a n d
           was trying to run an operation and as has oeen evidenceo
           I was being interrupted and pressed by various peop_e wno

       were easing themselves out satisfactorily between halC-
       past-2 and a quarter-to-3? - A. Yes sir.

 Q. You realised of course that the Club's control in the
    bowelo of the &outh Stand did not give them any video
    pictures of that stand, didn't you? -    a . Yes sir

 Q. And so if you had been concerned, and I accept that you
    say you were not, but that if you had been concerned the
    Club control would only know of that if you either 'phoned
    them or radioed them? - A. Yes sir.

 Q.    Did you know that in addition to the radio there was a
       direct land-line telephone between the Police Control Box
       and the Club Box? - A. Yes sir.

 Q. And so that any difficulty in getting through on the radio
    could immediately, instantaneously, be solved by pipkins
    up a telephone with a direct link? - A. Yes sirT ~

Q. If anyoody, any of your Officers, was seriously concerned
   to contact Mr. Locke, or the Police Liaison Officer in the
   Club Box at any time, the most obvious thing to do would
   be to pick the 'phone up wouldn't it? - a . Yes sir.

Q.     And would we be right in supposing that the only reason
      why abortive attempts were made to use theClub's radio
      was because you simply didn't know where Mr. Locke was
      stationed on that day? - A. I didn't know sir.

Q. Because if you or Superintendent Murray had known that he
   wao where he ought to have been, with respect, in the
   Control Room, you would have used the telephone’ - a
   Yes sir., .                                  ;       v

Q.    Finally, Chief Superintendent, may I come to the account
      which you gave of this incident after it had occurred
      because I am concerned with the effect that that has had
      on my clients as well as others.  It is right to say isn'c
      it that when you decided to withhold the information that
      the decision to let people into the grouned had been a
      Police one, you withheld that information from everybody on
      the afternoon in question. - a . yes sir.
Q.    For my part I can accept that the initial embarrassment, if
      you like, to say something to Mr. Kelly may have been done
      on the spur of the moment, you persisted in that deceotion
      throughout the afternoon. - A. There was good reason sir
      not to tell the crowd what had occurred.

Q. Was there good reason not to tell my clients, the officers
   of the Club? — A. I felt so sir at the time.

Q. You actually went to the boardroom of the Club, because
   they wanted to be told what was going on on their ground,
   didn't you? - A. Yes sir.                 -

Q. And when you went to the boardroom and saw the directors,
   who were extremely concerned, you would agree? - A. Yes
   sir.

Q. You didn't think: it right even to tell them within the
   confines of the boardroom, as the officers of the Club,
   that the disaster had been what you regarded as an
   unforeseeable consequence of a Police decision? - A. No
   sir.

Q. Did you realise, or did you even consider, that the
   possibility of that deception would lead to very unfair
   stories being circulated about the Club officers as wall
   as Police Officers the following day? - A. Sir at that
   time I acted in good faith.

Q.    Yes, but    didyou consider the possible consequences for
     others? Let us look at them. Did you think about what
     people might write and say about Superintendent Marshall?
         A. At that time sir ....

Q.    Well did   youthink or not?   -A. I didn't think of    the
     consequences.

Q. Did you think about the consquences for the Club and its
   officers, that people might very reasonably write stories
   about the irresponsible behaviour of the Club stewards?
   Did you think of that? - A. No sir, but at that time I
   had many things on my mind, not the least of which was a
   disaster, and it was a very tragic, very serious
   situation, and I was acting in what I thought was the best
   interests.

Q. Did you tell the Assistant Chief Constable the truth?
   A. Yes sir.

Q. You told Mr. Jackson? - A. Not until - it is difficult
   to say at what time, but I certainly spoke to him about
   it.

Q. He came to the Control Box in his civilian clothes       because
   he was obviously concerned as soon as the invasion       first
   started.  I'm sorry, that is a silly word to use.        As soon
   as the perimeter fence was first climbed over. -         A. Yes
   sir.

Q. At that stage of course you already knew what the cause
   had been. - A. Yas sir.
                                                      D. G. DUCKENFIELD




                Q. Was thera any conceivable reason for withholding that
                   information from the Assistant Chief Constable? - A. I
                   am not sure when he first came in he knew the full
                   circumstances sir.

                Q.   Well Mr.Duckenfield let me help you. He went with you to
                     the boardroom to see the directors, and he stood by in
                     that boardroom unaware of the fact that you were not
                     telling my clients the truth, didn't he? - A. Yes sir.

                Q.   And you, when giving the account to them of what happened,
                     realised that the deception which was being practised upon
                     thera was also being practised upon the Assistant Chief
                     Constable in your presence by you. - A. I think that is
                     an unfair comment, sir, about deception.   It was a
                     decision I made in the best interests I thought of: the
                     operation.

Q. Well, would you prefer me - and I do not want to be unfair
   and I certainly do not want you to think that I am being
   unfair, Chief Superintendent - would it at least be right
   to say that you decided t o withhold information from my
   clients who were responsible in that ground in the presence
   of the Assistant Chief Constable?    A.   Y§s, sir.
                                      I
Q. Thank you.   I am sure that you appreciate now that the
   unfair publicity which was inevitably directed at the Club's
   officers, among others, in fact resulted from the with­
   holding of that information on that afternoon.    A.   Sir,
   I cannot be specific about the publicity to which you are
   referring but any unfairness from that - but I made a
   decision to withhold information for what I thought was
   good reason.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am not quite clear, Hr.
     Duckenfield.   I think it was put to you by Mr. Dyson
     yesterday that you had said that the gates had been
     forced open by the fans.   Was that the tenor of what
     you told the Boardroom as well?   I do not know.
     A.   No, my Lord.

Q. Did you say the gate had been forced open or what?
   A.   My recollection, my Lord, is that - and bearing in
   mind yesterday afternoon was the first time that had been
   drawn to my attention, again - I was approached in the
   crisis in the Control Box by many people   and I do recall
   Mr. Kelly and Mr. Mack rell with others -Fire Service,
   various interested parties - coming in and crowding what
   was already a very crowded box in a very difficult and
   tense time, and I will agree I was probably asked by Mr.
   Kelly what the situation was and I will be categoric,
   I did not say, "I have given an order for the gates to
   be opened" and I think my learned friend over there ---
   I can't remember the words he said but he suggested
   that I said that a gate had been opened or a gate had burst
   open and fans had entered and if someone can refresh me
   of what he said?

Q.   I think it was put that you said that casualties had been
     ca used by the gate being forced open by the fans.
     A.    I didn't appreciate that, my Lord.    I would have
     said something of the order that fans have entered the
     ground.

          -MR. COLLINS:  I have, in fact,      the transcript
     here of the questions.   (H a n d e d )

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.   It was put at
     first:  "Do you remember telling them  that the problem
     had been created by the gate being forced open by the
     fans?" and then at a later stage it was specifically put ---

          MR.   GLASGOW:   Page 113, sir, letter D to E.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.    --that casualties
     had been caused by the gate being forced open   by the fans.

          MR. GLASGOW:    In fairness to this witness, sir,
     while you have got the paper in front of you - and we
     have great admiration for the way this transcribing
     is being done, let that be said - I think that there
     must be a mistake in the answer there because my
     clear recollection and my note is that Mr. Duckenfield
     said he would not go as far as that.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     That's right.

          MR. GLASGOW:   And unhappily it has been transcribed
     as, "I would" and perhaps we should correct that because
     it is very unfair otherwise.   The correction, with your
     leave, sir, at page 113, letter D, that the transcript
     should read, "I would not go as far as that."

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes, thank you.

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   Perhaps we ought to have that properly
     in evidence.   That is what you said, I think?   A.   Can
     you tell me now what ---

Q. Yes, that when you were asked the question that my Lord
   has just put to you:   "At all events, they are both quite
   certain they were told by the Police in the control room
   that the casualties had been caused by the gate being
   forced open by the fans?" your reply, I believe, in fact
   was, "I would not go as far as that."    Do you remember
   that?   A.   Yes, sir.    My opinion is, obviously referring
   to a conversation some time ago, I am not disputing what
   Mr. Kelly says, all I am saying is, my recollection is
   I said, "A gate has been opened and fans have entered" or
   words to that effect, but I didn't tell him the whole
   truth about the Police giving the instruction.    I cannot
   be any fairer than that, my Lord.

Q.   I must make it plain, Mr. Duckenfield, I       am not suggesting
     that you went any further than that with       the Directors.
     I am not suggesting that you t o l d ‘them a   lie;  what I
     am complaining about is that you did not       tell them the
     truth.  A.  Sir, you are correct.

Q.   Thank you, and the answer that you gave to my learned
     friend, Mr. Dyson, yesterday afternoon that you at that
     stage thought that you should not communicate the situation
     until possibly a Senior Officer knew the situation, that -
     with the greatest respect - cannot have been a very candid
     reply to Mr. Dyson, because the Assistant Chief Constable
     was present when you said it,   A.   I am sorry, sir,
     can you take me through that again, please, slowly?
                              29

                                         D. G. DUCKENFIELD

Q.   Yes.   You told Mr. Dyson yesterday afternoon when he
     asked you why you were being so coy about telling them
     what had happened, your reply was that you just thought
     at that stage that you should not communicate fully
     the situation until possibly a Senior Officer of mine
     knew the situation.   A.   Yes, sir.

Q. What I am concerned about is that that conversation
   to which you are referring had taken place after the
   A ssistant Chief Constable had come into the Police Box.
   A.    Yes, sir.

Q. And you had the opportunity, if necessary, to take him
   on one side and tell him the truth in one sentence.
   A.   Yes, sir, but the situation is that at that stage
   I am not sure that Superintendent Marshall had come in
   from the outside of the ground.

Q.   How would that affect the positon?     A.   Because Mr.
     M ar shall would say in detail, or tell in detail, what
     the situation had been as he saw it.

Q.   But was    not the fair thing to Superintendent Marshall
     as well    as to all the Club stewards who       were going to,
     p utting it bluntly, carry the can unless you put the
     p icture straight, was it not fair to say at least to the
     Assistant Chief Constable, "You ought to know, sir, that
     I made the decision, right or wrong, and no-one else is
     to blame."    W o ul d that not have been an honourable thing
     to do, as a very Senior Police Officer?       A.    Yes, sir.
     I cannot recall at what stage I told him the full
     circumstances.

Q. Let us face it, you must bitterly regret that you practised
   that deception on anybody,   do   you not?   A.In one
   lEspect,  sir, I never agree to   deception and don't tell
   lies but it was my view on this occasion, to save
   a crisis in the disaster, to withhold the information.

Q. Well, let us not talk about lies, C h i ef - S u perintendent.
   I am happy to talk about impressions.       The impression
   that you gave to the world at large from the Assistant
   C h i e f Constable downwards and which you persisted in
   until yesterday was that the Club had been responsible
   for the m a n a gement of this crowd inside their ground
   and~y_ou knew that to be unfair.     A.   I refer, sir,
   to the Green Guide in terms of the management of crowd
   control and they were my references.

Q.   I want a straight answer from you on that point for the
     p eace of mind of my clients and the men who have been
     d i st r e s se d by it. At least you now accept, Chief
     S uperintendent, that the impression which you allowed to
     be created that they were in some way responsible for
     failing to manage this crowd was ^unfair?      Surely you
     can accept that now, can you not?        A.   I can accept
     t hat now, sir.
                                                                 D. G. DUCKENFIELD

                         HR. GLASGOW:     Thank you.

                            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Does      that conclude your
                    cr o ss - e xamination?

                         HR. GLASGOW:     Yes,     sir

                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   It is a convenient moment,
                    then, to do what I suggested before.   I think the film
                    is ready and we will adjourn and see it and resume when
                    we have done that.

      MR. HYTNER: I wonder, sir, before Mr. Woodward cross-
examines, may I just put two more questions really arising
out of matters that I had no knowledge of when I cross-examined?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes, Mr. Hytner.
        Further Cross-Examined by MK. HYTNER:
      M R . HYTNER: Mr. Duckenfield, now we know what you
said later to the Board and to your Assistant Chief Constable,
you have given your explanation as to why you did not wish
to tell the truth and I am not going to pursue that. What
I want to ask you is why in deciding to suppress the truth
you also decided to tell a lie about the supporters, about
the Liverpool fans. Why couldn’t you have simply said you
did not know what had happened? - A. In the crisis of the
moment, sir, with all those pressures that are so evident,
I can't give an honest answer other than the stress of the
situation.
You realise do you, that that lie for which you cannot give
an explanation, has caused widespread slandering of the fans
not only here but also in Europe? - A. My intention in my
action sir was not to cause any distress.
Well in that case, this is my last question, since that was
not your intention, would you now take the opportunity of
publicly exonerating the fans? - A. Publicly exonerating
the Liverpool supporters sir?

Yes? - A. For what exactly?
For the overcrowding behind the goal at the Leppings Lane
end which caused 95 deaths? - A. I am in some difficulty
with that answer, sir. I would apologise for any inference
with Liverpool supporters as a whole.
Mr. Duckenfield, let me make it plain, I am sorry I have
overrun my two questions, that I am not asking you to
exonerate the behaviour of isolated fans who caused dis­
orders outside the ground either through drink or for
other reasons before the match. I am asking you publicly
to exonerate the fans for the overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4
which caused 95 deaths? - A. Yes, I publicly apologise sir
for the inference that people caused those deaths.

      MR. HYTNER:   Thank you.
     _MR. JACKSON:   Sir, we indicated at the outset that
my learned friend Mr. Hytner and I would not ask the same
questions but it is quite apparent that those questions
asked by Mr. Hytner in fact covered the virtual entire
remit of matters I would       have put to the    PoliceOfficers
in this case.
      May I associate myself with the questions and parti­
cularly accept the apology and observations made by the
Chief Superintendent.

A.  fes, but I did net communicate that to the world at
large.

But it somehow got to the world at large.   We heard it
this morning and that was what you had — or that was the
impression you had given, was it not?   A. - I am sorry,
would y o u  ?

 point?     f did not want to disclose the situation because
 it r.sy become public knowledge,, especially vis the media and
 my Igttntion was not tc tell anyone because I did n’t know
' £fSt individuals concerned and 1 sm not making any reference
 to any individual at all, and so it was my belief that
 the information should be kept closely to me and no-one
 else and I didn't want anybody telling via the media
 because,' whilst it was not an immediate consideration,
 if it got cut via the media, then difficulties could

         q. I follow that thinking but what I am concerned about is
              that you appear to have conveyed the impression as part
             of not telling what actually had happened, that it was
             the breaking down of a gate by the fans that had actually
             caused the trouble.       That is what the media picked up and
              that is what the a e d i C broadcast? - h . When I was in that

Mr.    Duckenfield              had agreed                tha t    the     gates          shold       be    opened?               A.    I t h ink

basically,         and      you          will       probably         remember              from     seeing           the     video,          that

everything           happened             very       quickly         from        that       moment         on,

Q .               Certainly.                   A.     In f act          1 think            roughly about               3 . 3 4 we        had

the     casualties          cle a r .           We    h ad    gone       to      see       the D i r e c t o r s '          we    had    come

back.       I had a         call          to    speak        to    the     Chief          Constable,             so     I asked          for

the    Ground Commander                        Mr.     M a r s h a l l to a t t e n d the              Control Room                so    that

I could      speak         to    all           the O f f i c e r s c o n c e r n e d a n d             I t h i n k it was               at

that     time     was      the       first          time     t hat       I realised               fully     what had              transpired.

Q .               This      would              be w h a t        s o r t of     time?        A.        I thi nk we w o u l d                 be

talking      about         4.15          ish.

Q.              So    effectively after                          everyone            had     been      told          that    the       g ame

was     cancelled and                people          had     begun       to      leave        the S t a d i u m ?            A.    That          is

right,      but      I have          a    vague       recollection                   that     it     is s o m e t i m e          during          all

t he   melee      and      I think             y o u w ill        appreciate               there      was        a    lot    of s t r e s s

in     dealing       with       the       problem.                I have         a    feeling         t ha t s o m e b o d y

Mr.    Du c k e n f ield        spoke          to Mr.        Kelly       and         I think        a Mr.        Kirton           from       the

F.A.    a n d Mr.       M a c k r e l 1,        the S e c r e t a r y          of    the C l u b .          Do y o u         rec all         a

Q »                 Because           it    has     been         suggested,           and     I think          Mr,     D u c k e n f ield

has     actually          accepted           this,          that    he       certainly          conveyed             the

impression,              whatever           precise          words        he m a y     h av e      u s e d , that          fans     had

broken a gate              down and              that       that       had    led     to     the    trouble?               A,    I d o n ’t

remember          what      the       actual        c o n v e r s a t i o n was-             1 remember              Mr.    M a c k re 11

saying        soemthing              about       " W ha t    was       the    plan?"          Certainly              I briefly           said

we were           trying        to    get     the     people           out    who     had     been       i nj u r e d .

<3„                But    you        said     tha t     you       ha d    some       vague      recollection                 that      at

some      stage      someone           said        something             about       "storming           the        gates?"         A.      Yes,

I do.

Q .                Could        that        in f act        be    the     occasion which                 has        been     spoken         to

way?         A.     O h y e s,        yes.

appreciates,              we    were        extremely             busy and           trying        to m a k e       sure        that     the

areas        were    sterile,              that     doctors         had       been     called and              all     the

necessary           things           were    being          done    that        should       have        been       d one.        That

                    As    I understand                 it y o u      have      said    so      far     that         you     did        not -

words        to    this    effect,               you     did     not     appreciate            that       the       gates      had       been

opened        by P o l i c e      Order          unt i l    about        4.15     pm.,      when you            spoke         to

Superintendent                 M a r s h a l 1.        Is t h a t       correct?          A.        Y e s , I think            that          was

ri g h t .

Q.                 The     time,        of       cou rse,        is a p p r o x i m a t e ,     but       the       poi n t    is this!

you    did        not    appreciate              that      there        had    been Police             Order         to     open        the

gates        until       you     spoke          to Mr.      M a r s h a l 1?     A.       That       is     correct.

Q.                 You     have       also        told     us     that        on a    previous            o c c a s i o n - an

occasion           before        that       -    somebody          in a u t h o r i t y       had made          a     reference              to

storming           the    gates?            A.      Yes,       I think         that    was      right.

0.                 And     you      believed             t hat    that        could    have         b e e n Mr.        Duckenfield

A.     Yes .

Q.                 And    you      it       could      have       been     on    the      occasion when                 Mr.        Kelly

was    in the           Police      control            box?        A.     Yes.

Q .                Does    it      follow          from     that        that,     u n til      you     spoke          to Mr.

Marshall           at    about      quarter            past      four,        you were         under        the       impression

that    f ans       had    somehow              forced      their        way    into      the       ground?            A.     That       was

my    recollection.

G .                Thank       you.         There        is one         other     matter.             DO you          have         a

recollection,              on a n y         occasion           before         4.15,    when you were                   in the

Police        control          box,     of       som e     reference           being      made       to     the      television

monitoring              screens        to       i1 lustrate         what       had    happened?              A.        No,     I do          not.

G .                You    do     not        have    any        recollection            of     that at           all?          A.        No,

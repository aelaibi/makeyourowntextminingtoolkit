    MAJOR CATASTROP?jE PROCEDURE IN SHEFFIELD

    WHAT IS A MAJORCATASTROPHE ?

    There is no standard definition, but for hospitals this is generally an
    accident for which the number and severity of live casualties require special
    arrangements to be made.


    NOTIFICATIONOFTHEHOSPITAL

  The notification of a Major Catastrophe should be made by the SOUTH
( YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE SERVICE (SYMAS). Other emergency services
  should channel all communications to SYMAS.

    SYMAS control will inform the ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT of the NORTHERN
    GENERAL/ROYAL HALLAMSHIRE HOSPITAL via the DIRECT LINE (this the usual
    emergency link between SYMAS control and the A&E department).

   If the A&E department: is closed then SYMAS will inform the
£/ HOSPITAL SWITCHBOARD. Information may also be frorrfforthern
 J General/Royal Hallamshire Hospital Switchboard. In either case
   return call to confirm message.

r Staff in the A«E Department of second Hospital will make contact
k with first onca.ll Hospital to confirm status of incident.

    The message to be vised by SYMAS to implement the full plan will be "IMPLEMENT
6   THE MAJOR CATASTROPHE PI,AN".

  On receipt of this message the most Senior Member of staff (Nurse
^ or Doctor) in the A&E Department receiving the message will
  .immediately phone SYMAS control to confirm that the plan has been activated.

  If a message to implement the major catastrophe plan comes from a source other than
7 SYMAS (eg police/fire) then the person receiving this message should check with
  SYMAS control. If an ambiguous message (eg "casualty standby”) is used then
  again a check should be made to SYMAS control.

, If large numbers of injured begin to arrive in the A&E department then the
& senior member  of staff in the A&E department will activate the plan.

   If SYMAS wish to put the hospital on standby (ie NOT the primary receiving
Q hospital) then they will notify the A&E department (Switchboard on closed
 j nights). The message to be used is ’Incident Alert. Prepare Site Medical
   Officer and team". This message will not implement the full
   Major Catastrophe Plan but key personnel will be informed and the
   Site Medical Officer and team will be made ready and despatched.
   (see page 3).
DISTRICT HOSPITALOTffROL

The choice as to which hospitals are to be initial receiving centres for
casualties will be made by SYMAS, depending on a range of factors including the
location of the accident, the number of casualties involved, and the nature of
the accident.. It is possible that SYMAS will select nei.gh.bou.ring hospitals
outside Sheffield, e.g. Rotherham or Barnsley, together with only one of the
Sheffield hospita1s.

A District Hospital’s control point will be established at the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital by a Senior Administrative Officer to provide co-ordination of
Sheffield hospitals and communications with other services and Districts. Local
hospital control points will be set up in each hospital.

DISTRIBUTIONPRINCIPLES

The Senior Doctor at the Accident and Emergency Department at the first
receiving hospital will notify SYMAS when he/she decides that further casualties
need to be directed to another hospital. If possible, the second receiving
hospital will be notified in "advance by the first receiving hospital that they
will be required to receive casualties. Other Departments may become saturated
(eg. ITU, Theatres) and in such cases, requests will be channelled through the
hospital control.

SPETIAL CASE DISASTERS

INCIDENTS INVOLVING LARGE NUtlBERS OF CHILDREN

In an incident where there are a large of injured children the
Paediatric SHO, Registrar and Consultant should be called to
assist in the A&EDepartment. They will assist with resuscitation
procedures and the Senior Paediatrician will co-ordinate the
mobiliation of other skilled Paediatrics help.

INCIDENT INVOLVING BURNS

In a Major Catastrophe where there are large numbers of burns
casualties the Consultant Plastic Surgeon should be called. He
will go to the A&E Department to assist with assessment and
disposal.

INCIDENTSINVOLVING DANGEROUS CHEMICALS

It is possible that a Major Disaster may involve patients who have been injured
or contaminated with toxic or hazardous substances. Specific guidance to NHS
staff is given in the Trent Regional Health Authority Guidelines on Major
Accident Procedures, a copy of which is kept in the White
cupboard marked "Disaster" in Sisters office of the Accident and
Emergency Department. Advice on dealing with patients involved in such
incidents can also be obtained by contacting the Occupational Health
Physician at the Northern General Hospital. ’

INCIDENTS INVOLVING RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES

Any incident involving radioactivity may give rise to casualties who,
as well as being contaminated, will require treatment for their injuries.
The Royal Hallamshire Hospital is designated as the hospital prepared
to accept contaminated casualties from Sheffield and the surrounding
District.

Where the need for life-saving treatment appears to override the need for
decontamination, ambulance crews (in liaison with their control) must take
the casualty to the nearest Accident and Emergency Department, even
though it may not be designated to receive contaminated casualties.
This situation may arise in Sheffield if the Royal Hallamshire Hospital
Accident and Emergency Department is closed and casualties are received
first at the Northern General Hospital. In this event arrangements must
be made with the Royal Hallamshire Hospital to obtain advice and
assistance in the decontamination of casualties and staff.
Initial guidance is contained in the Trent Regional Health Authority
Guidelines on Major Accident Procedures, a copy of which is kept
in the White cupboard marked ,TDisaster" in Sisters office of the
Accident and Emergency Department.

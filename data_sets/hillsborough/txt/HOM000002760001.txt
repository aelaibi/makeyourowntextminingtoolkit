Dear Mr McCormick

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER : FILM VIDEO COVERAGE

Sue Mitchell of the Home Office spoke with you earlier today
about the BBC's coverage of the Hillsborough disaster, and asked
if all the BBC's footage taken last Saturday could be retained in
view of its potential value to the public inquiry.

I understand that the BBC in fact had exclusive rights to filming
the match and will therefore have all the film shot inside the
ground. Any footage subsequently obtained by the BBC from other
sources may also be of value and it would be appreciated if this
too could be retained until the inquiry has reported and the
subsequent issues resolved. This would include footage which may
not have been transmitted.

As you may know, the Home Secretary made a statement to the House
of Commons on 17 april about the disaster, during which the
question of the film footage and of any photographs taken being
made available to the public inquiry was raised.  I enclose a
copy of the relevant extract from Hansard which you may be
interested to see.

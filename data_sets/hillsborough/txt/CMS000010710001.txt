this edition by lunchtime - perhaps copy recipients could
feed their thoughts in via you.   A revised version will be

reminds          us,          many     sporting            events             could          not     be

permitted           to t a k e        place.         They        turn         out     to d o w h a t

is     often        a    very        unpleasant           job.           They        often         face

derision,           abuse and assault,                    and they endure                     it all

with      remarkable                 good        humour.             They           deserve         the

thanks      of      every        decent          citizen.

major      impact         of CCTV           on    the     hooligan             problem.



S i r P e te r t a l s o       recognises           the great              potential            value

of     the ( N a t i o n a l           Football           Intelligence                   Unit        in

dealing          with           footbal1-related                      crime            and         with

hooligans           travelling              to m a t c h e s      abroad.
The     Report        recommends              the      creation            of         three     new

specific         offences             to     apply       at         designated            sports

grounds:          throwing            a missile;               chanting           obscene        or

racialist        abuse;              and    going       onto        the        pitch     without

reasonable           excuse.           It a l s o       asks        for    consideration

to    be g i v e n    to the          extending          of the            courts'        powers

to    impose         attendance             centre       orders           and     electronic

tagging         in         sentencing               offenders              convicted             of

footbal1-related                     offences.                  I         welcome             these

recommendations                 in         principle.                Before             bringing

forward       any     legislative             proposals             to     implement           them

I     shall     look        carefully             at    the         practicalities               of

their      enforcement.

authorities           in    connection              with       charges           to     be     made

for     policing        inside         grounds,          and        to     the        police     in

connection           with       planning               their        operations,               with

communications             at    the match,              and        with        the    training

for     police       commanders              at     matches.               I    endorse         all

these     recommendations.
‘ So    far      as     hooliganism                 is       concerned.            Lord           Justice

 Taylor         takes          the        view      that        better        facilities               and

 better           treatment                of        fans            will         bring            better

 behaviour.               Beyond           that         he     draws        attention             to   the

 potential            of CCTV             alongside            improved           facilities           and

 the       National             Football                Intelligence               Unit;               the

 creation         of      some        new        offences            and     an    extension            of

 the     courts'          powers           to m a k e        attendance            orders.

 Taylor         says     he c a n n o t          support           the      implementation              of

 Part       I    of     the      Football                Spectators           Act           and    I   say

 right        away      that         in    view      of        that      recommendation       the
                                                                                                <x

 We     t o l d t h e H o u s e t h a t Rt H o n a n d H o n M e m b e r s w o u l d

 have       the        opportunity                 to        consider             any        proposals

 before         they     were         implemented               in    the     light          of the



 T a y l o r Final            Report,        and     I do not t h i n k                 it w o u l d    be
right        to     take       the        matter        forward              in      view       of    what

We     remain        of        the       view      that           it        was ‘ right          at     the

Part        I will        remain           on     the    Statute              Book        so    that     if

a    more         workable               scheme         can        be        p r o d u c e d , / o r j if

hooliganism            is n o t          reduced         by the a l t e r n a t i v e m e a n s

is     to     i mpl e m e n t | t:h e            Taylorj proposals                        as     I     have

another           chance           to      put     themselves                 in        order.          The

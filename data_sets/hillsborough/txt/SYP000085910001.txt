    hours     <1330).        I parked about a mile                from the H i l l s b o r o u g h gr o u n d and

    then made my way on foot.

    It took about          half an hour           to walk      to the ground,              they were     lots of

    s upporters        in this      v i c inity    but    I saw no       incidents         of disorder       or

    drun k e n e s s at any        time.     I recall         passing      two      public    houses and seeing

    they were         very busy wi th N ot ti n g h a m Fo r e s t          s u pporters       drink i ng f r om

    glasses         outside.

    I took up a position on the                    bridge      o p p osite L e p p i n g s Ln entance about

    14-10 om (1410),           I had a r ra n g e d to meet                      my brother,        and his

    friends         there about      half    past two.           I could see           that   there were about

    1,000 supporters m il li ng about                    the L e p p i n g s Ln e n t r a n c e and      I could

    see many of them maki ng their way thr ough the                                 tur ns t i 1e s , the i r m o o a

    At about         1430 hours      the following            friends as a r r a n g e d joined me             on the

matches as           I'm the only one who                travels        from a different               part     of the

count r y .

w hile       I was waiting          for    the    lads    to ar r i v e    I saw some s upporters

climbing^he            walls above          th                 Ie s «     1 saw about             four    police

horses and>.t/o officers                   on foot       trying     to control          the       crowd but        they

irtad lit tl so# f f e c t .

A bout       five    to three       the    nine of us joined              the    rear      of the        1,000*3        of

s u pporters wait i n g         to get          in we were      stood on the            pavement at             the     bac

of the        crowd.

The    crowd was joyous              at    this    time    but as        it got      nearer        to kick        off

time     they a p p e ar ed to get a g i t a t e d w o n d e r i n g whet h e r               they w o u l d       get       i

on time.            1 thought       then    1 was    not going          to get       in but        thought also

the kick off might              be delayed.              All   nine     of us were          only stood            in

tjlis crowd a couple                of minutes.           To my     right       I saw a big           blue      gate

              I was    too    far    back       to see who      opened      it but suppo r t e r s              ar o u n d

                    outing    that    the gate had been opened,                      the    crowd m oved

fowards        entering       the gate,          I was    carried w ith the forward m o v e m e n t                      of

the    crowd,       at all     times       I was    in control          of my m o v e m e n t s and            it would

of been possible              to get out          of this      portion a/" tfcne crowd,                  but    I went

w ith everyone          else    through the          opened                       » dj/fficult            to estimat

how many        entered       through       the    gate.

On the other           side of       the    turnstiles         I stood to the              left of        the     tunnel

entrance        leading       to the a rea behind the goal                      to wait       for the          others        t

ar r i v e    so we    could then decide w here                 to stand.

I met        up wit h everyone            but                     He    had a ticket              for a n o t h e r     par

of the ground and                                   who we had obv i o u s l y             I os            he     c rowd.

There were           no police       or stewards          c o n t r o 1 1 ing a cc                         unns 1

e n t e r e d the     tunnel

A bout       five    feet    from           end of the tunnel              I found myself                stood only
                                                                                                             PAGE         4
                                                                                                             S 3 0 17

w it h my br o th e r ,                     we made        our way     on to the terraces             to the      right

(pen 3)       we both stood                together about          10/15 feet from the              back

wall.       I had        lost    sight       totally of the other               five      including G r a h a m

ROBERTS.           I think       it was a           couple    of minu t e s     before      kick off,       then the

players were on the                   pitch,       then the       pressure from the            crowd a r o u n d me

was    intense,          then    it was       very hot and           I thought        then that       I w o u l d n ’t

be able       to stand m u c h more.                  During     the    ne;<t few minutes           the    pressure

from     behind kept            increasing           I tried to move          to make       space     for myself

but    this was          not easy due             to the e xc e s s i v e n e s s    of the    pressure.          I did

not see       the game          start       the    pressure was         unbearable.           I felt      fear

and w or ri ed          for my safety,             it was     so hot,      I could feel myself              getting

faint,                  was    close       next    to me so       1 was able         to talk to him

throughout.

There were          no a p p arent          surges      forward .just a constant               build up from

the back          I was       shouting at          those     behind me      to get back         but    nothing      wa<

h ap pe n i n g    I felt my s e l f         being      s q u ashed and      pushed       forward,     it was an

effort      to keep my feet                 on the ground.             Myself       and         were      pushed

f or wards        and    right       for    some minutes.            I recall        lookj,^g up and seeing

supporters          climbing          over    the     front     fence,     policy            f pushing them

backi. n , people              on the       terraces were          s c reaming       at          lice,

i n i t i a l l y the     police       took       no notice and kept            pushing       them back      in I

d i d n ’t realise what was                  h a ppening      I thought       theres       too man y      people    in

here.      We both            came    to    rest about        f i f t e e n feet     from the front

perimeter          fence,       the    pressure         had eased off and             I said to               it was

time    to try and get                out.                 saw people      being      pulled from the            crowd

by those          supporters          in the       seated are a above           the West Stand.             We    both

made    our way to the back of ytie                        terraces      and with               I got      pulled to

the a bove         seated stand.

We    both stood at the                bl                    seated West S t a n d area for               some    time

I could see             it was a serious              s?      tion     I could see         injured an d dead

              supp o r t e r s    on the     pitch,      we     left   the ground via the Leppi n g s Ln

              e n t rance about           4 pm    (1600).        I sat on the        bridge       opposite    this

              entrance,          w here    I had    intially met         everyone        to await     their    return.      At

              about     1643 hours e v e r y o n e         but                   and G r a h a m R O B E R T S had

              r e t urned to the           bridge.       The     thought     then was they had made             their way-

              back    to the       cars     I then       left    them and made           my way home    to Scunthorpe.

              It w a s n ’t until          the   next morn i n g       I was    informed that Gr a h a m R O B E R T S

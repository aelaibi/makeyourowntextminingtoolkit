our    Supporters.                     When       we    first             went          into      the       ground           we       walked          through

the    tunnel           to       the    West       Terraces                   where       we      stood         near         to       the       back,       but

as    it     got       close       to     kick         off       time,             we    had      been       pushed           further             down          the

Terrace           towards          the       Perimeter                Fence             and     playing            area.              We    were       being

packed        in       steadily           by      pressure                from          the     rear.           It      was       a    continual

forced        by       the       crowd.           Paul       CLARKE                was     standing             down         in       f r o n t of         me

about        two       feet       away.           Just       after             3 . 0 pm       (1500)         when        they          kicked          off,             I

saw    pe o p 1e        c 1 i m fai n g      up on          ta    t h e P e r i rne t e r F e n c e .                    1 t h e n d e c id e d t o

resist        the       pressure             from       the       rear             and    attempt            to      force            myself

backwards.               At       this       time       I    c o u l d n ’t             see     my     friend           Paul          CLARK.           I do

remember           that          the    pressure             on       my       body       was        for     about           four          minutes          just

prior        to    the       3.0pm        (1500)            kick          off       and       just        after         until          the       gate       was

opened        leading             on    to     the      playing                area.

As    the     gate       was       opened          on       PEN       3       I felt          the      pressure              ease          and    1

started           to    force          myself          back.              Our       Supporters               were        being             forced          on       to

the    playing           area          and     the      match             was       stopped.                They        were          still       climbing

over       the     Perimeter              Fence         and       on          to    the       playing           area.             I    remained             where

I was        for       a moment           and      then          as       1    looked           around          as      it    cleared             and

noticed           there          was    about          five       people                1yi n g      on     the      ground            directly             in

front        of    me    and       up     against            the          front          wall        and     P e r i rne t e r F e n c 1 n g .                  1

                then       looked          behind          me       and       decided              to    c 1 irnb o n         to     the       internal             fenc e s

                which          separate          PENS          £    and       3 .        I then          jump        up    and       was       caught          by     someone

                who       was    in       the    West          Stand,             above        where          I was.               1 then       looked           out       over

                the       playing          area       and          could          see        lots       of     people         lying        on       the    ground,

                with       Police,          Ambulances                   and        other          people          with       stretchers                 and

                being          carried          away.              Although              I saw          some       people           lying       on       the     ground

                inside          the       Terraces             at       the       front,           I couldn't             tell       you       what       they        were

                wearing          or    what          their          names          are.            I did        not       see       Paul       CLARK■            After

                about          ninety       minutes                or    more,           I    left       the       stand           and    made       my    way        back        to

                the       car    where          I saw          Mr       Kenneth              CLARK       ( 1630— 1645               hrs).

                I       remember          looking          around             me     when          I was        first         in     the       West       Terrace             and

                noticed          how       sparsely                the       ends        of    the       Terracing              was       with       people.               We

                always          prefer          to    stand             if    possible              behind           the      Goal        mouth          when       at     the

                football             matches          as       this          is     an       area       used       by     Teenagers             and       those          just

                 little         older       who       sing          during           the       match.

                1 only          suffered             slight             bruizing              to    my       legs,        but       nothing          more

                serious.              I    remember                at    one        stage          being        up      against           one       of    t he

                internal             Pressure             Barriers                with        my    stomach             and        that    people          at       the

                •front         were       shouting             "move          back           move       back*,          but        although          I tried             to

                force          myself       backwards,                   you        just       couldn't            move.            I wasn't         frightened

                and       at    no    time       was       I unable                 to       breathe           properly.                 The    only       thing           was

                that       at    around          the       kick          off        time       when          the     pressure             was       on,    you        just

                couldn't         move       if       you       wanted             to.         If    anyone           had      taken        ill       or    there           had

                been       a    fire,       then          no       one       could           have       got     out.          John        FITZPATRICK                 is      a

Thank you for your further letter of 4 December 1997 about the Hillsborough
disaster.

My previous letter explained the purpose of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
independent scrutiny into the events at Hillsborough. The Judge has
subsequently received a great many representations in the course of his scrutiny.
He also spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died and
listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings fruitful
and constructive, and that they were of great help to him in writing his report.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated that he has been given full access to the
material held by South Yorkshire Police and that the force has co-operated
throughout his scrutiny. He believes he has been able to investigate fully the
issues raised by the Family Support Group and others.

The Home Secretary indicated in his statement to the House on 30 June that the
timetable for the scrutiny was a matter for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, and the
management of the scrutiny remains entirely the judge's responsibility.
Although it was hoped that the judge would be able to produce his report by the
end of 1997, the number of representations he has received has been such that
this has not been possible. However, he expects to be in a position to present
his report to the Home Secretary shortly.

          Dear Alun

          Ref: 1

          The above constituent wrote to me in May of this year about the Hillsborough disaster. I contacted
          you on his behalf and received an incorrectly dated response.

          I have now written to           informing me of the information contained in your letter, but would
          appreciate an up to date reply with any further information which I can pass on to him.

          I look forward to hearing from you.

          Yours sincerely




          ALAN MILBURN MP

        Thank you for your letter of 30 May to Jack Straw, enclosing one from
                                                                     in support of calls
        for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster. I am sorry for the delay in
        responding.

        As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a
        case for a further public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many
        representations which have been received. Concerns that a number of issues
        relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed attention following
        the Granada television documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December.

        The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which
        has been put forward, calling for a new public inquiry. He has decided, in all the
        circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no
        matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this
        end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had
        invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal
        to conduct the scrutiny. I enclose for your information a copy of the
        Home Secretary's statement to the House, which includes Lord Justice Sfaart-
        Smith's terms of reference. You will see that he has undertaken to make public
        the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives him.

        It is our earnest hope that the independent scrutiny will finally bring an end to
        the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

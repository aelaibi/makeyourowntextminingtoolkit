I 1eft         the    pitch at a bout            4. 0 0    pm and went             to the    first aid         centre

After     a few mome n t s           I can       remember         seeing J t f v s     police     prisoner        van

full    of s upporters           outside          by the TtfcrflTh Stand.                  The   prisoners were

just    having         the usual       banter          w ith the        police a n d asking             for    cigarettes.

I think         the    coach was       full       of Liverpool,              fans.

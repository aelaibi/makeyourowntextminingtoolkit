Mr J B Taylor




FOOTBALL LEAGUE


I am responding to your note of 31 May to Mr Brown, G2, copied
to me.     I have also seen Mr Bolton's response of 12 June which
I have discussed with him.     I have the following comments on
points 1 and 3 in Mr Sandford's letter.


Bournemouth v Leeds


2.      We, in F8, would be grateful for a sight of any agreement
between the Football League and ACPO on handling police
requests for changes of fixtures.     You might suggest to
Mr Sandford that this information could be fed into the Home
Office at official level (to me):     there seems no particular
reason, from the Home Secretary's point of view, why the
information should be sent direct to him.     However, in this
context the FL may feel a need to redeem themselves by direct
contact with Ministers.


Ticket Touts


3.      Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations for some new
offences and penalties at sports grounds are still under
consideration.   We shall be putting forward a submission to
Ministers on this shortly.     You could tell Mr Sandford that
consideration of the Taylor recommendations is well in hand
but not yet complete.

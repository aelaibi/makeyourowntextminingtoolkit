               then     travelled            by    transit          van    in our        serial,,         which was          serial        32.

               Once     at     the    Hillsborough                 g r o u n d we     were     paraded          and    the     match       de t a i l

               various         points        up    to    The       Gate    public        h ou s e .

               Ou r    direct        supervisory              officer          was    A/PS     Thomas          and    our    Inspector           was

               Inspector            Millett        part       of    our    duties        were       to    supervise          Liverpool

               supporters            coming        from       the     coach      park        and    the       train    station.

               We     commence        these        duties          around       11.2 0 a m       <1120).

               There        wa s   a steady          flow      of     people         towards        the       ground     all     in a g oo d

               mood,        and     I was      approached             by a n u m b e r        of    teenagers          and     older       pe o p l e

               and     the     main     questions             asked were             " W h e r e ’s the        nearest       pub      that's

               open"        and     "Where's         the      nearest          toilet".

               Around        1 2 . 15 p m    (1215)        I was       told      by     Inspector             Millett       to a t t e n d

               junction            beyond      the      roundabout             which     I believe             is    part    of C ^ a y w h e e I s

PC     Edwards            and myself               were       then making                sure        that         the     coaches          took

this     junction.

F rorri t h is        time         the       number          of    supporters                on    f oo t     grew        steadily,                  as     did

the     number            of    cars         and    vans          containing             supporters.

The     general             demeanour              of    the       crowd was             good        and      f airly well                behaved,

the     younger             element           were       shouting             avid c h a n t i n g           there        were       a good

number          of    people            walking          into       the       r o a d as          the    crowds           grew.           I saw

large      numbers              of      people          who       had    obviously                been       drinking,              their            fa c e s

were      flushed,              their         eyes       somewhat             bleary,             l a rg e    numbers           were       carrying

2,     4 and         even more               cans       of    beer       or     lager.

Numbers          steadily               grew       until          I noticed             the       train       arrive           over       the

bridge          further            up    the       road and             about       fifteen minutes                       later       there               wa s

a    l a r ge    surge          of      supporters                which       were       escorted             by the           Mounted

Branch.              Again         general          behaviour             was       good          but    l a rge        numbers           were

carrying             cans       of      beer,,

The     supporters                 we re      on both             sides       of    the       dual       carriageway                 down            the

central          reservation                  and       on    the       road       singing           and      chanting.               I w as

continually                 asked        for       the       nearest          pubs       and       toilets           and       by    now         it wa s

a r o u n d 2 . S O pm          (1420).

A ll    the      t i me        there         were       people          walking          against             the     flow       of    th e           main

body     of      supporters                  asking          for    spare          tickets           " A ny       sp a r e ,    mate".

Around 2.40pm                   (1440)         A/PS          Thomas       came          up    to me          and     said       t h at     it

s o u n d e d as          if    there         was       fighting          in the             ground,          according              to    the

radio messages.                         He    remained with                   us    on       the     p o i nt       and      I remember

seeing          the       l a st     coach         go    up P e n i s t o n e           Road       around           2.45pm          (1445).

These      coaches              were         now    being          parked          on    the       main       road        n e ar     to    the

r a i 1w a y     bridge            as C l a y w h e e l s          Lane       was       full       and       ha d    been       for       about

15 m i n u t e s .             S ho rt ly after               PS Thomas             said          that       it     sounded          on    the

radio      as        if     th e     fans      were          trying       to       rip       d o w n a ga t e           at     the    ground.

At     3pm     (1500)            we    left      ou r      point       with        other      members            of    our       serial        to

return         to L e p p i n g s           L a n e , as        we   had       been    briefed,               to a w a i t       our m ea l

break.

As     we    walked          back       we      mixed with             other         serials        who        were        also       returning

to L a p p i n g s          Lane.           Once      at    th e     entrance          I saw        other         officers

including            members             of     the M o u n t e d          Branch      a n d a s m al l           crowd          of    people

some        of w h o m w e r e          waving          th e i r t i c k e t s        s t il l     intent         on       getting          in to

see     the     game.

It w a s       quite         apparent             to me         at    this      stage       that       something                had    happened

inside         the      ground          although            I was          not a w a r e      exactly w h a t .

The     officers             present            were       told       to    form a         cordon which                we       did.        This

was     across          the       entrance            to    the      Lappings          Lane        entrance            to       stop    anyone

At     this      t im e      an a m b u l a n c e          arrived,            the    cordon        parted and                  allowed        it

I then         saw      someone             beckon         us    towards           where      the      ambulance                was    now

parked,         which            was     outside           the       concertina            gates,             I sa w       at    the     rear        of

t he    ambulance                a male         body       l ai d     on    the      floor       and      a    police           officer        with

him and         by      his       colour          he wa s        in a       ba d     way    or     dead.           I walked            past        the

ambulance            through             t he     concertina               gates      and     there           sa w a       large       number

of     people,          a    lot       of     which were              l ai d    on    the     floor           there        were       other

people         next         to    the       people         some       giving         first       aid      others           crying       s o me

shouting           for       help.

I ran         to     the n e a r e s t        person            on    the      floor       who     was        already           being       tended

to     by     another             male.          He     had a        pulse      but    had       been         sick     and       was    of     a

p oor       colour          and       in a      ba d way.            We     immediately             were         joined          by an

ambulance            man who             had a        resuscitator                 which      he    placed            on    the       man    and

we     then     with         others             c a r r i e d the      man      to    the     ambulance               by    the       ga te s.

After         he w a s p l a c e d in th e                 ambulance            I returned             b a ck     through             the    g at e

and went           to       the       next      person          I found         who    wa s      j us t       about        conscious.                I

placed        hi m       in t h e      recovery            position and                 asked         the       two    lads       n ex t      to

him     to    keep an           e ye      on    h i m as         I tended          to      the    n e xt        man who          was     dead

there        was     no    pulse          at all          and     his       friend         covered          him       up.

The     next        part       is all          a bit       of a b l u r r          really         picking             people        up

carrying            them       to    outside          the        gates       where         it a p p e a r e d         other       officers

were     segregating                 the       people        into       different               groups,          dead,          badly

injured         and       those        that         c o u l d wait.,          T h e re w e r e         a    lot       of    people           in

there        who     had       been       sick       a n d all         that       c am e     up w as        pure       alcohol.               There

were     people           crying,             shouting           in a n g e r      a n d all          t h is     time       I still           was

not    aware         of    what        had      gone       on.         But    as       the      comments             made       to me        went

on     like     " Wh y     did you             open       the     gates,          you      bastards             are    responsible                 for

this,        y o u ’ re m u r d e r i n g           bastards"           and       the      like.           It    became          apparent

that     had        been       some       form       of    surge        through            the    turnstiles                and     the

gates.          I was          told       by s o m e       that        stewards            had    been          letting          people           over

t he    turnstiles              for       a    price       and      that      lots         of    people          j us t     surged           past

without         having          their          ticket        taken          from       them.          One       of    the       last     I

helped        carry        ou t      was       a m a n wh o         had      back       and      chest          injuries.              We     then

went     around           the       large       numbers           of    people          who      were       s t i ll       in t h is         area

checking            to    see       if a n y o n e        wa s    still       in       need      of m e d i c a l          attention,              and

then     as     the       crowds          were       dispersing              from       the      area       directly             above        the

incident,            I was          one       of a number              of    officers            deployed             in a       c or do n ,

directing            the       crowd away              from       the       concertina            gates,             where       the

ambulances               and    i n j u r e d w e r e,           towards          the      other       g at e        into       Leppings           L a ne .

I don't         know       how       long       I was        stood          there       for,      but       it       seemed       like

forever         as       supporters             left,        blaming          us       for      the    incident             making

remarks         as m e n t i o n e d           earlier           and    “ I see         you've         got       the       gates       shut

now,     it's        too       late"          but    the     majority             of    remarks            passed were              to       the

effect         "I    hope       we     don't         get     the       blame       for       t hi s    one       as    well",          other

remarks         were       made        in a s i m i l a r          vein and             some      commented                on    the     good

j o b we *d d o n e            and     enquiring             about          the    number         of       dead and             injured.

            Most     people         were    clearly       upset     and      at    t ha t    t im e     needed    someone      to

             blame     a n d we      were     the   nearest        target.

             W h e n all     the     fans     had   cleared        the    area      we      were       deployed    outside      the

             L e p p i ngs   Lane     entrance        for a    short         time     bef o re         being   stood    down    to

             the N o r t h     stand       to a w a i t    instructions.              This       was     shortly      before    3pm

             (1700),

             1 do    remember         quite      a surge      of    f an s    shortly          before      2.43pm      (1443)

             people      running       towards        the    ground       cutting           across       the   dual    carriageway

             and    onto      the    roundabout           cutting    across         and      through       the    vehicles

             virtually         halting        traffic,       and    there         were      s t i ll    people    asking    for

             tickets         coming    the     opposite       way    until         shortly         before      this.

EVIDENCE FROM THE NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO THE
HILLSBOROUGH    INQUIRY


The NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES is the 5th largest Union
in Britain with 650,000 members.

Approximately 250,000 of those members work in the National
Health Service and are spread across all grades of staff.   The
Union is by far the largest Union in the ambulance service and
ambulance staff who attended the tragedy at Hillsborough are
members of the NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES.

The U n i o n ’s evidence will be presented at the Inquiry by Mr Roger
Poole, the U n i o n ’s Health Service National Secretary (Designate)
who is also Trades Union Side Secretary of the NATIONAL AMBULANCE
COUNCIL and
Chair of the AMBULANCE OFFICERS JOINT NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE.

The Union is represented on all of the major Ambulance Committees
in this country including the NHS Training A u t h o r i t y ’s Ambulance
Staff Training Committee.  The Union is critically involved in the
professional issues surrounding the ambulance service and is
acknowledged as the major organisation representing ambulance
staffs.

The Union does not intend to comment on any of the operational
decisions that were made on the day at Hillsborough as that is
something which will be dealt with by the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service and which our members working m
that service will have an input into.

It is however the intention of the Union to give evidence on
matters of public policy which we feel arise out of the tragedy
at Hillsborough and are issues on which the Union has held views
for a long period of time.

The role of the ambulance service

The ambulance service     is one of the c o u n t r y ’s 3 emergeney
services.  Its job is     to attend to victims at any accident or
emergency; to provide     immediate care for those victims and to
transport them to the     nearest hospital for further treatment.
Ambulance crews are highly trained and accident and emergency
crews are trained for the wide variety of conditions which face
them in the sort of work they do.   Their training consists of 8
weeks at a regional ambulance training school, followed by a
further 12 months working with a qualified ambulanceman/woman
during which time they again experience in all aspects of
accident and emergency work.  They undertake regular
post-proficiency training and many of them now go on to do what
is known as extended training in d ef r ib il l at i on , intubation and
infusion techniques.  Early attendance of an accident and
emergency vehicle with trained ambulance staff is therefore
crucial in ensuring that an injured person receives the most
appropriate treatment possible prior to their admittance to a
hospital.

It is recognised by all concerned that response times for 999
calls are critical to a patients wellbeing and ambulance services
strive to attend all emergencies as soon as they possibly can,
and certainly well within the limits laid down by something known
as the ORCON STANDARDS which are Department of Health
recommendations for response times for emergency vehicles.

The Tragedy at Hillsborough

Without wishing to comment in detail upon the events at
Hillsborough there can be little doubt that had an extended
trained ambulance crew been on duty at the ground with
d e f r i b i l la to r s, then at the very least, there would have been the
opportunity of saving the lives of some of those people who so
tragically died.

Whilst it must be the job of the Inquiry to make recommendations
on football grounds safety that will ensure to the best of
e v e r y o n e ’s ability that such a tragedy will never occur again, it
is the job of the emergency services to plan for events of that
sort and wherever possible to be in a position to take whatever
action is necessary to alleviate suffering and, of course, to
save lives.

It is the U n i o n ’s view that the South Yorkshire Met. Ambulance
Service acquitted itself extremely well on that occasion taking
into account all of the problems that they faced.       However, the
Union would like to comment upon certain aspects of the events
that day and to recommend to the Inquiry that recommendations
could be made which would ensure that the role of the ambulance
service was even more effective on any future occasion.

The provision of extended trained ambulance crews at public
events

It is the v i e w of the Union that at all major public events         (and
here we talk about events where large numbers of people are
congregating and would include all football events) there should
be on duty extended trained ambulance crews provided by the local
NHS ambulance service.  The promoters of the event (in the case
of a football match, the football club) should pay an appropriate
sum to the local health authority for the provision of that
ambulance attendance.

At the moment the only medical attendance at the majority of
these events are that provided by the voluntary St Johns
Ambulance and Red C r o s s .

The view of the Union is that both St Johns and the Red Cross
play a very valuable role in attending functions of this sort and
are very capable of dealing with simple first aid matters.
However, they are not trained or equipped to deal with more
serious incidents amongst which we would include serious injury,
heart attack etc.

We see no reason why St Johns and the Red Cross should not
continue to provide the very useful function they do but that
that needs to be supplemented by trained ambulance crews capable
of providing much more sophisticated care for seriously injured
or ill people.

Our first recommendation, therefore, is that qualified NHS
ambulance crews should be made available at major public events.



First Aid and rescue equipment

It was clear from the television pictures at Hillsborough that
the football club had made little provision for dealing with
casualties on their ground.  There were no stretchers readily
available and football fans were seen tearing down advertising
placards to use as stretchers for friends and colleagues.

Our understanding is that all public places have to have a fire
certificate before they are allowed to hold public events.   Our
second recommendation therefore is that all public places
including football grounds should have what we are terming a
First Aid Certificate.  It is our view that anybody wishing to
put on a public event on premises to which the general public pay
for access should have a certificate from their local health
authority which will lay down the minimal requirements of the
health authority both for equipment and methods of escape for
people who suffer injury or illness whilst at the event.   The
local health authority who have a great deal of expertise in
these matters would call upon their ambulance service to discuss
with the proprietors of such events the minimum equipment and
facilities necessary for a First Aid Certificate to be issued to
the premise.

Assaults on ambulance staff

3 members of the ambulance service were as we understand it
assaulted on the afternoon at Hillsborough.   Thei'e has been an
unfortunate tendancy in recent years to treat ambulance staff as
figures of authority rather than as people who are completely
neutral in all of these events, wishing to give attention to all
those who need it regardless of who they are.    Some of the fault
for this lies within the ambulance service itself which still has
a rather militaristic attitude to its work and the way it treats
its own staff, but some of it arises out of the general malaise
and break down in respect for one another in society generally.
If the ambulance service is to do its work effectively in very
difficult situations, then it is most important that it is always
looked upon as a neutral body of men and women dedicated to the
relief of suffering and pain and the saving of life.    Regardless
of what other tensions there be in society, the ambulance service
should always be able to go into those situations in the
knowledge that ambulance crews are going to be left untouched by
whatever event is taking place in order that they can provide
support and comfort to those who need it.

We would therefore ask the Inquiry to consider saying something
about this in your report in order that all those who work in the
service and those who are responsible for it, along with the
public at large, will understand the necessity to treat the
ambulance service in a manner which will always allow ambulance
staff to do the job for which they are trained, without the
constant fear of themselves being assaulted.

Stress and trauma

The last issue we wish to give evidence about is an issue that
affects ambulance staff themselves.  Unfortunately major
tragedies have become a way of life in this country in recent
years and whenever they occur, it is members of the three
emergency services who are called upon to clear up the problems.
To attend any of these disasters and be faced with the horrific
problems that one has to deal with has an adverse affect even on
the most experienced and hardened of s t a f f . I know very well
that experienced members of ours who attended Hillsborough were
very badly affected by what they saw and had to do deal with and
whilst they dealt with the matter very professionally, it was
after the event was over and they had time to reflect on the
situation that they become very stressed indeed.      It is, of
course, not only in major disasters where stresses occur,
but very often in the day to day work of the ambulance service.
Members of the service are called upon to deal with horrific
injuries - very often to young children, which leave a major mark
on them after the event.   I have to say that our members in the
South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service who attended at
Hillsborough have been very complementary about the way in which
the health authority have tried to assist them in relation to
these matters afterwards.   The Union has no criticisms of the way
in which the health Authority has handled the matter.   However,
it is very difficult for any employer on the spur of the moment
following an incident of that sort to put into place the sort of
counselling that maybe required by staff who have gone through
quite dreadful experiences.   It is therefore our view that
consideration should now be given to the setting up of an
appropriate organisation with Government funding which would have
available to it, professional help upon which employers could
call to provide counselling facilities for any of their staff
when it is needed.  Our last recommendation therefore is that the
Government should be asked in consultation with the appropriate
Trades Unions/Government Departments and Employers to set up an
organisation of the sort described above which could provide the
advice needed immediately when it was required.

Date:           8 June 1989

Matter:        Trent Regional Health Authority - Hillsborough

Ref:           AJC/


Roger Poole's secretary from NUPE Head Office telephoned.        Their
phone number is 01 - 854 - 2244 and she said that Mr Whalley at
the Home Office had suggested that she should ring me. She said
that NUPE had submitted some documents to the Inquiry that Lord
Justice Taylor had looked at last night and it had been suggested
that they should contact us.    She said that they wanted to put
some witnesses in and also make recommendations.        She was not
ab le to tell me w h a t t h e i r e v i d e n c e was or w h a t the
recommendations would be.   I suggested to her that she should
send me whatever it was she had sent to the Inquiry so that we
could liaise properly and ensure that wires did not get crossed.
She said she would have to speak to Mr Poole before doing that
and she said she would arrange for Poole to ring me on Monday
12th June, as he is away until then.

I rang Don Page and told him of my conversation with Mr Poole's
secretary. We both thought it likely that the only document that
NUPE had put in was the letter, a copy of which we had previously
seen.       I told him that my concern was to ensure that NUPE were
not pulling in a different direction to us and he agreed that
that was the important thing.          He also suggested that I should
tell Poole that it would be a mistake to push the use of
d e f i b r i l l a t o r s in the sort of situation that arose at
Hillsborough because of the danger involved.          He said he might
want to speak to Poole himself to discuss that point.

I confirmed to him that the witnesses who would be called would
be the eight notified to us yesterday plus himself, Yoxall and
        I as Andrew Collins had said that he would now want to
call them. He is making sure that they are all available for the
four days starting 20th June.    I told him that it was probably
most likely they would be called on the 21st but he should not
rely upon that.    I said it was quite possible that Wilkinson
would not be called. He said he had spoken to Wilkinson and told
him of the possible dates and Wilkinson said he would be
available.   He told Wilkinson that we would contact him or his
superior officer when we actually knew which day he would be
called.

I told Don Page that I would try to get a definite date from the
Treasury solicitors as soon as possible. He said that would be a
big help but at least knowing the period during which they would
be called was of great assistance to him.

                          Attendance Note


Date:          12 June 1989

Matter:        Hillsborough

Ref:           AJC/t


I telephoned Mr Poole at NUPE as he had not rang me as arranged
with his secretary.    He told me that his secretary was not in
today.   I explained that the Inquiry would be dealt with in two
phases and that the first phase is purely to gather evidence
relating to what happened on the 15th April and that the document
prepared by NUPE was not relevant to that. He accepted that. I
told him his document would be relevant to the second stage and
that Lord Justice Taylor had indicated that any Ambulance Service
views should be channelled through us. He said that he was quite
sure there would be differences of views between SYMAS/Trent and
the Union and he felt that these should be separately expressed.

I explained to him that defibrillators should not be used in a
crowd situation and that my understanding was that it would be
dangerous to use a defibrillator even inside an ambulance on the
pitch.  I also told him that^there had been an ambulance in the
ground before the match and oafr had one on standby about half a
mile to a mile away.   He said that he had only known about the
one which had been on standby.

I told him that I would speak to the Home Office to explain that
NUPE felt that their recommendations should be separately
submitted and I would let him know the position.

He asked me when the second phase of the Inquiry would take
place.   I told him that I did not know but that the present
indication from Lord Justice Taylor was that he would want
recommendations to be in writing.   I said that following receipt
of written recommendations, Lord Justice Taylor may feel it
appropriate to hold oral hearings in order to resolve any
problems where differences in recommendations arise, but I said
there had been no indication that this would actually happen. I
said I did not know whether the interim report was to be prepared
prior to Stage 2 of the Inquiry.

Matter         Hillsborough

Ref           AJC/SO'C


I telephoned Mr Poole at NUPE as he had not rang me as arranged
with his secretary.    He told me that his secretary was not in
today.  I explained that the Inquiry would be dealt with in two
phases and that the first phase is purely to gather evidence
relating to what happened on the 15th April and that the document
prepared by NUPE was not relevant to that. He accepted that. I
told him his document would be relevant to the second stage and
that Lord Justice Taylor had indicated that any Ambulance Service
views should be channelled through us. He said that he was quite
sure there would be differences of views between SYMAS/Trent and
the Union and he felt that these should be separately expressed.

I explained to him that defibrillators should not be used in a
crowd situation and that my understanding was that it would be
dangerous to use a defibrillator even inside an ambulance on the
pitch.  I also told him that there had been an ambulance in the
ground before the match and had had one on standby about half a
mile to a mile away.   He said that he had only known about the
one which had been on standby.

I told him that I would speak to the Home Office to explain that
NUPE felt that their recommendations should be separately
submitted and I would let him know the position.
He asked me when the second phase of the Inquiry would take
place.   I told him that I did not know but that the present
indication from Lord Justice Taylor was that he would want
recommendations to be in writing.   I said that following receipt
of written recommendations, Lord Justice Taylor may feel it
appropriate to hold oral hearings in order to resolve any
problems where differences in recommendations arise, but I said
there had been no indication that this would actually happen.   I
said I did not know whether the interim report was to be prepared
prior to Stage 2 of the Inquiry.

          HUPE PUBLISHES HILLSBOROUGH EVIDENCE
          Lives could probably have been saved if specially trained and equipped
          ambulance crews had been on duty at the Hillsborough football ground,
          concluded the National Union of Public Employees in its written evidence
          to the inquiry.
                                                                          J


          If? the document published today (Monday, July 10, 1989), the health service
          union NUPE recommends that there should be NHS ambulances with extended
          trained ambulance crews on duty at all major public events including football
          matches end pop concerts. The organisers should pay for the cover provided.

          The other key recommendation made by NUPE - representing the majority of
          Britain*s 19,000 ambulance staff - was that venues for such events should
          be, required to hold a First Aid Certificate of approval from the local
  £       health authority. This would stipulate that there were enough stretchers
          and essential first aid equipment ready for use.

          NtIPE has urg$d the inquiry to take account in its report - now in preparation
          the need for ambulance staff to come to the rescue without fear of assault.

          Another priority was for stress training for ambulance crews to help them
          v"'fccover from the trauma of coping with such tragedies.

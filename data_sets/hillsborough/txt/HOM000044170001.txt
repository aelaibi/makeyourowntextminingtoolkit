HILLSBOROUGH : article in Liverpool Post

Issue

Whether you should respond to Friday’s Liverpool Post article criticising your
so-called ’’climbdown” over the adjournment debate on Hillsborough.

Timing

Pressing - any response should be made as soon as possible.

Recommendation

That you write to the Liverpool Post along the lines of the attached draft,
correcting the story.

Consideration

The article is completely erroneous in implying that you have ever opposed a
debate on Hillsborough, and have therefore “given in” on the issue.
Additionally the nature and timing of the debate was never in your gift as it is
Ann Taylor’s responsibility.

The draft letter rather than giving a forensic explanation of the hows and
wherefores of agreeing an adjournment debate, makes clear that the Post got
it wrong and reinforces your willingness to debate the issue.
I must take issue with the story which appeared on the front page of Friday’s
Post (HILLSBOROUGH: STRAW BACKS DOWN.). Far from opposing an
open debate in Parliament on Hillsborough, I have always been sympathetic
to the requests of Merseyside MPs that there should be such a debate, as I
made clear in my comments to the House of Commons on 18 February. My
colleague Ann Taylor - who is responsible for scheduling Parliamentary
business - shares those concerns, which is why she has arranged the debate
for Friday 8 May.

I am only too aware of the strong feelings on Merseyside about the terrible
events of Hillsborough and I will continue to respond openly and directly to
questions raised by the families and local MPs whether inside or outside
Parliament. I will be opening the debate on 8 May - as I have always
intended to do.

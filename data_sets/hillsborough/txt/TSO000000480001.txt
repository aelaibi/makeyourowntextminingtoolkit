          Further       to my statement           of the     19 April      1989    (190489)      and my

          t e st i m o n y to the Tribunal           on T h ur sd ay    1 June     (010689).

          To summarise my evidence,                  on arrival        at the     perimeter      track at       the

          L e p p i n g s Lane      end of the ground,          I i mm ed i a t e l y went to E n c l o s u r e 3

          and    could see          bodies    piled on top of each other and other                      spectators

          being    pressed up agai n s t           the fencing,         a number       of these a p p e a r e d to

          be a l re ad y dead.           Fro m my o b s e r v a t i o n s at   that    location,       I can say

          that    the    pile of bodies was             s i t uated    in Pen 3 between the             barrier

          identified as             124A and the       perimeter       track    fencing,       which    is

          identified on P l a n           1.340/02 as the a r e a        in the squares 4, 5, 6,                7 and

          8 of N, 0 and P.

          It is diff icult            to a cc ur a t e l y estimate      the    number    of bodies w hich

          were e n ta ng le d       in a pile four and           possi b l y five deep.           However,

          taking     into a cc o u n t       it took almost 20 minu t e s             to clear Pen 3 I would

          estimate       the number          of bodies     to b et w e e n 60 and 70        in total.

          After    ass e s s i n g and       instructing      officers at Gate 3 I went                to Gate 4.

          The gate was           open,    people were       being      helped onto       the    playing area,

          and a l t h ou gh      people were       being     pressed agai n s t        the fencing,          I could

          not see any bodies              on the ground and no-one a p p e a r e d to be dead.

            I am sat i s f i e d   from what^ I saw that    the m a j o r i t y of spec t a t o r s who

            had      lost their    lives   in this trag e d y were   immedi a t e l y       in front   of the

           With    reference         to my statement        dated 4 May         1989    <040389),        regarding

           the    incident at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football        S t a d i u m on the         15 April      1989

           (150489),        I made     reference      in that s t a tement           to seeing       bodies      in Pen

           3.     Initially,         I had ente r e d the L e p pings          Lane    t e rracing     via Pe n 2,

           and after a s s i s t i n g      people out of Pe n 3 into Pen 2,                      I climbed      into

           P e n 3,    this w o u l d be towards         the bottom       corner,       i.e.       nearest    the

           playing a r e a        in Pen 3.        I recall      seeing a heap of bodies               some 6 or 7

           deep,      10 or      12 feet    from the     per-imeter fence.             Later,       during    the

           course     of a s s i s t in g   in the    rescue,      I could see         that       there were      bodies

           impossible         for me     to estimate      the number          of bodies.           I can only say

           it was an e n t a n g l e d      pile    that seemed bottomless.

Further to ray report of the 2nd May 1989.


I entered the Leppings Lane Terrace through gate number 3.Immediately in
front of me and to ray left there were approximately 50 or so bodies there.
All these bodies were entwined together making removal very difficult.
To enter the pen through gate 3 I had to climb over the bodies.   I was the
second person to enter the pen through that gate from the perimeter track.
On referring to the map shown I can say that the greatest concentration
of bodies were in squares 04, 5, 6 and P4,5,6 and 7.
I began pulling bodies   from this area and pass them onto other officers who
had followed me into the pen.      When the pile of bodies dwindled I accompanied
one of the bodies a male from the pen, it was at this stage I became aware that
one of the barriers was damaged.    This barrier is directly in front of the gate
to pen 3 and i.s located in squares M6,7,8 on the map.
The area where I went to assist in removing the bodieswas     thesame area
where I had been leaning over the fence.

             Football        Clubs.

              I was     tansp o r t e d w i th other               officers    by a PSV bus to H i l l s b o r o u g h

             of the ground and /togethe r wit h the                           officers       there,    received       packed

             refreshments           before           commencing my duties with serial                   11.

             Turner,       DC 873 Oakes,               DC 2571      Titterton,        PC Thickstt,        PC L a r k i n and

             PS 2279 Edwards,                I commenced           patrolling an are a           inside    the ground

             behind the L e p p i n g s              Lane    t u rnstiles     (1— 8).

             I was aware          that other            officers      were     outside       the ground d i r e c t l y

             outside       the t ur n s t i l e s where            I was     positioned.

             At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    12 noon,         the t u r n s t i l e s were    opened and supporters

             star t e d to come             through         the   turnstiles.         I saw that      there were           two

             of f icers      outside         in front         of each of the          turnstiles a n d that a number
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       R226

of Moun t e d officers were also                    in position       in Leppings Lane.           Other

unif o r m and CID o f f icers              could be seen        patrolling      this area.

At    this time a large metal                  gate was opened.          This    formed    part of a

fence w hich divi d e d             the s u pporters w i t h tickets for the N o r t h stand

and West         stand.       A portable metal          barrier       fence was    then    placed

across         the gate a l l o wi ng       a number of other          turnstiles     to be used to

a ll o w s u pporters         wit h tickets         for the N o r t h stand to enter         the

ground.          This barrier was manned               by four yellow j a c k e t e d stewards.

As    the number        of supporters          entering       the ground      increased a number of

fans a t t e mp te d to enter the ground w i t h o u t                 tickets.      A fan att e m p t e d

to snatch tickets              from a turnstile             operator.    The operator       called       for

help and         I went     to his assistance.               Ticket    stubs were all       over       the

floor     of the      turnstile.            The operator       had hold of the fan by the hand

however         I could not         see the fan as he was             being   shielded     by persons

a lr e a d y    in the turnstile.             The operator        let go of the fan and he

d i s a p pe ar ed   into     the    crowd which       had now dev e l o p e d outsids,

At    this time       I noted        that we were without any form of s u p e v i s o r y

support.

At 2. £ 5 p m whilst          work i n g    on tJn.e turnstiles       I saw a man who        I now know

to be                                                                             enter    the

gr o u n d with o u t a ticket             by going    thro u g h the    turnstile with another

fan who        had a ticket.           I immedi a t e l y d e t a i n e d him and     informed him of

what    I had seen and              that    it was my       i n tention to eject      him from the

ground.         T o g ether    w ith DC T i t t e r t o n    I took Wall      to the Po l i c e       room at

the    rear      of the N or t h      stand,    where       following   documentary        procedures

he was     ejec t e d from the             ground   via a gate at the F e n i s t o n e Road side

of the stand.

Together wit h DC T i tt er to n              I returned       to the   turnstiles        at the

L e p pings Lane.         It was       hectic and       it was a p p arent      that a     large      crowd

had built         up outside        the t u rnstiles and that a large amount                     of

  pushing was           going     o n . ^ Persons were           entering          the ground without

  tickets,         however,       it was      not    possible         to detain these           persons as

  there were just              six officers          including myself working                   this a r e a to

  leave the a rea w ould have                   put extra        pressure          on my    colleagues who

  were a lr e a d y s tr u g g l i n g with the volume                  of    persons       enter i n g    the

  ground.          There was an obvious                crush d e veloping            outside        the ground and

  persons         entering      the ground via the               turnstiles          d e s i g n a t e d N o r t h stand

  had tickets           for    the West       stand.        It was      not    possible        to    redirect       them

  a n d -t he y were a l lo we d         to enter       the ground and were                 r e d i r e c t e d through

  the     portable       barrier       to the West          stand a r e a of the ground.

  The     pressure       outside       the turns t i l e s was          by now a crush and officers

  outside         the t u rnstiles        were forced to retreat                    over    the barrier          in the

  turnstile          to a vo id     injury.         Persons      entering          the ground were           hyped up

  and     in a state          of distress and anger,                  shouting and screaming                 that

  persons w ould be s e ri ou sl y               injured        if the s i t uation outside                the

  g round w a s n ’t sorted out.                 It should also              be stated that           some    of the

  persons        entering       the ground were             under     the     influence       of alcohol         and

  some were         drunk.        H e a te d a rg u m e n t s   broke    out and the s i t u a t i o n           behind

.. the    turnstiles          became    very tejpse.            The   crush        continued and          persons

 enterin g         the gorund were making                 complaints          of    injury due       to the
                                ✓
  condition outside.

 At      this    time    I saw an       Inspector         (name not          known)    who was       stood by the

 metal      fence.        I went       to him and         informed him that                extra officers were

 required and that                persons would           be s e riously           injured    if the       s i t uation

 outside wasn't               relieved.        I was      informed       that      the ma t t e r was        inhand

 and that other               officers were attending.

 It was         now a p p a re nt    that    the s i t u a t i o n was        critical.         I could       see

 gates A and B were                 being    shaken v io le n t l y and were o b v i o u s l y               near   to

 being      f orced open.            I saw that a number                of Police          officers       had taken

 up station by gate A.                    Fans    had started to              climb the       outer wall         and a

number were          on the      roof       of the turnstiles.
                                     *
At this       time     I saw Police Serge a n t Wright                 walk     past wit h several

other officers a p p a r e n t l y a tt e m p t i n g          to get outside.

By 3pm      <1500)      the    pressure outside was at                  its worst.         People were

screaming and           shouting           for s o m e t hing'to     be done.      The     turnstiles

a reas were        choked      solid with           people and       I was a s sisting       in pulling

persons       through them.

A   loud roar was           heard from the            inside    of the ground and the               crush

seemed to get worse.                  This was o b v i o u s l y      the teams      entering       the    pitch.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 5 p m    (1505)    that    date    the two gates         A and B were

opened and a flood of persons                        entered    the ground.          At    this    time    there

was a further           loud     roar       from the    crowd      in the ground and the             persons

pouring       into    the ground a cc el e r a t e d          their     pace.     There was        no way of

checking        tickets       or d i rec ting any of the              crowd.      It was a stampede              of

people      it was      total      chaos they had taut one               thing    on their minds and

that was       to get       into the ground and w atch                  the match.

At a pp r o x i m a t e l y 3 , 06p m       (1506)    that date       I was     informed that        there

was a pitch          invas i o n and that            officers      had been      requested to attend

on the      pitch.        T o g e th er with-DC Turner,              DC T i t t e r t o n and Oakes       I made

rny way     round acr o s s        the back of the West               stand under         the Police

control      into     the S o u t h stand and down onto                  the field of        play.

I saw that         there were a number                of supporters        on the field,           it was

im m e d iately a p p a re nt       that      this was       not a pitch        invasion and that

persons were          injured.             I made rny way to an area of fencing                    to the

rear of the goal              posts,       where     I saw DS Morton.            There were a large

number      of d e a d/ di ei ng and          injured    persons       in the     crowu.         People were

crush hard agai n s t            the fence.           I could see what           can only be d e s c r i b e d

as a blob of h u m a ni ty            crush behind           them not moving.             Some    persons

crushed agai n s t         the fence were             blue    violet     in colour others           had

gl a s e d eyes,      apparently            dead,    others    were    covered     in vomit.

 S u pporters           from the       rear were        still      pushing        forward at this          stage

 onto       the    persons       trap p e d against          the    fence.         I could see       that, there

 were a number of                persons who          had been forced up into the air                         by the

 pressure.              They were          in great     distress       their faces were             d i s t o r t e d as

 though about             to explode,          they a p p e a r e d to be moving              in slow motion.

 I could see             that a great          disaster was           happening and           I felt     so

 helpless          to    prevent       it.     I saw DS M o r t o n a gain and said to him

 something          like    "There must be about                   twenty or thirty dead".

 I then saw Supt.                G r e e n w o o d who was      by the gate to pen number                     three.

 On the       pitch at          this       time were a small           but    increasing          number      of

 persons          injured who were             receiving        treatment          from officers,          St.         Johns

 A m b ul an ce     personnel          and football          supporters.             I was a s k e d by Supt.

 G r e e n w o o d to     clear       the    press    from the        field as they were             taking

 pictures          of the dead an d dieing at the                      fence and on the             pitch.             I

 a t t e m p te d to move            them away but         they     returned         like vultures         to a

 rotting          carcase       of meat.        They wars          disgu s t i n g     in their a t t i t u d e

 towards          life    they did not help,               give any form of aid or a s s i s t a n c e                          to

 the dead dieing an d                  injured       people on the           pitch.        They just       kept            on

- snapping        their     cameras          sometimes       in front        of    persons     giving m o u t h to

 m o ut h    resuscitation.                 I enlisted       the a s s i s t a n c e    of other     officers and
                                 ✓

 then       re turned.to         the       fence.

 It was       total       chaos,       I climbed the fence and                    leant    over   the   top to

 assist       fans       in climbing          over    to escape        the    crush.        I remember

 as s i s t i n g a number            of    persons     over    the    fence,        the exact     number          I

 cannot       remember          nor    I am unable         to describe            them.     I rmernber

 screaming         at     the    fans at       the    rear     to move       back away from the               persons

 crushed at             the fence.           The mood of the           fans was         one of a nger         and

 f r u st ra t i on at the a p p arent               lack of a s s i s t a n c e       of the Police          and this

 anger was         then d i r e c t e d towards           the Police,             in the form of verbal

 a buse and a very high state of a g itation.                                Persons        from the       rear of

      the    crowd      in pen 3 started             running at the fence           in panic a n d were

      c limbing over         the dead dieing and               injured to get        to ms on the             fenc
                                  *
      I realised         that     further      injury to these          persons was       being        caused s

      climbed down from                the fence an d     I saw Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit \

     was    by the gate           to    pen 3 which was         open.     I saw that       there were a

     number        of   persons        blocking the entrance.             They a p p e a r e d    dead.       Mr.

     N esbit       informed my self and other             officers        to enter      the      pen via       the

     gate.        I was     the    second      person to enter          the   pen via the gate            I

      remember that PC F a i r c l o u g h was            directly       behind me.        Entry       to the

      pen was      gained       only by       climbing    ever a n d onto the bodies               in order          to

     get to behind           the spaghetti            of bodies.

     There were a number                 of fans milling a r o u n d and o b v i o u s l y were               in a

     state     of extreme agitation.                   I was met with a torrent               of verbal

     abuse,        I turned my back on these              persons,        however     a number offans

     were    starting        to as s i s t     the    injured fans.

     There was          d i r ectly    behind the fence what             can only be d e s c r i b e d as a

     huge    blob of human             beings,       all were      intertwined and        I w o u l d estimate

     that    there were a p p r o x i m a e l y 50 or so bodies                there.      I could see that

     a large       number       of them w e r e / a p p e a r e d dead.       They wre     lifeless        thsir

     eyes were          glazed some        cove r eti in vomit and mucus,             others       were

     moaning,        others who were            trapped by their          limbs were       screaming          for

     help.                        '                                           ■

     The    crowd had m o v e d         back by now a n d        the    pressure at the           front    of the

     fence was          such that       the    persons    at    the -front had f a l l e n / f l o p p e d back

     onto    the    blob of bodies             behind.     Bo d i e s a p p e a r e d to be about         six or

     seven deep.

     I i mmediately          set about         getting    these     persons out       of the       pen a n d with

     other officers           star t e d      to move    them through         the gate.          One   of the

     first     I pulled out was a small woman/ g i r l ,                   she had been           pressed

     agai n s t    the fence,          she a p p e a r e d dead,    she was       trapped by the          legs and

 it took some m om e n t s               tp extract her from the pile of bodies.                                 She was

 wear i n g a red football                     type      shirt,    longish mousey           hair,       I handed the

 body to PC Fai rclough who was                            s l i g h t l y behind me to my           left      near    to

 the gate.

 A man,     alive,          was        trap p e d from the waist                down.     He was        shouting       for

 help,     together w ith others                        I attempted       to    pull    him free.         I c o u l d n ’t

 do this        because        of      the     spaghetti        of other        bodies     so    I star t e d    pulling

 bodies     from a r o u nd him.                   I cannot       say how many          I perso n a l l y m oved but

 I rembmer that a chain of officers was by now working and                                                1 passed

 the bodies           I r e c overed to them and then                      passed out           through the gate

 onto     the    pitch.

 Fans were        now helping                to    pull    bodies       from the       ?b I o b ’ and    I remember

 that     I found a m a n / y o u t h              IS years       still    alive he was           breathing

 however        he was       trap p e d from the                neck    down.     He was        pushed hard

 against        the     concrete wall               below the metal             barrier     fence.        The youth

 was     unconscious.               I shou t e d at him a n d             remember       slapping        his    face and

 telling        him to hold on.                    We    removed the       bodies       that were a r o u n d         him

 a n d he was         s ub s e q u e n t l y      passed thro u g h the gate.               I saw officers and

■ fans    pulling        the      perimeter             fefl-ce down w ith their           bare    hands,

 i left     the       pen    carrying a body of a man a p p a r e n t l y dead wit h a number
                                   ✓
 of fans        the body was             placed onto            the     pitch where        I checked for signs

 of    life.      There were             none,          a number       of fans    then turned           up carrying

 an a dv er ti s i n g       board and the man was                      then    placed onto        the    board.

 T here a p p e a r ed       to be hundreds                of   people     on the       pitch at        this    time    I

 could see        people          giving mouth             to m o u t h   to    persons     on the       pitch.        Some

 were    working         very hard,               others were m i l l i n g around obv i o u s l y              in a

 state     of shock.              T here was an a m b u l a n c e          on the       pitch.       I saw numbers

 of fans moving              bodies          on boards.

 I went with the boay                    I had          recovered towards          the Kop on an area near

 to the     corner          of the N or t h stand and                   the Kop there were a number                    of
     people      receiving             treatment     for    their    injuries.      I saw a man dea<

     the floor who               I now know to be Peter TOOTLE.                   He was    lying   face

     his   face      covered only by his tracksuit                       top which he was      still

 w ea r i n g at the time.                    I checked the m a n ’s pulse and             pulled the

     t racksuit        from his          face.      It was    obvious      he was   dead.     I removed

 a n o ra k and          placed         it over the body an d w a i t e d till         fans a r r i v e d w

 a further             board and           I went with the body to the gym s i t u a t e d at ti

     rear of the N o r t h stand arriving                     there at 3.4 0 p m     (1540).

 On entering              the gym          it was    like a battle        field,    bodies were

 everywhere.                 1' was a sk e d by someone             if Tootle was alive        or dead,       a

    I was      told to find a space                  in the first section and stay w i t h              the

 body.           1 cannot          say who       informed me.         The .body was    placed on the

 floor         towards           the    centre of the floor area.

 There were a large                      number     of fans Police        and    relatives    of dead

    there.         I kept         the body       covered t h a n k e d   the fans for       their   help and

 set about making                      a d e t ailed d e s c r i p t i o n of the body.      I checked for

    i d e nt i f i c a t i o n    there was       none.

 Howe v e r        there was a number of                   items    of jewellery.

At 3 . 5 4 p m         (1554)          Doctor -Bull from the Royal              h allamshire Hospital         cams

 to me and e x a m i n e d               the body^_and c e r t i f i c a t e d Tootle as      life extinct.

 I then made a note                      of the m a n ’s property w h i c h was as follows              -

 1' tagged the           body wit h a body         label     m a r k e d with my details and the

 brief     d etails       known about the          deceased.           A form G e n / 1 8 was    part

 co mpleted with            details      known at this          time.      The d e c e a s e d was

 s u b s e qu en tl y    p ho t o g r a p h e d and the    photo ma r k e d with the          body number

that      had been a l l o c a t e d that        being number 39.

At -11.30pm         (2330)       that    same date        I was    informed that a friend of

T ootle     had i de n t i f i e d the       phot o g r a p h taken earlier.            The    body was

w h ee l e d to a viewing area for a property                          identification.          I there       saw

Paul     R a y mo nd FRODSHAW,                                                        who    positively

 identified the            body as       being   his fr i e n d Peter Tootle.

The      body was        removed and        I o b t ained    personal       details     for    the form Gen

18.

On    c omp letion of d o c u me nt ar y         procedures         the    body was     conveyed       to the

Medico Legal            Centre        by ambulance.         On arrival,        documentation-

procedures         were        c o mpleted and the         body    left with the m o r t u a r y       staff.

The    items      retained by me w er e- h a n d e d            to :             who    recorded       them in

a property         book.         On    c om pletion   I r e t urned to the gym at              the    ground

before      being       returned to Woodse’ats Police S t a t i o n where                     I went    off

duty a Earn (0200),

I    can state          that    from my     return from the Police               room after      ejecting

Wall     the    pressure        outside     the turn s t i l e s     was    such that        if the

pressure        had not been            relieved at       the     time    then f atalities w o u l d have

o c c urred outside            the    ground.     There      is    little    doubt     that when       the

crowd     inside        the ground        roared then this             caused extra         pressure

outside        the gr o u n d and wo uld         in my o p i n i o n have       caused f a talities           by t


turnstiles.

T here    is little         doubt      in my mind     that        had we the Police           been able       to
 .t   '                                                                       PAG E   1C
                                                                                                               R226

            get at the fans at tha. front                  of the     fence whe n     I a r r i v e d on the    pitch

            at a pp r o x i m a t e l y 3. 0 6 p m    (1506)   then a number      of persons      could have

            been saved who s ub s e q u e n t l y died.

            This     delay was       caused     by the fence and         it is my belief         that   this

            d elay       caused a c o n s i derable       loss   of   life.    further     if there     had been

            wire     cutters a v a il ab le          death was   still   inevitable as the          low wall

            w o u l d have     pinned     those at the front and those at the                  rear w o u l d have

            si m p l y    run over    the    dead dieing a n d        injured.

   Further to ray report dated 5th May 1989.


   Initally when I attended on the perimeter track in front of the gateway
   leading to pen 3 I directed people leaving that pen towards gates number
   1 and 2 which are on the left of pen 3.
   I looked into pen 3 and saw a group of spectators who were indicating to
  us the police in general where bodies were, where they were stood.
  After the spectators who were unijured had cleared the gate I could see that
   there were a pile of bodies lying on the terraces.     On referring to the map
   I can say that the bodies were lying in squares P5,6 & 7 and 05,6 & 7.
   Behind this group in squares M5 & 6 and N5 &6 I saw other bodies scattered
   around that area, 1st Aid was being administered to than by Police Officers.
   There were police officers near to the gate passing bodies out and I formed
   part of a chain to remove the bodies onto the pitch.
  When we had cleared the injured parties and had begun to remove the dead bodies
   I saw that one of the crash barriers in the pen was damaged.     This barrier
   is located in squares M6,7 & 8.    Part of &    barrier was thrown over the
   perimeter fence at the police which came from the general area of the
   crash barrier which was damaged, this occiirfed during the early stage of the
   incident.                                                                 '
   The group of spectators who had indicated to me earlier had been standing
  ^behind this barrier in the area of square L6 and were indicating to a body
./                                 '!
   on the ground in this atea.   I can remember it was in this area because
  ■they parted and pointed to the ground at their feet.      I did not see the
  damaged barrier at the time they caught my attention.
  When I first arrived at Pen 3 I saw a male and female pressed against the
  perimeter fence. The male was stood with his hands against the fence attempting
   to ease the pressure from the female." The couple were situated in square P8
  and as far as I can remember both were wearing red anoraks.      When I first saw
  the female she was in a distressed condition but alive.     When I next saw the
  the female later she was blue in the face, her eyes had a glazed appearance and
  she was frothing at the mouth and appeared dead.
  I have been shown Conposite Album II, phootgraph PR 1/11A and I believe the
  couple I have described are shown on the photograph immediately above the P
  on the advertising boards and to the right of the police officer on the
  right of gate 3 to the Pen.

            At 0800 am Saturday,               15 April     1989,     I reported on duty at B a r n s l e y

            Po l i c e S ta t i o n to a t t e nd the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football          G r o u n d where      the

            was       to be played.          I paraded on at B a r n s l e y Police S t a t i o n w here we

            were       briefed by PS Swift who was               in charge       of the Po l i c e        contingent

             from B a rn sl ey who was att e n d i n g         from 0 800 am.          This      contingent

             consisted of PC Packer,               PC Taylor,        PC Mackenzie,        PC Phillips,

            PC Hooson,         his probationer,         WPC A k r e d and we were              later    joined by

            2    police o f f icers         from a squad"~from         Sheffield Headquarters.                    From

            where we were            brie f e d by Chief      Inspector and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s

            regarding        our duties        for the day.          These were       to consist          of

            reception of both L i verpool               and N o t t i n g h a m Forest Fans            at the M i d l a n d

            Ra il wa y S ta ti on at S h e f f i e l d where         they were      to be d i v erted           to 2 lots

            of P S V buses w h i c h were          to be w ai ti ng     for    them at         separate        ends    of

            the       station.        Two   officers were        then to be del e g a t e d to each bus to

            travel       up to the H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l 'Ground where         buses w o u l d       ba

            We were also         i ns t r u c t e d to make    searches       of fans as         they     came from

Approximately            1015 am this date,               along with other              officers,       I

a t t e n d e d at the S h e f f i e l d R ai l w a y S t a t i o n to commence duties as

instructed.           However,          once at the R a i l w a y S t a t i o n the serial               which             I

was a t t a c he d to were             instr ucted to take             up position outside              the main

entrance       to the R ai l w a y S t a t i o n to           intercept any fans who m a n a g e d to

slip the       police       net w i t hi n the          stat i o n and attempt           to go    into town

w i t h a possible          chance       of causing         trouble.          This we did and on a

number      of occ a s i o n s    had to divert             fans      back to the        buses w h i c h were

being     laid on for them.                   Most of these           fans,    a l t h o u g h were    noisy,

were well        b eh a v e d and no violence               o c c u r r e d and there was         very       little

s u g g e st io n of drink.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 3 0    pm     (1430)    this      date all      fans    had a r r i v e d       by

trains and a long w i t h other                    officers        we tra v e l l e d up to H i l l s b o r o u g h

on a PSV.          The    route w hi c h was            taken was through H i l l s b o r o u g h village

itself      on M i d d l e w o o d Road and then              into Leppings Lane.                Whilst

travelling        along liiddlewood R oad                 I noticed         that     there was a number of

fans     still w al k i n g      towards         the ground.           We then turned          into Leppings

L ane and      I noticed         that        there was a large             volume     of fans well           into

the     number    of th o u s a n d s        still w a i t i n g    to get     into the ground.                  The

area     in front        of thd turns t i l e s was             packed to        capacity and the                crowd

was     spilling      out    onto the           road    itself.        There were a number              of       police

officers who we re at the scene who we re attempt i ng to                                    control         the

crowd.       As we were          t r avelling          towards      this    part     of the gr o u n d       I

noti c e d 2 separate            fans who,          in my opinion,            were    e x t r e m e l y drunk and

w ere   having      to be     carried by 2 friends,                    one under        each arm.        I also

n o t i c e d a y ou th who a p pe ar ed to be a p p r o x i m a t e l y 25 years                     jumping             in

and out of the            road    putting         his    fists      up to     passing     vehicles.              In my

o p i n i o n from the view            I had from the P S V ’s there a p p e a r e d to be a

number     of fans who were drunk.                      As we       passed the        t u r nstile area,              I

also noti c e d a number           of s u pporters        climbing       onto the top of the

w alls and t u r n s t i l e s    o b viously entering           the m a t c h either without

producing      tickets      or trying        to enter with o u t         tickets at all.              The

officers who were           on duty at this            point     in no way       could stop these

youths     doimj what       they were doing due to the                   c i r c umstnaces       of the

rest     of the    crowd w h i c h were obv i o u s l y         pushing to obtain entry as

quick as      possible as the time at this                    point was a p p r o x i m a t e l y     quarter

to three.         We then t ra ve l l e d from the t urnstiles along L e p p i n g s Lane

towards     the    roundabout at Niagara.                 All along       this     road there were

still     hundreds       of fans    still walking           towards      the ground.            We then

t r avelled to the N o t ti n g h a m Forest             side of the ground w h i c h was on

P e n i s t o n e Roa d N o r t h E n t r a n c e and this was a . t o t a l l y d i fferent

scene.      There were        very few s u pporters a w a iting               to ob t a i n entry and

every t h i n g was quiet.          We were       inst r u c t e d to go to the g y m n a s i u m as

we were a reserve           serial       for the m a t c h      itself and there we o b t a i n e d a

drink.

About 3.00        pm    (1500)    this    date,     we were      instructed by S e r g e a n t Swift

to att e n d with him onto the               perimeter       track     in front         of the Leppirtgs

L ane    track.        We had been       in the gr o u n d a p p r o x i m a t e l y    one minute when

we were     given these          instructions.          We w a l k e d on the          perimeter      track

to the L e p p i n g s Lan6      end where we were              i nstructed to take             up

positions along           the track       facing     the L e p p i n g s Lane     end.        I w a l k e d up

room.      There       I remember    being      stood w ith PC Packer.                 At    this time       it

was     obvious    that    there was a large number                 of people          in the    crowd      in

the     central    sect i o n and there were a number                  of people who ware              being

pushed ag ainst          the fencing.         There were         screams      coming        from the     crowd

but at this time           it a p p e ar ed that       it was     just a      'push'        that was     being

m ade    by fans    from behind and            it was     not   evident      to myself          the

e n o r m i t y of the    incident.        I saw a number           of youths          open the small

                                             *
 back    into the       crowd as         it was          felt   that    they were       trying      to   invade

the     track      itself.       This        sort of a c t i o n       is normal       procedure at a

football          match.      However,            within a very short               space    of time     I am

unable      to say what,           but       I w ould estimate about 30 seconds                       to a

minute,       I think all          officers           realised that           the    position was more

serious.           I did not       see at this time any d e c eased                     persons       but    it was

obvious       that the        people         on the front were g r adually having more

pressyre          put on them.           The 2 small            gates were          then opened and fans

were     pulled out         of the       crowd.          The    initial       fans w hich      came out were,

a l t h o u g h short      of breath and some we re suffering                          siight      crush

injuries,          were well an d a p p e ar ed to be alright.                         I began to direct

these      fans     into the       side enclosure               under       the police       control     box and'

still      not     realising       the en orm i t y of the              incident.           I remember       one fan

stood on the track               jumping           up and down shouting and w a t c h i n g                 the game

from the          track an d not making any atte m p t                       to go to the other gate.                   I

got     hold of this          lad and            pushed him towards            the side      enclosure.            This

c o ntinued for a short while and then we                               began to realise           that      the

problem was more             serious at w hi c h stage we began to take                            the

a d v er ti si ng    boards      down w h ich were              on the       pitch itself       to a llow more

room to bring           s pe c t a t o r s       out on to.       During all         this time        I began

hearing       the fans       screaming             for help and         shouting      for us to do

something.           We were also                being   spat at       from the      crowd.      We    then

c o ntinued dragging             people           out and g r a d u a l l y they a p p e a r e d to be more

ser i o u s l y    injured but still                there were         no    persons d e c e a s e d that were

pulled      out.

While we were           stood at the fencing                    I saw a woman         I believe        with dark

hair,     in a red anorak             pressed up a g a i n s t              the fence and either            her

h us b a n d or b oy fr i e n d was              stood behind her also              in a red anorak with

his arms          up to either        side         of her head      pressing against            the fence          in

a p ea re d to be alive.            I then     continued      in a s s isting      fans who were

being    pulled out           by officers at the gate,            the gate was          only

s u ff i c i e n t l y wide   en o u g h for one fan to be pulled out at a time and

only s u ff icient at           the m ax i m u m of 3 officers         to be at       that gate

pulling      them out any more            officers at that           gate w ould just have

bloc k e d   it off totally.             I therefore        stood back and a s s i s t e d        in

getting      casualties         onto the     pitch.     We were       joined by other            officers

i m m e d iately and       some officers       began    climbing       on the fencing            in an

atte m p t   to    pull    people    out of the       crowd.      However,        people were          that

tigh t l y   packed that         it was almost        impossible       for one       officer      to    pull

persons      up a l t h o u g h some     officers     did manage       it.       People    then began

climbing      on top of each other              in an atte m p t      to escape a n d all were                   in

total    panic.          I then remember       turning and        looking at the           couple which

I p reviously d e sc ri be d and           realised     that the woman had gone                  blue       in

the   face,       her    eyes a p p e ar ed glazed and she was             frothing at the

mouth.       It was       obvious    that she was       deceased.          Her    partner was also

vomitting         from the m o u t h but a p p e a r e d to be alive.              I then       looked

further      back       into the    crowd and     I could see an old man who was                       being

sq u a s h e d and a p p e a r e d to be losing        total     consciousness.            There was

no way that we            coulft get to any of them.              I then noti c e d that           the

fencing,      the actual        wire meshing,         was    beginning       to buckle and

g ra du a l l y get worse and buckle            to something          like 6-12      inches.           We

then had the            problem of a public order             si t u a t i o n on the     pitch    itself

and   I remember          one y outh     screaming a n d shouting            that his      sister was

still    in there and was           suffering       from asthma.           I told him to stand

back and a llow           us to get as many         people as we          could out       but   in the

panic and emot i o n          , w h i ch one   cannot       blame,   he   continued        to try and

get   to the gate          to get   to his sister.            However,       this did nothing more

than hamper         the    police   officers who were           trying       their   best at      that

    stage.      I then remember seeing a man who                          I presume was w i t h his son at
                                             *
    the     front    of the fence.               He    too had his arms        pressed         up agai n s t    the

    fence trying          to    protect      his       son who was in a very d i s t r e s s e d state.

    However,        still      there was         no    way that we could get to                these    people.

    The    only way       to get      to them          was through the gate and                a few over the

    top.      However,         itw as all         so obvious       or a p p e a r e d obvious,         that had

    more    bodies     climbed onto the fence                   to try and       pull     them up this          could

    have     led to the         fence    collapsing           into the     crowd and        causing      even more

    deaths and        injuries.          At this         stage a l t h o u g h we      could see       people were

    dying and        people going         under        the    crowd and      losing sight          of them      it

    did not appear             from the gate           that    I was at that           there was anyone

    deceased        being      pulled    out.         However,     the    enormity of the           incident was

    becoming more and more apparent and                           police officers were              desperate         in

    t rying    to save         people.       Supporters         both on the pitch an d              in the      crowd

    itself were        shouting at officers and                    spitting and trying              to get them

    to do more        but there was              no way the officers            in this area,           including

    myself,     could do any more.                    Then as more        fans were       tyring       to get    out

    the gate        itself     got    blocked by the enormous                 number      of    persons    trying

    to get    through a small             gap at once.             I remember at          this    stage    that a

    large man who           I believe        had a white         top on was         trapped with the top

    half    of his     body     lyfng on the track               on his     back and from his waist

    dow n w a r d s was     trap p e d wit h i n the ter r a c i n g over              the entrance       of the

    gate.     Along wit h        other officers,              I a t t e m p t e d to    pull at his arms             to

    pull    him out while            other       officers were        f r a n t i c a l l y shouting    at us to

    do this.        We tried but were                 totally unsu c c e s s f u l     and this was        due to

    the amount       of     pressure      on his        bottom half       by the fans at            the gate.

    This    caused a large           jam at the gate             for what seemed an e t e rnity no

    one a p p e a r e d to be        coming      through this gate.

    I do    remember PC Tay l o r            stood hanging          from the fencing a t t e m p t i n g          to

    pull    persons       out of the         crowd      itself.      At   this      point      I stood back and

 up to the top of the seating a rea                               by other          fans and    fans were

 climbing over                the side         fencing a s s i s t e d by the           supporters.         There

 and        no a tt e m p t was made            to lock him up even though                     there was

 s ufficient            evidence      there.             Whilst all       this was going          on a number                   of

 officers,            including myself,                  was    trying    to wave at fans to tell                      them

 to move          back out of the stand                    itself       but    I remember       seeing a small

 crowd just jumping and                        cheering as though               nothing was going off.

 However          I do feel         that a ny b o d y with a bit of                   common    sense w ould have

 k nown there was a serious                        problem at the              front of the       pitch.           There .

 were a number                of senior         of ficers who were trying                  to organise          the

 officers           but     there was a large                  number    of fans milling          in and out of

 other         police       officers w hic h h a m p e r e d            instructions.           However,        along

 w i t h other          officers,       we made two              lines    either side          of the gate and we

 began to drag                people out,          two officers           per       person and d r a gging             them

 on to the            pitch wit h       i n s t r uctions         to commence          resuscitation.              This was

 c ommenced and then we began to try and form a conveyor                                           belt and

d e c e a s e d bodies were             being        passed a long            the    line onto the        pitch

 itself         in the hope         that medical               attention        could be given          to them

 immediately.                However,          as we were         pulling       these    people    out     it was

quite         obvious        that   they were d e c e a s e d this was due                     to the     colour of

the         face,     the smell       and       it was obvious            from       looking at the        clothing

that         they had        lost all          bodily functions.                The terrace       s u d denly

a p p e a r e d to become almost                   empty and        I could see a number                of bodies

piled up an d a crush barrier                             collapsed.          Part     of this    crush barrier

was         thrown      by a fan at the              police      officers who were              on the fencing

attempting               to    save          lives.            I believe             the    barrier          did hit a             police

officer.             The       people             tha t     I had         s e e n at       the    front       of    the       terracing

had      just       d i sap pea re d and                  I have          no    daubt       that       these       persons          fell     to

the      floor       when          the       pressure           was       taken       off.        I remember             during       the

incident,            although                I cannot           say at          what       point,       I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4

or 5 f a n s         seem          to     step       backwards             among       the       crush       shouting

approximately                  at       the       location           of    the       crush       barrier.           We    then       had     to

move      bodies          which were                 on the          pitch       further          in    in a n a t t e m p t         to g i v e

us m o r e      room          for       the       other        bodies          which       were    being          pulled       out    so     t hat

any      first       aid       t ha t        was     possible             could       be    giv e n .        Once    all       the    bodies

were      out       I i n s t r u c t e d 3 or 4 f a n s                       with    an a d v e rt i s i n g       boarding           and       I

placed a man                  on     the       boarding          and       began       running          towards          Penistone           Road

end      of    the       ground           where          other       people          were    being       taken       for

tereatment.                   The man             that w a s         on    this       was    obviously             dead       at    this

sta g e .       However,                it w a s         in a n a t t e m p t         to    get    him       to    the    medical           team

hoping         that       something                could        be    done       for       him.        When       I got       to    t hat    end

there         was    a    lar g e         number          of    bodies          at    that       corner       and    I placed           the

man      down and             left        h i m for        the       medical          staff       to    check       him.           I then     ran

b ac k    to    the L e p p i n g s               Lane     end       in o r d e r      to    fetch       further          people        from

ther e .        However,                on m y       r e t u r n all           the    bodies       and       casualties             t hat    were

to    be m o v e d       had        been.            I then          t oo k     up    position          on    part       of    the    fencing

that      had       been       pulled away                 on    the       instructions                of a       senior       officer        to

stop      people         going            in a n d        out    of       the    crowd.

Sometime            later       Sergeant                 Swift       rounded          up as m a n y          of    our    serial        as    we

could         find and             he w a l k e d         us    off       via    the       Penistone          Road       end.        We w e r e

taken         round      n ea r         to     the       gymnasium             and    sat    down.           Also    at       the    start        of

the      incident          when           we      began moving                 advertising             boards       we    were       also

forced         to    remove             journalists              away who             were       insistent          on    getting

pictures.

Further to my statement of*Jhe 2nd June 1989.


I entered the Leppings Lane terrace via the tunnel giving access to Pens
3 and 4.    At that time I was not aware of the fencing dividing pens 3 &
4.   I just entered on the right as it seemed to me that that was the
area where most assistance could be given.      I moved forward towards the
front of the terracing where I saw bodies piled several deep which
appeared to be adjacent to the perimeter wall.      I commenced the removal
of these bodies but was initially hampered by part of a crash barrier
which was entwined into the bodies, and was preventing the easy removal
of the same.
On referring to the map shown I would say that the greatest concentration
of bodies    that I was involved in were squares P7, 8 and 9 and to a lesser
degree squares 07, 8 and 9.     This is an area between the broken barrier,
the track side perimeter fence and track side gate nurrfoer 4.
My first impression was the pile of bodies were 5 or 6 deep, and I
believe the first body we moved was a male well built, wearing a light
coloured shirt.    In order to move the body we had to struggle to move
the broken barrier to release his body.      Once the body had been removed
the barrier returned to the same position as if spring loaded.

When I released that body I can say that there were legs of other
bodies still trapped under that barrier.
1 took the first body onto the pitch left it with other people and then
..returned to the area of the brokenjaarrier where I assisted in removing
2 further bodies which were clearly dead.

           developing             at    Leppings        L a ne,       but,     in a c c o r d a n c e    with       instructions,                   at

           about      3.05pm           (1505)       we were       i n s t r u c t e d ' to m a k e      our w a y        on f o o t    to

           Claywheels            Lane,     for       standby       duties           and    refreshments.

           On    r o ut e    however,          we    were     diverted            to a t t e n d at      the L e p p i n g s       Lane
                     .                                                                                         ■page                       -;
                                                                                                                                R53S

Shortly after              arriving           there,       Serial          53 was       directed          into       the       ground

through       entrance           C.      The       forecourt          at    that       time    had       been       partially

cleared,        but       it w a s     obvious           something          serious          had    occurred             by    the

conduct       of     supporters.               I p e r s o n a l l y was          approached             by    several

youths,       ob vi ou sl y a ng ry and annoyed,                           a nd was      subjected             to    verbal

abuse,       because           in t h e i r    view,       we    were       late       arriving.              I was       then

physically           manhandled             towards        the      tunnel        beneath          the    West       Stand.

On    entering           the    tunnel,        I was       met      with     several          people          carrying

’b o d i e s ’ out        and my       first        duty was          to a s s i s t     two       fans       with       one    such

person whom              they were          having        difficulty with                because          of    his       size.

This      p e r s o n at       t hat   time        was    sti l l     alive       and    on    reaching             the

forecourt,           I commenced              resuscitation                before       being       relieved             by a n

ambulance          man.

I then       re-entered            the      tunnel        and    went       to    the    terracing,             referred              to

a s P e n 3.         The       first     thing       that       struck       me    was       the    stench          of    stale

perspiration and                  alcohol.           Fans       were       screaming          at me       and       other

officers        to       "get     summat       do ne".          I went       to    the       foot    of the          terrace           and

saw a      'pile'         of    persons.            It    seemed       to me       they were             at    l e ast        5 or 6

d eep.       Entwined           in t h e s e       bodies       was    part       of a       crush       barrier          which        had

collapsed.

I then       began       to     remove        the    first       "body*          I could       get       hold       of w h i c h w a s

partly       trapped           by the       crush barrier.                 Eventually              it w a s     released and

dragged       through           the    perimeter           fence       g at e     on to       the    pitch.              I was

satisfied          that        person was           dead and          could       be    no    further          helped.            I

therefore          went        back    on     to    the    terrace          and assisted             in the          recovery              to

the    pitch,        of a f u r t h e r        4    persons.           In m y      view,       they were             beyond           help

By    this    time,        advertising              hoardings          were       being       made       into       make       s h ift

stretchers           and       fans    were        placing       'b o d i e s '    thereon          and       conveying           them

to    the P e n i s t o n e      Road       end     of    the    ground.

       In m y      view        their     efforts          were       doomed       to       failure,           but      I did        not

       consider           i t 'p r u d e n t * t o      try a nd      tell       them       that at           that       time.           They

    were        obviously             very angry,              distraught             and       upset,        and most             of    them

    were        influenced              by a l c o h o l ,      and would             not       have     listened             to    r e a s o n at

    that        time.

    I therefore                 assisted           one    such       party       to    convey a y o u t h                to     the      stand

    near        to      the     entrance           to    the    gymnasium.                 I supervised               the       placing            of

    the       stretcher            under          the    stand and made                an       examination              of     the      per son,

    but       satisfied myself                     that    life       appeared             to     be    extinct.              One       of    the

    faris w i t h me             at     that       time    obviously             knew       the        deceased          so     I advised

    him       to     remain wit h             the       body.        I then       returned              via    the       pitch          to    the

   Leppings               Lane     end.

   By        that       time,      as    far       as    I could        see,      all       the        bodies        had      been       removed

    f r o m the           terrace        either          on to       the     pitch         or     out    of    the       ground.

    I was          then        involved           for w h a t    seemed a             lengthy           period         in g e n e r a l l y

    trying           to    placate         irate Liverpool                  supporters.

   At      one       point,        I had to             intervene          to    prevent           a newspaper                photographer

   being           physically            assaulted             for    trying          to    take        pictures           of      deceased

   and        grieving           relatives.               In m y      view,       their          conduct           was     reprehensible

   and        is     not       justified           by t h e m    stating          that          they     are       ’j u s t     doing         their

   job".                                      y                                                                1

   There           was     a brief        moment          also       when       the    Forest           fans       taunted          the

   Liverpool               fans      which         caused       the     latter        to        run t o w a r d s        the P e n i s t o n e

   Road        end        of   the      g r ou nd and          in m y      v i ew,     had       not     the       fences          been       in

   p l ace         at     that    end,        there      may well           have      been a serious                     law a n d           order

   situation               break        out    as    w e ll.         This       appeared           to    be    l a ter        controlled                by

   a    line        of     officers           across      the        pitch.

   During           this       time,      I became           separated            from       the        rest       of S e r i a l       53 and

   saw        no m e m b e r      of     it a g a i n     that        day.

                      *
Further to my statement of 15th April 1989.


I can say that when entering Pen 3 on the Leppings Lane terraces
approaching from the tunnel I saw a broken barrier and on looking at
a detailed plan of that terrace I saw my first body in an area marked
06 on the grid.   This was to the right of the barrier as I approached.
Between that body and the perimeter fence     I saw about 20 more bodies,
these bodies were slightly to the right of the damaged barrier.      The
bodies were laid parallel to the perimeter fence.
On my arrival in the pen I saw that the perimeter gate was open and
bodies were being removed from the pen onto the playing area.

          To    summarise           my    evidence,             on a r r i v a l     at    the        perimeter               track          at    the

          Leppings          Lane     end       of    the       ground,       I imm ed ia te ly went                        to E n c l o s u r e      3

          and     could      see     bodies          piled       on t o p     of     each       other         and          other        spectators

          being       pressed        up a g a i n s t          the     fencing,         a number             of       these        appeared          to

          be a l r e a d y     dead.           From       my    observations              at    t h at       location,              I can          say

          t hat      the    pile     of    bodies          was       situated        in P e n 3 b e t w e e n                 the       barrier

          i d e n t i f i e d as     124A and             the    perimeter           track          fencing,               which        is

          identified           on P l a n       1.340/02 as            the    area        in the         squares              4,    5,       6,    7 and

         8     of N,       0 a n d P.

          It    is    difficult           to    accurately             estimate           the       number            of    bodies           which

          were       entangled           in a       pile       f our   and    possibly              f iv e    deep.              However,

          taking       into       account           it    took almost          20 minutes                to       c l ear        Pen 3        I would

          estimate          the     number'of             bodies       to    between           60 and 70               in tot a l .

         After       assessing            and       instructing             officers           at    Gate         3    I went           to G a t e       4.

         The      gate was          open,       people          were    being        helped          onto         the       playing           area,

         and      although          people          were       being     pressed against                     the       fencing,              I could

          not     see a n y       bodies        on       the    ground and           no-one          appeared               to     be    dead.

                deep,      10 or         12 f e e t      from     the     per-imeter            fence.           Later,       during          the

Further to my report of the 2nd May 1989.


I entered the Leppings Lane Terrace through gate number 3.Immediately in
front of me and to my left there were approximately 50 or so bodies there.
All these bodies were entwined together making removal very difficult.
To enter the pen through gate 3 I had to climb over the bodies.   I was the
second person to enter the pen through that gate from the perimeter track.
On referring to the map shown I can say that the greatest concentration
of bodies were in squares 04, 5, 6 and P4,5,6 and 7.
I began pulling bodies   from this area and pass them onto other officers who
had followed me into the pen.      When the pile of bodies dwindled I acconpanied
one of the bodies a male from the pen, it was at this stage I became aware that
one of the barriers was damaged.    This barrier is directly in front of the gate
to pen 3 and is located in squares M6,7,8 on the map.
The area where I went to assist in removing the bodieswas     thesame area
where I had been leaning over the fence.

              Football        Clubs.

               I was     t a n s p o r t e d wit h other         officers       by a PSV bus        to H i l l s b o r o u g h

              Football        Ground.           A briefing         then    took    place    in the N o r t h stand area

              of the ground and /together w i t h the                          officers     there,     received        packed

              refreshments           before           commencing my duties with serial                   11.

              At a p p r o x i m a t e l y     11.15am     (1115)     that      date    together with DC 2857

              Turner,       DC 873 Oakes,              DC 2571     Titterton,          PC Thickett,        PC L a r k i n and

              PS 2279 Edwards,                I commenced          patrolling an area             inside    the    ground

              behind the L e p p i n g s Lane              t urnstiles         (1-8).

              I was aware           that      other     officers were           outside     the    ground d i r e c t l y

              outside       the    t u r n s t i l e s where       I was      positioned.

              At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    12 noon,       the    turns t i l e s were     opened and supporters

              started to          come       t h r o u g h the   turnstiles.           I saw that      there were           two

              officers        outside         in front       of each of the            turnstiles and that a number
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             R226

 of Mounted         officers we_re also                 in position      in Leppings        Lane.       Other

 uniform and CID officers                   could be seen            patrolling       this area.

 At this time a            large metal            gate was       opened.      This    formed     part       of a

 fence w hich divi d e d           the s u pporters w ith tickets for the N o r t h stand

 and West       stand.        A portable metal                 barrier   fence was      then     placed

across        the   gate a l l o w i n g a number              of other turnstiles          to be used to

a l l o w supporters w i t h           tickets          for    the North stand to enter               the

 ground.        This     barrier was m a n n e d by four yel l o w j a c k e t e d stewards.

As    the number         of s u p p o r t e r s    entering       the ground        increased a number              of

 fans a t t e m p t e d to enter          the ground w i t h o u t         tickets.       A fan a t t e m p t e d

 to snatch tickets              from a turnstile                operator.     The    operator      called for

 help and       I went      to his a ssistance.                  Ticket stubs were all             over      the

 floor    of the        turnstile.          The     operator        had hold of the         fan by the hand

 however       I could not see the                 fan as he was         being s h i e l d e d   by    persons

already        in the turnstile.                  The    operator     let go of the         fan an d he

 disappeared         into the        crowd which had now developed outside.

At this time            I noted that we were with o u t                  any form      of s u p e v i s o r y

support.

At 2. 2 5 p m whilst w o r k i n g          on t_he turns t i l e s        I saw a man who            I now know

to be                                                                                       enter     the

ground without a ticket                   by going            thro u g h the turnstile       w ith another

fan who had a ticket.                   I immedi a t e l y d e t a i n e d him and          informed him of

what     I had seen and that               it was my            i n tention to eject        him from the

ground.        T o g ether     w i t h DC T i t t e r t o n      I took Wall        to the Police           room at

the    rear    of the N orth          stand,        where       f o llowing   docuiiisntary procedures

he was ejec t e d         from the ground               via a gate_ at the P e n i s t o n e Road               side

of the stand.

T o g ether    w ith DC T i t t e r t o n         I returned to the t urnstiles at                  the

L e p p i n g s Lane.      It was      hectic and             it was apparent        that    a large        crowd

had built       up outside          the    turns t i l e s and that a large amount                    of

  pushing was         going    on. ^ Persons were                entering          the ground with o u t

  tickets,       however,       it was        not    possible        to detain these            persons as

  there were         just    six    officers         including myself working                   this a r e a to

  leave     the are a w o u l d have            put extra        pressure          on my    coll e a g u e s who

  were a l r e a d y s t r u g g l i n g w ith the          volume     of     persons       e n t ering    the

  ground.       There was an obvious                   crush d e veloping            outside        the ground and

  persons      entering       the      ground via the            turnstiles          d e s i g n a t e d N o r t h stand

  had tickets         for    the West         stand.        It was     not     possible        to    redirect       them

  a n d - t h e y were a l l o w e d    to enter        the ground and were                 r e d i r e c t e d through

  the     portable     barrier         to the West          stand a rea of the ground.

  The     pressure     outside         the    turnstiles was           by now a crush and                 officers

  outside      the    t urnstiles were forced to                     retreat        over the        barrier      in the

  turnstile       to a void        injury.          Persons      entering          the ground were           hyped up

  and     in a state of distress and anger,                          shouting and scr e a m i n g            that

  persons would          be s e r i o u s l y    injured       if the        s i tuation outside           the

  ground wasn't          sorted        out.      It should also              be stated that           some    of the

  persons      entering       the      ground were          under     the     influence       of alcohol         and

  some were       drunk.       H e a t e d ar g u m e n t s    broke       out and the s i t u a t i o n         behind

.. the    turnstiles        became      very tsjpse.           The    crush        continued a n d        persons

  en t ering    the gorund were making                    complaints          of    injury due       to the

  condition outside.

 At      this time     I saw an         Inspector         (name      not     known)    who was       stood by the

 metal      fence.      I went         to him and         informed         him that        extra officers were

 required and that             parsons w ould be s e r i o u s l y                 injured    if the       s i tuation

 outside w a s n ’t relieved.                   I was     informed that            the matter        was     inhand

 and that       other       officers were attending.

 It was      now a p p arent        that      the    s i t u a t i o n was    critical.         I could see

 gates A and B were             being         shaken v i o l e n t l y and were            obviously         near   to

 being     forced open.             I saw that a number                of Police         officers         had taken

 up station by gate A.                  Fans        had started        to    climb the        outer wall         and a
                                                                                                                 PAGE

 number were           on the       roof of the turnstiles.
                                       *
 At this        time     I saw Police S e r geant Wright walk                      past with          several

 other      officers a p p a r e n t l y a t t e m p t i n g       to get outside,

 Sy 3pm       (1500)       the    pressure        outside was at           its worst.           Pe o p l e were

 screaming and shouting                       for something        to be done.           The    t u rnstiles

 areas were          choked solid with                people and        I was as s i s t i n g     in pulling

 persons        through them.

 A loud       roar was        heard from the             inside     of the ground and             the      crush

 s eemed to get worse.                    This was       o b v i o u s l y the   teams    entering         the    pitch.

 At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 3 p m      (1505)    that    date    the two gates A and B were

 o pened and a flood                of    persons       entered the ground.               At this        time there

 was a further             loud     roar from the           crowd     in the ground and the                  persons

 pouring        into the ground a c c e l e r a t e d            their     pace.     There was           no way of

 checking         tickets        or directing any of the                 crowd.      It was a stampede                  of

 people       it was       total        chaos they had but            one thing      on their minds and

 that was        to get        into the         ground and w a t c h the match.

 At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 6 p m      <1506)    that    date    I was     informed       that       there

 was a pitch           invasion and that officers                     had been      requested           to attend

- on the      pitch.        T o g e t h e r with-DC Turner,             DC T i t t e r t o n and Oakes           I made

 my way       round ac r o s s          the    back of the west          stand under           the Police

 control       into the S o u t h stand and down onto                       the field of          play.

 I saw that          there were a number                 of s u pporters         on the field,           it was

 im m e d i a t e l y a p p a r e n t    that   this was        not a pitch        invasion and            that

 persons were            injured.             I made my way to an area of fencing                        to the

 rear     of the goal            posts,       where     I saw DS Morton.            There were a large

 number      of d e a d / d i e i n g and        injured     persons       in the    crowd.           People were

 crush hard a g a i n s t           the fence.           I could see what           can only          be d e s c r i b e d

 as a blob of h u m a n i t y             crush behind          them not moving.               Some    persons

 crushed against              the       fence were       blue   violet      in colour          others      had

 g l a s e d eyes,      a p p a r e n t l y dead,       others were        covered       in vomit.

 Supporters           from the          rea.r were still            pushing         forward at       this    stage

 onto     the    persons          trap p e d against          the    fence.          I could see         that there

 were a number              of    persons who          had been        forced up into the air                    by the

 pressure.            They were             in great    distress        their        faces were       d i s t o r t e d as

 t hough about          to explode,             they a p p e a r e d    to be moving           in slow motion.

 I could see that a great                       disaster was           happening and           I felt       so

 h elpless       to     prevent         it.     I saw DS M o r t o n a gain and said to him

 something         like      "There must           be about         twenty or thirty d e a d " .

 I then saw Supt.                 G r e e n w o o d who was       by the       gate     to pen number            three.

 On the       pitch at           this       time were a small            but    increasing          number       of

 persons        injured who were                receiving        treatment           from officers,          St.       Johns

 Ambulance         personnel            and football          supporters.              I was a s k e d    by Supt.

 G r e e n w o o d to    clear         the    press    from the        field as they were                taking

 pictures        of the          dead and dieing at the fence and on the                              pitch.           I

 attempted         to move         them a way but they               returned          like vultures         to a

 rotting        carcass          of meat.        They were          d isgusting         in their a t t itude

 t owards       life    they did not help,                   give any form of aid or a s s i s t a n c e                        to

 the dead dieing                 and    injured       people     on the        pitch.        The y just      kept          on

- snapping       their       cameras          sometki.es      in front         of    persons    giving m o u t h to

 mouth      resuscitation.                   I enlisted       the a s s i s t a n c e    of other        officers and

 then     returned.to             the fence.

 It was       total         chaos,      I climbed the           fence and           leant    over    the top to

 a ssist      fans      in climbing            over    to escape         the    crush.        I remember

 assisting        a number             of    persons    over      the fence,           the   exact    number I

 cannot       remember           nor    I am unable          to describe            them.     I rmember

 screaming at the fans at                       the    rear    to move         back away from the                persons

 crushed at           the fence.              The moo d of the          fans was one of anger and

 f r u s t r a t i o n at    the appar e n t          lack    of a s s i s t a n c e    of the Po l i c e        and this

 anger was        then d i r e c t e d         towards       the Police,            in the   form    of verbal

 abuse and a very high state                          of agitation.            Persons       from    the     rear of

the     crowd    in pen 3 started               running at the          fence   in panic and were

climbing        over    the dead dieing and                 injured to get to me             on the       fenc
                           *
I realised that              further      injury to these            persons was      being       caused s

climbed down from the fence an d                         I saw Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit \

was    by the gate           to    pen 3 w h i c h was       open.      I saw that      there were a

number     of    persons          blocking         the     entrance. They a p p e a r e d     dead.       Mr.

Nesbit     informed myself and                   other      officers to enter         the    pen via the

gate.      1 was       the    second      person    to enter         the   pen via the        gate    I

remember        that PC F a i r c l o u g h was       directly         behind me.      E nt r y   to the

pen was     gained       only by         climbing        ever and      onto the bodies         in order          tc

get    to behind        the       spaghetti      of bodies.

T here were a number                of fans m i l l i n g a r o u n d and o b v i o u s l y were          in a

state     of extreme agitation.                   I was met w i t h a torrent               of verbal

abuse,     I turned my back               on     these      persons, however a number of fans

were    starting        to assist         the    injured fans.

There was d i r e c t l y          behind      the fence what          can only be d e s c r i b e d as a

huge blob of h uman beings,                     all were      intert w i n e d and    I w o u l d estimate

that    there were a p p r o x i m a e l y 50 or             so bodies      there.      I could see that

a large number           of them w e r e / a p p e a r e d dead.           They wre     lifeless         their

eyes were        g l a z e d some     covered      in vomit and mucus,             others were

moaning,        others who were             trapped      by their       limbs were     scr e a m i n g    for

help.

The    crowd had m o v e d         back     by now and        the    pressure at      the    front       of the

fence was        such that         the    persons     at    the front      had f a l l e n / f l o p p e d back

onto    the blob of           bodies      behind.        Bo d i e s a p p e a r e d to be aDout       six or

seven deep.

I immedi a t e l y     set about          getting     these      persons     out of    the    pen and with

other officers          started          to move    them      thro u g h the gate.          One   of the

first    I pulled out was a small                   w o m a n /girl,    she had been         pressed

against    the fence,             she a p p e a r e d dead,     she was     trapped      by the      legs and

it    took       s o me      moments             tp    extract            her      from        the    pile      of    bodies.              She    was

wearing          a     red     football               type       sh i r t ,       longish mousey                hai r ,     I handed             the

body    to PC           Fairclough                wh o      was      slightly             b e h i n d me     to m y        left       near       to

the    gate.

A man,       alive,            was          trapped             from      the      waist        down.        He      was    shouting             for

help,       together              with          others          I attempted               to    pull     him      f r ee.        I couldn't

do    this       because              of    the       spaghetti              of    other        bodies       so      I started             pulling

bodies       from         around            him.           I cannot           say        how many        I personally                 moved       but

1 rerribmer t h at                a    chain          of    officers              wa s    by    now working            and       I    passed

the    bodies            I recovered                  to    them and              then     passed        out      through            the    gate

onto    the          pitch.

Fans    were           now     helping            to       pull      bodies          from       the     'blob'        ana       I remember

that    I found a m an/ yo ut h                            13 y e a r s       still        alive       he wa s        breathing

however          he w a s         trapped             from        the     neck       down.           He w a s     pushed         hard

against          the       concrete              w al l     below         th e     metal        barrier         fence,,          Th e      youth

was    unconscious.                        I s h o u t e d at           him and           remember          slapping            his     face      and

telling          him      to      hold          on.        We     removed          the     bodies        that        were       around        hi m

and    he wa s           subsequently                  passed           through           the    gate.          I saw       officers             and

fans    pulling              the       perimeter                fefl.ce d o w n          with    their       bare      ha n d s,

I left       the         pen      carrying             a body           of    a man        apparently             dead with             a number

of    fans       the      body was               placed          onto        the     pitch where             I checked               for    sig n s

of    life.           There           were       none,          a number           of     fans       then    turned         up       carrying

an    advertising                 board and                the     man       was    then        placed       onto      the       boa r d .

There       appeared              to       ba    hundreds            of      people        on    the     pitch        a t •t h i s      1 1me     I

could       see        people          giving          mouth         to m o u t h         to    persons         on    the       pitch.           Some

were    working              very          hard,       others           were       milling           around       obviously             in a

state       of       sh o c k .        There          was       an a m b u l a n c e       on    the     pitch.            I saw        numbers

of    fans       moving           bodies          on       boards.

I went       with         the         body       I ha d         recovered           towards           the    Kop      on a n a r e a         near

to    the    corner            of      the      North           stand        and    the        Kop    there       were      a    number          of
 people        receiving          treatment                 for     their      injuries.                 I saw a man             dea

 anorak        and    placed          it       over     the       body and          waited          till       fans     arrived w

 a further           board and             I went           with     the      body       to    the       gym     situated         at    t,

 rear     of    the N o r t h         stand arriving                    there       at     3.40pm         (1540).

 On    entering           the    gym       it w a s         like    a battle             field,          bodies        were

 everywhere.               I was          asked        by     someone         if T o o t l e        was    alive        or dead,          a

" I was      told     to    find          a space           in the       first        section and                stay with          the

 body.         I cannot          say who             informed           me.        T h e .body was             placed       on    the

 floor       towards        the       centre           of     the    floor         are a .

 There       were     a    large          number        of       fans    Police          and    relatives              of   dead

 the r e .      I kept          the       body       covered         thanked          the      fans       for       their     help and

 set    about        making       a detailed                  description             of      the    body.            I checked         for

 identification                 there          was    none.

 However        there       was       a    number           of    i tems      of    jewellery.

 At    3.54pm        (1554)       Doctor             B ul l      from    the       Royal       hallamshire              Hospital          came

 I then made          a     note          of    the     man's       property             which was             as     follows       -

The     b o d y wa s      removed          and       I obtained           personal           details         for       the    form Gen

I    can    state        that       from       my    return       from      the    Police           r o om a f t e r      ejecting

Wall    the       pressure          outside          the    turnstiles             w as      such      that       if    the

pressure          had    not       been        relieved       at      the    time       then       fatalities            would        have

occurred          outside          th e    ground.          There       is       little       doubt        that        when     the

crowd      inside        the       ground         roared      then      this       caused          extra         pressure

outside         the     ground          and     would      in m y      opinion          have       caused        fatalities            by tin

    Further to my report dated 5th May 1989.


    Initally when I attended on the perimeter track in front of the gateway
    leading to pen 3 I directed people leaving that pen towards gates number
    1 and 2 which are on the left of pen 3.
    I looked into pen 3 and saw a group of spectators who were          indicatingto
    us the police in general where bodies were, where they were        stood.
    After the spectators who were unijured had cleared the gate        I could       seethat
    there were a pile of bodies lying on the terraces.     On referring tothe map
    I can say that the bodies were lying in squares P5,6 & 7 and 05,6 & 7.
    Behind this group in squares M5 & 6 and N5 &6 I saw other bodies scattered
    around that area, 1st Aid was being administered to them by Police Officers.
    There were police officers near to the gate passing bodies out and I formed
    part of a chain to remove the bodies onto the pitch.
    When we had cleared the injured parties and had begun to remove the dead bodies
    I saw that one of the crash barriers
                                      ✓»
                                         in the pen was damaged.     This barrier
    is located in squares M6,7 & 8.       Part of ^   barrier was thrown over the
    perimeter fence at the police which came from the general area of the
    crash barrier which was damaged, this occiirfed during the early stage of the
    incident.                                                                   '
    The group of spectators who had indicated to me earlier had been standing
^•behind this barrier in the area of square L6 and were indicating to a body
r                                     j
    on the ground in this atea.     I can remember it was in this area because
    -they parted and pointed to the grouiid at their feet.    I did not see the
    damaged barrier at the time they caught my attention.
    When I first arrived at Pen 3 I saw a male and female pressed against the
    periireter fence.   The male was stood with his hands against the fence atterrpting
    to ease the pressure from the female.1 The couple were situated in square P8
    and as far as I can remember both were wearing red anoraks.     When I first saw
    the female she was in a distressed condition but alive.    When I next saw the
    the female later she was blue in the face, her eyes had a glazed appearance and
    she was frothing at the mouth and appeared dead.
    I have been shown Composite Album II, phootgraph PR 1/11A and I believe the
    couple I have described are shown on the photograph iirmediately above the P
    on the advertising boards and to the right of the police officer on the
    right of gate 3 to the Pen.

Approximately                1 0 15 a m    this       date,         along               with       other        officers,           I

slip     the      police          net    within       the       station and attempt                              to     go    into       town

with     a possible               chance       of    causing           trouble.                    This     we       did and        on a

number       of    occasions             had    to    divert           fans             back       to    the     buses        which          were

being       laid       on fo r      them.           Most     of     these               fans,        although           were     no i sy ,

were    well       behaved and             no       violence           occurred and                      there         was    very       little

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y       S.30    pm       (1430)        this             date       al l      fans     had a r r iv e d            by

trains       and along             with    other       officers                    we    travelled              up     to H i l l s b o r o u g h

o n a PSV.             The     route      which       wa s      t a k e n wa s            through Hillsborough                           village

itself       on M i d d l e w o o d       Road and           then          into L e p p i n g s             L a n e.         Whilst

travelling             along       Middlewood Road                  I noticed                  that        there        was    a number                of

fans    still          walking          towards       the       ground.                  We    then        turned         into L e p p i n g s

Lane    and       I noticed             that    there        wa s      a     l a r ge         volume        of       fans     well       into

the    number          of    thousands          still        waiting                to    get        into       the     ground.              The

area    in f r o n t         of    th£    turnstiles              was        packed            to       capacity and             the         crowd

was    spilling             out    onto    the       road       i ts e l f .             There          were     a number           of       police

officers          who       were    at    the       scene       who        were          attempting              to     control          the

cro w d .     As    we w e r e          travelling           towards               this        part        of    the      ground         I

noticed        2 separate               fans    who,       in my           opinion,             were        extremely            drunk            and

were    having          to    be    carried          by 2       friends,                 one       under        each     arm.        I also

noticed       a youth             who    appeared          to     be a p p r o x i m a t e l y              25 y e ar s        jumping                in

and    out    of    the       road       putting       hi s       fists            up     to       passing           vehicles.               In m y

opinion       from          the    view    I had       from         the        PSV's           there        appeared           to    be a

number       of'fans          who       were    drunk.           As     we         passed            the    turnstile           area,             I

also     noticed a                  number        of       supporters                climbing          o nt o        the    top       of    the

walls       and       turnstiles                 obviously             entering             the       match either                 without

producing             tickets              or    trying          to    enter          without          tickets             at a l l .        The

officers             who       were        on    d u t y at       this          point       in no w a y              could       stop       these

youths        doing            what        they were             doing          due    to    the       circumstnaces                   of    the

rest     of      the        crowd which were                      obviously                pushing             to    obtain        e n t r y as

quick       as       possible             as     the       time       at    this       point was                approximately                quarter

to    three.              We    then        travelled             from          the    turnstiles                   along       Leppings          Lane

towards          the        roundabout                at    Niagara.                 All    along          t h is     road       there       were

still       hundreds                of     fans       s t ill     walking             towards          the          ground.           We    then

travelled             to       the       Nottingham              Forest          side       of     the         ground w hich was                  on

Penistone             Road North Entrance                             and       this was          a totally                different

scene.           There          were        very       few       supporters                awaiting             to    obtain          entry and

everything                was       quiet.            We w e r e       instructed                to    go       to    the       g y m n a s i u m as

we    were       a    reserve              serial          for    the       match          itself          and       there       we    obtained a

drink.

About       3.00          pm    (1500)           t hi s     date,          we    were       instructed                by S e r g e a n t         Swift

to a t t e n d w i t h              him     onto       t h e •p e r i m e t e r        track          in f r o n t         of    the L e p p i n g s

Lane     track.                We    ha d       been       in the          ground approximately                            one m i n u t e        when

we    were       given          these           instructions.                    We w a l k e d        on the             perimeter          track

to    th e L e p p i n g s           Lan6        end w h e r e         we w e r e          instructed                to    take       up

positions along                      the        track       facing          the L e p p i n g s            Lane       end.         I walked            up

the    end       of       the L e p p i n g s          Lane       Stand          nearest          to       the       police        control

room.         There            I remember              being          stood with             PC       Packer.              At    this       time       it

was    obvious             that          there        was    a    la rge         number          of    people             in the       crowd       in

the    central             section              and    there       were          a    number          of       people       who       were       being

pushed against                      the     fencing.              There          were       screams             coming          from       the    crowd

but    at     this         time          it a p p e a r e d       that          it w a s     just          a    'push'          that       was    being

made     by      fans          from       behind           and    it w a s           not    evident             to m y s e l f        the

enormity             of    the       incident.               I saw a number                      of y o u t h s           open    the       s m all

emergency          gates         and    burst        onto       the     track.           Officers             then     pushed          them

back    into       the       crowd      as    it w a s      felt        that       they were             trying        to      invade

the    track        itself.            This     s or t     of a c t i o n      is n o r m a l           procedure           at a

football          match.            However,         within        a very          short       space          of    time       I am

unable       to    say what,            but     I would          estimate           about          30    seconds          to a

minute,       I think            all    officers           realised           that       the       pos i ti o n was            more

serious.           I did         not    see at        this       time        any    deceased             persons          but. it w a s

obvious       that         the      people      on    the       front        were       gradually             having        more

pressure          put     on     them.        Th e    2 sm all          gates       were       then          opened       and     fans

were    pulled           out     of    the    crowd.            Th e    initial          fans       which          came     out wer e ,

although          short        of     breath and           some were           suffering                slight       crush

injuries,          were        well     and appeared               to    be a l r i g h t .             I began        to      direct

these    fans          into      the    side     enclosure              under       the       police          control          box and'

still    not       realising            the     enormity           of    the       incident.                 I remember           one    fan

stood    on       the     track        jumping        up a n d         down    shouting             and watching                 the    game

from    the       track        and     not    making        any        attempt          to    go    to       the    other        gate.        I

got    hold       of     this       lad a n d    pushed          hi m    towards             the    side       enclosure.               This

continued          for       a short         while       and     t h e n we        began       to       realise        t h at     the

problem was             more        serious      at w h i c h          stage       we    began          to    take     the

advertising              boards        down which were                  on    the       pitch       itself          to a l l o w m o r e

room    to    bring          spectators          out       on    to.         During          all    this       time       I began

hearing       the        fans       screaming         for       help and           shouting             for    us    to     do

something.              We w e r e      also     being          spat     at    from          the    crowd.           We     then

continued          dragging            people        out    and        gradually             they       appeared          to     be m o r e

seriously          injured            but    still       there     were        no       persons          deceased           that       were

pulled       out.

While    we    were          stood      at    the     fencing           I sa w a w o m a n              I believe           with       dark

hair,    in a          re d a n o r a k      pressed        up a g a i n s t        the       fence          and    either        her

husband       or       b o y f r i e n d was     stood          behind        her       also       in a       red a n o r a k      with

his    arms    up       to    either         side     of    her        head    pressing             against          the       fence     in

an attempt           to      shield        her       from       the       pressure.                At    this       stage         this         woman

apeared        to    be      alive.          I then            continued             in a s s i s t i n g          f a ns    who       were

being       pulled        out      by o f f i c e r s          at    the       gate,         the    gate was             only

sufficiently wide                    enough          for       one       fan    to      be    pulled          out     at     a time            and

only    sufficient              at    the       maximum             of 3 o f f i c e r s           to    be at        that        gate

pulling        them       out a n y        more        officers            at     that        gats w o u l d          just        have

blocked        it off         totally.               I therefore                stood         back       and       assisted            in

getting        casualties             onto         the     pitch.              We w e r e      joined          by o t h e r           officers

immedjiately a n d              s o me     officers             began          climbing            on the          fencing            in a n

attempt        to    pull       people          out       of    the       crowd.             However,          people            were       that

tightly        packed         that        it w a s        almost          impossible               for    one       officer            to      pull

persons        up a l t h o u g h         s om e     officers             did manage               it.        People         then        began

climbing          on t o p      of    each         other        in a n a t t e m p t           to       escape        and        all     were         in

total       pa n i c.        I then        remember             turning           and        looking          at    the      couple            which

I previously              described             and       realised             t ha t    the w o m a n         had       gone         b lu e     in

the    face,        her      eyes     appeared             glazed and                she w a s          frothing            at    the

mouth.         It w a s       obvious           that       she w a s           deceased.                Her    partner            was       also

vomitting           from      the     mouth          but a p p e a r e d          to     be    alive.              I then         looked

further        back       into       the     crowd and               I c o u l d se e          an       old m a n        who      was       being

squashed and appeared                        to      be    losing          total         consciousness.                      There          wa s

no w a y     that       we    coulS        get       to a n y        of    them.             I then       noticed            that        the

fencing,          the     actual          wire       meshing,             was     beginning              to    buckle            and

gradually           get      worse        and      buckle           to    something            like 6 - 1 2           inches.               We

then    had       the     problem          of a       public             order       situation            on       the      pitch        itself

and    I remember             one     youth          screaming             and       shouting            that       his      sister            was

still       in t h e r e      and was           suffering                from    asthma.                I told       him         to    stand

back    and allow             us     to    get       as m a n y          people         as we       could          out      but       in the

panic       and    emotion           , which          one      cannot           blame,         he       continued            to       try and

get    to    the    gate        to    get       to    his      sister.             However,              this       di d     nothing             more

than    hamper          the     police          officers            who     were        trying           their       best         at    that

stage.         I then            remember          seeing           a man who           I presume             wa s      with          his     s o n at
                                                   *
the     front      of       the    fence.              He     too     had    his a r m s        pressed            up a g a i n s t           the

fence       trying          to    protect          his        son     who    w a s in a v e r y              distressed                sta t e .

However,          still          there    was          no     way     that       we c o u l d      get       to    these           p e o p l e.

The    only way             to    get    to    them           was     t h r o u g h th e      gate and             a few over                 the

top.        However,             itw as       all       so    obvious            or    appeared          obvious,                that        had

more     bodies         climbed          onto          the    fence         to    try and          pull       them          up     this       could

have     led to         the       fence       collapsing               into       the       crowd and             causing             even more

deaths       and     injuries.                At       this       stage      although           we      could          se e      people           were

dying       and    people          going       under          the      crowd and              losing         sight          of     them       it

did    not     appear            from    the       gate       that       I wa s        at    that       there          was       anyone

deceased          being          pulled       out.           However,            the    enormity             of    the        incident             was

becoming          more       and more          apparent              and     police          officers             were        desperate             in

trying       to    save          people.           Supporters               both       on    the      pitch        and        in the          crowd

itself       were       shouting          at       officers           and        spitting          and       trying           to      ge t    them

to    do m o r e     but         there    was          no w a y      the     officers           in this            area,           including

myself,        could         do    any more.                 Then     as     more       fans       were       tyring             to    get        out

the    gate       itself          got    blocked             by    the      enormous          number          of       persons             trying

to    get    through             a small       g a p at           o n ce.        I remember             at    this          stage          that     a

large       man who          I believe             had a white               top       on w a s       trapped with                    the     top

half    of     his      body       lyfng       o n the            track      on       his    ba c k     and       from        his      waist

downwards          was       trapped within                   the     terracing              over       the       entrance             of     the

gate.        Along          with       other       officers,             I attempted               to    pull          at     his      arms        to

pull    hi m      out       while       other          officers          were         frantically             shouting                at     us    to

do    this.        We       tried       but    were          totally        unsuccessful                 and       this          was       du e    to

the    amount        of      pressure          on       his       bottom         half       by the       fans          at     the      gate.

This    caused          a    large       j a m at        the       gate     for        what     seemed            an    eternity              no

one a p p e a r e d         to    be    coming         through           this         gate.

I do    remember            PC     Taylor       stood          hanging            from       the      fencing           attempting                 to

pull    persons             out    of    the       crowd          itself.          At       this      point        I stood             back        and

were     a number              of    fans        swearing and                 shouting           at     us       on the       pitch and

both     from       the        terracing and                   the y o u t h         I mentioned                 earlier       as    trying

to    get    his       sister          h a d to        be     chastised            on a n u m b e r          of    occasions          by

officers          although             the o f f i c e r s a p p r e c i a t e d the                    situation             he wa s      in

and    no a t t e m p t         was       made         to     lock      hi m      up e v e n     though           there       was

sufficient             evidence             t he r e .         Whilst          all    this       was        going       on a n u m b e r        of

officers,           including               myself,            was      trying        to w a v e        at       fans    to    tell       them

to m o v e       b ac k    out       of     th e       stand        itself         but     I remember              seeing          a small

crowd       just       jumping            and      cheering             as     though       nothing              was    going       off.

However          I do      feel       that         anybody           with         a bit     of        common       sense       would       have

known       there         was       a serious               p r o b l e m at       the     front        of       the    pitch.        There

were     a number              of    senior            officers          wh o      were     trying           to    organise          the

officers          but      there          wa s     a    l a rg e     number          of    fans        milling          in a n d     out     of

other       police         officers              which         hampered            instructions.                   However,          along

with     other         officers,             we m a d e           two    lines        either           side       of    the    gate       a n d we

began       to    drag         people        out,           two     officers          per       person and              dragging          them

o n to      the     pitch           with     instructions                    to    commence            resuscitation.                 This        wa s

commenced and                  then-we           began         to    try a n d        form a           conveyor          belt       and

deceased          bodies            were     being           passed along                 the    line        onto       the    pitch

itself       in the            hope       that      medical             attention           could           be    given       to    them

immediately.                   However,            as       we w e r e       pulling        these           people       out       it was

quite       obvious            that       they         were       deceased           this       was     due       to    the    colour       of

the    face,        the        smell        and        it wa s       obvious          from       looking           at    the       clothing

that     they      had         lost       all      bodily           functions.              The        terrace          suddenly

appeared          to      become          almost            empty       and       I could        see        a number          of    bodies

piled       up a n d       a    crush        barrier              collapsed.               Part        of    this       crush       barrier

was    thrown          by a f a n at               the       police          officers           wh o    were       on the          fencing

officer.            The       people             t h at    I had          seen       at     the      front        of    the       terracing

had    just        disappeared                   and      I have          no    doubt          that       these        persons          fell          to

the    floor wh e n               the       pressure            was       taken       off.           I remember              during          the

incident,           although                I cannot            sa y at         what        point,          I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4

or 5 f a n s        seem          to    step        backwards              among          the     crush          shouting

approximately                 at       the       location            of    the       crush        barrier.              We     then         had       to

move     bodies          which          were        on the           pitch       further             in     in a n a t t e m p t            to    g i ve

us m o r e     room          for       the       other         bodies          which        were      being           pulled          out    so       that

any    first        aid       that          was     possible              could       be       g iv e n .        Once     all         the    bodies

were     out       I instructed                   3 or 4         fans          with       an a d v e r t i s i n g        boarding               and       I

placed        a man          on    the       boarding            and       began          running           towards          Penistone                Road

end    of     the       ground          where          other         people          were       being          taken      for

tereatmen't.                 The m an            t ha t    was       on    this       was       obviously              dead       at    this

stage.         However,                it w a s        in an a t t e m p t            to       get    him        to    th e m e d i c a l         team

hoping        that       something                could         be    done       for        him.          When        I got       to    that          end

there       w as    a    large          number            of    bodies          at    that        corner          and     I placed               the

man    down and              left       him       for      the m e d i c a l          staff          to     c h eck     him,           I then          ran

back     to    the       Leppings                Lane      end       in o r d e r         to    fetch          further         people            from

there.         However,                on m y       return           all       the    bodies          and        casualties             that          were

to    be m o v e d       had       been.            I then           took       up    position              on    part       of       the    fencing

that     had       been       pulled away                  on    the       instructions                   of     a senior             officer          to

stop     people          going          in a n d          out    of       the    crowd.

Sometime           l a t er       Sergeant             Swift         rounded          up as m a n y              of    our     serial            as    we

could       find        and       he w a l k e d          us    off       via    th e       Penistone             Road       end.           We    were

taken       round        near          to    the       gymnasium               and    sat       down.            Also     at      the       start          of

the    incident              when       we       began moving                  advertising                boards        we     were         also

forced        to    remove             journalists               away who             were        insistent             on     getting

pictures.

           I re c a l l        that          when             all      the       bodies            were   removed      a serial         of P o l i c e

           officers            made          a       line           in f r o n t          of    the     remaining       crowd      in the         enclosure

           his m e n         out.            One          of        the    supporters                  then   began    threatening            that            the

Further to my statement of «£he 2nd June 1989.


I entered the Leppings Lane terrace via the tunnel giving access to Pens
3 and 4.    At that time I was not aware of the fencing dividing pens 3 &
4.   I just entered on the right as it seemed to me that that was the
area where most assistance could be given.       I moved forward towards the
front of the terracing where I saw bodies piled several deep which
appeared to be adjacent to the perimeter vail.      I commenced the removal
of these bodies but was initially hampered by part of a crash barrier
which was entwined into the bodies, and was preventing the easy removal
of     same.
On referring to the map shown I would say that the greatest concentration
of bodies    that I was involved in were squares P7, 8 and 9 and to a lesser
degree squares 07, 8 and 9.    This is an area between the broken barrier,
the track side perimeter fence and track side gate number 4.
My first impression was the pile of bodies were 5 or 6 deep, and I
believe the first body we moved was a male well built, wearing a light
coloured shirt.    In order to move the body we had to struggle to move
the broken barrier to release his body.      Once the body had been removed
the barrier returned to the same position as if spring loaded.

When I released that body I can say that there were legs of other
bodies still trapped under that barrier.
1 took the first body onto the pitch left it with other people and then
returned to the area of the brokenjbarrier where I assisted in removing
2 further bodies which were clearly dead.

             On Saturday,              15th April,            1989     (150489)          I paraded          on d u t y at M a i n

             Street        at 7 . 4 5 a m     (0745)        and with         other       officers         was    then        conveyed            tt

             the       pre-match        briefing           at H i l l s b o r o u g h    Stadium.

             The   duties         of    serial        53     prior     to    the    game       were      the    supervision                of    th

             arrival        of    coaches       carrying           Notts.        Forest        supporters            to     the   ground,

             and   their         allotted       parking          a r e a at      the     Herries         Road    bus       depot.           This

             duty was         carried        out     withoyjt        incident,           as    generally         speaking,             the

             supporters           were      in h i g h      spirits,         but    generally            well    behaved.              As

             e a r l y as    from       10«;3Qam       (1030),         I received             requests         for    directions                to

             public        houses,       mainly        from Forest            fans,       but      from a few Liverpool

            supporters,            who,      fo r    some       reason      or     other      had     found      their        way      to       the

            Penistone            Road    end    of     the     ground.

            Shortly         before       kick       off,      I wa s    first       made      aware       of a       problem

            developing            at L e p p i n g s     L a ne,     but,     in a c c o r d a n c e      with       instructions,                   at

            about       3.05pm         (1505)       we w e r e     instructed'to              make       our    way       on f o o t    to

            Claywheels           Lane,       for     standby         duties        and    refreshments.

            On    route      however,          we    were      diverted          to a t t e n d     at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane
Shortly after               arriving         there,        Serial          53 was       directed             into       the       ground

through       entrance            C.     The       forecourt          at    t ha t     time       had    been          partially

cleared,         but    it w a s       obvious           something          serious          had       occurred             by    the

conduct       of      supporters.              I personally was appro ac he d                            by s e v e r a l

youths,       obviously            angry and annoyed,                      and was          subjected             to    verbal

abuse,       because         in    their       view,       we    were       late       arriving.              I was          then

physically            manhandled            towards        the     tunnel         beneath          the       West       Stand.

On    entering         the    tunnel,          I w as      met     with      several             people       carrying

' b o d i e s ’ out a n d m y          first        d u t y wa s      to a s s i s t        two    fans       with          one     such

person whom            they       were      having        difficulty with                   because          of    his       size.

This      p e r s o n at     that      time        was    still       alive       and       on    reaching             the

forecourt,            I commenced            resuscitation                 before       being          relieved             by a n

ambulance          man.

I then       re-entered            the      tunnel        and went          to    the       terracing,             referred              to

as    P e n 3.        The    first       thing       that       struck       me      wa s    the       stench          of    stale

perspiration            and       alcohol.           Fans       were       screaming             at me       and       other

officers         to    ’get       summat       done*.           I went       to      the     f o ot     of    th e      terrace           and

saw a      'pile'       of    persons.              It s e e m e d     to me         they were           at       least          5 or 6

deep.        Entwined         in t h e s e         bodies       was    part       of a       crush       barrier             which        had

collapsed.

I then       began      to    remove         the     first       ’body'          I could          get    hold          of w h i c h wa s

partly       trapped         by    the      crush        barrier.          Eventually              it w a s        released              and

dragged       through         the      perimeter           fence       gate       o n to         the    pitch.              I was

satisfied          that      p e rson was           dead and          could       be    no       further          helped.            I

therefore          went      back      on    to     the    terrace         and assisted                 in the          recovery              to

the    pitch,         of a    further          4    persons.           In m y        v i ew,      they were             beyond           help

By    this    tim e ,       advertising             hoardings          were       being        made      into          make       s h i ft

stretchers            and    fans      were        placing       'bodies'            thereon and              conveying              them

to    the P e n i s t o n e       Road      end     of    the    ground.
In m y v i e w            their       efforts         were       doomed          to     failure,           bu t    I did       not

consider             it     prudent*to             try a n d      tell        them         that      at    that     time.           They

were       obviously             very angry,               distraught              and       upset,        and most           of    them

were        influenced               by a l c o h o l ,     and would              not       have     l i s t e n e d to. r e a s o n at

that       time.

I therefore               assisted            on e    such       party       to       convey a youth                to       the    stand

near       to    th e      entrance           to     the    gymnasium.                  I supervised               the       placing          of

the    stretcher              under         the      stand and made                   an     examination            of       the    p e rson,

but    satisfied myself                       that        life    appeared              to     be    extinct.            One       of    the

fan's w i t h me            at       that     time        obviously          knew          the      deceased        so       I advised

him    to       remain with               the      body.         I then          returned via               the     pitch          to    the

Leppings             Lane     end.

By    th a t     t i me,      as      far     as     I could        see,         all       the      bodies        had    been       removed

from       the       terrace          either         on    to    the     pitch          or    out     of    the     ground.

I was       then          involved          for w h a t         seemed       a     lengthy           period        in g e n e r a l l y

trying          to    placate           irate L i v e rp o ol           supporters.

At    one       point,        I had         to     intervene           to    prevent             a newspaper             photographer

being       physically                assaulted            for    trying           to      take      pictures           of    deceased

and    grieving             relatives.                In m y      view,          their        conduct        was        reprehensible

and    is       not     justified            by t h e m         stating          that        t h e y ar e    ’j u s t        doing       their

j o b ’.

There       was       a brief          moment        also        when       th e    Forest           fans    taunted           the

Liverpool             fans      which        caused         the     latter          to       run t o w a r d s      th e P e n i s t o n e

Road       e n d of       the      ground        and       in m y      view,        had       not     the    fences           been       in

place       at       that    end,         there      may well           have       been a serious                   la w a n d          order

situation             break       out       as w e l l .         This       appeared            to    be    later        controlled                by

a    line    of       officers            across       the       pitch.

During         this       t i me ,     I became           separated           from         the       rest    of S e r i a l        53 and

saw    no m e m b e r        of      it    again       that       day.

My    next       direct         i n s t r u c t i o n was         to a s s i s t         in d i p l o m a t i c a l l y        trying         to

Further to my statement of 15th April 1989. -


I can say that when entering Pen 3 on the Leppings Lane terraces
approaching from the tunnel I saw a broken barrier and on looking at
a detailed plan of that terrace I saw my first body in an area marked
06 on the grid.   This was to the right of the barrier as I approached.
Between that body and the perimeter fence   I saw about 20 more bodies,
these bodies were slightly to the right of the damaged barrier.    The
bodies were laid parallel to the perimeter fence.
On my arrival in the pen I saw that the perimeter gate was open and
bodies were being removed from the pen onto the playing area.

1. INTRODUCTION

Scope and S tatu s o f th e G uide
1.     The object of this document is to give guidance to ground management, local authorities and tech­
nical specialists such as engineers in order to assist them to assess how many spectators can be safely
accommodated within a sports ground used for a sporting event. The document also outlines measures
fo r im proving safety at existing grounds. The Guide has no statutory force but many of its recom­
mendations w ill be made statutory at individual grounds by their inclusion in safety certificates issued
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 or the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.

2.    W h e th e r or not a ground is the subject o f a safety certificate, ground operators, w h o have
p rim a ry re s p o n s ib ility fo r th e s a fe ty o f th e ir sp e c ta to rs , s h o u ld a p p ly th e c rite ria , e n lis tin g
professional expertise, where necessary, in order to help ensure safe conditions at their ground.


B ackground to th e G uide
3.    Guidelines on measures for im proving the safety of spectators at sports grounds first became
available when the W heatley Report on Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1972. The
recom m endations in the A pp endix to that Report w ere extended to include fire precautions and
means of escape from an emergency situation. They form ed the basis of the first Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds and continue to do so.

4.   The application o f the original guidelines to football grounds revealed a need for advice to be
am ended in certain respects. Furtherm ore, since the safety o f spectators can be affected when
crowds are disturbed by hooligan elements, the recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd
Behaviour were incorporated in a new version, published in 1976, which was aimed specifically at
football grounds.

5.    Following the fire at Bradford City FC ground in 1985, a w orking party, established under the
aegis o f M r Justice Popplewell's Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds, reviewed
the Guide and produced a series of recommendations which were taken into account in consultation
w ith others to produce a revised and expanded second edition in 1986.

6. This third edition incorporates further changes made follow ing re-examination of the guidelines
in the light o f recom m endations by the Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor w ho reviewed the guide with
technical assistance in the course o f his in quiry into the tragedy at Hillsborough in 1989.


H is to rica l c o n te x t
7.     Serious accidents at sports grounds involving injuries on a large scale are fortunately few. But
as dem onstrated by those at Burnden Park in 1946, Ibrox Stadium in 1971, Valley Parade in 1985 and
Hillsborough in 1989, the potential for disaster at a crowded sporting event is such that it is essential
fo r ground m anagem ent to ensure reasonable safety at their grounds. This applies to all grounds
irrespective of the sport being played and w hether or not they are the subject o f a safety certificate.


G en eral p rin c ip le s o f th e G uide
8. The problem o f crow d safety at sports grounds is com plex and cannot be solved s im p ly by
e n su rin g th a t in d iv id u a l co m p o n e n ts o f a g ro u n d , such as sta irw a ys, passages or sections o f
terracing, are satisfactory in themselves. The inter-relation of these and other com ponents is critical:
none o f them can be considered in isolation w ith o u t consideration of its effect on the others. They
should all be com patible and com bine to form a balanced unit.

9.   The guide is intended to cover grounds where sporting events of all kinds are held and where
the g ath ering o f large cro w d s is like ly to present a safety problem . Football has had p articula r
problem s w hich are not norm ally experienced to the same extent elsewhere. Accordingly, much of
the guidance has particular application to foo tb a ll grounds. But w hatever the sport it should be
recognised that crowd problem s are often directly related to the nature of the event and the numbers
attending it.

                                                                  5
10. The variety o f type, fun ctio n and la you t o f sports grounds and the inter-relationship o f the
d ifferent com ponents means that a flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the
individual nature of grounds. The Guide does not attem pt to provide a universal m inim um standard
but sets achievable standards. It m ay therefore be possible to deviate from individual guidelines
w ith o u t detracting from the overall safety of the ground. Any decision to do so should be properly
recorded w ith supporting docum entation and adhered to. But unless other measures, which can be
dem onstrated to achieve an equal or greater degree of safety are taken, a reduction o f the numbers
o f spectators, compared to the num ber w ho w ould otherwise be accommodated, w ill be required.
That reduction may be severe.

1 1. The Guide is aimed prim arily at safety in existing sports grounds and therefore attempts to take
account o f the constraints and difficulties which are present in these grounds. It is not a design brief
for new construction w ork or reconstruction w ork at sports grounds, but the standards o f such w ork
should not be lower than those set out in the Guide. New w o rk should conform to the appropriate
Building Regulations. The scope o f new design w ork should lead to higher standards of safety and
am enity than those that can be achieved at grounds already built.

1 2. W hen using the Guide to assess w hether existing circumstances provide adequately fo r the
safety o f spectators, the criterion to be aimed for is that o f a reasonable degree of safety. It w ould be
unreasonable, if not im p ra ctica l, to seek standards fo r absolute safety o f everyone attending a
ground.

13. The Guide is not specifically aimed at risks to spectators from the sport itself, but managements
have a duty to take all necessary precautions to safeguard spectators against the effects of accidents
in, or originating from , the activity on the track or the playing area. Particular care is needed when
the sport entails the use and storage o f flam m able fuels.

1 4 . The advice given in this Guide is w ith o u t prejudice to the operation of the Building Act, Building
Regulations, the Health and Safety at W ork etc Act 1974 and any other relevant legislation.



U sing th e G uide
1 5. The Guide is an aid to p ro fe s s io n a l ju d g e m e n t a n d c o m m o n sense, n ot a su bstitu te. The
principles referred to in paragraphs 8-14 above should be kept in mind by both ground management
and, where applicable, by the local authority when applying the Guide to an individual ground.

1 6. A lthough some of the safety standards are likely to apply to all sports grounds however many
spectators are present, it is nevertheless im portant to relate the Guide to the needs o f each individual
g ro u n d . The required safety standard to be attained sh ou ld relate to the m a xim u m num be r of
spectators w h o are to be adm itted to the ground or parts o f it. For example, a football ground w ith a
m axim um spectator capacity of tens of thousands is likely to pose significant crowd pressure risks
particularly if it is full or nearly full. To accommodate such a crowd safely may necessitate substantial
remedial work. Alternatively, consideration m ight be given to accepting a much smaller num ber of
spectators w ho, properly dispersed, could be accommodated safely w ith o u t having to incur costly
repairs, im provem ents or alterations. Therefore, the first step, using the Guide’s criteria, is to assess
how many spectators can be accommodated safely given the existing condition of the ground. In other
words, determine a safe ground capacity based on each section of viewing accommodation, entry and exit
route. This requires properly detailed plans drawn to scale (1:200) of the ground.



T he problem s
1 7. There are essentially fo u r types of safety problem to be considered w ith in a ground and its
im m ediate surroundings, all of which are inter-related.

1 8. U n d e r f o o t c o n d it io n s : The f ir s t hazard is tr ip p in g o r fa llin g w h ic h m a y have s e rio u s
consequences fo r the individual concerned, but can also lead to a serious incident involving others.
This type o f problem can be remedied by proper care maintenance; and attention to good building
practice.

                                                             6
19.    C ro w d pressures: The second type in volves crow d pressures and is p o te n tia lly the m ore
serious. Careful a tte n tio n m ust be paid to avoid o ve rc ro w d in g , to restrain surges and s im ila r
pressures on the terraces, and to ensure free m ovem ent throu g ho u t the entry/exit systems. When
large crowds are present and densities are high, pressures build up w ith in the crowd either through
m otion or swaying which make it difficult, or even impossible, fo r individuals to control their own
m ovem ents. Under these conditions crowd pressures can escalate to a dangerous level and if a
person stum bles or falls the crowd cannot adapt to avoid them or to stop to help. Since this type of
danger arises fro m crowd pressures its remedy lies in their removal or restraint w ith in safe limits.
These dangers arise particularly on terraces and in entry/exit routes.

2 0 . Emergency evacuation: The third type o f safety problem cannot be divorced from the second
and in some ways is an extreme version of it. The danger arises from emergency situations which
can develop fo llo w in g , fo r example, an outbreak of crowd disorder or fire. The orderly evacuation of
large crowds may, under emergency conditions, become a serious problem.

2 1 . Fire: the fou rth is the risk from fire, particularly where there is a large crowd in a confined area
o f an elevated covered stand where spectators are in the upper levels, the materials and construction
of which m ight in themselves constitute a fire risk (see Chapter 13).


O verco m in g th e problem s
2 2 . G o o d g r o u n d m a n a g e m e n t: The im p o rta n c e o f g o o d g ro u n d m a n a g e m e n t c a n n o t be
em phasised to o stro n g ly (see Chapter 2). Much o f this Guide contains advice on m atters w hich
should fo rm part o f the general upkeep and m aintenance o f a sports ground. If follow ed , it w ill
reduce or elim inate risks to spectators and in the long term should prove cost effective by preventing
serious defects. A w e ll m aintained and w ell-run venue makes com m ercial sense and may attract
more events and a greater number of spectators.

2 3 . Im proving safety b y n ew design: As m entioned in paragraph 11 aBove, new design w o rk can
provide an o pp o rtu n ity to enhance spectator safety and should be given the highest priority when
deciding upon the design, layout, materials and loading of new buildings, or alterations in a ground.
Close attention should be paid to new and existing exits and exit routes, slip-resistant surfaces,
lig h tin g and ease o f m aintenance. A ll parts o f th e v ie w in g areas sh ou ld alw ays have a clear,
unobstructed v ie w o f the playing area and designs should take account of the need to facilitate
effective stewarding, which plays an im portant role in controlling crowd m ovem ent (see Chapter 16).

2 4 . New design w o rk also offers the chance to im prove am enities and standards of co m fort fo r
spectators. A ttention to decor, careful planning o f catering or other refreshment areas can encourage
spectators to arrive in good tim e, influence the use of different ingress and egress routes and may
contribute tow ards im proving crowd behaviour. Where segregation of spectators is a feature, special
attention is needed in order to ensure a good standard of am enity is available in each segregated
part of the ground.

2 5 . Care and maintenance: A lthough controlling crowd numbers may serve to reduce some risks to
an acceptable level, remedial w ork is likely to be necessary to overcome others. Obvious defects such
as trip hazards (particularly at the head o f stairs or steps), loose or weak handrails or guard-rails, and
obstructed exits or exit routes, should be rectified as part o f a continuous program m e of remedial
care and maintenance o f a ground.

2 6 . Structures should be sound (see Chapter 4) and inspected by suitably qualified persons (see
Chapter 5). Design, layout and signposting of entrances, exits, entry and exit routes require particular
attention so as to ensure that they can safely cope w ith the num ber of spectators w ho w ill use them
(see Chapters 6 and 7). Attention should be paid to the condition of terraces, view ing slopes (see
Chapter 9) and crush barriers (see Chapter 10). Broken, uneven terraces cause stum bling. Crush
b a rrie rs serve to break up cro w d pressures and help c o n tro l m o v e m e n t fro m the terra ces by
regulating the rate o f arrival at exits to suit their capacity, and encourage the form ation of orderly
queues.

2 7 . Fire precautions: Proper precautions should be taken to m inim ise the risk of fire. Accum ulation
o f litter is a prim e potential source o f fire but can be elim inated by regular, frequent inspections,

                                                             7
g oo d housekeeping, m aintenance and safe p ro v is io n over the care and storage o f fla m m a b le
materials. The nature and type of materials used in the construction of covered areas and stands w ill
strongly influence the safety measures required in them.

2. M ANAGEM ENT RESPONSIBILITY

E ffe c tiv e ground m an ag em en t is an essential e le m e n t in achieving safety. M a n a g em e n t
should co n stan tly lo o k to im p ro ve s a fe ty standards.

G eneral D u ty
2 8 . The responsibility fo r the safety o f spectators at the ground lies at all tim es w ith the ground
m anagem ent ie those w h o stage the event and/or adm iniste r the ground. Local a u th o rity safety
officers, police and fire officers w ill advise management on how to discharge this responsibility and,
in certain circumstances, may require measures to be taken in order to achieve reasonable safety
standards. This does not, however, exonerate the ground management from its responsibility fo r the
safety of spectators.


S a fe ty P olicy
2 9 . As part o f the drive fo r success of the club, team or individu a l event, senior m anagem ent,
directors and board members m ust devote tim e, effort and resources to safety management at the
ground, both in its day to day use or fo r any special event. There should be a w ritten policy of safety
fo r spectators and employees covering the safety objectives and the means of achieving them. This
should be known to and understood by all staff and vo lu n ta ry workers w ho m ay be involved in
g ro u n d o p e ra tio n s . T his p o lic y s h o u ld be kept u nd e r re v ie w by m a n ag em en t and revised as
necessary. Annex A summarises issues which should be addressed by the policy.

3 0 . The management should require regular, periodic reports on safety measures taken and on pro­
gress on those in hand. They should ensure that they are made aware of details of any minor incidents
(which might suggest underlying problems) and the action taken to rectify t|iem. Such details should be
kept in written form and, together w ith the policy statement on safety, should be available for inspection.



S a fe ty O ffic e r
3 1 . There should be an appointed safety officer w ho should be of sufficient competence, status and
a u th o rity effectively to take re sp o n sib ility fo r safety at the ground and be able to authorise and
supervise safety measures. The safety officer should be accountable to the most senior management
or Board of Directors to w hom the right of direct access is essential.

3 2 . The safety officer or an appointed deputy should be in attendance at a central control point
when an event takes place. The sole duty of that person during the course of the event should be that
of safety, and he or she should be easily identifiable. All staff should know the location o f the central
control point, w h o is in charge of safety on the day in question and the line of com m unication.

3 3 . A program m e o f checks, inspections, tests, training and remedial w ork should be drawn up so
as to elim inate or m inim ise the potential risks to spectators. The safety officer should be responsible
fo r ensuring that such inspections are carried out on all structures, installations and equipm ent so
that they are safe and fit for the purpose fo r which they were intended. The details o f any remedial
w ork carried out including the dates of completion should be recorded. Adequate resources to carry
o ut these tasks should be made available.


E m ergency Plan
3 4 . Plans should be made to deal w ith emergencies. Consultation between management, police,
fire and ambulance services should take place in order to produce an agreed plan o f action, including
access fo r emergency vehicles, fo r all foreseeable incidents (see also paragraph 42 vi).



S ta ffin g
3 5 . W hile the public are in the ground management should ensure that sufficient staff are on duty
to cover entrances, exits (including any emergency exits) and other strategic points or areas.
3 6 . S taff training, particularly for stewards, in carrying out both their normal duties and ensuring
that they are aware of their role in an emergency situation, should be given high priority. All staff
should be capable of undertaking the duties allocated to them . They should be informed in w riting
w h a t th e ir d utie s are, h o w to e ffe c t th e m and fro m w h o m to seek advice if in d o u b t. These
in s tru c tio n s should be available fo r in spe ctio n. The safety o ffic e r sh ou ld also carry o u t active
supervision and organise emergency drills to maintain standards (see Chapter 16).


R estrictions
3 7 . W here restrictions on crowd numbers to parts of the ground are required fo r safety reasons
they m ust be imposed and enforced. Similarly, if part o f the ground is required to be closed, this
m ust be done, and it m ust not be opened up fo r any reason unless measures have been taken
beforehand to remove the dangers which led to its closure in the first place and approval given by
the appropriate authority to re-open it.


Fire s a fe ty
3 8 . Managem ent should ensure that structural fire protection of buildings is adequate, and that fire
w arning systems are correctly installed and properly maintained in accordance w ith manufacturers'
instructions or British Standards. Suitable fire-fighting equipm ent must be provided and maintained
to the standards specified in this Guide (see Chapter 13).


First A id Provision
3 9 . A p ro p e rly equ ip pe d and staffed First A id room and su itab le medical fa cilitie s sh ou ld be
provided in consultation w ith the local Health A uthority's Chief Ambulance Officer (see Annex B).


M iscellaneous
4 0 . W here a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected fo r an event, admission should norm ally
be by ticket only.

4 1 . General repair and m aintenance should be undertaken w ith spectator safety in m ind; litte r
should not be allowed to accumulate. M inor repairs should be quickly and properly carried out.



S u m m ary o f M a n a g e m e n t R esponsibilities
4 2 . A sum m ary of managem ent responsibilities is contained below:-
       i.     A ppoint a safety officer.
       ii.    W here required, apply fo r and ensure com pliance w ith the term s and conditions of a
              safety certificate or other notice covering the safety at the ground.
       iii.   Draw up and keep up to date plans o f the ground; maintain the general fabric of the
              ground, and arrange an annual detailed inspection.
       iv.    Arrange an annual inspection of all crush barriers, handrails/guard-rails and ensure a rep­
              resentative sample are tested, (keeping a record of those tested and results of the tests).
       v.     Maintain and test all electrical installations fo r emergency lighting, com m unications and
              fire w a rn in g /d e te c tio n , and fire -fig h tin g e q u ip m e n t in accordance w ith the relevant
              British Standards and Codes of Practice.
       vi.    Prepare in conjunction w ith the police, fire and ambulance services contingency plans,
              including arrangements fo r stopping or delaying an event, for:
              a.   various emergency situations including fire;
              b.   possible crowd disturbance;
              c.   coping w ith an exceptionally large num ber of spectators arriving at the ground; and
              d.   the failure o f any detection, w arning, lighting or communications system or other
                   equipment.

                                                          10
      vii.    Devise a clear system of com m unications inside and outside the ground (including direct
              com m unication w ith any police control w ith in the ground).
      viii    Take necessary fire prevention and precautions measures.
      ix.     Consult the fire a u th o rity about emergency evacuation, fire risk and provision of fire ­
              fig htin g equipm ent.
      x.      Consult the police, fire and ambulance services on access fo r emergency vehicles.
      xi.     Store safely and away from public areas any flam m able materials and any accumulations
              of com bustible waste w hich cannot be cleared from the ground before the next event.
      xii.    Provide firs t aid facilities and first aid staff.
      xiii.   Consult w ith the police to arrange adequate policing and police facilities and ensure that,
              where the police are to be present at the ground, there is a clear understanding of the
              division of duties and responsibility between them and the management.
      xiv     Recruit, train and deploy stewards and organise and carry out emergency evacuation
              drills using those staff.
      xv.     Staff exit gates at all tim es when the public are in the ground and ensure that such gates
              can be, and are, opened im m ediately fro m the inside in an emergency.
      xvi.    Ensure that all gangways and exit routes are unobstructed and capable of being used to
              their full capacity at all tim es when the public are in the ground.
      xvii. Provide directional flow, exit and emergency exit signs.
      xviii. Before each event:
              a. test the operation of exit doors and gates;
              b. test lighting, com m unications and fire warning/detection systems;
              c. check the ground fo r any accum ulations of com bustible litter, especially below stands
                 and in exit routes; and fo r any source of potential missiles;
              d. check security of any container used fo r storage of com bustible material;
              e. check the operation of the turnstiles and metering system;
              f.   check that all entry/exit routes are clear of obstruction;
              g. ensure that there are sufficient stewards fo r the event and inform the police ground
                 com m ander before the ground is open to the public.
      xix.    A fter each event:
              a. carry out a general visual inspection fo r signs of damage;
              b. liaise w ith police so as to gain full benefit from any debriefing about crowd control.
      xx.     Keep records of:
              a. attendance figures;
              b. all inspections and tests, any defects noted and the remedial/other action taken;
              c. any accident or reported incident which m ight have led to an accident;
              d. staff training and emergency evacuation drills.
4 3 . The managem ent should ensure that details of all consultations, arrangements, plans between
them and the police, fire and ambulance services are notified to the relevant local authority if there is
a safety certificate issued in respect of the ground or stand(s) w ith in the ground.

3. SPECTATORS WITH DISABILITIES

P ro p er provision to a cc o m m o d a te safely people w ith d is ab ilities should be m ade a t all
grounds.

G eneral
4 4 . The safety measures set out in the Guide should not be construed in such a w ay as to place
undue restrictions on people w ith disabilities.


P eople w ith im paired vision
4 5 . Signposting (see paragraphs 84 and 101) especially fire or other safety signs, should be sited so
that as fa r as possible they can be easily seen and readily distinguishable by those w ith impaired
vision or colour perception. Advice is available from the Royal National Institute fo r the Blind or the
National Federation of the Blind of the UK.


P eople w ith im p aired hearing
4 6 . A lth o u g h p eo p le w ith im p a ire d h ea rin g m a y e xp e rie n ce d iffic u lty in h ea rin g m essages
b ro a d c a s t on a syste m d e s ig n e d fo r th o se w ith n o rm a l h e a rin g (see C h a p te r 14) a h e a rin g
im p a irm e n t does not mean that in all cases a person is insensitive to sound and that they do not
have a sufficiently clear perception o f all conventional alarm signals. Where this is not the case it is
reasonable to expect spectators w ho have been alerted to prepare fo r evacuation to warn those w ith
impaired hearing.

4 7 . W here they exist, electronic score boards and television and television m onitors should be used
to give inform ation on evacuation.


P eople w ith im paired m o b ility
4 8 . A lthough it is unlikely that anyone whose m o b ility is severely impaired w ill occupy standing
accom m od a tion they w ill often w ish to occupy seated accom m odation, perhaps w ith frie n d s or
relatives, in stands. Arrangements should therefore exist to meet such wishes wherever it is possible
to do so, fo r exam ple by the provision of wheelchair spaces w ith in the seated area, preferably in
different parts so that there is a choice of seating position. Such provision should take account of the
sightlines available fro m the allocated areas to ensure that occupants have an unrestricted view.

4 9 . W herever possible there sh ou ld be m ore than one ingress/egress fo r those w ith im paired
m obility. A ltho u gh m ovem ent to and fro m accom m odation at ground level is easier fo r users of
wheelchairs, consideration should be given to the means by which they can be accommodated on
other levels w ith o u t prejudicing their safety or the safety o f others.


W heelchairs
5 0 . W here a person leaves a wheelchair in order to occupy a seat, provision should be made fo r the
w heelchair to be readily accessible w ith o u t it causing an obstruction in a gangw ay or exit route.
Those w h o remain in a wheelchair should be accommodated so as not to obstruct the m ovem ent of
others.


S u p p o rt Facilities
5 1 . Ramps which are to be used by wheelchair users should conform to BS 5810.

52.   S upport services and facilities fo r disabled people should also be available w ith in the stand.

5 3 . New design w ork fo r stands should take account of guidance in BS 5588 Part 8 (Code of Practice
fo r means of escape fo r disabled people). Where, because o f constraints posed by existing buildings,
it is not possible or practicable to apply the Code fully, alternative ways of meeting its objectives
should be sought.

                                                           12
5 4 . The arrangements described above should be in addition to any special provision made fo r the
adm ission (often at pitch level) o f vehicles used by people w ith impaired mobility. The location of
such vehicles should be agreed w ith the relevant safety authority in order to ensure that access to the
ground by emergency vehicles and means of escape are not comprom ised.


Use o f lifts in an em ergency
5 5 . A lift should be used as a means o f escape fro m a stand o n ly if it is an evacuation lift or
fire fig h tin g lift operated under the direction and control of an appointed steward designated w ith
specific responsibility fo r its use in an evacuation using an agreed evacuation procedure. BS 5588
Part 8 recommendations, which specify the facilities that need to be incorporated in an evacuation
lift, should be follow ed.




                                                  13
4 . GENERAL FABRIC A N D STRUCTURAL MATTERS

A ll co m p o n en ts, in s talla tio n s and stru c tu res such as terraces, stands, stairs, barriers and
pylons, should have th e s tren g th , d u ra b ility , and should be m a in tain e d in such c o nd ition
and arranged in such a m anner as to p e rfo rm properly th e ir required functio n s.

G eneral
5 6 . The design and construction of buildings and installations should be in accordance w ith good
engineering and building practice, as set out in the relevant British Standard specifications and codes
o f practice. They should be properly maintained and repaired by suitably qualified persons. Specialist
advice fro m appropriately qualified engineers belonging to a recognised Institution should be sought
to assess the safety and strength of load-bearing elem ents in buildings and installations such as
crush barriers, (see Chapter 10) brick/block walls etc (see Chapter 9, paragraph 157).

5 7 . Walls, including boundary walls, and fences which are to withstand crowd pressures, should be
designed and maintained to w ithstand such pressures safely. Allowance should be made fo r forces
sim ultaneously and independently induced by other factors eg w ind forces or attached installations.



H eadroom
5 8 . All parts o f the ground used by the general public should have m inim um headroom o f not less
than 2 metres. Exit routes should wherever possible have a headroom of 2.4 metres.

5 9 . Precautions should be taken to prevent people fro m clim bing on to roofs, pylons, hoardings and
other structures. Where possible such structures should be fitted w ith unclimbable devices eg stout
barriers or close-boarded enclosures. Spikes, barbed w ire etc should o n ly be installed above the
m in im u m headroom specified in paragraph 58 above and preferably at a m inim um height of 2.4
metres fro m the base. Spikes or other sim ilar devices should not be installed on pitch perim eter
fences. Nor should such fences have sections overhanging or returning inwards tow ards spectators
(see Chapter 18).



E lec trica l in s ta lla tio n
6 0 . A ll electrical installations should com ply w ith the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 and also
w ith the Electricity Supply Regulations 1988. New electrical installations should also com ply w ith the
edition o f the W iring Regulations of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) current at the date of
in s ta lla tio n . The IEE C o m p le tio n C ertificate as prescribed fo r e lectrical in s ta lla tio n s in the IEE
Regulations should be retained by the proprietor of the ground.

6 1 . The installation should be regularly inspected and an IEE Inspection Certificate as prescribed in
the IEE regulations should be obtained. The interval between inspections should be no longer than
five years, and necessary repairs p ro m ptly carried out.

6 2 . A diagram of the main electrical circuit should be fixed in a position easily accessible to the
technical staff. A ll main switches or circuit breakers should be clearly labelled to indicate the circuits
which they control.

6 3 . A ll cables and c o n d u c to rs o f w irin g system s sh o u ld be sited so th a t th e y are, as fa r as
practicable, inaccessible to the public and should be enclosed throughout in a protective covering of
material w hich has sufficient strength to resist mechanical damage - fo r example armoured cables,
sheathed cables protected by screwed metal conduit, trunking com plying w ith BS 4678 Part 1 or Part
4, or rigid PVC conduit com plying w ith relevant British Standards. PVC conduit should not be used in
confined areas because o f fire smoke hazard.

6 4 . The base of any flo od lig h ting tow er should be earthed in accordance w ith BS 6651 which also
contains advice on bonding and earthing fo r lightning protection.

                                                          14
Lig hting
6 5 . Where the natural lighting in any section of the ground accessible to the public is deficient,
adequate a rtificia l lig h tin g should be provided. If the g ro un d is to be used after dark, all parts
accessible to the public should be provided w ith means for lighting adequate to enable them to see
the ir w ay into, w ith in and out o f the ground. These provisions are particularly im portant in relation to
entry and exit routes and stairways used by the public. Emergency lighting should be provided and
conform to BS 5266: Part 1 (see Chapter 15).




                                                      15
5. INSPECTIONS A N D TESTS

In spections and te s ts should be carried o u t by su itab ly q u a lified persons on b e h a lf o f th e
m a n ag e m e n t to ensure th a t th e s a fe ty standards are m ain tain ed .

A n nu al Inspection
66. A detailed inspection o f the ground, in clu din g all com ponents and installations, should be
arranged annually by the managem ent in order to ensure that load-bearing elements are capable of
w ith stan d ing the pressures to w hich they are likely to be subjected and that they are fit fo r their
intended purpose (see also paragraphs 56-57). Inspection should be carried out by a person w ith a
relevant, recognised professional qualification, and w ith experience o f inspecting structures.

6 7 . E ngineers c o m m is s io n e d to assess s tru c tu ra l sa fe ty o f b u ild in g s m ay fin d th e appraisal
techniques recommended by the Institution of Structural Engineers (ISE) in the "Appraisal o f Existing
S tru c tu re s " o f assistance. Hard and fast rules on the e xte n t to w h ich a s tru ctu ra l appraisal is
necessary fo r in d ivid u a l b u ild in g s are d iffic u lt to lay dow n: much w ill depend upon the type of
installation, its size, condition, materials used in construction and standard o f maintenance. A full
appraisal is unlikely to be necessary unless defects are identified or in evidence from the analysis of
inform ation on the structure and visual inspection.

68. Inspection and testing o f crush barriers, handrails and other protective barriers should be
carried out in accordance w ith Chapter 10 and Annex D o f this Guide.




O th e r in spections
6 9 . W arning, detection, lighting and public address systems are vulnerable to vandalism, and this
sh o u ld be borne in m in d w h en in s ta llin g th e m . A ll a u to m a tic fire d ete ction and fire w a rn in g ,
e m ergency lig h tin g and p ub lic address system s should be tested 24 hours before an event, in
accordance w ith the methods laid down in BS 5839: Part 1 and BS 5266: Part 1 respectively.

7 0 . Turnstiles and metering systems should be tested before each event in order to ensure that they
are in proper w orking order.

7 1 . There should be contingency plans in case any of these systems is not operating properly and
cannot be rectified before the event. Such plans should be form ulated, in consultation w ith the local
a u th o rity (if a sa fe ty ce rtifica te is in force), police and fire services, fo r the use o f acceptable
substitute measures or (if necessary) the closure of relevant areas o f spectator accom modation until
the fault is remedied.

7 2 . Before an event, and at m ajor soccer grounds in particular, steps should be taken to ensure that
the ground does not contain any accessible items which could be used as missiles.

7 3 . The ground should be inspected before, during and after each event to ensure that there are no
accum ulations of com bustible waste and that any hazardous materials (if essential to be stored) are
safely stored well away fro m public areas.




D e fo rm a tio n /D a m a g e
7 4 . Following each event, a general visual inspection of the ground should be made fo r signs of
damage which m ight create a potential danger to the public. Particular attention should be paid to
the condition of terraces, view ing slopes and stairways. Crush barriers and balustrades should be
exam ined fo r defo rm a tio n o r any other overt signs o f weakness. The fire precautions measures
should also be inspected fo r damage. Alarm and other electrical installations should be checked to
ensure continued compliance w ith the relevant British Standards. Turnstiles should be checked for
damage w hich m ight im pair the ir efficiency.

R eco rd s

7 5 . Records should be kept and maintained of all inspections and tests together w ith a record of
remedial actions taken. The required level o f competence o f those carrying out the test should be
specified and the record o f the results certified by those carrying out the w ork together w ith their
qualification and status.

76.   Annex C provides a tabulation o f tests and inspections and their frequency o f operation.

 S p e c ta to r s e n te r in g t h e g ro u n d s h o u ld be a c c u r a te ly c o u n te d a n d t h e i r n u m b e r
 c o n tro lle d in o rd e r to ensure th a t o v erc ro w d in g does no t occur. S p ectato rs should be
 a d m itte d a t a ra te w h ic h is co m p atib le w ith th e dispersal arrangem ents fo r th e m inside
 th e ground.

 Turnstiles
 7 7 . The num ber and location o f turnstiles control not o nly the rate of adm ission but, to a large
 extent, the dispersal o f spectators w ith in a ground to the particular sections. S ufficient turnstiles
 should therefore be provided in order to adm it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds
 are kept w a itin g fo r adm ission and yet at no faster rate than the arrangem ents fo r d is trib u tin g
 spectators w ith in the ground permit.

7 8 . Each section o f view ing accom modation should be served by its own metered turnstiles which
keep a tally o f the num ber o f spectators adm itted to that section. Where a section is served by a bank
or banks o f turnstiles, arrangements must ensure that the metering system is capable o f recording
the total o f all the turnstiles fo r that section. The total should be quickly available at any given tim e so
that appropriate action can be taken once a pre-determined figure (ie a figure which is less than the
capacity fo r the section) has been reached. This is especially im portant if a capacity or near capacity
c ro w d is e xpected o r if a p a rtic u la r se ctio n o f a g ro u n d is know n to be p o p u la r o r lik e ly to
accommodate an unusually high num ber of spectators for a particular event.

7 9 . The correlation between each section o f the view ing accom m odation in the ground and the
turnstiles serving it should be such as to ensure that all spectators intended to be adm itted to that
accom modation and w ho are to pass through the turnstiles can do so w ith in one hour. If that cannot
be achieved, the capacity o f th a t vie w in g accom m od a tion in tha t part o f the g round should be
reduced accordingly, or the num ber of turnstiles increased (see also Chapter 19).

8 0 . The m axim um rate at w hich spectators can pass through turnstiles w ill depend on a variety of
factors such as the design and age of the equipm ent, the ability o f the operator and the ticketing
arrangem ents. The rate o f adm ission at each tu rn s tile w ill therefore depend g re a tly upon local
circumstances. The through-put or flow-rate through turnstiles should therefore be measured at least
once a year and recorded. Where a recorded flow -rate is less than 660 persons per turnstile per hour
the actual fig ure should be used fo r calculation purposes o f paragraph 79 above. The m axim um
upper figure fo r calculation purposes should not exceed 660 persons per hour.



C o m p u ter M o n ito rin g
8 1 . Centralised com puter m onitoring should be installed wherever practicable and at all grounds in
the 1st and 2nd Division of the English Football League, Premier Division o f the Scottish Football
League and grounds used for international or other m ajor sporting events.


E ntrances and E ntry Routes
8 2 . Entry and exit routes are often com m on to each other and in such cases the considerations
w hich apply to exit routes therefore apply also to entry routes (see paragraphs 91-96 of Chapter 7).
These routes should not be obstructed. Am enities such as refreshment kiosks or toilets should be
located away from the area of the turnstiles, entrances and entry/exit routes.

8 3 . Entrances to each part o f the ground should, where practicable, be designed and located so as
to allow fo r the even distribution of spectators and to prevent local pressure building up outside the
ground. They should be sited so that the flo w o f people from them is, as far as possible, evenly
d istrib u te d to the v ie w in g a ccom m od a tion . W here th is d is trib u tio n is uneven and gives rise to
congestion at an entrance consideration w ill have to be given to changing the turnstile arrangements
o r s itin g in o rd e r to e nco u rag e b ette r use o f under-used entrances. A d d itio n a l o r a lte rn a tive
measures should also be taken: fo r example im proved sign-posting and increased stewarding either
inside or outside the ground.

                                                           18
S ig nposting
8 4 . Clear, comprehensive signposting should be provided in order to show the routes to different
parts of the ground. Tickets (where issued) should clearly identify the location of the accom modation
fo r w hich the y have been issued. Inform ation on the ticket should correlate w ith the inform ation
provided both inside and outside the ground. Colour coding o f tickets should be considered and
retained ticket stubs should contain inform ation which w ill help guide spectators once they are inside
the ground. Large scale wall maps showing location should also be considered.


P rogram m es
8 5 . W here possible, program m es should include a plan o f the ground indicating the entry/exit
routes to or from different parts o f the ground and their destination.


C ro w d B uild-Up
8 6 . Dangerous overcrow ding can be caused if spectators are able to force their w ay into a ground
already full or nearly full by scaling or breaking through boundary w alls or fences or the gates in
them . To avoid this danger such walls, fences and gates should be of appropriate height and strength
and should not provide the o pp o rtu n ity fo r hand or fo o t holds which m ight assist clim bing. They
should be regularly inspected.

8 7 . Installation of closed circuit television should be considered in order to assist in the m onitoring
o f crowd densities outside the ground and throughout the ingress/egress routes (see paragraph 264
Chapter 14).

88 . Contingency plans should be drawn up w ith the police in order to deal w ith situations where
u n d u ly large crow ds have gathered outside. Local knowledge of the ground and crow d patterns
should be taken into account in draw ing up contingency plans. Opening additional or under-used
e n tra n c e s m a y have to be c o n s id e re d . H o w e ve r, u n d e r no c irc u m s ta n c e s s h o u ld th e re be
uncontrolled admission into the ground.

T h e re should be a s m o o th , unim peded passage thro u g h an e x it route and a fre e flo w o f
p eople fro m one e le m e n t to th e n e x t u n til th e y reach th e boundary o f th e ground.

8 9 . It is generally recognised that a period o f great risk to crowd safety is at the tim e o f leaving.
Pressures can be set up w ith in a departing crow d; such pressures can and must be contained and
controlled by careful attention to the detailed design of barriers (Chapter 10), stairways (Chapter 8),
gangways (Chapter 9) and exits.

9 0 . A d d itio n a l c o n sid e ra tio n w h ich m ust be given to egress fro m covered stands and seated
accom m odation is given in paragraphs 177-179 of Chapter 11.



E xit R outes/System s
9 1 . A sm ooth free flo w throu g h an exit route to the outside is best achieved by co ntro lling the
crow d flo w at the beginning of it, so that departing spectators are held back in a relatively safe place,
fo r exam ple on view ing accom m odation, enabling access to the exit route at a calculated rate. That is
to say the capacity of the first elem ent of the exit route from the viewing accom modation should be
no g re a te r th a n a ny s u b s e q u e n t e le m e n t. The e x it ro u te w ill th e n be able to a cco m m o d a te
th ro u g h o u t its length and discharge spectators at a rate com patible w ith that at w hich they enter into
the route.

9 2 . If there is any deviation from the recommended guidelines which creates a potential danger,
that section should be closed. Until remedial action has been taken, a reduction should be made
a c co rd in g ly in the spectator capacity o f the section o f the g round it serves; ie the e xit route is
excluded fro m the capacity calculations.

9 3 . The m in im um w idth o f an exit route should be 1.1 metres. If any part of an exit route is less
than 1 metre w ide that route should be excluded fro m the exit capacity calculations. For capacities of
exit routes see Chapter 19, paragraphs 326-330.

9 4 . Exit systems should ensure that in the event of an incident which blocks the usual exit route
spectators w ill be able to use an a lternative e xit route o r routes. In a pp ro pria te cases fo rw a rd
e va cu a tio n on to the pitch can fo rm part o f the e m e rge n cy evacuation ro u te (see C hapter 13
paragraph 236).

9 5 . There should be no "fu n n e llin g " effect causing people to converge on a narrow er means of
access or egress. This w ill slo w dow n the rate at w hich people can pass thro u g h the entire exit
system and cause them to pack more closely together. However a narrowing in the exit route m ay be
acceptable when it is preceded by an open space or "reservoir area" where the holding capacity is
sufficient to contain the spectators held up because o f the difference in the flo w rate into and out of
the reservoir area (but see also paragraph 96 below). The capacity of the reservoir areas should be
calculated using the appropriate flo w rate given in Chapter 20 and the recommended exit tim e given
in paragraph 97 below. A packing density of 40 persons per 10 square metres o f the area available for
standing w ith in the reservoir area is the maximum for safety. Arrangements should be such as to
prevent this being exceeded.

9 6 . Reservoir areas should be avoided wherever possible and should not be permitted w ith in 45
metres of any com bustible building w ith in the ground eg a tim b e r stand, or w ith in 15 metres of any
non-com bustible building w ith in the ground.



Egress tim e
9 7 . Crowd flo w tends to become turbulent when it takes more than about 7 minutes to vacate an
area o f terraced spectator accom m odation. In these conditions the rate of flo w may be reduced and
in d iv id u a ls can lose c o n tro l o ve r th e ir ow n m o ve m en ts w h ich m ay increase the p ote n tia l fo r

                                                           20
accidents. Sufficient exits from each section of view ing accom modation should be provided so that
all spectators can leave that area and pass into a free flow ing exit route system w ith in 8 minutes or
less. This applies to both standing and seated areas even though spectators norm ally vacate seated
accom m odation in a more leisurely fashion.

9 8 . Once spectators have passed into the exit system they should be able to move at the same
speed throu g ho u t its length. Calculation of exit capacity is shown in Chapter 19, paragraphs 326-330,
using the m axim um recommended flo w rates given in Chapter 20.

9 9 . The exit routes available fo r use by spectators in an emergency are in many instances the same
as those used by them in normal circumstances - fo r example fro m the upper tiers of a stand. If the
ca p a city o f th e e x it ro u te s is c o n s id e re d in s u ffic ie n t fo r e va cu a tio n purposes the n u m b e r o f
spectators occupying the accom modation w ill have to reflect that exit route capacity.

1 0 0 . In some cases exit routes, not norm ally used by spectators, may be made available fo r them
where the playing area or perimeter track is used as part of the emergency evacuation route but does
not form part o f the normal egress route. In such circumstances there should be a route from the
playing area or perim eter track to an exit from the ground.




S ignposting
1 0 1 . A comprehensive system o f signposting w hich clearly indicates routes to the various parts of
the ground, and to exits from the ground, should be provided. Signs relating to fire safety should be
in accordance w ith BS 5499: Part 1 and other safety signs should be in accordance w ith BS 5378: Part
1. E xit gates th e m s e lv e s sh o u ld be c le a rly s ig n p o s te d , p re fe ra b ly using illu m in a te d sig n s in
accordance w ith BS 5499: Part 2 or Part 3. Directional signs should be provided to encourage crowds
in any particular section to flo w in one direction when leaving the ground and should, w herever
practicable, provide inform ation on the destination o f the exit route (eg north side car-park, High
Street) so as to p ro vide confidence to people using them , especially if th e y are evacuating the
premises.




E xit routes
1 0 2 . Exit routes should be kept clear o f obstructions. In particular, no catering, sales or toilet facility
should be situated in such a w ay that it, or any queue it attracts, obstructs an exit route.

1 0 3 . Where there is a simple exit route, ie a direct passage from the accom modation area to the exit
gate fro m the ground, every part o f that route should be able to accommodate the flo w from the
terrace or stand exit.

1 0 4 . For a more com plex exit system which combines a num ber o f exit routes and/or offers a choice
o f alternative routes to exits, the system should be analysed in the form of a network in order to
check that the capacity o f the exit from the terrace or the stand is sufficient to ensure a free flo w of
spectators to the various exits from the ground. Where branching o f routes gives spectators a choice
of paths, the proportion o f the crowd likely to use each path should be derived from local knowledge,

show ing them on the plans. These plans should be kept w ith the draw ings o f the section o f the
ground to w hich they relate. Any changes to the ground which affect the entry/exit routes should be
identified on the network plan. An example o f a network plan is given in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. Other
examples are contained in Chapter 19.

E xit doors and G ates
1 0 6 . No door or gate form ing part of an escape route should be locked or fastened in such a w ay
that it cannot easily and im m ediately be opened by those using that route in an emergency.

1 07 . A ll exit doors on an exit route should always be capable of opening outwards so that crowds
can escape in an em ergency w ith o u t obstruction. This is p articularly im p o rta n t fo r doors w ith in
covered stands and at the fo o t of stairways.

108 . A ll doors on a normal exit route should be secured in the fu lly open position before the end of
play. When open, no door should obstruct any gangway passage, stairway or landing.

1 0 9 . A ll exit gates from the ground should open outwards. Where this is impracticable, fo r example
because they w o uld cause an obstruction on a public highway, the gates should be resited (ie put
fu rth e r back) w ith in the e xit ro u te th e y serve, or p ro visio n made fo r tw o -w a y opening. W here
practicable exit gates should be sited adjacent to entrances. There should be no obstructions and no
changes in level at exit doors.

1 1 0 . Sliding or roller-shutter gates should not be used because they are incapable of being opened
when pressure is exerted in the direction of crowd flo w and have mechanisms or runways which are
vulnerable to jam m ing.

1 1 1 . A ll exit gates, unless secured in an open position, should be staffed at all tim es w h ile the
ground is used by the public.

1 1 2 . Facilities should be provided in order to eject anyone whose presence is unwanted and to
enable people to leave the ground at any time. For this purpose a num ber of reversible turnstiles or,
preferably, pass doors, so operated as to lim it the opening to the passage to one person at a time,
should be provided. Reversible turnstiles are not acceptable as a means of escape from a ground and
should not form any part of, or be installed into, the normal or emergency exit system of the ground.
8. STAIRWAYS A N D RAMPS

T h e d is p o s itio n an d c o n s tru c tio n o f s ta irw a y s and ram p s should be such as to help
p ro v id e a sm ooth and unim peded ingress and egress fo r spectators under all conditions
set o u t in C h apters 6 and 7.

1 1 3 . For the purpose of this section the term "sta irw a y " has the meaning given to it in the Glossary
(Annex F) and is distinct fro m a radial gangway on a terrace or in a stand. Guidelines on terrace
gangways is given in Chapter 9, paragraphs 143-151 and fo r stands in Chapter 11, paragraphs ISO-
182.

1 1 4 . M ovem ent on stairways, especially downwards, poses a considerable potential risk to crowds
both in norm al circumstances such as at the end of an event, or in an emergency. The effects of
stu m b lin g , pushing, jo stlin g, and congestion are p o te ntia lly dangerous if, as a result, the crow d
su dd e nly surges forw a rd. S im ilarly, if sections o f the crow d decide, w ith o u t w a rn in g, to change
direction the resultant turm o il can have serious consequences. Steep ramps can cause or exacerbate
uncontrolled forw ard m ovem ent and lead to an accident.

1 1 5 . Stairways should, therefore, m inim ise hazards by having u nifo rm ity of w idth, going and risers,
secure footing and a suitable gradient. They should be w ide enough to allow free m ovem ent but also
provide, as far as possible, everyone w ith access to a handrail. The head of the stairway should be so
designed that flo w onto it is uniform across its w id th and so that crowd pressures cannot easily be
generated. Flights should not provide long, uncontrolled paths down which crowd pressures and
surges can be created. Adequate separation should be provided between channels so that there is no
overspill from one channel to another.

D isp o sitio n o f s ta irw a ys
1 1 6 . Stairways should be carefully positioned to take advantage of natural light and ventilation.
W here the natural lighting is deficient the stairw ay should be adequately lit by artificial lig h t (see
Chapter 4, paragraph 65 and Chapter 15, paragraphs 269-272 fo r emergency lighting).

C o n s tru c tio n o f s tairw ays
1 1 7 . The w id th, rise and going of the steps should be uniform w ith in each stairway, and, ideally,
should be uniform throu g ho u t the entire exit system.

1 1 8 . Stair treads should be provided w ith slip-resistant surfaces and durable edgings. Adequate
drainage should be provided.

1 1 9 . Open risers should not be used.

1 20 . On any stairw ay the preferred going of treads should be 305 mm but not less than 280 mm; and
preferred height of risers should be 150 mm but not more than 190 mm. Stairways should:
        i.      be w ith o u t winders;
        ii.     be in flights of not more than 16; and
        iii.    make at least one change in direction between flights of at least 30° if there are more
                than 36 risers in consecutive flights.

1 2 1 . The going of the landing between flights should not be less than the w id th of the channel of the
flight.

122. Guarding should be provided on both sides o f all stairs and landings. Where next to open wells,
or spaces, such guarding should conform to Building Regulation requirements but should be not less
than 1.1 metres in height (measured vertically fro m the nosing of the step, or the surface o f the
landing). The guarding should have a strength equivalent to that of the crush barriers of the weaker
type, described in Chapter 10. (ie 3.4 kN/metre w id th design force, 4.1 kN/metre w idth test load.)

1 2 3 . The m in im um w id th of a stairw ay or stairw ay channel should be 1.1 metres. The m axim um
w id th of a stairway channel should be 1.65 metres. Consideration w ill have to be given to dividing
existing stairways w id e r than 1.65 metres but which do not exceed 2.2 metres taking account of the
extent to w hich they co m p ly w ith the other stairw ay requirements of the Guide. Stairways of 2.2
metres or more should be divided into channels having a w id th of between 1.1 metres and 1.65
metres (see examples at Figures 2-4).

124 . Handrails should project not more than 100 m m and should be provided on both sides o f all
stairways, steps and landings at a height of not less than 840 mm (measured vertically from the line
of the step nosing or the surface of the landing). A ll handrails should extend by at least 300 mm
beyond the top and bottom of any ramp or risers of the staircase.

1 2 5 . The strength o f the handrails (including supports) used to divide a stairw a y into channels
should be as described in Chapter 10, i.e. 3.4 kN/metre w idth design force or 4.1 kN/metre w idth test
load fo r handrails at right angles to the direction of the crowd flow; 2.2 kN/metre w id th design force
or 2.7 kN/metre w idth test load fo r handrails parallel to the direction of the flow.

N o tes
Consideration is given here to the option of dividing the staircase into tw o sections of 1.0675 metres
or accepting it as a single channel stairway. Division w ould mean that each channel w ould be less

preferable to having no centre rail at all. Factors to take into consideration w o uld include use of
staircase (ie. w hether or not heavily loaded) its length, num ber or risers and landings, num ber of
winders.

Handrails should extend at least 300mm beyond the top and bottom risers of the stairways.

Access to s tairw ays
1 2 6 . Access to the head of the stairways should be controlled to ensure a free flo w of spectators.

1 2 7 . W here a stairway is divided into channels the access should be designed to secure a uniform
flo w dow n each channel.

1 2 8 . The approach to the head o f the stairs should be level and should be so arranged tha t the
spectators converge on the stairway from the fro nt and/or the sides only.

 1 2 9 . The approach in the direction of the stairway should not be less than 1.1 metres and preferably
 not more than 3 metres unless access is totally controlled, see Figure 5.

  1 3 1 . Where restrictive elements such as barriers or gateways are installed in the approach from the
 terrace to a stairway in order to meet the foregoing provisions, the total w idth o f the passage form ed
 by these elements should not be more than tw o-thirds the m inim um w id th o f the stairway, see Figure

 fla t areas and through portals (see Chapter 20).



 D ischarge fro m stairw ays
 1 3 2 . All exit stairways should discharge either:

                 at ground level and lead directly to a place o f safety* in the open air; or
                 on to walkways or concourses o f adequate dimensions at any level provided these

9. TERRACES A N D VIEW ING SLOPES

A rra n g em e n ts should be m ade to encourage th e even d is trib u tio n o f th e cro w d ; to
provide ease o f ingress and egress; to c o n tro l and fa c ilita te m o vem en t, p a rtic u la rly if a
local em ergency should arise during th e event; and to p re ve n t th e build up o f pressures
fro m reaching dangerous proportions.


G eneral
1 3 7 . Terraces are recognised as presenting a special safety problem especially at football grounds.
The follow ing guidance is therefore aimed m ainly at football stadia but can be applied to any ground
where standing terraces or viewing slopes are used for accommodating spectators.

1 3 8 . In addition to the incidental dangers o f standing fo r long periods on steep, terraced slopes,
crowds may be subject to excessive pressures generated by spectators straining to see the event, by
excitement, or by surging. Failure to provide spectators w ith an unobstructed view can cause them to
stretch and strain.



Terrace steps
1 3 9 . A terrace step should not be less than 280 m m or m ore than 380 mm w ide. The preferred
dim ension is between 355 mm and 380 mm.

1 4 0 . The height o f risers should be between 75 mm and 180 mm. 75 mm is related to the m inim um
w id th o f 280 mm. If the riser height is greater than 180mm, a crush barrier should be provided at the
to p o f the riser.

1 4 1 . Excessive variations in the gradient of a terrace should be avoided. Gradients steeper than 1 in
2 can be potentially dangerous. Where unavoidable, consideration should be given to reducing the
num ber o f spectators occupying that area or provision o f additional crush barriers.

1 4 2 . The surface o f terrace steps should be even and o f a slip-resistant material. Drainage should be
provided to prevent rainwater causing deterioration.



G an gw ays
1 4 3 . For the purpose o f this section the term 'radial gangway' has the meaning given to it in the
Glossary, Annex F.

1 4 4 . Gangways, both radial and lateral are the means by w hich spectators are channelled in an
orderly w ay into and o ut o f the viewing areas. Siting o f gangways, crush barriers (see Chapter 10),
barriers governing the flo w at the head o f stairways and handrails dividing stairways (see Chapter 8)
should be designed to provide a uniform flo w o f spectators to each o f the exits from the viewing
area.

1 4 5 . All gangways should be even and free fro m trip hazards. Surfaces should be slip resistant. They
should be painted w ith a non-slip paint in a conspicuous colour.

1 4 6 . Spectators should be inform ed by signs and other means (for example in programm es and by
the p u b lic address system ) th a t no standing is a llow ed in gangw ays (see Chapter 2 paragraph
42(xvi)). Where necessary stewards should be used to enforce the instruction.

1 4 7 . All spectators on the terraces should be w ith in 12 metres of a gangway or exit as measured
along a line o f unobstructed travel fro m the viewing position, so that they can move quickly into the
exit system. This may be achieved by a pattern o f gangways (not less than 1.1 metres wide) linked to
the exit system.

                                                      31
L ateral G angw ays
1 4 8 . Spectators should not be allowed to stand in lateral gangways because this disrupts the free
m ovem ent along them and may obstruct the view o f those on the terrace steps behind causing them
to stretch and strain (see paragraph 138 above). Standing in the gangways w ill be discouraged if they
are sunk approxim ately 150 mm and if crush barriers are provided behind but not im m ediately in
fro n t o f them.



Radial G an gw ays
1 4 9 . M ovem ent on radial gangways is disrupted by the presence o f spectators using them to view
the activity on the playing area. Such gangways are often relatively long, dow nw ard paths through
terraces and spectators standing in them are not protected by crush barriers in the event o f a sudden
m ovem ent forward. Radial gangways should therefore be kept clear. It may be helpful to sink them
approxim ately 150 mm and to interrupt an otherwise continuously descending gangway by turns
along lateral gangways.

1 5 0 . A n y balustrading w all, fence or gate at the fo o t o f radial gangways should be o f the same
height as crush barriers and should be as strong as those o f the stronger type, ie, 5.0 kN/metre w idth
design force, or 6.0 kN/metre w idth test load (see also Chapter 10).

1 5 1 . Radial gangways should not contain winders. Where the gangway is stepped the going should
be uniform and the step dim ensions should be com patible w ith those fo r the terrace w hich they
serve (see paragraphs 139-140 above).



D ivisio n o f s p e c ta to r a cco m m o d atio n
1 52 . A ground should be divided in order to prevent m igrations by spectators which m ight cause
dangerous overcrow ding. Each division must have its own lim it o f safe capacity and be served by
turnstiles or other arrangements which keep a tally o f the num ber o f people admitted. Each division
o f a ground, fo r example each end or side, should be self-contained w ith its own entrances, exits and
toilet/re fre shm en t facilities. Consideration should be given to providing suitable access fro m one
division to another fo r use in an emergency but such access w ill not norm ally be taken into account
in any exit capacity calculations.

1 5 3 . Each o f the divisions should be subdivided by such means as crush barriers and gangways,
arranged so as to m inim ise the sway and surge o f spectators and to discourage lateral movement. If
a terrace or view ing slope is sub-divided into sections by structural means such as fences or railings,
arrangem ents at the ground m ust be such as to ensure tha t these sub-divisions cannot be filled
beyond the ir safe lim it. This means, in effect, tha t they w ill need to be self contained sections or
divisions o f viewing accom modation (see also Chapter 17 paragraph 289).

1 5 4 . A t sporting events such as greyhound racing spectators may need to move freely w ith in each
division o f the view ing accom modation as well as to and from amenity areas. This should be borne
in mind when considering the need for division o f the ground. Other sports, including Rugby Union
and Rugby League, also frequently allow more freedom o f movem ent fo r spectators. The advantage
o f this arrangem ent is tha t it provides spectators w ith an opportunity to disperse in a w ay which
avoids concentrations o f the crowd.

1 5 5 . G rounds m ay still have the ir popular areas. Considerable care is therefore needed to ensure
th a t any concentration o f spectators does not exceed the safe capacity fo r the particular area in
question. Well trained stewards should be provided to check, m onitor and marshall spectators at
such grounds.

1 5 6 . In cases w here m o b ility o f spectators is a feature o f the event, overall calculated packing
density for standing should be below the m axim um o f 47 persons per 10 square metres in order for
spectators to move in the w ay desired.

1 5 7 . R ailings, fences etc d iv id in g sections o f the ground should be o f the strength o f th e crush
barriers. Brick/block and sim ilar solid structures lacking sufficient mass or tensile strength are poorly

                                                    32
suited to w ithstand horizontal pressures, and where used to divide spectator accom modation, should
be subject to regular structural appraisal by appropriately qualified persons (see Chapter 4) in order
to ensure they are fit fo r their intended purpose (see Chapter 5, paragraph 66).

Crush barriers
1 5 8 . Detailed advice on crush barriers is given in Chapter 10.

V ie w in g slopes (ie non-stepped sloping areas providin g standing a ccom m odation fo r
sp ectators)
1 5 9 . The surface o f this form o f standing accom modation should be covered w ith a slip- resistant
material and should be even and properly drained.

1 6 0 . The desirable m axim um gradient fo r a view ing slope is 1 in 6 (ie 9.5 degrees). Note: this is
different to the stepped terraced gradient quoted in paragraph 141 above. Viewing slopes w ith any
steeper gradient should have continuous crush barriers between radial gangways.

1 6 1 . The spacing o f crush barriers should be the same as fo r those on terracing (see Chapter 10).

Terrace to to u c h lin e d istan ce.
1 6 2 . The m inim um recommended distance between the fro n t o f the terrace or view ing slope and the
playing area is 3 metres where the terrace gradient is 30° or steeper. Where the gradient is shallower
than this, it may be advisable to increase this distance so as to enable spectators to obtain a clear
view.

10. CRUSH BARRIERS, HANDRAILS AND OTHER
    PROTECTIVE GUARD RAILS

Many of the hazards arising from crowd pressure on terraces can be eliminated by provision of well
constructed, correctly positioned and properly mounted crush barriers which physically control and
contain crowd movement. Handrails and other protective guard rails of the correct specification are
essential in regulating safe passage of spectators through entry/exit routes.


D im ensions and D esign Features
1 6 3 . In order to locate the top rail against that part o f the body most able to tolerate pressure the
height o f crush barriers should be between 1.02 metres and 1.12 metres above the nosing o f the step
or standing area im m ediately behind the barrier, w ith a preferred height of 1.1 metres (see Figures 7a
and 7b).

insufficient room fo r standing on the step on which the barrier is installed.

1 6 4 . Crush barriers should be designed so that there are no sharp projections or edges. A lthough a
barrier w ith a top rail o f 50 mm diam eter tube has been used at many sports grounds, research has
shown that there are advantages in the use o f a fla t rail o f 100 m m vertical depth.

1 6 5 . The m axim um distance between rows o f crush barriers w ill be dependent on the gradient o f the
terrace or view ing slope. Paragraphs 168-172 below give details o f the spacing and strength of crush
barriers.

1 6 6 . Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the full w idth o f a terrace, w ith gaps o nly at the
radial gangways. An example o f crush barrier configuration is shown at Figure 8.

alignm ent o f gaps in successive rows o f barriers on a terrace should form an angle of less than 60° to
the barriers. There should be no more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line. These gaps should be at
least 1.1 metres and not more than 1.4 metres in w idth. (See Figure 9).

S tre n g th o f Crush Barriers, G uardrails and H andrails

1 6 9 . The structural in te g rity of crush barriers guardrails and handrails is a major factor in ensuring
safety. A 25% representative sample of all, from each part of the ground including stands etc, should be
tested annually. Thereafter, the testing of barriers should take place annually so that all barriers are tested at
least once every 4 years (see Annex D).

1 7 0 . All barriers should be visually inspected each year fo r signs of wear, distortion, corrosion or
other signs of weakness. If from such inspections and the records of earlier inspections and tests,
there is any doubt as to the integrity of a barrier it should be tested. This test should be in addition to
the 25% representative sample.

1 7 1 . Existing crush barriers and handrails should be capable of resisting the forces indicated in the
existing test load colum ns of Table 2 when applied in a test as described in Annex D. Where existing
c ru s h b a rrie rs and h a n d ra ils fa il to m eet th e s e te s t c o n d itio n s , th e y s h o u ld be re p lace d or
strengthened in such a w ay as to do so. Barriers and handrails so strengthened should be retested in
accordance w ith Annex D.

1 7 2 . New crush barriers or h andrails should be designed to resist safely a horizontal force as
indicated in the "design force" colum n in Table 2 applied as a static load acting on the top rail of the
b a rrie r or handrail at rig h t angles to the lo n g itu d in a l axis. The fou n da tio ns o f new barriers or
handrails should be designed to resist the overturning moments and sliding forces, induced by the
forces described in the "design force" colum n overleaf, w ith a factor of safety of 2.

1 7 3 . New crush barriers designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter
w ill have satisfied the strength requirements and w ill not therefore require sample testing fo r 4 years
from the date of installation. Such barriers should not form part of the 25% representative sample
described in paragraph 169 above. They should however be inspected annually in accordance w ith
paragraph 170 above.

11. COVERED STANDING A N D SEATED
    ACCOM M ODATION

T he general s a fe ty considerations fo r covered stands are s im ila r to those fo r o th e r parts
o f th e ground b u t w ith th e a d d itio n a l need to safeguard sp ectators against th e g re a te r
risk o f fire (see C h a p te r 13).

G eneral
1 7 4 . Covered stands may consist of seated accom modation o nly or may contain a m ixture of both
seated and sta n d in g areas. The fo llo w in g a dvice can be a p p lie d to all sp o rts g ro u n d s w h ere
spectators are so accommodated.

1 7 5 . The o p p o rtu n ity provided by new design w o rk should be taken to enhance the co m fort and
a m e n itie s fo r s p e c ta to rs (see p a ra g ra p h s 23-24, C h ap te r 1). T h is is p a r tic u la rly re le v a n t to
redevelopm ent o f m ajor football grounds when all-seated stands are provided. New w o rk should
conform to the relevant Building Regulations requirements and should be designed on the basis of
fire safety engineering principles fo r the safety o f occupants.

1 7 6 . A ll spectators should have a clear, unobstructed vie w of the w hole of the playing area. Designs
should ensure that sightlines are such that spectators are encouraged to remain seated (where seats
are installed) and do not have to strain or stretch to vie w the playing area. Stands should protect as
m any spectators as possible fro m the elem ents. Exits and e xit routes (w hich w ill also serve as
entrances and entry routes) should be based on the principles set out in Chapters 6 and 7.


Exits
1 7 7 . There is generally a less hurried departure from the seated apcommodation in stands at the end
of an event. Moreover, spectators are induced by the layout of the seats to form orderly queues. Even
so, attention should be paid to the points below as well as the other structural considerations in
respect of stairways, entrances/exits and where appropriate, density levels and crush barriers.

1 7 8 . There should be sufficient exits to allow fo r the orderly evacuation of all the spectators. This
m ay entail a re d uctio n in the specta tor ca pa city (see paragraphs 326-330 Chapter 19). Egress/
evacuation tim e used to calculate the exit requirem ents w ill depend to a large extent on the fire
hazard present (see Chapter 13, paragraphs 241-245) but should be no longer than 8 m inutes (see
Chapter 7 paragraphs 97-100).

1 7 9 . Seats and gangways should be so positioned as to provide ready access to exits. No spectator
in any part o f the seated area should have to travel m ore than 30 metres fro m th e ir seat to the
nearest exit fro m the view ing area measured along the line of the seatway and gangway.


G an gw ays
1 8 0 . G angw ay requirem ents fo r standing accom m od a tion are set o ut in paragraphs 143-151 of
Chapter 9. Gangways fo r seated accom modation should have a slip resistant surface. They should be
o f s u ffic ie n t w id th fo r th e seats served and sh o u ld be not less than 1.1 m etres w id e w ith o u t
projections.

1 8 1 . A n y stepped side g a n g w a y (ie w ith v ie w in g accom m od a tion on one side o nly) should be
provided w ith a hand-rail fixed at a height o f not less than 840 mm (measured vertically from the line
o f the step nosing) and p ro je c tin g no m ore than 100 m m in to the gangw ay. The handrail and
protective rail should conform to the strength requirem ent of Table 2, Chapter 10.

1 8 2 . The going and riser of a stepped gangway in seated accommodation should be uniform . The
g ra d ie n t s h o u ld n ot exceed th a t achieved by th e step d im e n s io n s fo r s ta irw a y s in C hapter 8
paragraph 120 (ie 1 in 1.47 or 34°). Gangways should not contain winders. They need not contain
interm ediate landings, and the provisions o f paragraph 120 (ii) and (iii) on the num ber of steps and
tu rn s w h ich a p p ly to stairw ays are not a ppropriate. If, because o f site co nstraints and vie w in g
requirem ents, the gangways o f a stand w o uld result in step dim ensions outside those set out in

                                                              38
paragraph 120, additional com pensatory measures should be provided, as necessary, in order to
ensure safe movem ent on them , fo r example some form of hand-hold.

Balustrading
1 8 3 . Those sections of balustrading at the foo t of gangways or stairways should be as strong as
crush barriers of the stronger type. Other balustrading w hich w ill not be subject to pressure from
mass crow d m ovem ent should conform to normal requirem ents of Building Regulations and British
Standards.

S ea tin g
1 8 4 . All seats should be securely fixed in position. The use o f tip-up seats allows more circulation
space, the automatic type being preferable. Upholstered seating should satisfy Ignition Source O of
BS 5852 Part 1 and Ignition Source 5 of BS 5852 Part 2.

1 8 5 . The m in im um space allotted to each seated person should be 460 mm w ide (500 m m for seats
w ith arms) and 610 mm deep. But fo r com fort these measurements should be increased to 550 m m

    STRUCTURES

T h e p rin c ip le s fo r s ec u rin g s a fe ty a p p ly to te m p o ra ry s tru c tu re s to w h ic h th e re a re
a d d itio n a l considerations.

G eneral
1 8 8 . The nature of tem porary stands and other tem porary structures, whether or not covered, used
to accom m odate spectators at a sports ground is likely to vary considerably as w ill the materials
used in th e ir c o n s tru c tio n . S om e m ay be erected fo r a sin gle e ven t only. Even so the re is no
justification fo r accepting a lower standard of safety in such structures than elsewhere w ith in the
sports ground, and the design and construction o f tem porary structures should be in accordance
w ith good engineering and building practice, should pay particular regard to public safety and should
satisfy all relevant British Standards.

1 8 9 . The principles of this Guide are applicable to tem porary stands and structures and particular
attention is drawn to:

Chapter    3    - People w ith disabilities
Chapter    4    - General Fabric and Structural Matters
Chapter    7    -Egress
Chapter    8    - Stairways and Ramps
Chapter    13   - Fire Safety
Chapter    20   - Recommended Flow Rates

1 9 0 . All tem porary stands should be capable of w ithstanding any load or force to which they may be
subjected and account should be taken of any external factors such as w ind forces. Failure of any one
support m em ber or connection should not render the structure unstable, cause local, or give rise to
progressive, collapse. As far as practicable the area around supporting frames should be secure to
prevent unauthorised access, and fram es should be so designed th a t they are firm ly locked into
position and cannot be tam pered w ith by unauthorised persons.

1 9 1 . Consultation w ith the local authority and building authority (if different) should take place at an
early stage prior to the erection of any tem porary stand. Consultation should also take place w ith the
fire authority about access fo r fire-fighting purposes.


S itin g
1 9 2 . Choice o f location may be lim ited but factors which need to be considered include: load-bearing
c a p a b ility o f th e g ro u n d , its s lo p e o r u ne ve n n e ss, d ra in a g e , a v a ila b ility o f m a in s services,
access/egress for spectators and fo r emergency vehicles, overhead power lines, and the p ro xim ity of
surrounding b uildings in relation to the risk o f fire. The condition of the site should be regularly
checked to ensure its load-bearing capabilities have not deteriorated; settlem ent o f ground may
cause instability and so require repacking and relevelling. The site should be prepared and m ain­
tained so as to provide an even surface for those parts to which the public have access. In order to be
accessible fo r the disabled the ground surface should be such as to ensure their m o b ility at all times.


A s se m b ly /D is m a n tlin g
1 9 3 . The assembly and dism antling of stands should be carried out by or under the supervision of
persons experienced and trained in the proper perform ance of such work, in accordance w ith the
m anufacturers' instructions whenever available, or in accordance w ith drawings and specifications
prepared by a com petent engineer.

1 9 4 . Work should be carried out only where lighting is sufficient to a llo w it to be safely and properly
perform ed and checked. No assembly or dism antling w ork should be carried out to the danger of
members o f the public in the vicinity.

                                                              41
1 9 5 . The w ork should be carried o ut in a proper manner, using correct parts, and tools o f a proper
size and d esign. Care sh o u ld be taken w ith th e h a n d lin g o f co m p o n e n ts to a void dam age or
distortion.

1 9 6 . All com ponents should be closely examined during assembly and dism antling for signs of wear,
deform ation or other damage, and where necessary replaced by sound com ponents of matching
m aterial, properties and dim ensions. Tem porary repairs using m akeshift com ponents should be
avoided.

1 9 7 . Care should also be taken to ensure all com ponents are correctly aligned; they should not be
bent, distorted or otherwise altered to force a fit.

1 9 8 . On com pletion, assembly w ork should be checked w ith particular attention given to fastenings
and connections.


Tents/m arquees and o th e r such structures.
1 9 9 . These types o f structures can present special fire safety problems and guidance is contained in
th e H om e O ffic e /S c o ttis h O ffic e p u b lic a tio n "G u id e to Fire P recautions in E x is tin g Places o f
Entertainm ent and Like Premises" (ISBN 0 11 340907 0 £8.50).

2 0 0 . Tents should be capable of withstanding all forces to which they may be subjected, particularly
w ind (including u plift so caused) and those caused by the build up o f snow or heavy rain. Emergency
arrangements should be made for the dism antling, either partial or total, of a tent should abnormal
conditions arise that could lead to any collapse or distortion. Where such w ork in any w ay affects the
stability of the tent or the safety of members of the public, the w ork should not commence until the
im m ediate area has been cleared of all but essential staff.

 201. S upporting poles or structures, guy ropes and stays s h ou ld 'b e used as necessary, correctly
 form ed and secure anchorages made to ensure that the tent is stable and maintains its correct shape.

 2 0 2 . The s tab ility o f the main te n t poles and supporting structure should be independent o f the
 sheeting fabric, ie any tearing or defect occurring in the fabric should not result in the collapse o f all
 or any part of the main structure.

 2 0 3 . Particular attention should be paid to the main supporting poles or structures and to p braces of
 large tents where they have to be raised to a considerable height. Damage or distortion to these
 members could considerably weaken the structure. Where such damage does occur, the members
 should be replaced or repairs or m odifications carried out so as to bring them up to full w orking
 strength.

 2 0 4 . W here solid fram es or units, eg doors, are linked to a ten t structure the y should be rig id ly
 form ed and adequately braced, and care should be taken that they do not overstress local areas of
 the tent.

 2 0 5 . Foundations to poles or frames should be properly prepared and subjected to regular checks as
 should w ire bracing or guys, the tension of w hich should be re-adjusted as necessary.

h ig h e r f ir e r is k a re a s ; p ro v id e f ir e d e te c tio n an d w a r n in g ; an d a s s is t fir e - f ig h t in g
op eratio n s.

G eneral
2 0 6 . The type o f spectator accom m odation w hich is m o st at risk fro m fire is the covered stand.
A lthough new buildings w ill conform to current Building Regulations requiring structural protection
from fire, existing structures w ill vary considerably according to age, condition and materials used in
construction. It may therefore be d ifficult in some cases to im prove the fire resistance of an existing
structure to any significant extent. But it should be done wherever practicable even though in some
cases substantial alterations may be needed to provide reasonable protection fro m fire (see also
paragraph 243).

2 0 7 . W ith new stands there is greater opportunity to incorporate comprehensive measures fo r fire
safety and to consider properly the im pact of each measure on the others. Design features fo r new
stands should include the follow ing:

       a.   adequate structural resistance to fire;

       b.   fire resisting separation of the view ing accom modation from other parts of the building;

       c.   internal finishes which have low spread o f flam e characteristics;

       d.   lo w f la m m a b ilit y and fir e ris k p o te n tia l in fix tu r e s and f ittin g s , in c lu d in g s e a tin g ,
            partitioning and any other fixed or removable contents including cushions;

       e.   contents w hich are not capable of being easily dismantled or moved to block exit routes;

       f.   no inaccessible places where litter can collect;

       g    a fire w arning system, including, where appropriate, automatic fire detection;

       h. as far as possible no storeroom s or other storage areas to form part of the stand building.
          W h e re th is is u n a v o id a b le , su ch s to r e r o o m s s h o u ld be p ro v id e d w it h fix e d fir e
          extinguishing systems appropriate to the fire risk and should not be accessible from public
          areas;

       i.   alternative, separated, escape routes w hich keep people w e ll clear o f the sm oky gases
            produced by a fire (which in general means that initial m ovem ent o f people from the back
            o f the view ing areas should be downwards) and planned in such a w ay as to avoid the use
            o f the playing area as an escape route;

       j.   the protection of later stages of escape routes so that a continuing fire does not pose any
            significant threat to them;

       k.   a roof geom etry w hich should restrict smoke and flam e travel along the underside of the
            roof;
       I.   where appropriate, the provision of smoke ventilation w ithin structures.


M in im isin g fire risk
2 0 8 . One potential cause o f fire arises from the accumulation of waste paper, programmes, food and
drink cartons etc dropped by spectators. Such waste can be easily set alight by smokers' materials
and the resulting fire may then spread to the structure or the fitting s of the building. All parts of the
ground should therefore be inspected before and after each event; any accumulation of litter should
be cleared away and taken from the ground w ith o u t delay or kept in a fire-resistant container or room
pending removal. Sufficient litter bins should be provided and arrangements made fo r the frequent
em ptying o f them during an event.
2 0 9 . Smoking should be discouraged in stands which are constructed of, or contain, com bustible or
flam m able items or materials.

2 1 0 . A com m on feature is the existence of voids under the seating and under the flo o rin g itself.
These can become a resting place fo r litter. Seating arrangements should, wherever possible, be such
that flo o r surfaces are accessible fo r the removal of litter. Voids beneath the flo o r of the viewing
a c c o m m o d a tio n w h ic h are unusable, eg w h e re the vie w in g area is b u ilt on a slope, should, if
practicable, be filled w ith a non-combustible material. Alternatively, they should be either completely
sealed o ff to stop litter accum ulating in them , or entirely open in order to a llo w easy access for
inspection and removal of com bustible waste.

2 1 1 . Upholstered seating should satisfy Ignition Source O of BS 5852 Part 1 and Ignition Source 5 of
BS 5852 Part 2. Cushioning and other flam m able materials, when stored in bulk, pose a risk o f a rapid
fire grow th. They should be stored in a fire-resistant container or room.

2 1 2 . If it is necessary to store hazardous materials, such as fuels (whether in containers or w ith in fuel
tanks and machinery) fertilizers, weed killers and paints, they should be kept in a fire resistant room.

2 1 3 . Stores used fo r m aterials referred to in paragraphs 207, 211 and 212 above should provide
access direct from the open air and be well away from public areas and kept locked when not in use.
T hey sh ou ld be separated fro m any oth e r p art o f the b u ild in g by a c o n s tru c tio n having a fire
resistance of at least 1 hour. When the store has a depth of 6 metres or more, alternative means of
escape fro m it should be provided.

2 1 4 . High fire risk areas, such as enclosed or underground car parks should be separated fro m any
other part of the building by construction having fire resistance of at least 1 hour.

2 1 5 . Special care should be taken to ensure th a t any fuel or pow er supply used fo r cooking*or
heating, in particular LPG cylinders, is safely stored and used, in accordance w ith the advice of the
authority responsible fo r enforcem ent of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. Guidance is
given in Health and Safety Executive Guidance Notes CS4, "The Keeping of LPG in Cylinders and
S im ilar Containers" and CS8, "Sm all Scale Storage and Display of LPG at Retail Premises".


 P rev e n tio n or re ta rd a tio n o f fire grow th/spread
 2 1 6 . lt is vital to ensure that in the event of a fire the arrangements fo r escape are preserved by
 restricting the rate of grow th in its early stages. Combustible materials used for fixtures and fittings,
 or stored, in the building should be kept to a m inim um .

 2 1 7 . The viewing accom modation of a stand or other building should be separated fro m adjacent
 accom m odation or void used fo r other purposes by a construction w hich has a fire resistance of at
 least 1/2 hour. This is so that any fire underneath or in an adjacent area cannot easily break through
 into the view ing accom modation. The route from the exit from that accom modation (ie the "v o m ito ry
 exit") should be separated fro m other internal areas by a construction which has at least one hour
 fire resistance (see parag ra ph 238). In such c ircu m sta n ce s fire d oo rs, w h ic h m ay d is ru p t the
 m ovem ent of spectators into the exit route, are unlikely to be necessary on the vo m ito ry exit even if
 such doors are needed elsewhere in order to protect the exit route.

 2 1 8 . Walls and ceiling linings w ith in viewing accom modation, together w ith ceiling linings beneath
 the flo o r of that accom m odation, should have a flam e spread classification of not less than Class 1
 when tested in accordance w ith BS 476: Part 7.

 2 1 9 . Fire-fighting equipm ent and staff trained in "firs t a id" fire-fighting should be provided in order
 to tackle any fire w ith o u t endangering their lives until the fire brigade arrives.

 2 2 0 . M ost measures w hich reduce the rate of fire grow th in early stages w ill also serve to restrict the
 fire spread in its later stages. For some roof configurations, venting systems may offer a means of
 reducing the spread of fire (including movem ent of flames under the roof) and hot smoky gases. The
 science of fire and smoke venting is, however, com plex and advice from the fire authority should be
 sought on w hether this w o u ld be advantageous in a particular case.

                                                        44
2 2 1 . Flammable roof material should not be used. Where it exists it should be replaced by non­
com bustible materials. Where this is not practicable, it should be underdrawn w ith non- combustible
board.

2 2 2 . Where the roofs o f buildings are close together or connected to each other, smoke or flame
should not be allowed to spread fro m one to another. Unless this risk is eliminated by fire prevention
measures, there should be a break in the roof wide enough to prevent that spread.


Fire w arn in g
2 2 3 . All buildings to which the public or staff have access and w hich m ight pose a fire risk should be
provided w ith an electrical fire w a rn in g system to alert staff. The system should be designed to
accommodate the emergency evacuation procedure o f the ground and should be approved by the
fire authority. An indication of the warning and its location should be given to a central control point.
The system sh ou ld c o n fo rm w ith BS 5839: Part 1 in te rm s o f its com ponents, in s ta lla tio n and
maintenance.

2 2 4 . The central control point and, where necessary, other selected positions in the ground should
have fa c ilitie s to call the fire brigade and other em ergency services (see Chapter 14). A line of
responsibility in contacting the emergency services should be established.

2 2 5 . The area underneath the spectator accom m odation should have a system for detecting fire.
A utom atic fire detection (AFD) systems in unoccupied areas, conform ing to BS 5839: Part 1 in term s
o f its co m p o n e n ts , in s ta lla tio n and m aintenance, sh ou ld be considered. The alarm sh ou ld be
autom atically com m unicated to the central control point.

2 2 6 . Fire detection equipm ent should be tested regularly in accordance w ith the advice given in the
British Standard specification.

2 2 7 . Where areas o f high fire risk such as large storeroom s and enclosed or underground car parks
are situated under view ing accom modation, consideration should be given to providing an automatic
fire extinguishing system, installed in accordance w ith the relevant part of BS 5306, instead of an
AFD system. Activation o f the system should be autom atically communicated to the central control
point.


Em ergency lig h tin g
2 2 8 . Emergency lighting is dealt w ith in Chapter 15 paragraphs 269-272.


F ire-fig h tin g e q u ip m en t
2 2 9 . Advice should be sought fro m the fire authority on the type, am ount and siting of fire-fighting
equipment. A t some larger grounds it may be necessary to provide a suitable water supply for fire ­
fighting in the form of hydrants.

2 3 0 . For "first aid" fire-fighting by members o f the staff, consideration should be given to providing
hydraulic hose-reels conform ing to BS 5306: Part 1. These should be sufficient to provide adequate
protection to the w hole flo o r area, and should be installed in a suitable position by entrances, exits
and stairways.

2 3 1 . Where hose-reels are not provided, portable fire extinguishers should be installed in sufficient
n um be rs to g ive adequate cover. The num be r and type w ill depend upon the size, layout, fire
separation and risk in each structure. Fire extinguishers should conform to BS 5423 and be sited and
maintained according to BS 5306: Part 3.

2 3 2 . Fire blankets co nform ing to BS 6575 and suitable fire extinguishers conform ing to BS 5423
should be kept in all catering facilities.

2 3 3 . F ire -fig h tin g e q u ip m e n t sh o u ld be located so th a t it ca n n o t be vandalised b ut is re a d ily
accessible to staff in the event of fire.


                                                           45
E m erg en cy procedures and s ta ff tra in in g
2 3 4 . lt is essential th a t plans should be made fo r dealing w ith emergencies, including fire (see
paragraph 42(vi) Chapter 2).

2 3 5 . Sufficient staff should be trained in the use of the fire-fighting equipm ent provided, and/or in
the action the y should take in the event of fire. The fire authority's advice should be sought on
w hether the content of the proposed training program m e is adequate.



M ean s o f escape                                                                            .
2 3 6 . "M eans of escape" is the structural means w hereby a safe route is provided fo r people to travel
fr o m a n y p o in t in a s tru c tu re to a p la ce o f s a fe ty w it h o u t o u ts id e a s sis ta n c e . In e x is tin g
accom m odation, the means o f escape in the event of an emergency w ill usually be the same as the
norm al exit routes but there may be an additional "ro u te " o f forw ard escape on to the playing area
and then out of the ground. All exit routes for use in an emergency should be clearly signposted (see
paragraph 101, Chapter 7) and should be capable of being safely and effectively used at all tim es
w hen the ground is occupied.

2 3 7 . The emergency exit routes should be sited so that people using them w ill be least affected by
the fire or its products, fo r example smoke, toxic gases, and heat. Initial travel should if possible be
d ow nw ards. This is because in the event of fire, its dangerous products w ill travel upwards and
accumulate densely at the highest points. Further stages of the exit routes should be so arranged as
to take p eo p le p ro g re s s iv e ly fu rth e r aw ay fro m the fire , along a ro u te w h e re th e y ca n n o t be
significantly affected by the fire or its products. There should be more than one emergency exit route
fro m a vie w in g area and the exit system should be such that any blockage in one exit does not
 prevent access to an alternative.



 Fire p ro te c tio n fo r s ta irw a ys and passages
 2 3 8 . Where a stairway, passage or any other part of an emergency exit route passes up, down or
 through a stand or other building used by spectators, unless it is in the open air, it should be in a fire
 resistant enclosure separated from the remainder of the stand by a structure having fire resistance of
 not less than one hour. Such exit routes should discharge to a place of safety in the open air (see also
 paragraph 132).

 2 3 9 . The surface fin ish o f w a lls and ceilings o f all em ergency exit routes above should be o f a
 standard corresponding to Class O (as defined in the guidance issued in connection w ith the Building
 Regulations fo r England and Wales and the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations).

 2 4 0 . A ny door form ing part of the enclosure to an exit route should be self closing and have a fire
 resistance of not less than half an hour (see also paragraph 217 above).


 E m ergen cy e va c u atio n tim e
 2 4 1 . The evacuation tim e is an arbitrary tim e which, together w ith the m axim um flow-rate figure, is
 used to determine the capacity o f the exit route(s) providing the means of escape from the viewing
 accom m odation in an emergency (see paragraph 236). This exit capacity is a factor in calculating the
 num ber o f spectators w ho can be accommodated (see Chapter 19 paragraphs 313 and 326).

 2 4 2 . The em ergency evacuation tim e w ill depend largely on the level of fire risk present in the
 accom m odation. Spectator accom m odation w hich has, fo r any reason, the potential fo r rapid fire
 spread should have an exit capacity based on an evacuation tim e of not more than 2 /2 minutes. An
 increase in this tim e w ill be acceptable where the possibility of rapid fire spread is reduced by the
 provision of fire safety measures (either active or passive systems) and the emergency exit routes are
 not vulnerable to a fire occurring w ith in the building. For example, an open concrete terrace or a
 stand w hich incorporates the fire safety design features described in paragraph 207 above, where
 spectators are not tota lly enclosed and can move into protected exit routes, or exit routes in the open
 air, w ould norm ally have an exit capacity based on an 8 minute calculation (see Chapter 6 paragraph
  97).

                                                                46
2 4 3 . The conditions w ith in a particular ground may call fo r interpolation between the times referred
to in paragraph 242 above. The aim should always be to introduce measures which w ill m inim ise the
outbreak and spread o f fire rather than rely on an exit capacity based on a 2 1/2 minute calculation as
a solution (see also paragraph 206). In all cases, the advice of the fire authority should be sought.

2 4 4 . A dvice on the ca lculatio n o f exits required fo r in terna l areas o f a stand or oth e r b u ild in g
occupied by spectators, fo r example, a restaurant or bar, is contained in the Guide to Fire Precautions
in Existing Places of Entertainment and Like Premises.

2 4 5 . W here the playing area or perimeter track is accessible to spectators and is considered as a part
o f the exit route, exits onto it fro m the view ing accom m odation can be taken into account when
calculating the capacity o f that exit system. Where there is a pitch perimeter fence, wall or moat, it
sh ou ld have access p o in ts in accordance w ith C hapter 18, paragraph 300 w h ic h can serve as
emergency exits fo r that purpose.

2 4 6 . W here the p la yin g surface o f a pitch is m ade o f syn th e tic m aterials, advice fro m the fire
authority should be sought to establish if it can be properly considered an emergency exit route in
the event of a fire. This is because it is possible that some form s o f artificial tu rf m ight in themselves
c o n s titu te a hazard in th e e v e n t o f fir e b ecause o f fla m e s p re a d and fu m e s etc ca use d by
decom position of the material as a result o f heat radiation and ignition.

2 4 7 . If the playing area is w h o lly surrounded by covered accom m odation w ith no breaks in the
roofing (see paragraph 222) it may not be suitable fo r evacuation in the event of fire and the advice of
the fire authority should be sought.

Access fo r em ergency vehicles
2 4 8 . Adequate roads fo r emergency vehicles should be provided so that speedy and direct access
can be obtained to all buildings w ith in the ground. Wherever possible these access routes should be
separate from those used by spectators entering and leaving the ground or, alternatively, provide for
the parking o f emergency vehicles so that routes used by crowds are not seriously obstructed. The
police and the fire authority should be consulted about the suitability of access roads and access to
the ground.

 2 4 9 . W here practicable and necessary, roads w ith in V4 o f a m ile o f the g ro un d should be kept
 entirely free o f parked vehicles so as not to delay or obstruct emergency vehicles.

14. COM M UNICATIONS

T here should be a c o m m u n icatio n s system capable o f clearly relaying essential m essages
to b o th s ta ff and sp ectators in all parts o f th e ground, inside and outside, in both norm al
and em erg en cy conditions.

G eneral
2 5 0 . Precise requirements fo r com m unications w ill depend on the sort o f ground and the numbers of
people tha t attend there. Professional advice and expertise should be sought and, in general, the
com m unications system should be determined after consultation w ith the local authority (where a
safety certificate is in force), police, fire and ambulance services. The system should conform to
relevant British Standards or Code of Practice. It should be available for use, capable o f coping w ith
all emergencies and should have an override facility. It should provide the central control and, where
necessary, selected positions in the ground, the facility to call the emergency services. It is ground
managem ent w ho should provide and operate the necessary equipm ent fo r this purpose as well as
provide com petent staff, suitably trained in its use.



C e n tra l C ontrol
2 5 1 . There should be a central control room com m anding a good view of the w hole ground fro m
w h ich the com m unications system should operate. It should contain the fa c ility to com m unicate
quickly w ith staff, the public and the emergency services. Subject to paragraphs 259-260 below the
safety officer and his staff should be responsible fo r the operation of the communications system.

2 5 2 . There should be inter-com m unication between the central control, all turnstiles or banks of
turnstiles and all entry and exit gates used by the public (see also Chapter 6). Metering systems to
record all admissions should be installed at turnstiles and, to ensure that ground capacities are not
exceeded, arrangements should be made fo r central control and police control room where provided
to be inform ed im m ediately a predetermined num ber o f spectators has been adm itted through each
turnstile, or bank of turnstiles serving each section o f the ground.



 P u b lic A ddress/S ystem W arning
 2 5 3 . The public address system should be able to com m unicate w ith individual areas outside and
 inside the ground, w ith groups of areas or w ith the w hole ground.

 2 5 4 . Emergency use of the system as part o f the fire warning system means that it w ill also need to
 co m p ly w ith BS 5389 Part 1 (Code o f practice fo r system design, installation and servicing of Fire
 Detection and Alarm Systems in Buildings).

 2 5 5 . Im portant announcements relating to crowd safety should be preceded by a loud signal to catch
 the attention o f the crowd despite a high level o f noise in the ground. This signal, follow ed by the
 voice-over transm ission should be different to, and distinct fro m , any other signals which may be in
 general use on the system. This arrangement should be prom inently displayed in every programm e
 sold fo r every event.

 2 5 6 . The public address equipm ent should be installed so that broadcast messages can be heard
 under reasonable conditions (including emergencies) by all persons of normal hearing in any part of
 the g ro un d to w hich the public has access. Installation should conform to the relevant guidance
 contained in BS 6259 (Code o f Practice fo r Planning and Installation of Sound Systems). The power
 supply to the system should be such as to enable it to continue to operate in an emergency, such as
 fire or a failure o f the mains supply, fo r up to 3 hours.

 2 5 7 . In th e e ven t o f an e m e rg e n c y it is essential th a t clear, accurate in fo rm a tio n is g ive n to
 spectators at the earliest possible tim e. Messages should be positive leaving those to w h om they are
 addressed in no doubt as to w hat is required of them. They should be pre-arranged, w orded w ith the
 agreem ent o f the police, fire authority and, where a safety certificate is in force, the local authority.

                                                          48
Back-up Provision
2 5 8 . Loud hailers should be available fo r the use o f stewards and police in all parts o f the ground for
directing or instructing spectators.

2 5 9 . Any police radio facilities available fo r the maintenance o f law and order should augm ent and
not be regarded as a substitute fo r the ground com m unications system.

P olice C o n tro l Room
2 6 0 . Where there is sufficient special police presence inside the ground to warrant a police control
room , such a room should be provided fo r use by the o ffice r in charge. This control may be in
addition to that used by the ground safety officer in which case an adjoining or a jo in t control room
s h o u ld be c o n sid e re d . There m ust be a clear, u ne q u ivo ca l u nd e rs ta n d in g by both police and
managem ent as to the tasks, duties and responsibilities which w ill be undertaken by the police and
those w hich w ill be undertaken by the ground management (see also Chapter 17, paragraph 286).
There m ust be established lines o f com m unication between them.

2 6 1 . International grounds, grounds o f clubs in the English Football League and clubs in the Premier
Division o f the Scottish Football League should provide a police control room w hich is:-
      (a) w e ll placed so as to c o m m a n d a g o o d v ie w o f th e w h o le p itc h and th e s p e c ta to rs
          surrounding it;
      (b) o f su fficien t size fo r the o ffice r in charge, his deputy, m anagem ent representative and
          enough officers to operate radios, telephones and any other equipment. There should be
          space fo r others w h o m ay need to v is it the room , fo r exam ple, oth e r se nio r officers,
          management, representatives of the emergency services and local authority;
      (c) properly equipped w ith suitable CCTV, radio, telephone facilities.

2 6 2 . W here necessary the control room should be sound-proofed against excessive noise. The room
and equipm ent should be to the satisfaction of the chief officer w ith responsibility fo r the ground.

2 6 3 .To com plem ent police radio com m unications there should be a separate system o f land-lines
w ith telephone links between control room and key points, fo r example, turnstiles, stewards' control
point, secretary's office, referee's room , lig h ting control, medical practitioner, casualty clearance
points and first aid room.


Close C irc u it Television
2 6 4 . Consideration should be given to the installation o f CCTV in order to m onitor turnstiles (inside
and outside the ground) ingress/egress routes, concourse areas, terraces and any other area where
there is likely to be a crow d build-up. CCTV should norm ally be installed fo r this purpose at grounds
used fo r m a jo r events and in p articula r at grounds referred to in paragraph 261 above. Before
d e c is io n s are re a c h e d , a n a ly s is o f each g ro u n d is n e c e s s a ry . Each p a rt o f th e s p e c ta to r
accom modation should be assessed fo r the nature and degree of risk in order to determine w hether
CCTV w ill be o f use, if so, the individual needs and w hether alternative measures can be taken which
achieve equal or better results.

2 6 5 . G u id a n c e on CCTV, based on re s e a rc h c a rrie d o u t by H o m e O ffic e , P olice S c ie n tific
Development Branch, can be obtained fro m the Home Office, Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AT.

15. A U XILIA R Y POWER

A u x ilia ry p o w e r should be available and be s u ffic ie n t to enable em ergency lig h tin g , th e
P ublic A ddress system C C TV and o th e r e le c tric a lly pow ered in stallatio n s to fu n c tio n fo r
a t least 3 hours a fte r th e fa ilu re o f th e norm al supply.



2 6 6 . In the event o f a power failure consideration should be given to cancellation o f the event. If the
auxiliary power supply is capable of supplying the entire load fo r the ground fo r at least 3 hours it
may be possible to continue a fixture or event provided it is scheduled to finish and the ground
cleared w ith in this period and no other emergency situation exists. To supply such a load a generator
rather than a central battery system is likely to be required. An additional back up emergency power
supply w ill be necessary if an event is to continue. Ground management should take into account the
needs fo r the ground in deciding the type of power provision and make contingency plans fo r the
failure o f the power supply (see Chapter 2).

2 6 7 . A uxiliary power equipm ent should be located in a secure room to which the public does not
have access. The room should be o f fire-resisting construction of a standard of not less than 1 hour.

2 6 8 . All equipm ent should be installed, maintained and tested in accordance w ith the manufacturers
instructions and relevant British Standards.


 Em ergency lig h tin g
 2 6 9 . Emergency lighting, fo r use in the event of a failure o f the general lighting, should be provided
 in all parts of the premises accessible to the public and along all exit routes, w ith exit signs clearly
 illu m in a te d . In s ta lla tio n sh ou ld be in accordance w ith BS 5266: Part 1. The system should be
 com pletely separate fro m the normal lighting system, although a one-circuit system incorporating
 staggered su b -c irc u its w o u ld be an acceptable a lternative. Unless, excep tio na lly, tw o e n tire ly
 in d e p e n d e n t su pp lie s can be obta in ed fro m o utsid e sources, the em ergency c irc u it sh ou ld be
 connected to a source of power located on the premises, fo r example storage batteries or a diesel
 generator, w ith a delay of not more than 5 seconds.

 2 7 0 . The system should be capable o f maintaining the necessary level (see IEE Lighting Code) of
 illum ination fo r a period o f 3 hours from the tim e o f failure o f the normal supply.

 2 7 1 . The emergency lighting should operate automatically on the failure o f the normal lighting.

 2 7 2 . Emergency lighting systems should be tested regularly in accordance w ith BS 5266: Part 1.



 P ublic A ddress S ystem
 2 7 3 . W here the public address system is part o f the fire warning system it should conform to BS
 5839 Part 1 (see Chapter 13 paragraph 223 and Chapter 14 paragraph 254). A uxiliary power w ill in
 such circumstances therefore be needed to ensure the continued use of the system in the event of
 fire or other emergency.
16. STEWARDING

E ffe c tiv e s te w a rd in g should p re ve n t overcro w d in g in sections o f th e ground, reduce th e
like lih o o d and incidence o f disorder, help disperse spectato rs in such a w a y as to reduce
c ro w d pressure and provide th e m eans to in v es tig a te , re p o rt and ta k e early a ctio n in an
em ergency.

G eneral
2 7 4 . It should be emphasised to stewards that they are deployed to assist in the safe operation o f the
ground, not to vie w the activity taking place.

2 7 5 . S ta ffin g le v e ls and s te w a r d in g re q u ir e m e n ts w ill v a ry d e p e n d in g u p o n th e size and
configuration o f the ground, the nature o f the event and crowd levels, but there are six basic duties
w hich stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:
      a)    to control or direct spectators w ho are entering or leaving the ground, to help achieve an
            even flo w of people to the view ing areas;
      b)    to recognise crowd densities, signs o f crowd distress and crowd dynamics so as to help
            ensure safe dispersal o f spectators on the terraces or viewing slopes;
      c)    to patrol the ground to deal w ith any emergencies eg. raising alarms or tackling the early
            stages o f fires;
      d)    to staff entrances, exits to and fro m the viewing accom modation and other strategic points,
            especially exit doors and exit gates fro m the g round w hich are not co n tin u o u sly open
            w h ilst the ground is in use;
       e)   to assist police as appropriate or as requested w ith crow d control; and
      f)    to undertake specific duties in an emergency.

2 7 6 . A more detailed check list o f the kind o f duties w hich stewards are liable to undertake is at
Annex E. It should be borne in mind that this is not necessarily an exhaustive list of duties.

2 7 7 . Managem ent should appoint a chief steward responsible fo r co-ordinating responsibilities of all
stewards. The chief steward should attend police pre-match briefing. Control of stewards should be
from a central point w ith an efficient means to com m unicate w ith them (see also Chapter 14).

A g e and Fitness
2 7 8 . Stewards should be fit, active, not less than age 18 and ideally not more than 55 years old. They
should be fu lly capable of carrying out the duties allocated to them. Every steward should be fu lly
appraised in w ritin g of his duties and responsibilities and should carry on him a general check list of
them.

Training
2 7 9 . Where a ground, such as one used by an association football league club, has special police
presence, duties and responsibilities of stewards should be agreed w ith the police and form part of
any w ritten understanding or statement of intent agreed w ith the police. Stewards should attend pre­
match briefing and should be made aware as necessary o f the arrangements and any contingency
plans to deal w ith the arrival of away supporters.

2 8 0 . Effective training and supervision should be provided by m anagem ent so that all stewards,
w hether regular or casual, know not only w h at their duties are but how to carry them out and why.
This is especially im portant in emergencies when it is essential that stewards and their supervisors
are fu lly aware of, and practiced in, the part th e y are to play in the plans dra w n up w ith the
emergency services. Exercises should be carried out before the start of, and mid-way through, the
season so as to ensure that emergency procedures operate smoothly. A record should be kept of the
  uration of the exercise, details of the instruction given and by w hom . At least 14 days' notice of the
intention to hold such exercises should be given to the local authority (if a safety certificate is in
torce), the police, fire and ambulance services.


                                                             51
Id e n tific a tio n
281. All stewards should be readily identifiable eg. by the wearing of distinctive clothing such as
lum inous tabards which are numbered and distinctive from those worn by police, fire and ambulance
services. Arm bands are not acceptable.

V is itin g S te w a rd s
2 8 2 . A t association football grounds any supplementary stewards fro m visiting ciubs w ho w ill be
operational during an event m ust arrive before the ground is open to the public and in tim e to be
fu lly briefed as to the construction and configuration of the ground, the safety arrangements and
the ir specific duties.




                                                   52
17. CROWD BEHAVIOUR
W h ere th e re is a d is o rd e rly e le m e n t a m o n g th e c ro w d in te n t on v io le n c e , a d d itio n a l
s afety m easures are needed to contain and m inim ise th e p o te n tia l disru ption, to isolate
q u ic k ly , id e n tify a n d re m o v e th e o ffe n d e rs a n d to p re v e n t th e ir re -e n try on fu tu r e
occasions.

General
2 8 3 . A ltho u gh the problem of crow d disorder at sp orting events is one w hich affects p rim a rily
professional association football, other sports are not im m une from it. Therefore, w hilst the follow ing
advice is directed m a in ly at those g ro u n d s w h ere pro fe ssio na l association fo o tb a ll is played,
especially grounds used by English Football League clubs, the general principles should also be
borne in mind by managements at other grounds where m ajor spectator sports are played.

2 8 4 . The 'European Convention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour at Sporting Events and in
particular at Football Matches' (HMSO, Cmmd 9649), which came into force on 1 November 1985,
sets out in general term s measures to be taken to prevent and control violence by spectators. The
Standing Committee on the Convention in April 1989 adopted a comprehensive report on measures
to counter hooliganism and guidelines on ticket sales. In addition all clubs in the Football League are
required by League regulations to have in place local plans fo r crowd control and safety, drawn up in
consultation w ith local authorities, local police and other relevant organisations.

2 8 5 . For matches in European com petitions, UEFA has issued binding instructions in their docum ent
'Order and Security in the Stadia' (Third Edition, 1985). The follow ing paragraphs cover some of the
main areas th a t re q u ire the a tte n tio n o f g ro u n d m a n agem ent. The advice th e y co ntain is n ot
com prehensive and is intended to supplem ent rather than replace existing instructions, codes of
practice etc.


P olicing
2 8 6 . Although the measures described elsewhere in the Guide w ill help achieve reasonable safety at
a sports ground, fo r management to discharge its responsibility properly, a special police presence
inside the ground may be necessary. The num ber and disposition o f the police must be determined
by the Chief Police Officer in whose area the ground is located. Where there is such a presence there
should be a clear, w ritten understanding or 'statement of intent' agreed between the police and the
ground management setting out the functions and responsibilities of each as to crowd safety. A copy
of the statement should be available to the local authority. Dealing w ith disorder (as distinct from
normal ground operations and crowd management on the premises) as in any other circumstances
w ill fall to the police.

2 8 7 . G round m anagem ents should give all possible assistance to the police and provide police
control facilities w ith in the ground (see also Chapter 14, paragraph 260).

2 8 8 . Proper advance planning w ith the police is essential to counter potential crowd disorder. There
m u st be an e ffe c tiv e lia iso n between clu b and p olice fo r th is purpose to in clu d e n ot ju s t the
arrangements inside the ground but also the escort of visiting supporters, their likely numbers, their
separate entry to the ground and their departure at the end of the match. There should be debriefing
meetings as necessary to evaluate existing arrangements and provide the fle xibility necessary to deal
w ith different circumstances.


 C row d m o vem en t
 2 8 9 . If crowd m ovem ent is to be controlled by the sub-division o f terraces or view ing slopes by
 structural means, such as railings or fences, in order to help the police contain any disorder, the
 greatest care must be taken to ensure that these sub-divisions cannot be filled beyond their specified
 safe limit. Dividing structures should com ply w ith the strength requirements set out in Chapter 10.
   ac s u b - d iv is io n s h o u ld be assessed f o r its safe lim it, th e lim it s p e c ifie d , re c o rd e d and
 a rrangem ents m ade to ensure it is n ot exceeded. Each s u b -d iv is io n should be se lf-contained,
 serviced by its own entrances/exits, refreshment facilities and toilets - in keeping w ith the principles

                                                           53
o f Chapter 6 and paragraphs 152-153 of Chapter 9. If the sub-divisions are not self-contained and
arrangements cannot be made to keep a reliable count of spectators admitted to them, they must not
be used. Alternatively, the sub-dividing fences should be removed and the w hole area controlled as a
complete section.

2 9 0 . P ro po sa ls w h ic h e n ta il changes in the c o n fig u ra tio n o f the v ie w in g a c c o m m o d a tio n or
entry/egress to and from it, fo r example fo r the purposes of segregation, should be acted upon by
ground m anagem ent only after full account has been taken of their effect on the safe movement,
evacuation arrangements and the holding capacity. Where a safety certificate is in force the local
authority should be consulted about such proposals.


S eg reg atio n
2 9 1 . Home and visitin g supporters at professional association foo tb all matches may nave to oe
segregated but segregation is not advocated for other sports where crowd disorder is not a problem.

2 9 2 . Where possible a neutral or sterile zone should be provided w ithin a ground so that home and
visiting supporters are not physically close to each other. The arrangements for adm itting spectators
into the ground, w h eth e r by tickets purchased in advance or throu g h paym ent at the turnstiles,
should be drawn up in consultation w ith the police, and must be carefully controlled to ensure as far
as possible that segregation is effective and known troublemakers are excluded.

2 9 3 . Segregation arrangem ents may also have to include measures which deter spectators from
invading the pitch or playing area. At the same tim e the arrangements w ill need to provide fo r the
police to have effective access to the terraces in the event of an outbreak of violence. Moreover,
where the playing area is accessible for evacuation in an emergency, any structural means used to
deter unauthorised encroachment onto the pitch, must allow for such access (see also Chapter 18).


 D e te n tio n and rem o val o f tro u b le m akers
 2 9 4 . A t soccer grounds, where there has been a record of frequent crowd trouble, secure detention
 rooms should be provided if requested by the police.

 2 9 5 . There should be adequate vehicular access fo r the unobtrusive removal o f detainees (see also
 Chapter 13, paragraphs 248-249 on access for emergency vehicles).


 R efreshm ents
 2 9 6 . Hard containers such as glasses, bottles or cans can make dangerous missiles and should not
 be used fo r the sale o f refreshments. All refreshments should be served in soft containers. Adequate
 receptacles should be available fo r rubbish disposal and collection (paragraph 208).

 2 9 7 . Alcohol should not be on sale fo r consum ption on the terraces or in the seated accommodation.

 2 9 8 . Ground managements should also note that the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act
 1985 applies to any ground in England and Wales used for an international association football match
 or a match involving a football league club. In Scotland the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980
 applies to g ro u n d s used by clubs in the Scottish Football League, Highland League and to the
 international stadia used fo r association football and Rugby Union.

18. PITCH PERIMETER FENCE/WALL
A p itch p e rim e te r fe n c e /w a ii m ay n o t only d e lin e a te th e playing area fro m th e spectato r
a c c o m m o d a tio n b u t m ay have to serve as a crush b arrier, and in som e s itu atio n s will
serve as a m e a n s to d is c o u ra g e o r p re v e n t access to th e p la y in g a rea e x c e p t in an
em ergency.

General
2 9 9 . The type, strength and height o f a pitch perim eter fence or w all w ill vary according to its
location and required function. A t one extreme, at a certain type of ground or small stadium used by
very few spectators, there may be no need fo r a perimeter fence or wall at all; or if such a wall or
fence exists it may need to consist of little more than a rail to mark the playing area. A t the other
extreme, some m ajor soccer stadia may have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
circumstances (see also Chapter 17, paragraph 293) but allows fo r access in emergency as part of the
measures taken to prevent or contain any outbreak of crowd disorder. Such a fence may be lim ited to
one part o f the g ro u n d , fo r exam ple, the "a w a y su pp o rters e nd " or it m ig h t encom pass other
sections.


Access to th e playing area
3 0 0 . A ny pitch fence or w a ll, w h ate ve r its height, w hich delineates the spectator area fro m the
playing area restricts or impedes access to the pitch. The extent of the restriction depends upon the
nature o f the fence or wall. All pitch fences and walls must therefore contain gates or openings (if no
gates are fitted) which allow access to the playing area or any perimeter track. Openings should be
no less than 1.1 metres wide. They should align w ith radial gangways (where provided) and should
be not less than the w id th of those gangways. Openings or gates should be properly stewarded,
should be clearly marked and painted a different colour fro m the rest of the fence or wall. Gates,
where fitted, should open away from the spectators and should be kept unlocked.



S treng th
3 0 1 . If spectators can lean on the perim eter fence or wall it should be deemed a crush barrier and
fulfil the conditions of height and strength specified in Chapter 9 except that if the fence is of solid
construction its height may be more than 1.12 metres. This is because the pressures acting on a
person forced against such a fence are distributed over a large area of the body, unlike the situation
w ith a normal crush barrier, where the pressures are localized.



P itch Barrier Fences
3 0 2 . The term "pitch barrier fence" in the follow ing paragraphs means any pitch fence or wall which
exceeds the m axim um recom m ended height o f a crush barrier (1.12 metres) measured fro m the
spectator accom modation side of the fence or wall.

3 0 3 . Pitch barrier fences are not norm ally considered to be necessary except at sports grounds used
by association fo o tb a ll clubs, especially clubs, in the English fo o tb a ll league. They are usually
associated w ith standing areas rather than seated areas and (with some exceptions) are not generally
considered necessary when seated accom m odation extends to the level of the playing area. Sim ilarly
fam ily or club enclosures are unlikely to require such a fence.

3 0 4 . W hether a pitch barrier fence is installed w ill depend on individual circumstances, such as a
history of hostile pitch invasions or other disorder from a certain part of the ground, the extent to
which stewarding and policing is felt to be able to deal w ith any attempted encroachment of the pitch
and availability of alternative solutions.

3 0 5 . W here a pitch barrier fence is installed it should not im p a ir v is ib ility o f the playing area. If
sig times from a terrace are obscured congestion may be caused, fo r example because spectators
are unw illing to move forward, or seated spectators induced to stand up. If such problem s are not
 eso ved satisfactorily, consequential reductions in capacity should result, see Chapter 19.

                                                       55
3 0 6 . The m a x im u m h eig h t o f a pitch b a rrie r fence should be 2.2 metres. There should be no
overhanging sections and no spikes, barbed wire or other devices installed or attached to it.

3 0 7 . All pitch barrier fences must contain gates or openings as described in paragraph 300 above. If
a terrace is sub-divided by structural means (see Chapter 9 paragraph 153, and Chapter 17 paragraph
289) each s u b-division m ust have its ow n gate or gates leading onto the pitch. There m ust be

3 0 8 . W henever practicable to do so terraces should not descend to a pitch barrier fence (see Figure
11). A walkway between the fence and the terrace should if possible be created and reserved solely
fo r use by police, club and first-aid personnel. In order to achieve this it may be necessary to take out
of use or remove com pletely one or tw o rows o f terracing. The walkway w ould need to be protected
by continuous crush barriers in order to discourage access except in an emergency via authorised
points (ie radial gangways).

 barrier fencing is installed so that, if necessary, sufficient fencing can be removed in order to release
 any trapped spectators. Trained operators provided by the club should be available in order to use

19. ASSESSMENT OF SAFE GROUND CAPACITY

To assess th e n um ber o f sp ectators w h ich can be safely accom m odated a cco u n t should
be ta k e n o f th e fe a tu re s o f th e individual ground, its c o n fig u ra tio n , general c o n d itio n ,
intended use and any deviatio n s fro m th e G uide's provisions.

G eneral
3 1 0 . The previous sections o f the Guide give guidelines and safety considerations fo r individual
features of a ground. This section describes a method of calculating the num ber of spectators that
can be sa fe ly a ccom m od a ted w hen taking into account in te ra c tio n s between these in d iv id u a l
features and where there are deviations from the guidelines. It may be necessary to calculate various
capacities if the ground is used fo r more than one activity.

3 1 1 . The calculations should be attached to a plan of the ground and should be available w ith such
details as exits, stands, terraces, stairways, passages, kiosks, seats and barriers. A scale of 1:200
s h o u ld be used fo r th is p u rp o s e . The plan s h o u ld be cross re fe re n ce d and a tta ch ed to the
calculations.

3 1 2 . The method assesses:
         a. the holding capacity of a terrace or view ing slope (that o f a seated area generally being
            determined either by the num ber of seats when it conform s to guidelines, or an acceptable
            reduced occupancy when the guidelines can not be met); and
         b. the capacity of a given exit/entry route from a terrace or stand.

3 1 3 . The num ber of people that can be safely accommodated on a terrace or in a stand (or other
covered accom modation) is either its holding capacity, or the capacity of the exit/entry system to be
used in normal circumstances or the emergency exit system, whichever is the least.



Holding c ap a c ity o f te rra c e s and v ie w in g slopes
3 1 4 . An even d is trib u tio n o f spectators on a terrace or vie w in g slope is likely to be d iffic u lt to
achieve notw ith stan d ing the measures described in this guide because spectators may prefer to
gather in a certain part or parts of the view ing area. This pattern of crowd dispersal and any other
relevant factors should be taken into consideration when assessing the safe capacity fo r a particular
area.

3 1 5 . In all cases the calculation of the capacity of the standing area should take into account only
those parts of the view ing accom modation from which the w hole of the playing area can be seen
e xc lu d in g g an g w ays, s ta irw a y s and la n d in g s (ie the "a v a ila b le v ie w in g area" fo r ca lc u la tio n
purposes). Where a viewing slope has an insufficient gradient to provide a clear view, the depth of
the crowd taken fo r calculation purposes should be a m axim um o f tw o metres. If the positioning
and/or w id th o f the g an g w ays do not m eet the c rite ria o f paragraphs 143-151 o f C hapter 9 a
commensurate reduction should be made to the available viewing area.

3 1 6 . Where crush barriers conform to the specifications in Chapter 10 and the view ing area is in
good condition (see Chapter 9) the m axim um allowable overall packing density is 47 persons per 10
square metres over the available view ing area. Where the conditions of the viewing area m aterially
  eviate from Chapter 9 a reduction must be made in the packing density. There is no lower lim it to
   is reduction, and if a view ing area is in such poor condition that it is unfit fo r use, the figure is 0.
 n erpolation between these figures w ill be necessary where the conditions fall between the tw o
extremes.

thp^a        ° apacitV ° f  standing area is calculated by m ultiplying the area available fo r standing by
        ppropriate packing density. The fo llow ing form ula may be used:
Capacity (Number of persons) = A x D
                                       10
        e A is the area available fo r standing in square metres and 'D' is the density, between 0 and 47.

conform to the distances laid down in Table 1, or if the gaps between them are greater than those
described in parag ra ph s 168 and Figure 11 o f Chapter 10, the capacity o f the v ie w in g area is
calculated fro m the provision of crush barriers. The total length of crush barriers (including the pitch
wall or fence if it serves as, and meets the requirements of, a crush barrier) should be measured. This
figure is then m ultiplied by either the recommended distance between the barriers (see Table 1) or
the actual distance w hichever is the lesser. This establishes the notional available view ing area (see
Figure 13). This area is then m ultiplied by the density factor determined for that area.

Crush barrier configuration as in Figure 13.
Working load of pitch wall established by test meets the higher strength of Table 2 Chapter 10.

Crush barriers consist of 12 at 6 metres in length plus 1 at 3 metres in length.
Test/inspection of tw o barriers (see Figure 13) reveal sufficient doubts as to their integrity and are
discounted fo r calculation purposes.
Remaining barriers in Line A (see Figure 13) have a safe w orking load (established by test) of the
lower strength of Table 2.
Barriers in Line B have a safe w orking load (established by test) of the higher strength of Table 2.

Calculation o f (notional) available viewing area:
      (a) Pitch w all: 76 metres less 4 exits at 1.1 = 71.6 metres. Recommended crush barrier distance
          (for higher strength) on a gradient of 20° = 3.4 metres (actual distance from pitch wall to
          crush barriers 5 metres). Notional available view ing area is therefore 71.6 x 3.4 = 243.4
          square metres.

                                                     59
       (b) Crush barriers: Line A = 4 at 6 metres plus 1 at 3 metres = 27 metres. Recommended
           d istance betw een barriers (for lo w e r stre ng th) 2.3 m etres (actual distance 8 m etres).
           Notional available viewing area is therefore 27 x 2.3 = 62.1 square metres.

           Crush barriers: Line B = 6 at 6 m etres = 36 m etres. Recom m ended distance betw een
           barriers (fo r h igher strength) 3.4 m etres. Actual distance behind barriers is 3 metres.
           Notional available viewing area is therefore 36 x 3 = 108 square metres.

Total notional available viewing area:-
           243.4

3 2 2 . Terraces or view ing slopes at older grounds not used fo r major sporting fixtures and which are
attended by very few spectators may not have crush barriers at all; or if they do their installation may
be random and not meet the specifications of Chapter 10. The safe capacity in such circumstances
has to be assessed on the c o n d itio n s p revailing at the gro un d. A ll relevant factors have to be
considered eg underfoot condition, the dispersal of the crowd at fixtures. The overall capacity of tHe
terrace w ill be lim ited and the average packing density w ill be low. One method of calculation is
taken fro m the pitch wall/fence (if any) discounting the rest of the terrace.

3 2 6 . General considerations to be taken into account w hen assessing the adequacy of exit systems
are set o ut in Chapter 7. The capacity of an exit system can be calculated by assessing fo r each
elem ent in the system (ie each gangway, doorway, stairway, exit etc) the number of persons w ho can
pass the lim iting point in that elem ent in 8 minutes (ie egress time, see Chapter 7, paragraph 97). The
capacity o f the emergency exit system is the num ber of people w ho can pass through the designated
emergency exit route in the appropriate emergency evacuation tim e (see Chapter 13 paragraphs 241-
247). The calculation is made as follow s:-
W idth of elem ent x appropriate x appropriate
Unit w id th (.550)  flo w rate       tim e
                     (See Chapter 20)

fro m the calculation.

3 2 8 . Net available view ing area 76 x 16 = 1216 square metres excluding designated gangways.
M axim um potential capacity =
1216 Xj47 = 5715 (see example A).
        10
Exit capacity consists of 2 stairways in each corner of the terrace leading to a concourse at the rear,
converging on 1 exit gate in the centre. (See Figure 14.1.)
Analysis of exit capacity allowing a m inim um of 8 minutes fo r spectators to pass through a fixed
point, using flo w rates given in Chapter 20.
Stairways = 3.327 metres. These are divided into tw o channels of 1.1 metres and one channel of
1.127 metres.
Each stairway capacity is therefore:-
3.327 x 40 x 8 = 1935.7 (1936)
.550
The capacity of the passage or concourse at the rear of the terrace is measured at its narrow est
points (see Figure 14.1). In sector A the distance measured is 3.05 metres. Exit capacity at this point is
calculated as:-
3.05   x 60 x 8 = 2661.8 (2662)
.550
In sector B the narrowest point is measured as 4 metres. Exit capacity at this point is calculated as:-
4.0 x 60 x 8 = 3490.9 (3491)
.550
The exit gate is measured as 4.88 metres.
The exit capacity of the gate is calculated as:-

4.88 x 60 x 8 = 4258.9 (4259)
.550

From the above calculations it can be seen that:-
       a) capacity of exit staircases = 3872 (1936 x 2)
       b) capacity of concourse = 6153 (3491 + 2662)
       c ) capacity of gateway = 4259
Terrace capacity is 3872 unless other lim iting factors apply. If staircase capacity at (a) is increased to
m ore than 4259 the restricting elem ent in the exit system w ill be gatew ay (c) provided tha t the
restricting elements on the concourse (b) can also accommodate the increase.

em ergency evacuation tim e and the exit routes to the playing area and thereafter to outside the
ground available fo r use in an emergency.

They assume that m ovem ent is through an exit-width of at least 1.1 metres (ie. a double unit-width)
and that underfoot conditions com ply w ith those recommended elsewhere in the Guide. If, in an
individual case, it is evident from studies of crowd movem ent at a ground that a lesser flo w rate is
actually achieved from those mentioned, the actual rate should be used for calculation purposes.

3 3 2 . From stands and all stairways a flo w rate of 40 persons per minute per unit of exit w idth (ie 550
mm ) should be used.

3 3 3 . From terraces (including covered terraces) and the ground generally a flo w rate of 60 persons
per minute per unit of exit w idth should be used.

M A N A G E M E N T RESPONSIBILITY: W RITTEN PO LICY OF SAFETY
The safety policy fo r spectator safety is, in effect, an extension of that drawn up by management in
respect of staff. It should make clear that there is a duty on all employees to ensure, as far as they are
able, that all activities w hich take place at the ground are conducted in such a w ay that, as far as is
practicable, the safety of everybody at the ground is assured. The policy should identify the safety
objectives and the means o f achieving them and should include at least the fo llo w in g "10 point
plan".

       1. Organisation/Structure fo r im plem enting safety.
       2. Arrangements to m onitor the policy (at all levels).
       3. Crowd Management: to include
            a) entry - identification of and admission to each section of viewing accommodation.
            b) exit - m ovem ent across, on leaving the view ing accom modation and thereafter.
            c) accom modation - occupancy level, division, seating, crush barrier requirements.
       4. S te w a rd in g : to in c lu d e d e te rm in a tio n o f m in im u m n u m b e rs , lo c a tio n , tra in in g and

       6. Communications
            a) to the public.
            b) internal - police - emergency services.
       7. Fire Precautions.
        8. First Aid/M edical Provision.

FIRST A ID , M E D IC A L FACILITIES A N D AM B U LA N C ES

G eneral
     1. The measures described elsewhere in the Guide w ill, if follow ed, help to prevent a serious
         accident but fo r ground m anagem ent to discharge fu lly their safety responsibilities they
         should ensure that proper first aid and contingency medical provision is available in case
         there is an incident. This means that, normally, there w ill be an NHS ambulance service
         presence at the ground where a crowd of over 5,000 is expected (see paragraph 7 below). In
         all cases, however, ground management should consult the local Health Authority's Chief
         Am bulance Officer of the ambulance service for the area to determine the ambulance, first
         aid and medical requirem ents fo r the ground. W here a safety certificate is in force the
         c o n s u lta tio n a rra ng e m e nts sh ou ld be made th ro u g h or, if required, a pproved by, the
         relevant local authority.



First aid s ta ff and a cco m m o d atio n
      2. A t each event there should be a m inim um of 2 trained first aiders and at least one trained
          firs t aider per 1,000 spectators. The responsibility for securing the attendance of firs t aiders
          lies w ith ground management w h o should consult the Health Authority's Chief Ambulance
          Officer on the level of training required.



A c c o m m o d a tio n                                                                    ^
        3. Ground management should provide accom modation designated fo r the provision of first
           aid to spectators. This should be in addition to the club's medical room. Any room set aside
           fo r this purpose should be large enough to contain a couch w ith enough space fo r people
           to w alk around; a sink providing hot and cold w ater and drinking water; a w orktop; and
            sufficient room to store stretchers, blankets and pillows. Toilet facilities should be available.
           The recommended m inim um size of the room is 15 square metres. Where the authorised
            capacity of the ground exceeds 15,000 the size of the accommodation should, ideally, be
            increased to at least 25 square metres and an additional couch should be provided. Care
            should be taken to ensure that the doorw ay is large enough to allow access fo r a stretcher
            or a wheelchair.
       4.   First aid rooms should have heating, lighting, ventilation and electric sockets. The room
            sh ou ld be sig nposted th ro u g h o u t the g ro un d and located in such a p ositio n th a t it is
            accessible to both spectators and emergency vehicles. A telephone line should be installed
            allowing internal and external communication.
       5. The first aid room should contain suitable storage for first aid materials and equipment, the
          nature of which should be agreed w ith the local Health A uthority's Chief Am bulance Officer.
          G round managem ent should appoint someone w ith sole responsibility fo r the equipm ent
          and materials in the first aid room and fo r the upkeep of the room. These facilities should
          be available at any tim e for inspection by the NHS ambulance service officers.



 M e d ic a l P ra c titio n e r
         6. A t m atches or events w h ere the num be r o f spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, a
              medical practitioner able to manage accident and emergency situations should be present.
              The medical practitioner should have specific training in cardio-pulm onary resuscitation
              and in the use of autom atic/advisory or manual d e fib rillato rs. The medical practitioner
              should (a) be at the ground at least an hour before the start of the event; (b) remain until
              half an hour after the end of it; (c) be made aware of the location and staffing arrangements
              of the firs t aid room(s) and details of the ambulance cover. The whereabouts of the medical
              practitioner should be known to first aid and ambulance staff and to those in the control
              room w h o should be able to make im m ediate contact w ith him or her.

                                                        66
A m b u la n ce provision
       7. G round m anagem ent should make arrangem ents fo r the provision o f at least one fu lly
            equipped am bulance either fro m the NHS or, if fro m elsewhere, approved by the local
            Health A u th o rity 's Chief A m b u la n ce Officer, to be in attendance at all events w ith an
            anticipated crowd of 5,000 or more. A ny additional ambulance cover should be determined
            after consultation w ith the local Health A uthority's Chief Ambulance Officer. The follow ing
            provides a general guide to the ambulance service provision which, in most cases, w ould
            be considered reasonable.

     Expected attendance        Am bulance provision
     (a) 5000 to 25000             1 Accident and Emergency ambulance (with 2 paramedics);
                                   1 Am bulance Officer
     (b) 25000 - 45000             As in (a) above plus deploym ent of a m ajor incident/equipm ent
                                   vehicle and 2 additional paramedics;
                                   1 control unit
      (c) 45000+                   as in (b) above plus 1 additional ambulance (with 2 paramedics).
Ground managem ent should note that should a serious incident develop the NHS ambulance service
has the capability and com m and structure to build rapidly on the above resource in order to ensure
the protection, treatm ent, care and medical evacuation of any casualties.

TESTS A N D IN S PE C TIO N S

      I.     As indicated in Chapter 2 and Chapter 5, regular and detailed inspections of the ground are
             a necessary and im p o rta n t fun ctio n of g round m anagem ent. The fo llo w in g provides a
             tabulation of tests and inspections referred to in the text of the Guide.

       2. Check the operation of exit doors and gates including mechanisms securing them to ensure
          that they can be opened im m ediately in an emergency.
       3. Test all automatic fire detection and fire warning, emergency lighting, public address and
          other com m unication systems 24 hours before an event.
       4. Inspect and test turnstiles and m onitoring systems to make sure they are in proper working
          order.
       5. Check tha t the g ro un d does not contain any accessible item s w hich could be used as

TE S TIN G A N D IN S P E C TIO N OF CRUSH BARRIERS, H A N D R A ILS A N D OTHER
STRUC TU R A L CROW D CONTROL ELEMENTS

O b jec tiv e
       1. The objective of visual inspections and physical testing is to ascertain the condition and
            strength of the crush barriers and handrails and other elements in order to establish that
            they co m p ly w ith the requirements of the Guide and that they are adequate to carry out
            their required function - ie that they w ill safely withstand the pressures generated by the
            m ovem ent of spectators during entry, view ing and egress. A factor of approxim ately 20%
            over and above the design load is used fo r the test load (see Table 2 Chapter 10).
       2.   Note: forces generated may vary depending upon the event, the size and nature of the
            crowd and its dispersal. Crowds at football matches including rugby w ho are essentially
            static throu g ho u t the match, occupying accom modation at a packing density of up to 47/10
            square metres and w ho leave all together at the end of the game w ill probably generate
            greater pressure on barriers, handrails etc than spectators at other events such as cricket or
            athletics. The criteria fo r strength of handrails and barriers etc envisage the more robust
            nature of spectator movem ent and actions at, say, football matches.
Personnel and E quipm ent
     3. The in s p e c tio n s and te s tin g s h o u ld be ca rrie d o u t by o r u nd e r the s u p e rv is io n o f a
        competent, suitably qualified engineer belonging to a recognised professional institution.
        The engineer w ill be responsible fo r ensuring that the inspections and testing are properly
        carried out and that all results are accurately recorded. The engineer must be satisfied that
        equipm ent used fo r the tests is suitable fo r the purpose and is used in the correct manner.
        The equipm ent used should be capable of a level of accuracy + 5% of the test force. The
        deflection measuring equipm ent should be calibrated and be capable of a level of accuracy
        of + 0.5 mm.

Records
     4. Detailed records should be made and kept of all observations, loadings, deflection/recovery
        readings etc in respect of each structure inspected and tested. The record should include a
        standard record sheet identifying each barrier tested and inspected, its location (including
        cross-reference to the plan), date of inspection and com m ents and state clearly w hether the
        barrier, handrail etc has passed or failed.
Inspections
     5. A ll crush barriers and handrails etc should be inspected annually taking due account of
         com m ents recorded from previous inspections (see paragraph 4 above).
       6. A n y v is ib le defects, such as co rro sio n, cracks, holes, m isa lig n m e n t, undue d is to rtio n ,
          missing bolts or fitting s, should be noted and the ir potential effect on the in teg rity and
          strength of the structure assessed in order to determine whether its condition is fit fo r its
          intended purpose.
       7.   If it is considered that members or connections, due to the nature of their construction,
            have hidden defects such as corrosion, furthe r investigation should be made. This may
            involve partial dism antling if this can be done w ith o u t detrim ent to the structure itself.
       8.   Particular attention should be paid to areas where corrosion or damage could result in a
            loss of performance ie w ater traps.
       9.   Should inspections result in any doubt as to the integrity or potential strength of the barrier
            or handrail etc it should be tested in accordance w ith the Guide or deemed to have failed.
Testing
      10. Testing should be undertaken annually on a 25% representative sample of crush barriers
          and handrails etc th ro u g h o u t all parts o f the ground. Each year the sample should be
          different so that all crush barriers and handrails are tested at least once every 4 years. The
          25% sam ple does not include any w hich, fo llo w in g inspection, are tested as a result of
          doubts as to their integrity.
      11. The method of physical testing should be as given below.

Test M e th o d
     12. The test is in tw o parts: Bedding In Cycle and Proof Cycle. In each part an evenly distributed
          force is applied horizontally on the top rail of the barrier or handrail at right angles to the
          longitudinal axis and is applied in increments. Crush barriers and handrails must com ply
          w ith the requirements of both parts of the test in order to be considered satisfactory for
          furthe r continued use.
      13. The deflection measuring equipm ent should be properly set up on a firm part of the terrace,
          stairway etc, unaffected by any m ovem ent of the barriers or handrail. The deflection in the
          horizontal plane should be measured at the anticipated location of m axim um deflection, eg
          at the centre of a barrier or handrail span (when testing the rail) or the top of the upright (if
          testing the upright).

Bedding In C ycle
     14. In order to allow fo r the bedding in of the test equipm ent and any frictional restraints, the
         barrier or handrail should be loaded up to its design service load (see Table 2 Chapter 10).
         The bedding-in force should be applied in at least 5 equal increments. Deflections should be
         m onitored at each increment of the load cycle. The m axim um force should be maintained
         fo r 5 minutes.
       15. The b a rrie r o r h a n d ra il m ay be c o n s id e re d to have c o m p le te d th is p a rt o f th e te st
           sa tisfa cto rily if, on rem oval of the force, the recovery is at least 75% o f the m axim um
           deflection as measured fro m the o rig in al position p rio r to loading or if the perm anent
           deflection is less than 2 mm. If the barrier or handrail fails to achieve this level of recovery it
           shall be considered to have failed the test unless there is a satisfactory explanation fo r the
           results.

P ro o f C ycle
        16. The proof cycle is to consist of tw o consecutive applications of the proof force, the interval
            b e tw e e n each a p p lic a tio n s h o u ld be as s h o rt as p ra c tic a b le , ie to e nable c o m p le te
            unloading.
       17    For crush barriers the proof force is either 6.0 kN/metre w id th or 4.1 kN/metre w idth of
            barrier as m entioned in Chapter 9.
            For handrails the proof force is either 4.1 kN/metre w idth or 2.7 kN/metre w idth of handrail
            as m entioned in Chapter 9.
       18. Each of the tw o applications of proof force should consist of 5 equal increments, the full
           proof force being maintained fo r 5 minutes fo r each application. A record should be kept of
           any deflection during loading, maintained loading, or unloading (see paragraph 4 above).
       19. If, on removal of the force after the second application the recovery is at least 95% of the
           m axim um deflection or the permanent deflection is less than 2 mm (as measured from the
           barrier position at the start of the proof test cycle - ie after the bedding in cycle), the barrier
           or handrail should be considered to have satisfied the proof cycle loading requirement.

O th e r C o nsid erations
        20. W h e re ve r possible c o m p arison should be made w ith the perform ance of o th e r crush
            barriers of a sim ilar type and w ith the same barrier previously subjected to the same or
            sim ilar tests in order to establish w hether there are indications of a reduction in overall
            perform ance w hich m ight indicate a developing weakness requiring special attention or
            more frequent testing and/or inspection than the m inim um .
       21. If at any tim e during the procedure, and notwithstanding that the barrier or handrail has
           satisfied the test requirem ents, d o u b t arises fo r any reason (including such matters as
           co rro sio n, cracking o f the terracing stairw ay etc or d istortion o f connections) as to the
           safety of the barrier or handrail, a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the
           results of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety of the barrier or handrail, the
           barrier or the handrail as the case may be, should be deemed to have failed.
        22. The principles of the testing procedure recommended in previous editions of the Guide are
            still valid as are the results of such tests until re-testing is required under paragraph 10 above.

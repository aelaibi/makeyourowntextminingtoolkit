         Sheffield;,          using     the M67 and A 3 7 .

         stationary           for about        two miles,         tailing           .back onto        the motorway.             iwo

         police        vehicles were           parked       on the       hard       shoulder         near to the         island a ’

         the    end of the motorway.                  The      officers were               telling        suppo r t e r s     to tak?

         their     scarves        in from        being      trailed       out       of the      car windows.             On

         lights were            operating        on a fixed          cycle.          1 noticed that             very     little

         traffic        was     using    the     other      appr o a c h e s    to these         lights and          formed         the

no sense         in my view as most                 of the      people      on the     pitch were           hex pi. ng

the    first aid services.                    There was a d i s tinct             lack    of effort          on the

happening?            and t h erefore         people were a g i t a t e d and            bemused.

The    crowd q u ietened and                 I eventually          left at about          3.4Qpm,      of my own

     I was deeply saddened to have to receive your kind note of appreciation of
     the work performed by some of my officers and those of South Yorkshire, in
     recovering your son* Paul’s, clothing.* Of course I m pleased that we.have
     been of sane help, ®y only wish being that such assistance was not
     necessary In the first place*

     On behalf of myself, ray Chief Constable, Geoffrey Bear, and all «y
     officers, can I extend our deepest sympathies to you and your family In
     your sad loss. If there is any way in which m can help please
     feel free to contact m personally at any time.

     Qod bless you.

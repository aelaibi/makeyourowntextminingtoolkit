                    steel    gates        leading       onto L e p p i n g s       Lane were       shut.      As    small   numbers

                    gates    to the         turnstiles.          We were           issued with        black    plastic      dustbins

                    for    confiscated         property.           Spectators          began arriving              but during      the

                    first    hour     to     12 o ’clock,        very       few a c t u a l l y entered        the ground.          From

                    people were           s t a nding around.           The        number   of     people a r r i v i n g   steadily

                    i n creased until          2 o ’clock,         at w h i c h time        fans were         regularly entering

formed.         The        queues           in the area           in w h i c h      I was   standing       reached about

half way back                 to the         gates        onto L e p p i n g s Lane.          I had      c onfiscated

m any    cans     of soft                drinks      but     no a l c o h o l i c    drinks.

However,        I had seen                  people        throwing        unopened        cans of bejw" into the

black     bins at the turnstiles.                               I can remember a man w a l k i n g                       up to.the

t u r n s t i l e and t h r o w i n g a way two u n o p e n e d                     cans of N e w c a s t l e      B rown

Ale.      He    then w a l k e d back towards L e p p i n g s Lane and did not seem to

be    in any hurry to enter the ground.                                     At      the same time another man

therw awa y a one and a half                                litre bottle            of beer,     he too walked away

from the ground afterw a r d s .                             I can remember             seeing     two    crates            of

Heineken        beer               s tood on the          ground      at    the     corner of L e p p i n g s Lane.

Up until        this time,                approximately               2.30       p.m.    the amount       of     people

queueing        to get               into    the ground was               still      s u f f i c i e n t l y few for           people

to be able            to walk              up to me and ask               direc t i o n s    to ent r a n c e s          etc.

I cannot         recall              a ny b o d y a pp r o a c h i n g me who did not have a ticket.

Fans     seemed          to be            congregating          outside       the gates         on L e p p i n g s Lane.

After 2. 3 0          p.m.           w i t h i n the      space    of a few m i n u t e s , I can              remember

s u d d en ly getting                    busier     searching        people,         the queue at my turnstile

began     pushing                   and as        I looked up I saw              that the area w i t h i n               the gates

was     s olid wit h              people.           It seemed         as    if a large number            of      people              had

materialised               from nowhere.

The     pushing at                the      t u r nstiles      i n c reased and          I can recall           people,

p ar ti c u l a r l y older                people      or    people w i t h         children,      compla i n i n g about

the     pushing.

W i t h i n a few more m in u t e s all                       signs       of queueing         had disappeared,                         I

was     stood with my back                         to the wall at           the side        of the turnstile a n d                          I

had stopped             s ea rc h i n g           people     becaus'e there was             no room to do so.

Because        of thj / p r e s s u r e             of the      crowd,       people      began jamm i n g          in the

entrance        to the               tur n s t i l e and as a result,                 this slowed down the                           rate

at w h i c h    people               could        enter     the ground.

More and m ore           people       began to c o m p l a i n a b o u t    the    crush and          I noticed

that    the s i t u a t i o n was        getting more        serious       than was       normal       for a

football       match.

I was     not abl e       to do a n y t h i n g     in the      p o s ition that        I was    in and the

crowd     pressure was           increasing all           the time.         I decided       to go to the

point     on L e pp in gs Lane where              I had    last seen our serial S e r g e a n t and

advise him of            the s i t u at io n at      the turnstiles.              Our    serial       had not

been    issued w i th         radios.        I realised that            if I were        to stay where          I

was for any            longer    this would         become      i m possible so         I forced rny way

t hr o u g h the       crowd.        This was very di f f i c u l t even though                 people were

trying to make way for me as                      they    r e a l i s e d what    I was    trying to d o .

As    I got to the         gates a w o m an g r a b b e d hold of my arm,                  she     had injured

her    foot an d she was              p anicking and       in tears.        I could not get             her

thro u g h    the      crowd so       I left her      in a trian g u l a r        clearing made by the

opened       gates.       I then made my way onto L e p p i n g s Lane.                     I was       in a

crowd of       people who were              steadily      pushing       in the d i r e c t i o n      of the

turnstiles.             1 can remember          looking      back      towards     the turn s t i l e s where

I had been and seeing what a p p e a r e d                   to be just a crowd of                 people.          I

was w o r r i e d because            from this      distance      the    people a p p r o a c h i n g    the

gr o u n d w o u l d    not see,       or be aware        of,    the    crushing at        the     front.       All

the    time    people were            pushing     past me,       adding     to the       crowd.        I wanted

to tell       them that         they should         hold back       for a while and a l t h o u g h            some

did,    the m a j o r i t y     didn't.        I then     looked along L e p p i n g s          lane and as

far as       I could see         it was      full    of people         coming towards           us.     It looked

like a b at te r i n g        ram.

As the       crushing a r o u n d the t ur n s t i l e s         became more        obvious,          mounted

officers       came to the            point on L e p p i n g s Lane where           1 was       standing and

b egan to form a cordon,                  pres u m a b l y to hold back the              crowd and so

relieve the            pressure       on the turnstiles.               I was stood        in a gap between

two horses          trying      to    prevent     people     from      coming     through.

had been at the turn s t i l e s                earlier,          the m a j o r i t y of     people     entering            i


had been older an d             better         behaved.

After a few minu t e s             I    saw that        the    crowd at the turnstiles,                  both for

the      West S ta nd seating and for the                       terracing,        had thin n e d       out.     I did

not realise at         the      time,        but     this was       probably         coincident        w ith the

gates     being     opened.

I then saw our          serial          Sergeant,          P.S.    Whitlain and almost              straight away

he told us of a radio                   call    r e questing         officers        to enter       the ground.

1 f o l l o w e d other      officers          t hr o u g h the t urnstiles and down the side of

the L e p p i ng s Lane       t e rracing           into the S o u t h Stand.               At the entrance to              !

being    t re at ed by officers.                    A l t h o u g h this area was           full,    I cannot        say

remember      t h i nking     that we were              dealing w ith a pitch                invasion,       but

then    J. saw fans         on the       pitch wit h the Police Officers.                           These    fans

invasion.              X then        looked at      the    centre     pen and saw that          it was        very

full.       The        people        inside were      sway i n g     forwards and       I realised that

the     o fficers         were       in fact helping          people    to get out       of the        pen.

I have       been a s e a so n ticket               holder at H i l l s b o r o u g h for m a n y years and

I can      remember            'looking a r o un d the        ground and thinking             that     it looked

u nre c o g n i s a b l e .        I had    never    before      seen the ground a n y w h e r e           near as

full.

As we got onto                 the    pitch the m a t c h had a l r e a d y stopped and the                   players

had     left.          I saw two young             boys    being     carried away towards              the S outh

Stand,       they w ere            u n c o n s c i o u s and their    faces were       o m i n o u s l y blue.          At

this     point          I r e a l i s e d that there was a danger               to    life w i t h i n the

ground.            I thought          to myself      that     those    boys    could easily          have     been

killed,        I       realise       now that      they were        probably alre a d y       dead.

The     gate       t hr o u g h    the    fencing    into the S o u t h end of the L e p p i n g s Lane

t er r a c i n g was       op e n e d and I f o l l o w e d Police          Sergeant Whit lam into the

pen.

I made        my way to           the     dividing        fence w i t h the     centre     pen where          I saw

people        climbing            over to our side.              1 helped     two or- three          people over

an d then I clim b e d onto a safety                         barrier    and shouted to the fans                    in

the     centre          pen to move         back    up the       terracing.      S o m e b o d y who    climbed

over     the fence at                the side      of me shouted,           "There's     people      died     in

there."            I    took      this    to mea n that       there were       some    injured       people        at

the     front          of the      centre       pen and     I was    shocked.

I climbed over                 the    fence and      landed       in the    centre     pen.     I saw that

man y    people were               laid on the ground at              the   front     of the    pen.        They

were m o t io nl es s a n d their                 faces and       limbs were     blue.        I can     remember

being      puzzled at              first    because young           looking    people     don't      die    in

large      quant i t i e s         all    at once.

I went        to a man who was              laid at        the   top of the      pile.      His waist          and

legs were t r ap pe d                in   the    pile and he wasn't moving.                 I w o n d e r e d why

the    people     on the         t e rracing weren't           doing a n y thing         to help him and as

I got     to him     I r e a l i s e d that          this was      because      he was        dead.       I

s t r a i g h te ne d his       head out and          I felt      for    his    pulse at his throat.                 I

o p e n e d his   left      eye and          I saw    that     his     pupil was dilated.                 He was              j

w here    to s t a r t .        The    crowd on       the    terracing         behind me seemed to be                         j


just     standing     there.            I heard       chants      of    " M U R D E R E R S *, I ignored                      |

them.      I heard         s o m e ob od y shouting,         "GET ME OUT",          I    looked and saw a                     <

between me and             the gate          onto the    pitch.          I could    reach his            hand and        I   ■;

for    fear of hurt i n g             them.     He    couldn't       get free.          I looked down and

saw that the g r o un d               between me and him was                covered w ith tangled up

bodies and        I walked            on them towards          the man.         I can remember                thinking

that my Doc M a rt en s were                  soft and that          I w o u l d n ’t cause any           serious

damage     to the     limbs           I was    t r e ading   on.        I dug at the          pile ar o u n d his

leg with my hands a n d with his                       pulling we got           it free.           He    too walked

across     the    bodies         towards me and back               onto the terracing.

I was     then s tood about              four    or five       feet     from the        gate onto the

             lifted       the u n c on sc io us       man onto a        board an d         carried him to the             other

            end of the           pitch.        I shou t e d that we           had a       live   casualty and           he was

             immediately          taken     by the        people a r o u n d     the ambulance.              I noti c e d that

            a lot of the other                 casualties who          had been carried here were                      being

            left,        presumably        becau se       they were        dead.

            I then made my wa y                back     towards      the L e p p i n g s Lane       end.       I assisted           in

            carrying more            casua l t i e s      to the Hop        end.         I then joined         the    cordon of

            officers m id -w ay acros s                 the   pitch.        I can        remember    being a p p r o a c h e d

            by several           groups     of Liverpool            fans    on the        pitch who were           asking if

            the      game was       to be a b a n d o n e d .       They also a s k e d me how they                  could

            ob t a i n    refunds on their              tickets.        I couldn't          think    of a reply.

            After        the a n n o u nc em en t     was made       to a b a n d o n the game        I made my way

            towards         the L e p p in gs Lane         end to try and            find my serial            Sergeant.            I

            saw a pile of            prope r t y near         to the       centre        gate of the        pen.      I saw a

            youth        picking     coins       up from the ground.                 I did not see           hinv putting

            the money w i t h the              other      property.          I cannot       say if he was looting                   as

             I did not           challenge       him.

            Our      serial      then m o v ed      out    of the     ground where we were                  s t a t i o n e d at

            the side of the              t e m po ra ry m o r t u a r y near        to the       river at the side             of

            the S outh S t a n d .

             1 then a t te nd ed         the     d e - b r iefing    in the N o r t h S tand and at 7.0 0                  p.m.

AGREEMENTS BETWEEN POLICE AUTHORITIES AND OTHER PARTIES RELATIVE TO
THE POLICING OF PUBLIC EVENTS

We have been consulted by Municipal Mutual, the insurance company
set up-by local authorities as £ mutual company to provide a
standard and reliable level of insurance for local authorities
You will^no doubt know that most police authorities use the
 unicipal utual as their insurance company.

They have pointed out that in. the "wake of the Taylor report into
the Hillsborough stadium disaster considerable attention is being
focussed on agreements entered into by police authorities- and those
organisations for whom they provide crowd safety and crowd control
functions.  There does not appear to be any standardisation of such
agreements and, whilst MMI in its position as the public liability
insurer of a large number of police authorities is able to comment
where appropriate on the wording of individual agreements there
would seem to be considerable merit in their view in the wording of
such agreements being considered on a countrywide basis.

My Association would support the idea, I think, of a standardised
agreement.   I believe that the issue may have already have been
considered by ACPO, and any information which you can provide would
be appreciated.

I would, of course, expect to involve chief police officers in anv
drafting working party that might be set up.
Yours sincerely

        '.VC/

                                             DISASTERS AND THE LAW


                   You (and fellow recipients) may stil‘ recall the meeting held
here on         13th December 1990 at which we held an interesting discussion of
various         issues relating to inquiries into disasters.    The minutes of that
meeting         were circulated in January.      The discussion has helped us to
produce         a draft of the suggested Memorandum which the Lord Chancellor might
send to         his Ministerial colleagues, and I now attach that draft.

           I should be grateful if you could, within the next two                                               weeks,
let me know if you have any comments on the draft.    I shall then                                              put it
to the Lord Chancellor for his consideration.       As discussed                                                at the
meeting, we envisage that he will circulate it, once approved,                                                  to his
colleagues on HS Committee and other interested Ministers.

           I am copying thi^- letter and the draft to those who attended the
December meeting, and to D. Nissan (Department of Energy), R. Brodie
(Scottish Office) and E. Vannett (Crown Office, Edinburgh).

                        DISASTERS AND THE LAW:
                    DECIDING THE FORM OF INQUIRY


                  Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor




Introduction


1*          This memorandum offers advice on the type of inquiry
     follow a disaster in such areas as transport, oil exploration,
football stadia and elsewhere, and the considerations to bear in
mind when choosing between the two main options.


2.          The two options are:


       -    (1)   a statutory "technical" investigation or inquiry
                  under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (or
                  under other, special statutory provisions), and
                        *


       -    (2)   a non-statutory public    inquiry set up by the
                  relevant Minister for the purpose of investigating
                  the disaster.


3•          I am writing this memorandum at a time when we are not
having to concentrate on any particular- disaster.      My interest
arises not only in safeguarding the differing public interest
concerns which arise,       but also   in securing the best use of
judicial resources.


The public Interest concerns


4-          The public interest concerns arising out of a major
disaster appear to be (although it is not the case that they can
all be met in a single procedure) that there should be:


                                                                   1
           (i)            a detailed investigation of the facts to
                          establish how the disaster occurred, how it
                          could have been avoided, and how to improve
                          safety for the future;


           (ii)           a means of establishing (where necessary) how
                          each deceased met his death;


           (iii)          mechanisms     for     the      assessment          and
                          apportionment of blame, with application of
                          (a) procedures for penalising those who are
                          criminally culpable (b) mechanisms for the
                          award of. compensation.




5-        The     first    of    these   concerns   can      be   met    by   an
investigation or inquiry of the kind considered in this paper.
In relation to the second concern, a problem may arise from the
duplication between a coroner's inquest and a public inquiry.
The implications of this problem and its possible solution are
being considered by tfye Home Secretary, and are not addressed
here.    In relation to the third concern, it suffices to note
that questions of criminal and civil liability will almost always
take second place to any inquiry that is held.



Option. (1) : The Irtechnical inquiry,r tinder statutory powers


&•        The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 empowers the
independent Health and Safety Commission to direct inquiries in
respect of accidents and so :forth which the Commission thinks
should be investigated.         Two types of "technical" inquiry may be
directed:


          First, the Commission can direct the Health and Safety
          Executive       (or   any   other   person)   to    carry     out   an


                                                                               2
             investigation.        This is usually conducted by expert
             inspectors in the Health and Safety Executive.


             Second,     the    Commission    can    direct     a   more    formal
             inquiry, with the consent of the appropriate Secretary
             of State.     This form of inquiry can be chaired by an
             outsider, and can include a public hearing.              The person
             holding the inquiry (and any expert assessors appointed
             to assist him) have power to summon witnesses to give
             evidence     or    produce    documents      and   power      to   take
             evidence on oath).


     either case, reports are normally made public.


7.           The statutory power to hold an HSE inquiry ensures that
technical    expertise     and     know-how    can   be    applied      front the
beginning.    This method can be used in a wide range of situations
and, indeed, could have been used in almost every recent example
of a disaster.


8.           In addition to the provisions of the 1974 Act, there
are comparable statutory powers to set up technical inquiries in
relation     to,   among       others,    railway,   aviation,      and     marine
accidents.



Option (2): Non-statutory public inquiries


9.           In recent years, the non-statutory public inquiry, set
up at the instigation of the appropriate Minister,                  and usually
chaired by a senior Judge or Queen's Counsel, has increasingly
become the standard mechanism for the investigation of large-
scale disasters, even where there is a statutory power to hold
a public inquiry. The procedure usually follows that which would
be required for a Tribunal of Enquiry under the Tribunals of
Enquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 (now rarely used): that is to say,



                                                                                   3
there will be counsel for the enquiry leading the questioning,
and interested parties will be represented by counsel.

1 0   .          There are two understandable reasons why non-statutory
inquiries are established in preference to statutory, technical
inquiries:

          they    appear     best    fitted     for     a     full   and    complete
          investigation into every conceivable aspect of a disaster;


          Ministers      set them up themselves:            the agreement of the
          Health and Safety Commission, for example, is not required.

 #

11.              it is understandable that pressure for public inquiries
of        this    kind    has   intensified.          Public      expectations     of
compensation have increased and lawyers acting for the injured
and the bereaved relatives seem to believe that it is possible
to achieve more out of a public inquiry than a technical inquiry.
However, a non-statutory public inquiry should not be regarded
as the inevitable result of a disaster.                     An inquiry of this kind
can       be     both    lengthy    and    expensive,       adversarial     attitudes
 invariably prevail and the outcome is rarely satisfactory to all
 concerned.         It can also make it more difficult to get at the
 technical         factors      which      caused   the      disaster      free   from
 considerations of blame and compensation.

 12.              Ideally, a technical investigation should be held, and
 preferably at the outset.                Where this falls under the Health and
 Safety at Work Act, it has the advantage of being backed up by
 the Health and Safety Executive and is conducted within the wide
 experience of that body.                 It is likely to be more expert and,
 ultimately, more effective.      There has been no widespread
 dissatisfaction with technical inquiries in the past. Although
  they are low key and do not attract so much media attention, they
  are capable of going a very long way to meeting the public needs.



                                                                                        4

        Guidance on the approach to adopt


        13.         In the light of the above analysis, the approach which
        Ministers are invited to' adopt when considering the appropriate
        form of inquiry into a disaster is as follows:


                    There should be a presumption in favour of holding a
                    statutory,       technical   inquiry     under       the    Health    and
                    Safety at Work Act 1974, or under other appropriate
                    legislation,       rather    than    a   non-statutory             public
                    inquiry.


    ff)       -     The    appropriate     Minister     should,      as    a     matter    of
                    priority, consult the Chairman of the Health and Safety
                    Commission as to whether the powers available to the
                    Commission       are   appropriate       for     the       purpose     of
                    investigating the disaster in question.                    The Chairman
                    will be in a position to advise within a short space
                    of time whether (a) a technical investigation by the
                    HSE or (b) a statutory inquiry with a public hearing
                    element, would be appropriate.
                               >
                    If,   however,    the Minister considers that there are
                    special    reasons     for   establishing        a     non-statutory
                    inquiry, he should consult the Attorney General before
                  • ruling out the option of a statutory' investigation or
                    inquiry.        The final decision on the appropriate form
                    of inquiry will remain; with the Minister.


              -     In either case, if it is thought that there should be
                   an inquiry and that it ought to be chaired by a judge
                   or     lawyer,    the   Minister     should     consult       the     Lord
                   Chancellor before any decision or announcement is made.
                    (Although it is arguably undesirable to use judges for
                   such inquiries, both on constitutional and practical
                   grounds,   I recognise that in certain circumstances
                   this may be the right method.)


                                                                                            5

  FOR THE ATTENTION OF MR MERVYN JONES


  Dear Sir

  Hillsborough Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

  We are instructed on behalf of David Duckenfield in connection with the
  Inquiry presently being undertaken by you on behalf of the Director of
  Public Prosecutions and also the Police Complaints Authority.

  Chief Superintendent Duckenfield has indicated there are matters which he
  believes should be investigated by yourselves as part of your general
  enquiries on behalf of the DPP and PCA which could usefully be carried
  out to enable both the DPP and PCA to have a fuller picture when
  considering any further action particularly in relation to Chief
  Superintendent Duckenfield.

  We should be grateful, therefore, if you would include the following in
  your investigations:-

   1.             Obtain evidence of drinking by supporters, particularly Liverpool
                  supporters away from the immediate area of the Hillsborough ground
                  on the day of the disaster.

   2.             Obtain any evidence in relation to fans attending the match without
                  tickets and any evidence of such fans attempting to get into the
                  ground without paying and the related problems caused thereby.

        r         Obtain copies of the notices which were placed by the South
                  Yorkshire Police in the Liverpool and Nottingham local papers
                  and match programmes prior tothe game, giving warnings to
                  potential spectators advising them to:

                   (a)   come early,
                   (b)   not to come unless they had tickets
                   (c)   that no drink would be allowed inside the ground.
                   (d)   to be patient.

               Please obtain copies of the press
               entries and match programmes detailing these matters.

     4.        Confirm you have all videos available relating to this matter in

         Dear Sir

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - YOUR CLIENT MR D DUCKENFIELD

         I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 19 February 1 9 9 0 , the contents
         of which I have noted.

        You point out four aspects which you consider are worthy of
        investigation. My response is as follows, I refer to your points by
        number.

         1.     A considerable amount of investigation work has been undertaken by
                us to address this particular issue. It will be included in the
                report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

        2.      Work has also been undertaken in respect of this concern.

        3.      The advance notice of the match and the advice proffered is a
                matter which is already in hand.

        4.      We have collected over 71 hourn of video material.                     However, we have
                not discovered any independent TTV nr YTV video. If you                             aware
                of any that exists I would be grateful for the information.

        In order to give you some idea how the investigation is progressing, I
        would like to advise you, confidentially, of the proposed timetable.
        However, I would say that it could be subject to variation depending
        upon the decisions and actions of others.




  PLEASE REPLY T O THE OFFICE A T              W q y d .House,, PAntfngbM.
j   I hope to complete the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions by
    the end of this month. However, that will be without any interviews
    being undertaken with any individuals, including your client. Shortly
    before Easter I hope to have a meeting with representatives of the Director
    of Public Prosecutions when I can discuss with them the subject of
    Interviews. Depending upon what Is said, I would hope that interviews
    under caution would he Attempted some time After Faster and In the
    following three or four weeks. 1 would propone that these would take
    place in Sheffield at our Furnlval House, which are premises away from
    South Yorkshire Police and hopefully away from obvious public gaze.
    Prior to the Interviews taking place I will contact the legal
    representatives of those I would propose to interview with a view to
    preliminary discussions. At that time the legal representatives will
    have the opportunity of viewing where the interviews will take place and
    what facilities we intend to use.

  Once such interviews have been completed I Intend to submit the
  transcripts thereafter to the Director of Public prosecutions for his
! consideration In conjunction with my earlier report. Prcrlaoly how long
  It will be before the Director of Public Prosecutions Is able to reach
  his decision and subsequently announce it, is not something on which I
  am able to comment.

    I do hope that this brief summary of our proposed progress is of some
    help to you. Please do not hesitate to contact if I can be of any
    further assistance.
I
: In closing this letter I would like to remind you that I would like the
  contents to remain a confidential communication between you and me and
  for them not to become public knowledge, and especially not to be shared
  with the media. I would also remind you that they are my best
  understanding at this present time and could be subject to change in due
  course.

    Finally, in respect of any information which you think could be useful to
    my Investigation, I will be pleased at any time to receive.

i Yours faithfully




    Assistant Chief Constable
    (Hillsborough Inquiry)

   Dear Sir

   On 1st April 1990 I was appointed to take over the Hillsborough Disaster
   Inquiry following the appointment of Mr G Dear to the post of Her Majesty’s
   Inspector of Constabulary. Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, is
   overseeing the Coronal aspects on behalf of the Coroner Dr Stefan Popper
   and I shall take charge of the Criminal Investigation and matters relating
   to complaints against the Police.

   I now enclose for your information copies of the video and photographic
   material you requested when you met Detective Chief Superintendent Foster
   at Furnival House.

   We are now in a position to commence the interviews of your client at your
   earliest convenience.  To assist this if you contact Detective Chief
   Superintendent Foster direct on              the necessary arrangements can
   be made.

   Yours falthfiullv

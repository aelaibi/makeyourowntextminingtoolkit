           was POL PS2620 CR OP LE Y’S/ de ta i1 and attended the Hillsborough Footbal

           Ground for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

           On arrival at the ground we were taken in to the North stand where we

           were briefed by a senior Police Of f i ce r , after whi ch we we re then



                                Rd,   having been instructed to patrol this area with a

                                      arriving supporters.                     At this time I was              in
                                      a
            company with POL PC 184 Alan GEEpSON.

           F rom around 2.30 pm (1430 h r s ) that da t e , I was on duty at the

            junction with Catch Bar Ln and Leppings Ln with other officers.                                    About
                                                                                   PAGE      2

this time PS CROPLEY left us and went             in a Ford Transit van with a

prisoner.     The crowds were beginning to build up and it was obvious

that many of them were the worse for dririj< and that a la/rge number did

not have tickets.        Many of them wer/e d r i m i n g    from litr/e bottles of

coke, wine bottles and carrying four pack's a nd I could smell alcohol

in the air.     Whilst I could not attribute the words to any specific

individuals,    the words     “Any spares /whack?" were echoing around me all

the time.

As it got closer to kick off time,             the crowds were getting denser          in

front of the gates and at this point we began to anticipate trouble in

the form of fighting outside the ground as it was obvious so many

would not get into the ground,         not because of the time element,             but

because they had no tickets,

In the midst of the p r e s s i n g crowds,      I could see a man whom I now know
                     ^       no V
to be Superintendent MA R S H A L L , apparently^hemmed/in and unable to

move.   Directly behind him were several            horsemen,    possibly I think

about s i     who from earlier talk I had gathered were f rorjy'L ive r pool ,

they also had different uniform ^iid badges.                These top were unable to

move because of the crowd dens/ty - they were leanyfsgover on their

horses trying to control        the,' crowd.    There was a further senior

officer standing on a wall to my right,             ho 1 di ng/ on to a lamp ^yfjst, and

he appeared to be trying to communicate on btx s radio.               Sho/tly

afterwards,    I wa<*/j oink'd by Inspector H U M P H R I E S , POL PC/7fir? FLATMAN

and POL PC 184 GEBSON/and we were h u d d l e / round the Inspectors               radio

the players were on the pitch.   The next message I pecall was for ail

available officers to go on to the cinder track ,a(s there was a pitch

invasion.     In company with the other officers we made our way down

Leppings Ln,    through some gates         in to the ground,     I think we went

                under the South stand and down a tunnel which led on to the pitch in

                front of the Liverpool        supporters.
                                                                          \ Q
                The first scenes 1 saw officers stood               the raxTIngs
                                                                          iiir   in front of the

                Liverpool       supporters be ckoni Big them to move back.    At the same time

                there were other s u pporter^ scrambling over the fence onto the pitch

                and there were about between 50 and 100 already stood about behind the

                goal.    At this time I still thought that it was a pitch invasion and

                we made our way to the left hand side of the goal mouth.                From there

                it became apparent that it was no ordinary pitch invasion and/that
                            /                                       /
                some of tme people were injured.            I begaf'n helping to carry/people from

                the g a l e .    I believe this was gate 3 / b n   to the pitch,

                injured appear ed'to be so badly injured I felt compelled to administer

               ^tjae ’kiss of / i f e * and this I commenced.        The first person I gave the

                 iss of life to came round and some othetf^people then took him away.

A —             I then helped to get another   one from t/e X a t e , laid         him on the pitch

    O       &A- apparent that this person was no*^ going to/ respond.  I looked up at

             /  this moment and saw PC FOSTEFJ^and PC CjpESON both trying to give the

                kiss of life to other supptyrters.

        '      I realised that the incident was now             far more serious than    perhaps

                anyone could have imagined.          People were standing around shouting and

                screaming at us to do something and I became aware that people were
                                                             /
                ri pping down the boardings and I assisted F'C FOSTER with the help of

                other supporters to carry one of the inju/red to the far side of the

                pitch.     When we got there we did not know where to go and we placed

                the injured person in the rear of the ambulance.             I then went back to

                the gate and assisted to move more onto the pitch.             At this time I

                remember there was a Sergeant at this gate.             He was wearing a yellow

                flourescent jacket and I assumed he was from Road Traffic.               He was

                shouting at us to all work harder and faster and told me to get into
                                                                       PAGE      4
                                                                       SI 926

the pen, which I did through the same Gate 3 I think.          1 made my way

up to the dividing fence with spikes on the top,      through which I could

see lots of bodies    lying on the floor,   people were scrambling on them

and trying to get out themselves.     .Bodies were being passed over this

fence which had clothing placed on the top,      both police and civilian

to offer    protection from the spikes, and I assisted to carry them to

the gate where they had to be lifted up and passed out to waiting

carriers.     I stayed there for some time,   I am unable to say how long.

This    crowded area was almost clear when I found myself standing

on the sidelines,    close to the point where I first entered the

ground - I have no recollection of leaving the pen area at all.          I can

remember    looking round and seeing a line of Police Officers      in the

centre of the pitch and people shouting,      screaming and some wanting to

fight.     I saw the Force Scenes of Crime Officer at tac ke d, punched and

I think water thrown on him - he was wearing      civilian clothing.     I

would like to add that during the time when I was carrying the injured

on the boards across the pitch we had to queue in front of the

Nottingham Forest supporters and I remember one of them pushed his way

to the front of their pen, and spat on the body on the stretcher,

another Nottingham supporter     ran up to him and punched him, and two of

them pulled the one who had spat on the body to the back of the crowd

and away from the fence.

Later    in the day I remember sitting back in the North stand where we

had first been briefed, and after that all      I can recall    is getting on

a bus to come back to Doncaster.

           I am a Police Constable          in the South Yorkshire Police s tationed at

           Doncaster. On 15th April           1989 I was on duty at Hillsborough for the FA

           Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



           I have previously submitted a form of recollections concerning my

           involvement on that day and wish to add the follo wi ng.

           All the persons I dealt with both dead and alive were removed from Pen

           .3, The last person I gave the kiss of life to was a w hite male                        1//18

           years old,       slim build about 5* 8" tall.               I cannot remember what he was

           wearing.    He was on the fii t&h^levg l^wi tfr thg ^oa l .J ^ t s ^ o j i ^ the South

           jSt y d, side about     10' to 12* from the goal                post. This youth appeared

                     The second person I gave the kiss of life to was a white male about 25

                     The third person I dealt with was in company with Fc Phil F O S T E R . This

                     person was a white male about 20 yrs old.             I cannot remember what he

                     was wearing we placed him on a piece of hoarding and with others who I

                     canffot, describe took him to the corner of the ground between the North

                     stnad k n d Spion Kop. There was an ambulance             reversing onto the pitch

                     and^v^e Zalcad him in it.       I do not know if he was alive or dead.            I then

                     returned > 6   Pen 3.    1 then assisted in pulling out numerous persons as

                     part of a chain of officers.         Some of these persons were obviously dead

                     although I cannot       recall the description of them other than one of

                     them was a young boy aged about 11 y e a r s . There we re about six

                     females who were      pulled out but I d o n ’t know if they were dead or not.

               I have been a Liverpool               Football        C lu b all     my   life,
                                 '                                   .

 i     f
               On    15th April         1989    (150489?     I tra ve ll ed to the H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l

               Ground       in S h e f f i e l d to see     the F.A.       Cup Semi-Final        between Liverpool

               N o t t i n g h a m Forest.



               X went       in a private         car witi£            a nek.                     and



               We a r r i ve d     in S h e f fi el d at about       12,30pm X-1230) after a trouble                free

               journey!          We had however          been s t o ^ e 4 / ^ y    Police   to see     if we had any

               drink     in the      car,      we were    not as z    z    about    tickets.      In fact      I did not
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               S3590

     have a ticket         for the gams           bat all    the others         did,



     We    parked the      car    in a side        road near    to the ground and all wa lk ed

     down to the ground.               I split      up from the others and                    I got to the

     L e pp i ng s Lane    t urnstiles at about             12.45pm    (1245),         I tried to get             to

     the     t urnstiles    but    I was        stopped at    the e n t r a n c ^ b y Police w hen/

     could not        produce a ticket.                                   Z 0     . < £ _ -           /    a    U      -

                                                                           f( & & ■
     I de ci de d to go to the             other    end of the ground the Forest                    end,       to try

     to get     in there.         At   that end, as at Leppi ng s Lane at that                       time there

     were     not a lot of fans about.                I tried about 8 turnstiles                    to get        in,

     just by offering            the operators a £10 note,              but each time              I was

     refused,         I then went       into turnstile                where       there was

                                                              I offered him £10,                he took        it,

     and     I just    climbed over the turns ti le s and got                    in

                                                                                                           0«A-

     W hen    I got    in I went       to the      right    hand s ide/ of the Hop terrace as you
B
     look at the        pitch end       I was w it h a big        crawd of other Liverpool                      fans,
s>
     By this time         it w ou ld have         gone dnto       ■15pm < 1 4 1 5 ?



     As we wa it ed for the            game to start         the only thing            I remember         is

     thinking     is that        the terraces at the sides              of the Liverpool              end was

     quite     empty.



     As far as what         h ap pe ne d    in the ground       is concerned             I am not able            to

     give any     real     details,        as    it was    not till    the game was              stopped,       that

     I saw anything wrong and then at first                       I thought           it was      crowd

     troubles.        I saw some       fans      running    on the    pitch.



     The     only way     I think      that      incidents    of this    nature         happening         again        is
                                                                                         P AG E     3

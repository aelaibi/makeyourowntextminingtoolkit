                     We   c o mmenced our          patrol     at about             10G0 hours                 (1000)    and   I spent        the
first     half      hour       or so showing PC                          the area ar oand the           ground a n d

p ointing         out    the    streets        etc that          I knew the      names     of and both of us

trying      to     locate       the    possible         trouble      spots      etc.

The    first       couple       of hours         of   patrol      went     very quietly,          no trouble,

other     serials         in the a rea getting                   themselves      organised.          Host    of the

police      officers           I saw a r o u n d L e p p i n g s     Lane    were       from my Division,

About m i d d a y        (1S00)       there was a steady flow of Liverpool                           fans,       mainly

older m e n w i t h wives and                  children who          have a r r i v e d    early by car and

well    organised          coaches,           making       their way along Leppings Lane                    to the

turnstiles.              All    very     pleasant,          cheerful       and queuing       orderly at the

turnstiles          to get        into       the ground.           If they're all          like    this then we

will    have an easy day                 I    thought.

At about          i3u0 hours          ' •]isUU) the ma,jority of the L.ivsrpoc 1 coaches                           began

to arrive and were                 sent       into C l a y w h e e l s   Lane    for     parking and        to

dis c h a r g e    thei r passengers.                 we    parked on the         forecourt        of Law Bros,

Coaches.           As    the    buses        emptied       the    number    of fans       increased greatly and

they were          the youn g e r        fans     in larg e / g r o u p s    and gangs.           Many of them

their m a t e s.          As    they gdn, nearer             to the      ground     they began        chanting and

About     1400 hours            (1400)        we moved       from L e p p i n g s Lane      into P a nistone Road

drive     the van safely a long                   the      road and      it was     closed to ail           traffic.

We    parked      in L e p p i n g s Lane,          in the       entrance        to the Used Tyre                firm,

(marked A on maps)                 and kept         observations              on the turnstile area.                     At

this    time     the are a         i n f ront       of the       t u r n s t i 1es was       packed with

supporters          but there a p p e a r e d to be                   no trouble,          they were       queuing,           sort

of,    and they were             getting       into       the    ground,        albeit       slowly,       without many

probiems.

There were          however        large      numbers        of fans just hanging about,                         sat on the

parapet walls            of the        river       bridge,       sat     on the footpaths,                stood outside

the    chip shop an d the                  other    shops       in the        immediate area and they were

making       no a t t e m p t    to join any of the                    queues at       the t u rnstiles            which

 I deci d e d to take a last^xook                         along L e p p i n g s Lane           before      going       into

Niagara       for     our meal         at    1500 hours           (1500).         Just as        I was moving             off

from the        tyre     f i rm the m o u n t e d         officers           began to       round up the           fans who

were    hanging a bout and direct                      them      towards        the    turnstiles.             1 went

along L e p p i n g s      Lane      to P e n i s t o n e R oad a r o u n d          the    roundabout         and went

back    towards        the      ground.        The     road was          v i r t u a l l y empty and traffic

officers were a g a i n a l l o w i n g              vehic l e s along Leppings Lane.                          W hen      I got

was a mob of fans,                 perhaps         1500    plus,        all    jammed       in the area

immediately           in front         of the       turnstiles.               They were       shouting         and     pushing

towards       the t u r n s t i l e s a t t e m p t i n g       to get        into    the ground.            I parked up

in L e p p i n g s Lane         facing       the    turns t i l e s      (marked       ’S ’ on maps).              There

appeared        to be very few               police       officers           there and       from what         i could

hear    on the        radio,       what      officers       there were            in the area were               having

a p p e a r e d to    be starting           to get       o r g a n i s e d and     requesting        ambulances,

stretchers,           and    doctors        etc.

It was      1520 hours          (1320)       when we got           into      the    club at N i a g a r a and got

our meal.            I d i d n ’t eat m uch          I d i d n ’t feel        like     it.        I went    into      the TV

R o o m where        they were        showing        pictures         from    inside       the     ground.         I saw

there were           some    of the        police       dogs    on the       pitch behind           the    cordon of

police      o f f icers      near     the Notts Fo r e s t            fans.        I thought we might               be

needed at        the       gr o u n d so we     left      the    club and          returned to our           previous

p o s ition     in L e p p i n g s Lane.

It was      now a bout         1533 hours          (1533),       whe n we        got back         to Leppi ngs Lane.

The    scene     that we        saw was,        to      put    it mildly,          total        chaos.     The     road was

b 1o c k e d b y e m e rgerscy v e h i c 3.e s , m a i n 1y f i r e a p p 1 ia n t:e s an d a rnb u Ia n c e s „

Opposite        the    e n t rance     to Vere R oad we               parked up w ith about                ten other

dog    handlers an d about                 12 - 14 m o u n t e d       officers.                There were about

150-200 other              police     officers          in L e p p i n g s Lane      from all        over the         force

area,     apparently           responding          to    ’O p e r a t i o n S u p p o r t . ’

The    other     dog       h a n dlers and myself              remained       in L e p pings        Lane    until

about     1600 hours           (1600)       when we were           deployed         by Inspector           PHENIX        to

stand by on the              forecourt         of Law Bros            (Coaches)        Ltd,       on Leppings         Lane

near P e n i s t o n e R o a d       in case of          possible       trouble as the Liverpool                      fans

were    now     leaving        the    ground.           whilst at       this       location we were              su b j e c t e d

to a barrage           of    verbal        abuse and          threats     etc      from the fans as they

passed     en route          to their        coaches,          cars,    etc.       My feelings            of disbelief

and    sorrow        for    the dead and b e r e a v e d           families was            quic k l y     put aside and

replaced by disgust,                  anger and even hatred                   towards        these       drunken fans

who    had no f e e lings w h a t s o e v e r            for    the    people who          had died or their

families        or for       that matter any o n e              else.        All    they seemed to           care about

was    the fact        the m atch          had been       stopped and            they had spent a            lot      of

m o n e y and    travelled a           long way          for    nothing.

What    a n n o y e d me was         the    fact     they were         putting       the     blame       on anyone,

            i ncluding       us,    for what      had happened,         when    the   cause   of this   disaster

            rests    solely,        in my      opinion,   wit h the m i n o r i t y    of L i verpool   supporters

            who    came to H i l l s b o r o u g h many with o u t       tickets,     with the    intention of

            getting        into    the m a t c h at w h a tever    cost     to anyone     but themselves.

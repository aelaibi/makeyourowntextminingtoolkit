        I have already spoken to my Instructing Solicitor in giving some general

advice about the points numbered 1 to 7 in my Instructions. In compliance with

our agreed timetable I have settled draft Affidavits for consideration in

Conference.    It is plain to me that a significant amount of work remains to be
done.   With some reluctance I have come to the conclusion that I will have to

see the 19 A4 boxes of the transcript before the Conference.   I hope that I can

extract some of the relevant information required to complete Dr Popper's

Affidavit.    It must be appreciated that without any instructions from him I

have extrapolated what I have read as falling from his lips in the transcript

material selected by the Applicants.    However, the Affidavit is to be sworn by

him and he must be satisfied that what is set out in the Affidavit accurately

and properly reflects his own views.

It would appear that Mr. Frazer was present every day at the
interim inquests but did not always represent the deceased families.
I found three instances

There were also instances when other solicitors were£ present.

Dear Dr Popper,

I noticed in the Press at the weekend that you will shortly be retiring from your
Office as Sheffield Coroner.

I would like to take the opportunity both on my own behalf on behalf of the rest
of the Steering Committee and our clients thanking you for your kindness in the
past and to wish you every happiness and success in the future.

It has been a very long two years since the Hillsborough tragedy particularly
as far as the families are concerned.

The care and sensitivity and inparticular the arrangements made for the families
at the individual# Inquests was very much appreciated both by them and by us.

As far as the lawyers are concerned your unfailing courtesy and consideration
to the advocates and ready response to various problems that we, as Solicitors,
have had to burden you with have been appreciated by us all.

I doubt whether any other Coroner has been faced with such a task before and whatever
you decide to do in the future we thank you for making a difficult time easier
and send our very good wishes.

Yours sincerely,




MISS E M STEEL

                     PATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISASTER

My medical qualifications are MB, BS, FRC Path, DMJ (Clin et Path). I have been
in Active practice in Forensic Pathology for almost thirty years and have been
Consultant Pathologist to the Home Office for South Yorkshire and the East
Midlands for twenty-five of those years. During that time I have performed more
than twenty-six thousand post mortem examinations for Her Majesty's coroners and
have taken part in some- seven hundred and sixty murder investigations.

I have been asked by Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief Constable of the West
Midlands Police in charge of the Hillsborough Enquiry Team, to provide a general
overview of the pathological aspects of the Hillsborough disaster in which some
ninety-five persons were killed on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 April, 1989,
during a cup semi-final match.

I took part in the investigation of the deaths myself, being present at the
request of Her Majesty's coroner at Hillsborough Stadium on the evening of 15
April, 1989, and at the Medico-Legal Centre on Sunday, 16 April and Monday, 17
April. I personally carried out nineteen of the ninety-five post mortems. The
other examinations were carried out by teams of pathologists working five or six
at a time in the mortuary of the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre at Watery Street
- following the transfer of the bodies from the temporary mortuary in the
gymnasium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground. Initially, I believe,
some thirteen bodies were taken to the mortuary of the Northern General Hospital
in Sheffield, but later they were removed from there and brought to the
Medico-Legal Centre. As far as I know, the only body autopsied at the Northern
General Hospital was that of a Lee NICHOL (body No 95), aged 14 years, who
survived, under treatment, until about 2 am on Tuesday, 18 April, and whose body
was examined that same day by Dr Shirley HOLT, Consultant Pathologist at the
Northern General Hospital, Herries Road, Sheffield, S5 7AU (Tel: 0742 -
434343). The work at the Medico-Legal Centre was performed by five forensic
pathologists and four clinical pathologists - all of consultant status. They

      70, 73, 84, 85, 87 and 88).

I can only speak in a detailed way of the nineteen examinations which I
personally carried out. However, having read all ninety-five post mortem
reports and seen certain statements made by witnesses, I believe I can speak in
a general way about the pathological conditions which proved fatal in the total
of ninety-five cases which were examined. The details of individual cases will
need to be obtained from the pathologists who examined them, which is why their
names and professional addresses, together with the body numbers, have been
provided above.

SEX
Of the ninety-five dead, eighty-eight were males and seven were females, which,
in my view, merely reflects the nature of the occasion.

AGE
Of the ninety-five who died, the youngest was a 10 year old boy and the eldest
67 year old man.
  Thirty-eight persons (approximately 40%) were under 20 years ofage
  Thirty-nine persons (41%) were between 20 and 29 years of age
  Twelve persons (13%) were between 30 and 39 years of age
  Three persons (3%) were between 40 and 49 years of age
  One person (1%) was between 50 and 59 years
  Two persons (2%) were between 60 and 69 years old.
  Seventy-seven of the ninety-five (81%) dead were below 30 years of age.
Again, I imagine these figures probably reflect the composition of the average
soccer crowd.

CAUSE OF DEATH
In virtually every case, the cause of death was basically compression of the
chest wall - against the bodies of the persons immediately around the deceased
or against fixed structures such as the walls of the stadium and the crash
barriers. In the vast majority of the cases, this pressure caused the condition
of traumatic or crush asphyxia - the two terms are synonymous.

Asphyxia pathologically means some mechanical obstruction to normal breathing.
That obstruction may be caused in a variety of ways - by a hand across the nose
and mouth (suffocation), by a ligature tightened around the neck
(strangulation), by a bolus of food which sticks in the airways (choking), or by
a strong pressure upon the chest wall so that it becomes fixed and cannot move
in and out to enable the person to draw breath. Whatever the impedance to
respiration, the result is similar. The oxygen in the air cannot be drawn into
the lungs and passed into the blood to be transported to the body tissues which
require it for their normal function. The deoxygenated blood in the tissues
turns a dark colour, giving the victim's complexion a bluish or cyanotic hue.
The heart begins to fail and the walls of the smallest vessels (capillaries)
which are under pressure and themselves starved of oxygen, give way and allow
spurts of red cells to pass into the surrounding tissues where they show as tiny
pin-point haemorrhages (petechiae) in the loose skin around the eyes, on the
forehead and behind the ears as well as on many of the internal organs. Thus, a
somewhat bloatd cyanotic appearance with external and internal petechiae arises.
If the impediment to breathing is not removed in some four to six minutes -
perhaps less if the victim is struggling and thus using up oxygen at a higher
rate - then the brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes and
ultimately the vital centres in the hind brain are damaged and die and then life
is no longer possible.

Appearances such as these were seen in almost every person who died at
Hillsborough, and in all but nine cases death was attributed solely to traumatic
(or crush) asphyxia. In one case (No 76) the force compressing the chest was
(perhaps momentarily) so great that the rear surface of the breast bone almost
touched the anterior surface of the spine, nipping and splitting the aorta
between them so that the man bled to death internally before he could be
asphyxiated. In only eight other cases (Nos 3, 27, 29, 48, 69, 91, 93 and 95)
were factors other than traumatic asphyxia thought to have even contributed to
the death, and in six of these eight, the contributory factor arose out of
trauma to the chest, neck or head. In the remaining two cases (3 and 69)
only,truly natural disease was believed to be a significant contributory factor
in the death.

INHALATION OF VOMIT
In any form of asphyxia vomiting may occur before death and because of
unconsciousness and the lack of the protective reflex mechanism, vomitus may be
aspirated into the lungs, greatly increasing the likelihood of death. Most
pathologists regard this vomiting as merely a facet of death from asphyxia and
though recording it in their post mortem reports, do not dignify it with a
separate heading in the cause of death. This is my view and the one I have
adopted in compiling the simple statistics for this report. It has, however, to
be said that for purely mechanical and obvious reasons, vomiting is more likely
to occur if the stomach is distended with food and/or drink and is subjected to
hard external mechanical compression. Vomiting is also more likely to occur in
those persons intoxicated with alcohol.

OTHER INJURIES
In eighteen cases bones were broken - mostly ribs (thirteen cases), but in
addition the bones and/or cartilages of the larynx (voice box) were fractured in
three cases (47, 51 and 81) - perhaps suggesting that the throat of these
persons had been trodden on accidentally ie that they were on the ground when
they sustained that injury.

In only two cases were long bones fractured. In one of these cases (18), both
bones in a woman's forearm were broken and in one (11) a young boy's femur was
broken. Both injuries could have occurred as the result of accidental
trampling.

In two cases impacts to the chest wall were so severe as to cause extensive
bruising to the underlying lungs, affecting the victim's ability to breathe and
in one of these the ribs were actually fractured and their ends tore the
underlying lung allowing air to escape from the lung into the chest
(pneumothorax) and seriously adversely affect the victim's breathing.

In one case damage to the nose with subsequent bleeding allowed the inhalation
of blood into the lungs and this was thought to be a significant factor in the
death.

As one would perhaps have suspected, a very high proportion of these bodies bore
superficial grazes and scratches - evidence of blunt impact against all manner
of solid objects such as walls, concrete flooring, barriers and fences. These
injuries are too numerous to be described or interpreted here and details should
be obtained in each individual case from the pathologist who actually performed
the post mortem (see above).

ALCOHOL
In discussing this matter, my impression is that the dead came mostly from the
front (ie near to the pitch) areas of the Leppings Lane end, from amongst
persons who had arrived early in order to get a good view and thus their blood
alcohols are not necessarily an indication of the alcoholic status of those who
arrived later and were pushing to get in at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

No blood was taken from the victim who died last ie no 95, because of the
interval of time which had passed between the accident and his death.
No alcohol was found in the bodies of any of the seven female victims.
Of the remaining eighty-seven men and boys, fifty-one (58%) were shown to have
nor more than 10 mg% in their blood, which is negligible, but fifteen had more
than 80 mg% in their blood, which means they could not legally have driven a
car, and six had upwards of 120 mg% in their blood. Six youths below the age of
18, who were not legally allowed to drink, had taken drink, of which group one
boy, aged 17 years, had a blood alcohol of 141 mg%, whilst a 15 year old had a
blood alcohol of 56 mg%.
EYE HAEMORRHAGES
I have been asked to comment on the proposition that a distinction can be made
in this case between those persons who died from traumatic asphyxia standing up
in the crowd and those dying from the same cause lying down. The latter, it is
said, will have petechial haemorrhages in their eyes whilst the former will not.
I have seen a very large number of cases of traumatic asphyxia and I am certain
that no such distinction can be made - both groups will in all probability have
petechial haemorrhages in their eyes.

GENERAL COMMENT
The Hillsborough disaster occurred between 3 pm and 3.30 pm on Saturday, 15
April, 1989. By 2 pm on Monday, 17 April, ie less than forty-eight hours later,
all ninety-four of the victims who were then dead had been examined post mortem
and had a blood sample taken for analysis, so that their bodies were ready for
release to relatives. I believe that several factors were responsible for this
feat:-

 1.   The excellence of Her Majesty's Coroner's arrangements and organisation.
 2.   The immediate availability of the Football Club's gymnasium, sited just a
      few yards from the pitch. This huge room was easily compartmentalised
      into three large chambers, each invisible from the others. One was used
      as a mortuary for temporary body storage, one as a makeshift canteen and
      the third as a reception area for relatives where they were greeted and
      assisted by padres of various denominations, social workers and
      ancillaries.
 3.   The fact that the victims' bodies were not fragmented nor greatly
      disfigured as might have happened in an explosion or an aircraft crash.
      This meant that the initial identification was possible from polaroid
      photographs taken by the police, which made the identification process
      rapid and meant that relatives were generally required to view only one
      body and were spared the harrowing task of entering the main mortuary and
      searching for their dead.
 A.   The use of the facilities available at the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre -
      the only building of its kind in the United Kingdom. This meant that in
      one day it was possible for up to six teams of pathologists and their
      assistants to work simultaneously in excellent conditions with modern
      equipment so that they were able to perform seventy autopsies on Sunday
      alone. This building was designed with an emergency facility to deal with
      disaster involving up to one hundred bodies, and when the disaster
      arrived, the building worked well. Sheffield City Council are to be
      congratulated on their provision of such a building.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out 'below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

      a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
              subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
              they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

      b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
              conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
              legitimate purposes in c o n ne x i o n with any legal proceedings
              in which solicitors may be engaged.

      c.      Subject to th&'cakg)!?© t they are to be kept confidential until
              they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect .
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is        per sheet (total £
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,

                                   \

                 POLICY NOTES

                                          Thursday, 3 January 1991

Telephone discussion with Dr S L POPPER, HM Coroner. We
discussed progress that the Coroner had made over          the
Christmas/New Year holiday period to identify the process by
which he would sum up at the conclusion of the Inquests and
how we,   as his team, could assist.     Briefly, the Coroner
proposes the following outline of his summing up:

1.   He will explain the method he will adopt to sum up;       in
     other words the introduction to the summing up.

2.   He will briefly outline the legal issues but not at that
     stage go into any detail and certainly not go into any
     legal directions.

3.   He will then list the various types of verdict that the
     Jury could return and explain what each means.

4.   He will then summarise the evidence that was taken at the
     interim Inquests in April/May 1990.

5.   He will then address the evidence on how the 95 people
      came to meet their deaths.        He will do this by
      summarising the history of the event, giving examples of
      the general understanding, identifying the numbers who
     will support the concensus, and finally identify the
      contradictions or changes in emphasis.

6.   He will address the legal issues.

7.   He will address the material issues upon which the Jury
     will have to consider their verdict in the light of the
      legal aspects.

The Coroner then discussed with me the issues as he saw them.
Briefly they can be summarised as follows:

1.   The overall planning of the event.

2.   The degree of recklessness, if any, in allowing the crowd
      to build up in Lepping Lane prior to the opening of
      Gate C.

3.   The degree of recklessness or otherwise in opening Gate C
      and/or other gates.

4.   The degree of recklessness, if any, in failing to seal
      off the tunnel access to Pens 3 and 4.

5.   The failure of the supervisory officers, i.e. Chief
      Superintendent DUKENFIELD, Superintendents MURRAY and
      GREENWOOD, to properly observe the packing of, and

                 7.   The degree of recklessness or otherwise in failing to
                      open the perimeter gates to the pens and release injured,
                      dying people.

                                  (i.e. the Police, the Club, etc.)

                            (ii) The ultimate outcome (i.e. 95 deaths).

                 I spent some time discussing with the Coroner some way in
                 which we could assist him in having all the information easily
                 identified and collated so that he could prepare his summing
                 up.    It  may  be    that  there  is   a  role   for   myself,
                 D/Superintendent BEECHEY or D/Inspector PERKINS, to identify
                 material witnesses who provide key evidence which could be
                 used in the summing up.    This perhaps could be done on an
                 individual Witness Sheet upon which could be marked those
                 aspects that the relevant witness has identified.   This could
                 be followed up the next day from the transcripts by a
                 researcher(s) extracting the relevant sections.       In other
                 words, cut and stick!

                 It appears to me that this could be useful.         Those who
                 actually do the identification of the issues in Court would
                 have to concentrate upon key evidence rather than ticking
                 every section for everything the individual said. We can give
                 this some thought at our meeting at Nechells on Friday,
                 4 January    1991,  so that we     could brief   the   Coroner
                 appropriately on Monday, 7th.

                 The telephone discussion concluded at 12.20 hours.

                                                                                            A
 FILE NOTE DATED 8.10.90.    TELEPHONE CALL FROM MR. FRAZER.

 Mr. Frazer said that he was pleased to be able to tell me

 that the Family Support Group had now decided to instruct

 the Steering Committee to represent the families.     He said

 he thought the instructions would come direct from the

 Group rather than through solicitors but that was really a

 problem for them.    The nett result would be that either he,

 Junior Council and/or Mr. Huyfcon would be present.    He did

not expect Mr.           to be there throughtout.    Possibly

at the beginning or at the end or at any particular

fQdlCl>t~.ns point in time when he might want to
cross-examine.

M r . Frazer wanted to know whether I was having a

Pre-Inquest Review.    I explained that I would have

preferred to have this with solicitors only but we felt

that that would not be a very good idea as it might give

the impression that things were being done otherwise than

in public.   Mr. Frazer felt that it would be right that if

Group members wanted to attend, they should be able to sit

behind but in principle he thought that the meeting could

and should be held with legal representatives only.     He

felt it would be very helpful as it would enable them to

prepare more realistically if they knew what was happening.

I explained to him that it was my intention to let them

know as soon as possible the oeehentfcr of how I was

proposing to run the inquest together with an indicator of

the sort of numbers that we were likely to be calling.




LESABG
We discussed the nominations by him of witnesses.        I

explained to him that whilst I realised there was some

difficulty in that       didn't have access to all the

statements, on the other hand what I was really after was

names of people who he/his clients knew and who they felt

ought to be given the opportunity of being heard.        It

wasn't so much people whom they didn't know about but

people whom they did know who they might want to put up to

me for me to consider.     I repeated that of course in the

end it would be my decision.

He then said that as far as he understood it, I was

intending to run the Inquest generically, more or less in a

similar form of line to Lord Justice Taylor.      I said that

that was correct, but there were certain elements of

modification to that.     1.   That if I was calling generic

evidence and was able to find people who could give that

evidence satisfactorily and who had an association with one

or more of the deceased, then I would probably use that

person, as it would enable a certain amount of specificity

to be brought in.    2. That it was my intention to probably

call people like Mr.     Hicks and Mr.   Devonside who had been

present and of course had suffered a tragic loss.        I felt

that it was important that by listening to a number of

people who had maybe strong views, that although this would

in some ways mean that there particular bereaved would be

dealt with in somewhat more detail, it would also mean that

the generics for everybody else would be properly explored.




LESABG
Mr.   Frazer mentioned Mr.   Spearitt.   I s aid that

my list for consideration.

TURNBULL. TIME 10.57 to 11.24.        0274 391362   ______



I managed to get hold of Jim and asked him similar

questions to Mr.      Sturt.



      1.   Did he think that there was any reason why,

           having allowed the officers to summarise the

           evidence of the rescue that I should now have to

  *        call these people specifically.     Jim Turnbull

           felt "no".    He thought that it was perfectly

           proper for me to allow this evidence to go forward

           on the basis that this would be of benefit and

           help to the bereaved and that it might help them

           with their grieving, but that was no reason why

           one should have to go over it again if it didn't

           in fact advance the primary considerations of the

           inquest.

           I asked    him what he thought about meeting with the

           lawyers    and having discussions incamera with the

           exclusion of various parties.     He thought it was

           an excellent idea that he had done it himself and

           he felt that if that having meetings in this way

           procedurally with a view to sorting out the

           running of the Inquests proper had many many

           advantages and tended to facilitate rather than

           hinder.




LESAAD
         He did say that if at such a meeting anybody

         objected, then of course it might be necessary to

         take that into account and act appropriately.

     DICTATED 8 .3.9O.   LONG TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH DR. KNAPMAN
     (IROM A CALI BOX    - COST £2.80).___________ _______________________


     He told me about the D.P.P.    The upshot of what he said was that the
     D.P.P. didn't really object to a limited Inquest in the form of which
     I was proposing to hold it and he was intending to do the same.
     I think he was still in some difficulty because the D.P.P. have not
     yet decided what to so and I think he was concerned that the decision
     might be announced before he could get off the ground, or alternatively
     the D.P.P. might ask him to adjourn.   His plan was to announce         Inquest
     for the 23rd of April.    If he was asked to adjourn, he would do so for 28
     days and then resume but that he would seek to limit the Inquiry to
     matters which would not infringe the D.P.P's legitimate interests.
     $ discussed the question of Jury with him.   He felt that we definitely-
     had to have one and that he would do so *0 0. I expressed my concerns
     that the Jury would of course find this quite a difficult task.    He
     didn't really think that there was any alternative.
     He pointed out to me that there was the risk that the families would
     be dissatisfied with the limited nature of the Inquiry.    I said I realised
     that, but we would seek to answer as many questions as we reasonably
     could and we were bound to have some who wouldn't be entirely happy.
( < I said that we could only do the best we could.
     He asked how long I thougit I would take and I said I expected to do about
 ^   8a day.   I think he was rather surprised at this.    They managed apparently
     5 an hour for the Clapham Train Disaster but as far as I was able to
     understand him the proceedings were very very brief with just identification
     and one person saying that the body had been found in such and such a place.
     It seemed to me that the Hillsborough situation was totally different,
     and that the relatives had legitimate interest in doing rather more than that.

MEETING WITH MR. STDHT ON M D A Y / O F JDHB 1989.

AISO PRESENT POE PART OP THE TIME WAS BILL MADDOX HIS CORONER'S OFFICER
AND JOHNNY 'THE LAD! WHO APPARENTLY HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE AMIN
AND ORGANISATION OP THE TRANSACTIONS'.


Mr. Sturt was exceedingly helpful, and with guidance and help in
connection with the work and help in connection with the work
which he did on Zebrugge, which might be relevant to me.

We discussed the ambit of how.          He let me have a copy of the judicial
review in which he was supported and also photocopied and extracted
out of his direction to Jury which he explained the general proposition
on which he had proceeded.       In principal he distinguished between
the background circumstances                    was more in the nature of
setting the scene and explaining the situation so that the actions themselves
i.e., the how could be understood.

3e felt that it was exceedingly important to try and establish the
when and where of the deceased, and entirely agreed with the amount
of work which was being put in.         Although we didn't discuss it
in absolute detail, my impression was that he felt it was necessary
to deal with the surrounding circumstances, for example arrests for
drunkenness and so on, and what had happened outside the ground
immediately prior to the event.         He had in general dealt in great
detail with the 24 hour period over which the disaster had occurred.

We discussed the question of Jury.         He pointed out that we had to be
careful about the conflict of interests, not only for myself, but
also for them.     In particular they might be related or associated
in some way with some of the deceased.         This was a point which had
to be watched.     Basically he had been advised by Counsel that his
job was to minimise the disruptions rather than to maximise them.

We discussed the question of D.P.P. and Manslaughter.         He poxMed
out that under Rule 28 the D.P.P. could authorise an Inquest to
proceed, even if evidence vrere being produced which might give rise
to charge of Unlawful Killing.

He pointed out that the D.P.P. in his easersraacappreciative of the
problem of aborting the Inquest or even holding it up for any length
of time.


His Inquest lasted about         weeks which was about as long as he
thought the Juries and he himself could sustain it

families on the whole were represented jointly but there were a few
who individually represented, one of which whom was Mr. fiLapley who
represented an individual.
submissions.    There was one which had lasted at least      hours.

He tended to retire, even if it was only for coffee "before giving a
ruling on anything or any complexity.   He felt that it was exceedingly
important not to make mistakes.

He consulted with Counsel with regard to his advice where necessary
and received some guidance and help from Counsel with regard
to his summing up, though on the whole he felt that this was his
own unaided work.

We discussed transcription.    They had used recordings.   I wasn't
quite clear whether they used two or three tape recorders, hut
certainly there was one reel to reel machine which was used as a
overall "back-up copy.   They had 1 policewoman whose sole job was to
make sure that the tape recorders were working properly.     They
.had used 4 word processors.   Initially they were able to keepoop
but eventually fell behind because two of the secretaries had left.
Altogether they had about 6 secretarial staff and I think Mr. Sturt
felt that it might have been a little bit on the low side but
Johnny thought that they would have coped if everybody had stayed.
In addition they had a Marshall who performed certain functions,
Solonel McEwan., but he had to leave before the end because of the
length of the Inquest.    Mrs. McEwan would come along as well and
specially made the tea and coffee and generally by the end was
an exceedingly helpful person.    The fact that somebody was there
to 'mother them' so to speak was very useful.

Ordinary Soronal work was handled by his Deputy.    He had to give up
all his normal legal work (he is a part-time Coroner) for several
months at very severe financial loss.

Johnny had gone through all the transcripts and had flagged and
marked relevant bits of the evidence of each individual,and death,
and this helped him with his summing up.    He did not hand to the Jury
anything other than 3 exhibits, a life jacket a**d a plan of the ship. ^
He did not let them take in the Jury Hoorn any documents of their
own but he did give them a pro-forma on which they were able to
record various aspects.

 (i think we will have to think about this.   We have pre-psepared
 the Inquisitions, which to a certain extent covers the pro-forma
which they used, but it is obviously going to be a bit of a complicated
matter, to enable them to remember all the details and facts.       He as
 far as I could make out prepared his summing up over the week-end).

 He felt that the transcripts had to be read through and corrected
 by him before they were released.   They were listened to by members
 of his family and also by himself and then the necessary amendments and
Discussed shorthand writing.    It seemed from what he said that
transcription "by recorder would be cheaper (but I amUstilSiv (tempted
with the shorthand, aa "tile standards of the Inquiry seems to be
very high).

 Arrangements were made for the witnesses to be warned in batches.
This was done well ahead of time.   Witnesses notices were sent out
but not summonses and by and large things went quite smoothly.
Expenses were re-funded usually by cheque, but in one case they
had to pajr out in cash.   If need be, overnight accommodation was
paid for.
All witnesses were supplied with a plan of Dover showing locations
of site, names and addresses of boarding houses and hotels with
costs and other general information, to make life easier for them.

Provision was made in the building for tea and coffee, but this was
not provided on a free of charge basis either to families or witnesses.

Arrangements were made for the Jury to be able to take their coffee
breaks on their own.    There was a room which had to be provided, so
that they didn't mingle with the general crowd.    Apart from that,
they were free to go out in the evening, having been warned of course
not to discuss the matter, and similarly at lunch.    Coffee breaks
were arranged in the morning and in the afternoon, and there was
usually an hour for lunch.    The Inquest started, I wasn't sure whether
it was 10 or 10.30.

They had provided a room in the building as a museum for the Inquest
in which they had retained all the various copies of all papers, documents
and newspaper cuttings etc.    This would be open to people who wanted
to do serious research.
Transcripts were in three forms in this room.     The first raw draft, and
then the various aaend/^trsions as they were listened to.      All these
had been kept and usefully so, because with the present prosecutions,
some of the details on the original drafts, such as who had typed them etc.
was needed.     Tapes had also been kept.

Mr. Sturt had retained all draft notes that he had made and these had
carefully been bound for historical purposes.

Documentation was neatly bound and presented in good quality binders.


            bofng 'that thoy took           under some pressure as some
of the paper work wasn't completed when they began and they were catching
up as they were going along.    Hopefully that is a problem which we
won't be faced with.

Mr. Sturt made it clear that it was absolutely essential to try to
anticipate^the legal problems which might arise, and be able to give
well            guidance and rulings.   It is hispoint of view that the
most difficult question of course is the issue, Unlawful Killing,        He
pointed out that the situation would now be more difficult in view of
     the prosecution initiated against P & 0 and various people
     as not surprisingly others would want to seek to follow the
     same principle in cases.    This might of course apply at Hillsborough
     as well.
     I asked how the Jury were sworn in and he pointed out that this was
     actually set out in the transcript of the opening which of course
     I have already got.    They did it by a very short oath and on the
     basis that he would then read out all the names, which is in fact
    what he did.       ..    .

     He confirmed that the signing of the verdicts after the Jury had given
     their decision took a good two hours.

     The Jury once they had been put in charge were kept in a hotel overnight
     until they had reached a verdict.    This took over 24 hours to conclude
     their deliberations.

        Hillsborough Family Support Group




         Dear Mr. Hicks,

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

         Thank you for your letter of the 24th of August.

         I am somewhat astonished by some of the comments which you make, but I do not
         feel that any useful purpose would be served in responding to these.

         It seems to me that the points which you raise might perhaps be better
         addressed to your legal advisers.

         To avoid misunderstanding, I want to make it quite clear that the content,
         scope, form and procedure relating to the Inquests is a matter for me.

         Once the D.P.P. has announced his decision, I will consider it and take
         whatever decision is appropriate in relation to the Inquests.


         Yours sincerely,




          ' H)

Hillsborough Judicial Review.

I attended at the Town Hall arriving at about 25 past two rather
later than planned.

Mr. Webster and E. Bashforth present.

Discussed the application for Judicial review.

The had discussed the propriety of acting but in the light of the
drafting of the application they in discussion with the current
coroner had not felt that there was a conflict. They would of course
withdraw should it become apparent in the course of the proceeding
that such a conflict might exist. They would also check with Counsel
to make sure he is happy with the situation.

I indicated that I would not be taking notes and Mrs. Bashforth said
that was not necessary as she was writing down any points that were
made so that they could be incorporated in the affidavit.

We discussed the 7 points which had been raised and various notes
were made regarding this.

I pointed out that there were some medical anomalies eg the
establishment of a pulse by ECG and the additional medical evidence
and it was felt that an affidavit from an expert might be
appropriate.

This was one of the problems which we need to resolve namely to what
extent any affidavit of mine should deal with the points raised,
whether other affidavits should be filed or whether it should be left
to counsel to argue it out on the day.

After a prolonged discussion (Mr. Webster left at 15.00)
Mrs.Bashforth and I went to the MLC and we met Mr. Dorries who was
still there.

I showed Mrs. B. were the Hillsborough files were kept. We had a
quick look through the instructions to counsel but on first glance
there was no specific reference to Lack of care verdicts in these
instructions or replies. (There was reference to a special verdict
and a general request for comments on verdicts or something like
that.)


On returning home I found some handwritten notes which may be dated
22nd Sept. 1990 in which the lack of care appears with two question
marks. I also found a another reference in a draft direction in which
I refer to the other verdicts left namely accident and open but refer
to drafting legal direction re lack of care.

 Dear Dr Popper,

 I noticed in the Press at the weekend that you will shortly be retiring from your
 Office as Sheffield Coroner.

 I would like to take the opportunity both on my own behalf on behalf of the rest
 of the Steering Committee and our clients thanking you for your kindness in the
 past and to wish you every happiness and success in the future.

 It has been a very long two years since the Hillsborough tragedy particularly
 as far as the families are concerned.

 The care and sensitivity and inparticular the arrangements made for the families
 at the individual* Inquests was very much appreciated both by them and by us.

 As far as the lawyers are concerned your unfailing courtesy and consideration
 to the advocates and ready response to various problems that we, as Solicitors,
 have had to burden you with have been appreciated by us all.

 I doubt whether any other Coroner has been faced with such a task before and whatever
 you decide to do in the future we thank you for making a difficult time easier
 and send our very good wishes.

 Yours sincerely,

Dear Chris,
                    Hillsborough Inquests

Thank you for your letter of 16th April. I am sorry it has take me so
long to reply.
I do not thinlc^that it would be wise or perhaps even proper for me to
correspond directly with the Home Office regarding the letter which
they have received from Mr. Glover. I think any response will have to
come from you or your office.

I was abroad at the time when the judicial review application came
before the the court but I note from news paper reports which I
have seen since my return that presumably leave to apply for judicial
review has been granted.
I was a little surprised to see in the reports that counsel for the
appellants indicated that no objection had been lodged. I do not know
whether you as coroner were ever formally approached for any comment.
In any case I thought that the application was ex parte. As you will
know except for the chance remark which you made regarding the date
of the hearing when I spoke to you on the phone about some other
matter ( namely looking for some documentation which might be of help
to Jim Turnbull in the Tony Bland inquest) I do not think that we
have had any conversation much less correspondence regarding the
application for judicial review.

I note what you say about your own involvement in the judicial
review proceedings. Whether you really need to exclude yourself so
rigorously is a matter on which I do not think I should comment
particularly as in the end it has to be your decision.

I note what     you say about Judith Naylor. I am not sure to what extent
I should or     will be involved but no doubt will hear from Judith in
due course.     I will however not be available till the beginning of
June in any     event as I am going abroad again God willing on 14th May.

If I now revert again to the letter from the Home office. I am
somewhat hampered in that I do not have access to all the
documentation which is of course in Sheffield. In addition
there has been a substantial passage of time since the disaster and
the inquest which does not help. Subject to that if it will assist
you or Judith in dealing with the letter from the Home Office I would
make the following comments.

I note hat the Home Office sent you a copy of Mr.Glover's
letter on 14th April even though it appears that his letter is
dated 2nd December.
I have a feeling that there has been a previous letter from Mr.
Glover and it may be that if one looked through the correspondence
with him which should be on file you may find that some of the points
which he raises have already been brought up before.

I also agree with you that in so far as as the matters he raises are
within the ambit of the judicial review it may not be appropriate to
deal with them at this stage. Furthermore there is the general
principle that if there is a complaint about the conduct of an
inquest there are procedures for review by the courts and it is
questionable whether it is either right or wise to seek to explain
one's action privately to one of the parties particularly when the
explanation is requested in the context of a complaint.

One has however to bear in mind that whatever one may think of the
questions, at the end of the day Mr. Glover lost a son and it would
seem that despite the public enquiry and very long inquest
proceedings Mr. Glover still feels that more has to come out. I
believe that in fact Mr. Glover's other son who was present at the
same match gave evidence at the inquest on I think day 40.

With regard to the highlighed questions:

1. This is a matter for the Registrar of Births and Deaths. I feel
almost certain that this point has been raised before.

5. It seems reasonable clear to me that Mr. Glover has misunderstood
the point I was making. However for the reasons which I have already
set out I do not think that I should seek to re-explain what I said.
In addition as Mr. Glover was and presumably still is legally
represented it should be possible for his legal advisors to review
the transcripts and clarify the position for Mr. Glover.
Alternatively the matter may be aired at the judicial review if it
proceeds.

6. I am not sure what is being referred to here. I do not recognise
the description given by Mr. Glover and no doubt he would be able to
produce the references to what he is alleging.

I hope that these comments will help.



Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper.

             Dr Stefan L Popper




             Dear Stefan

             Hillsborough Inquest

             I am writing to let you have a copy of a letter received today from the Home
             Office together with an enclosure. However, Mr Glover is one of the six
             parents who succeeded recently in their application for a judicial review and
             I doubt the wisdom of    the Home Office making a full reply at present. Can I
             ask that you correspond direct with Yvonne Buxton.

             You will appreciate that I feel unable to be personally involved in the
             response to the judicial review because of my involvement (albeit very minor)
             both in the aftermath of the disaster and the legal proceedings that
             followed.  In any event, I am presuming that the Affidavit will of course
             need to be made by you.   I am having a meeting with the legal advisers from
             the Town Hall in the next week or so to agree an appropriate course of
             action. Another difficulty is that they themselves should not really be
             involved because of the City Council’s part in the proceedings.

             I am going to suggest therefore that responsibility for dealing with the
             judicial review, so far as this office is concerned, be given entirely to my
             Deputy.  Independent solicitors will need to be involved and Counsel
             instructed.  They will liaise with you very quickly and no doubt involve you
             in a conference to decide the next steps.

             This is also therefore a good time to mention that Bob Forrest and Judith
             Naylor (my assistant deputy) have agreed to swap positions with effect from
             the 1st May 1993.  This follows Bob turning down the offer of Phillip Gill’s
             jurisdiction, and is not only with his agreement but at his suggestion.   I
             think it is felt that the title of Deputy (there being very little difference
             in the workload in reality) will be of more use to Judith now in her future
             legal career.

The responsibility of Hillsborough will therefore fall on Judith.   Judith is
a solicitor in private practice and is therefore able to instruct Counsel
direct.  This may work out quite neatly in view of the difficulties that the
City Council Legal Department have. You will find Judith a very sensible,
level headed lady, she is making quite a name for herself in legal circles
and is currently Chair of the Criminal Law Solicitor’s Association, one of
the major professional organisations.  Judith is also about to be appointed
as a Tribunal Chairman I understand.  I have however passed on your warning
about immigration appeal tribunals and the amount of work involved!

Although I am not going to be involved in the legal processes involved I do
still feel it is my responsibility to ensure that matters are proceeding
smoothly in administrative terms and you should not hesitate to ring me
therefore if problems of that nature arise.

Best Wishes

 IAN THOMAS GLOVER DECEASED

                                     about the death of his son,
 Ian, in the Hillsborough stadium disaster.
 In order that we may reply to Mr Glover we should be grateful to
 receive any comments that you may be able to offer on the points
 highlighted on the enclosed copy.
  In replying I will of course state that although the Home
  Secretary has a general responsibility for the law under which
  coroners work he has no authority to intervene in or to comment
  upon in any way, the way in which a coroner, who is an
  independent judicial officer, carries out his duties in any
  particular case.
   I look forward to hearing from you in due course

  ar Sir,
            I am the father of Ian Thomas Glover (deceased) who died at the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster on 15th April 1989. I have tried to get answers
to how and why he died that day (nearly k (four) years ago) without success.
Now I'm putting some of those questions to you.
We were told by Mrs Thatcher (prime minister at the time) that there would be
no cover up and the truth would be told.Up to now the truth has not been told
and as a British citizen I think I am entitled to know how and why my son died.
If the South Yorkshire Police did wrong on that day they should be accountable
to the public in the same way as a member of the public would be accountable to
them if they done wrong.
If you find the questions difficult to answer then ask Lord Justice Tayl&r who
carried out the inquiry into the disaster he may be able to help you.If you don't
answer my questions then I shall write to the queen to see if she cam help*


1) Why hase I not received a death certificate for my son?                    <
2) Video tapes of the disaster unfolding were viewed by the South Yorkshire
Police.When Dr""Popper (coroner) askee to show them at the inquest to the jury
he was informed that they had gone missing. Where are those tapes?
3) Myself and other families attended a public court in Manchester to decide
liability and blame for the disaster.lt was attended by barristers representing
South Yorkshire Police,Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Sheffield City Council and the
stadium designers. As we sat in the court tlie Police admitted liability in neg­
ligence and the judge said isn't anybody in this court blaming the supporters
for the disaster .Nobody answered.Just after that we were asked to leave the court
and the case was carried on behind colsed doors.All the families present      were well
behaved and no one was allowed in the court.I would like to know why we were not
allowed to find out who is taking the blame.
*0 My son was taken out of the pen approximately 20 minutes past 3 by two Police
Officers and layed on his back.At approximately ^p.m. he still had a pulse .Why was
he not taken to hospital in the ko minutes in between?when there was a line of
ambulances waiting to take people to hospital?
5) Dr Popper said he was conducting the inquests as if it was a road accident
with one death.The fact is it was inside a stadium and 95 people died consequently
it became the largest inquest in British history why was he allowed to get away
with this?                                                    continued
  Vlliy was Dr Popper allwoed to stop questions which arose after 3.15p.m,   when sane
  people who died were clearly still alive after that point?
v 6) Why was the South Yorkshire Police praised for a full day during the inquests'
  and allowed to read out statements praising one and others actions during the
  miners strike when clearly this had no bearing whatso ever on the Hillsborough
  Disaiter?
  7)Because my son was over 18 and unemployed the only compensation we recieved was
  his funeral expenses?
  8) My wife ancTI travelled to Sheffield Town Hall every day of the inquests (four
  months) at a cost of    over £17,OCX) (seventeen thousand pounds).IX South Yorkshire
  Police were negligent that day why do they not pay me all the expenses we have
  incurred?


  I beg you to bring out the truth    of the Hillsborough disaster in order to allow “
  the souls of the ninety five people who died to rest in peace as X am sure this is
  not possible while the cover up goes on.



  Yours sincerely,

     received an earlier reply

     You suggest that it is inappropriate for the coroner to hear
     an inquest touching on the possible liability of the
     City Council. However, although coroners are appointed by and
     receive a salary from the local authority, they are not
     employees of the council. Coroners are independent judicial
     officers who hold office under, and are officers of, the
     Crown. Once appointed, the local authority has no control
     over a coroner's activities. He may only be removed from
     office by the Lord Chancellor or, in certain instances, by the
     Crown Court.

     Secondly, it is not the function of an inquest to determine
     liability. The law states that the purpose of an inquest is
     to ascertain the identity of the deceased and how, when and
     where he came by his death. The Coroners Rules provide that
     neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on
•    any other matters.  In addition, the Rules specifically
     prohibit the framing of an inquest verdict in such a way as to
     appear to determine any question of criminal liability on the
     part of a named person, or civil liability. Any issue of
     civil or criminal liability is a matter for a civil or
     criminal courts and notthe coroner's inquest.

    The Coroner, Dr Popper, has advised that this particular
    request was opened in April 1989, was resumed between 18 April
    and 4 May, and again on 19 November. If anyone is
    dissatisfied with any aspect of an inquest, under Section 13
    of the Coroners Act 1988, it is open to them to apply with the
    authority of the Attorney-General, for the High Court to quash
    the verdict and order a fresh inquest to be held, either by
    the same coroner or by a different one. Coroners inquests are
    also subject to judicial review.



                                                      \As you will

    Simon Hughes Esq MP
As you will know, there has already been a public inquiry into
this event by Lord Justice Taylor whose subsequent report
reached various conclusions on the cause of the event,
including that:

           1 . The immediate cause of the gross over-crowding and
           hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was open,
           to cut off access to the central pens which were already
           over-full.

       2. They were already over-full because no safe maximum
       capacities had been laid down (in the safety certificate
       issued by the local authority), no attempt was made to
       control entry to the individual pens numerically and,
       there was no effective visual monitoring of crowd
       density.
   •   ■   '        ■   /   ■


       Xn order to avoid a similar occurrence in future,
       Lord Justice Taylor has recommended that such safety
       certificates should be reviewed annually and this is
       fully supported by the Government.

The question of the Council's possible negligence over       the
™?SueL ° f the_safety certificate has been considered by     the
3ij.eotor of rublic Prosecutions but he has decided not      to
institute criminal proceedings. However, I understand        that
relatives of the victims have initiated a civil action       against
the council.

As you will appreciate, one event such as the Hillsborough
disaster, can generate several different inquiries, each
focusing on a separate aspect and. r hope that I have clarified
the role of the inquest in this respect.

Mr. J. H. Rowlands,
Home Office,
Queens Anne's Gate,
Lon do n,
SW1H 9AT




Dear Mr. Rowlands,

Thank you for your letter of 13th November enclosing a letter from
Simon Hughes MP for Southwark Bermondsey.

 1. I have to say that I am somewhat surprised :

a. by the fact that I was first made aware that there was a letter
from Mr. Hughes to the Homes Secretary when a reporter from a National
Newspaper visited me at home shortly after 2 p.m on Sunday 9th Nov.
1990

b. that the MP for Bermondsey is concerning himself with the running
of inquests in Sheffield as I assume that neither Sheffield City
Council nor myself nor an unnamed Liberal Democratic councillor nor
for that matter Liverpool or Nottingham fall within his constituency.

 c. that a concern regarding a possible conflict of interest should be
 raised with me three working days before the recommencement of the
 Hillsborough Inquests particularly when I had already spent several
 days in April 1989 opening the inquests and had resumed with a jury
 between 18th April - 4th May 1990. The transcripts of the evidence
 of these hearings run to over 1000 pages. In addition there was
 extensive national publicity regarding those proceedings. The
 conclusion of the interim hearings on 4th May are themselves 5 months
 prior to the date of Mr. Hughes letter.

 2. Everything that is referred to in Mr. Hughes letter (apart from any
 references to Committee meeting matters of Sheffield City Council of
 which I have no knowledge) was known in April 1989. That was the time
 when anything regarding possible conflict of interest should have
 been raised and not 18 months or so later.

 3. I would remind you that a Coroner is an independent judicial
 officer and is an appointee and not an employee of the local
 authority. The latter have inter alia a duty to remunerate him and
 pay his costs and expenses but they do not control what he does or how
 he does it. They are not able to remove him from office which is a
 right reserved for the Lord Chancellor, and in presumably very rare
 instances, the Crown Court.
1 have sought to maintain good relationships with the officers of
Sheffield City Council, to behave responsibly with regard to the
incurring of costs and expenses and to keep them informed possibly to
a greater extent than was strictly necessary.

4. As I understand it I was the only eligible coroner under the
legislation unless the provisions of Section 14(1) Coroners Act 1988
had been implemented and some other coroner had agreed to take the
transfer, or the provisions of section 14(3) or 13(l)(a) and 13(2)
Coroners Act 1988 had applied which I do not think was or is the case.

Although a large number of the deceased came from Merseyside by no
means all did, and it would not in my opinion have been right to ask
the coroner in Merseyside or Liverpool to take over the inquests.

If I could have divested myself in April 1989 of the responsibility
for the inquests into   the deaths caused by the disaster I have no
doubt I would have gladly assented and it certainly would have made an
enormous difference to my life.

5. It is inherent in the coronal system   which is territorial in nature
that the coroner may come into conflict   with the local authority.
This is no doubt one of the reasons why   the coroner's position is as
is described in paragraph three of this   letter.

The Coroners Act 1988 specifically mentions various disqualifications
from appointment to coronal office. I draw your attention to Sections
2 (2) and 2 (3). It seems therefore to me that had parliament wished
to include provisions   to cover the sort of situation described byMr.
Hughes, it would have been childs play to legislate for it
particularly as sections 2 (2) and 2 (3)   actually deal with the
appointment of a coroner who is or was a   councillor or alderman.

6. Whether it is a good thing that a coroner's jurisdiction is
territorial and that he is locally appointed as opposed to centrally
by say the Lord Chancellor is another question.  I do not think
that this letter is the appropriate place to deal with these issues
though I may write to you again on this after the inquests are over.

The seperation of powers is very fine in   principle but not so easy to
achieve in practice. For instance even the head of the judiciary is
himself a political appointee.

7. It goes without saying of course that should someone feel that
proceedings are defective then judicial review or the provisions of
Section 13 Coroners Act 1988 are open.

8. You will no doubt be aware that in the normal course of things
should I require some expert legal help I ( and I believe coroner's in
general ) would in the first instance look to their local authority's
legal Departments for help.

I was however conscious from very early on that there was the
possibility of criticism of the Council's involvement in connection
with the disaster.  I felt that it would be inappropriate to
consult with them as this could give rise to a conflict of
interest if I were to discuss matters with them when the officer's
or the Council's conduct might be called in question.  I therefore
arranged for a meeting with the then Chief Executive and inter alia
agreed with him that it would be right that in the Hillsborough
disaster I would seek independent legal advice if I felt that I needed
it and instruct independent solicitors which I have done. I had
thought about the problem and in so far as it was necessary I had and
have continued to take steps to avoid difficulties arising.
In fact I seem to recollect that I approached some one in the Home
Office to see if legal help was available from you or treasury
solicitors but I was told that that was not possible.

8. I must say that I am not entirely happy with the suggestion that
has been raised and even less so with the timing and manner of its
making.  I have had to devote considerable time to this reply which
could have been better spent in getting prepared for these inquests.

I hope the foregoing will be of assistance to you. Please let me have
a copy of Mr. Waddington's reply.




Yours sincerely,

Sheffield Coroner
It has been brought to ray attention that the Sheffield Coroner is paid at
a full time rate but does other jobs.
I am also troubled by the at least apparent conflict of interests between
somebody, although Her Majesty's Coroner, who is paid for by the City
Council, when he is at the same time conducting an Inquest Inquiry into
the liability of the same City Council.
I have discussed this matter with ray colleague Alex Carlile, Q.C., who shares
ray concern.
I could set out the details further if this would be helpful and am aware
that this matter is now a matter of public debate in Committee on Sheffield
City Council. One of the Liberal Democrat Councillors in Sheffield asked for ray
view on the subject and I said I would write to bring the matter to your
attention.
I am happy to discuss the matter with you if this would be the most
appropriate way to proceed. I should be grateful for a reply as soon
as possible.

I had a long conversation with Dr. Knapman.       He agreed to send the
copies of the      summing up and the Opening day.Dr. Knapjnan on         the
whole thought      that I ougth to try and minimise   the amount of evidence
to take nad that I should restrict it very very tightly to the
question of How.      He felt that to explore issues     which .... a possible
verdict of Unlawfully killed were outside the scope of thatword.                I
pointed out to him that position in his case was rather easy as the
incident was restricted to just one event.       He agreed but said that
he could have      gone through all the strata of British rail who had to
supervise this work but he decided against it.         I pointed out to him
that Michael Powers felt that he had to do the whole evidence and go
into considerable detail.      It sounded to me as if he didn't agree with
Michael on this point.


He did make a very interesting comment that he had been to see counsel
who had advised the D.P.P. in the Clapham Disaster.          Counsel apparently
had advised him that he should not try and distinquish          between gross
negligence and recklessness but that he should address himself to
either one or the other following the quote "Lawrence" case.              Apparently
there is a lot of conflict as to what the law on manslaughter is at
the moment.


I spent a few minutes discussing with him the verdict of Lack of Care,               !
                                                                                     I
he didn't think it was appropriate in his case and he doubted whether                I
it would apply.      I asked him what he thought about the fact          that if
Lack of Care was the .....      of self neglect whether it was ever
possible to have that verdict when isolated incidents have occurred
on the basis that self starvation might well be self neglect but missing
one or two meals could hardly be classified as such, though in one sens)
they were the beginning of starvation.       He thought that that might well ]
be right.                                                                   j


I thought about what Dr. Knapman said regarding ........              the inquests
but I didn't really feel that it was possible.         I telephoned Dr. Halle
and made arrangements for cover and then took the opportunity              of
discussing this issue with him.      Dr, Halle felt that it really wasn't
practical to try and tracate it.      Having spoken to Dr. Halle I also
had a word with my former deputy David Hinchliff.        He similarly felt
that there wasn't really any option but to proceed and deal with the
matter fully. I felt relieved that my opinion was confirmed by these
two colleagues.
DRAFT.

DIRECTION TO JURY ON VERDICT OF UNLAWFULLY KILLED

1. DIRECT ON RIDERS

2. DIRECT ON RULES 36 AND 42

3. The criminal equivalent of the verdict of Unlaw fully killed is
for the purposes of this Inquest Manslaughter. It will be up to you
to decide whether the facts of this case are such as to justify the
verdict in the light of the legal directions which you have to accept
and which I am about to give to you.

Before I tell you what you have to be satisfied about I must explain
to y you that in coronal verdicts there are two standards of proof. On
the one hand there is what may be described as a standard based on the
balance of probability, ie is it likely . The degree of probability
may vary from case to case but it may be as little as just over 50%.

The other burden of proof can be described as the criminal burden of
proof ie you have to be satisfied beyond reason doubt or to put it in
slightly more modern language you have to be satisfied so that you are
sure that the ingredients for the verdict which you are considering
on the particular facts which have been presented to have been made
out. It is this burden of proof ie beyond reasonable doubt which
applies in a case in which you might wish to consider the verdict of
unlawfully killed.

What then does the term unlawfully killed comprise. For the purposes
of this inquest it suffices that this verdict can be taken as being
equivalent to manslaughter which I am sure you will appreciate is a
most serious matter.

There are various forms of manslaughter and indeed the subject is
extremely difficult from a legal point of view. However againas far
as this inquest is concerned the varients which you have to consider
are that someone who on no account may be named has either acted or
failed to act in respect of some one to whom he owed a duty of care
in a grossly negligent manner or recklessly.

Gross negligence does not merely mean carelessness or convential
negligence. Obviously you have to be satified so that you are sure
that there has been negligence ie a duty of care breach of duty and
damage but in addition you have to be satisfied so that you are sure
that the negligence or incompetence of the person went beyond a mere
matter of compensation and showed such disregard for the life and
safety of others as to amount to a crime against the the State and
conduct deserving punishment. (R. v. Batement per Lord Hewart C.J.
19 Cr. App. Rep. 8. CCA and others)

Other terms than gross have been use but you may  feel that a suitable
word to describe the negligence could be abhorent or
repulsive ie that the act or omission was such that it causes you to
shudder when you contemplate it.

 On the other hand you have to be careful because it has to be proved
that the person who you are considering has at least been indifferent
to an obvious risk of injury to health mere inadvertence is not enough
(R. v. Stome and Dobinson 1977 1 QB. 354 (C.A.)).
The word recklesness means for these purposes that there was
 1.   an obvious and substantial risk of inj ury to health and welfare
of the deceased and if you are satisfied as to that

2. that the person whose conduct you are considering was indifferent
to the risk or recognising the risk decided nevertheless to take it.

Again you have to be careful in applying the test as there are many
situations where a person is aware of a risk and indeed in some case
is aware of a very serious risk to life and nevertheless takes it
without incurring any criticism or blame. For example a surgeon who
may be faced with a very ill patient who also suffers with say a
cardiac condition and who is therefore at great risk of death if
operated on. Nevertheless the surgeon admittedly with consent from the
patient may go ahead with the operation because the risk benfit
equation is in favour of it. So perhaps when considering the second
limb above it might be better to add the words with out good cause or
contrary to reason of a reasonable man suitable informed.

The third form in which unlawfully killed may present itself in
these cases is if there is an unlawful and dangerous act of violence
which causes death.

It is not necessry that the unlawful and dangerous act was aimed at
any one in particular and in particular not at the deceased etc

The   unlawfulness must in general terms be a criminal unlawfulness
but   not merely negligence as in for example driving without due care
and   attention. There are a few exceptions to this general proposition
but   I do not think that they are relevant here.

  In considering either gross negligence or recklessness you have
to look at the action or ommision itself and not at the result and
you have   be satified so that you are sure that the facts on which you
bring in   you verdict have been made out.

You must not aggregate the activities of individuals so that as to sum
minor acts of negligence from several persons and then say that the
sum of them constitutes gross negligence or recklessness of some one
person. Neither should you aggregate minor or relatively minor actos
of negligence of the same individual which occured at different times
or places so as to for example say he was negligent on say three
seperate and distinct occassions and we therefore think that this
enables us to describe him as grossly negligent . Acts and ommisions
which form part and parcel of the res gestae ie the event itself which
you are considering may be agreggated so for example in say an RTA the
failure to notice a pedestrian because of gross inattention can be
coupled with the late braking or inadequate steering which occured
too late to avoid the incident.

This is not say that there may not be more than one person who could
in a criminal trial be charged with manslaughter in respect of one
death and in appropriate cases be convicted. The reason for this is
that in respect of each one of these persons the necessary ingredients
of the offence have been made out. The same applies to a verdict of
unlawfully killed.

In considering whether the facts which have been put to you can
constitute the cause of the death you have to beware that you do not
relate too distant causes to the event. Thus for example if football
had never ben invented there would not have been a Hillsborough
disaster. Similar but a little closer if the Football Association had
not decided on the venue there would not have been the disaster. The
latter is quite a good example as there has been criticism of the
choice of venue and allocations of ends but although this in one sence
directly contributed to the disaster ie a causa sine qua non
nevertheless it must be pain to you that that cause is too remote for
you to consider it. Thus when you consider the evidence you have to
decide before you apply the appropriate tests of gross negligence or
recklessness whether that cause which you are considering is
sufficiently proximate to the event. I will try and guide you as we go
through the evidence in this regard.

 The right of silence. It would be grossly unfair and quite contrary
to justice if you construed a refusal to answer a question on the
grounds that the reply might incriminate as an admission of guilt. Not
only would this totally defeat the purpose of the privilege but it
would put the person in a far worse position than if he had replied.
Furthermore because you have to be satisfied from the evidence that
you have heard so that you are sure or beyond reasonable doubt
anything that has not been said cannot constitute evidence of fact on
which you could build a verdict of unlawfully killed. The persons who
exercised their privilege had a right to do so and it must not be
twiste into a noose. On the other hand the right of silence may have
an effect when I come to address you on the open verdict.

Is it necessary to know the name or names of the persons inrespect
of whom yo might be contemplating an unlawfully killed verdict. The
short answer is no. After all there are unfortunatly quite a few
occassions when it is clear that a person has been murdered but it is
not possible to find the culprit(s). By anology if you were for
example to consider whether the evidence supported a verdict against
one or more supporters that they had acted grossly negligently or that
they having done an unlawful and dangerous act then you would be
entitled to consider the verdict of Unlawfully killed in respect of
that person or persons. I remind you again however that you have to
base your decision on the evidence you must be satified beyond
reasonable doubt that the facts support the verdict and that you are
not allowed to aggregate the actions of people soo as to elevate
negligence to gross negligence or if appropriate recklessness.

Order. In considering the verdicts you have to appy your mind to the
verdict of unlawfully killed first of all. You have to consider it in
rspect of each deceased. I have already directed you on the groupings
of the deceased and you are ofcourse entitled to find that the verdict
if it applies may be in respect of all the       deceased    oronly in respect
of some. On the other hand I might perhaps be a little unlikely if you
were to find the verdict in respect of some people and not others
within each of the respective groupings. The decision is yours. If you
decide that a verdict of unlawfully killed is the right verct then
that is the end of the matter and you do not need to consider the
other verdicts. You will only have to consider the other
verdicts if unlawfull killed is not made out.

You must remember that in considering the verdicts you have to apply
the facts within the context of the law as I have directed in respect
of each of the parties whose conduct you are considering .
The order in which you consider each of the various parties is a
matter for you but forexample you will have to consider the facts
within the context of the law as stated in respect of the say

A, B, C, etc The order in which you consider the names is a matter
entirely for you but it might be worth while spending afew minutes in
deciding whether ordering the persons may not make your deliberations
easier.

If on going through the list you were for example to come to the
conclusion that the evidence is such that you can reach a verdict of
UK in respect of some or all of the deceased then you can stop there
in respect of those of the deceased to whom your decision applies and
only consider your deliberations in respect of those in respect of
whom you have not reached a verdict. If it is in respct of all that is
the end of your deliberations and you can come back with your
verdicts.The reason for this is that under the rules you cannot and
may not name any person in respect of whom you have found the verdict
of unlawfully killed established. In those circumstances it does not
matter that you have not considered every name as you will have
reached a verdict and it does not seem to me to matter that you might
have reached the same conclusion in respect of others too. Obviously
if the rules were different so that you could name people than one
would have to consider each and every person irrespective of the
decision yo might have taken on someone.

Consider direction re Corporate manslaughter

Consider direction withdrawing the verdict in respect of people were
no evidence.

Only if you have exhausted the possibility of UK can you move onto the
the other verdicts which I have mentioned to you namely Accidental
death and Open ( Draft legal direction re lack of care at some point
as well)

In the case of these other verdicts the standard of proof is based on
the civil standard ie the balance of probability is it more likely
than not that for example an accident tock place.

Most of us understand what accident mean. We all have them from time
to time whith varying levels of injury or damage and with varying
degrees of culpability. It is a mistake to think that an accidental
death verdict implies that there is no fault on some one or other.
Accidents range from total human blamelessness to very serious
liabilty in which say one of the parties in a an RTA may be held to be
100% to blame and to have to pay coinpensation. Because you and I are
expressly prohibited in framing a verdict so as to determine the
criminal or civil liabilty of any person you must not name any person
but if you are satisfied that in respect of all or some of the
deceased this is the correct decision you would record a verdict of
accidental death. What people then do with that verdict and whether
or not they fight issues out in other courts is none of our business.

Remember that you only consider this verdict if UK has been
thought through and rejected. Remember that the standard of proof is
different for this verdict tha UK

Finally there is the possibility of an Open verdict. This is a
perfectly acceptable verdict and you must not be frightened of it.
Howeer it is not the verdict yo bring in because you cannot agree on
anthing else but because haveing considered the evidence you come to
the conclusion that despite all you have heard the available evidence
does not enable you to reach a conclusion as to the other possible
verdicts that I have left with you.

Consider special verdict eg football disaster??

I mentioned earlier that the right of silence may possibly play a part
in your deliberations here. Not in the sense that silence implies
guilt but in the sense that the evidence that has been put before you
is insufficient to enable you to reach a named verdict. Do not
misundersand me there has been an enormous amount of evidence put
before you and it is entirely upto you to decide whether there is
enough to bring in one of the other verdicts mentioned earlier.

You will have noticed that I hve spoken more about UK then the other
verdicts. Please do not take this as an indicator of my thinking . The
reason is quite simply that it is a difficult concept to put across
it is a very serious verdict and I am anxious as far as possible to
ensure that you approac your onorous task as well directed as I am
able to do.

Neither must you take the fact that it has to be considered first
as an indicator or preference. The reason for this direction is that
it has been laid down in a Higher court decision that this is the
correct order and indeed if you think about it makes sense as you
should decide about the verdict with the higher standard of proof
and probaly greater gravity before you decide lesser verdicts.

To summarise then:

    Counsel is asked to advise Her Majesty's Coroner for South Yorkshire (West)
    District on the following matters.      For convenience these instructions
    are divided into Part A and Part B.

    Part A proceeds on the assumption that the Director of Public Prosecutions
    will charge someone or more persons with an offence of Manslaughter.

    Part B proceeds on the assumption that the Director of Public Prosecutions decides,
    that neither Section (l) (a) or Section 16 (l) (b) of the Coroners'
    Act 1988 apply.

    Part A.   1.   Counsel's attention is d r a w to Section 16 of the Coroners'
                   Act 1988.

              2.   For the purposes of this instruction, it is assumed that
                   the charge under Section 16 (l) (a) (i) would be in respect
                   of one or two of the deceased and not in respect of all
                   95 persons who have died.

              3. It had been the view of Her Majesty's Coroner that in
                   that event the Coroner would adjourn the Inquest under Section
                   16 (l) (a) in respect of those persons of whom a Manslaughter
                   charge had been brought and in respect of the remainder of
                   the deceased, he would adjourn the Inquests under the provisions
                   of Section 16 (l) (b) assuming that the D.P.P. made an
                   appropriate reauest.
                   This appears to be a commonsense view of looking at the
                   inter-relationshiio of the two sub sections in a situation such
                   as the Hillsborough Disaster.    This also seems to be the
                   view of the Authors of the Law & Practice on Coroners, Thurston
                   Third Edition, Section 22.20.    The attention of Counsel is
                   also drawn to Jervis on Coroners 10th Edition Paragraph
                   14-27.

              4.   The Coroner's attention was re-drawn to Section 16 because of
                   the situation arising out of the Marchioness Inauest, vhere the
                   skipper of the boat has been charged with an offence which
                   does not fall within Section 16 (l) (a).    However, it is
                   understood the D.P.P. has requested the Coroner to adjourn
                   the Inquest in respect of all the deceased under the provisions
                   of Section 16 (l) (b).

                   On an examination of Section 16, what has concerned the Coroner
                    is whether it is open to the D.P.P. to reauest an adjournment
                    under Section 16 (l) (b) in a case where someone has been charged
                    with Manslaughter of a particular person, and notice is given
                    under Section 16 (l) (a).
The drafting of Section 16 (l) (a)     is not entirely clear.
Sub paragraph (i) ends with the word "deceased" whereas
sub paragraphs (ii) and (iii) end with the word "or".
It is not clear whether the word "or" particularly at 4he
end of sub paragraph (iii) merely applies to that sub paragraph
or to the whole sub section.    If the "or" only applies to the
sub paragraph then presumably it is possible for a person
to be charged under sub section (a) in connection with
the Manslaughter of the deceased 'X' and at the same time,
for the D.P.P. to implement the provisions of sub section (b)
(but see paragraph 6 below on this).    If the ^     >■". "or"
refers to the whole of sub section (a) then Counsel is asked
to advise on whether it is possible for sub section (b) to
be implemented at all.   One possible reconciliation would be
to argue that sub section (a) deals with a person charged
with the death of the deceased 'X' whereas, sub section (b)
deals with other people, but in that case what is the purpose
of the word "or".   Hopefully the word "or" can be treated
as tautologous   or otherwise reconciled because its implementation
in the way outlined above would seem to produce a ridiculous
result.

The next point that arises is whether or not it is possible
 for the provisions of Section l^|J(b) to apply in a
 case where a charge has been brought against a person in respect
 of Manslaughter under paragraph Section 16 (l) (a).        Prime
 facie, this would seem to be the intention.       The difficulty
 arising from the fact that the sub section (b) includes the
 words "alleged to have been committed in circumstances connected
 with the death of the deceased, not being an offence within
 paragraph (a) above".   If "the deceased" in sub paragraph (b)
 is the same as "the deceased" in sub paragraph (a) then it would
 seem that one has the ludicrous situation that a Manslaughter
 charge negates the D.P.P's ability to avoid an Inquest being
 held into the death of persons connected with the death of
 the deceased 'X* but in respect of whom no charges have been
 brought.   On the other hand, if a lesser inclinable charge is brought,
 the D.P.P. can implement sub section (b).

 A s it happens, this situation has already been explored
 by Mr. Sturt, the Coroner for the County of Kent, and I
 enclose copies of an exchange of correspondence between
 him and the D.P.P. dated the 12th of January 1990 and the
 l6th of January 1990.   You will recollect that in the Zebrugge
 Disaster, following the Inquest several people had been
 charged with the offence of Manslaughter and are in fact at
 the moment awaiting trial.    Since then, a further death of
 a Mr. Singh has occurred.    The Coroner for Kent was concerned
                      - 2> -

     whether or not he would hare to have a Mil Inouest into

     hie death.   Tou will see that in effect the D.P.P. h“

     interpreted sub section   16   (l) (b) by m        *& **
     that somebody has Keen charged with the offence of Manslaughter

     in respect of 'X', bat that he is requesting the adjou™en

     because that offence has been committed in circumstances

     connected with a death of T       but the offence which has

     been charged is not the Manslaughter of        .   In other

     words, the "death of the deceased" refers to the person

      or persons who have not been charged under sub paragraph

      (a).

      If this section can be interpreted in this » ? then the
8.
      problem outlined in paragraph 6 would seem to hare been

      overcome (subject to your advice on the point outlined

      in paragraph 5)•
      The interpretation applied by Mr. Sturt and the D.P.P. has

      a very marked advantage of making sense of the provisions.

      Counsel is asked to advise on this as soon as possible.
1.        This section deals with the hypothesis that the D.P.P. will not
          proceed under Section 16 either sub section (a) or sub section (b).
          In that event, as the Coroner sees it, the Inquests will have to
          be resumed, and concluded.


2.        Counsel is reminded that the Coroner has already sat with a Jury for
          about 2-jj? weeks and taken evidence relating to 95 deceased and in particular
          Via<a dealt with    the questions of who, when and where they died,   but has
          not dealt with      the question of how.


3.        Each individual Inauest was of course different, but they followed
          a more or less standard form and by way of background information a copy
          of one of these Inquests is attached to these instructions for        information.
          (D.G. Godwin).

4.        Counsel is also reminded that a full public inquiry has already taken
          place before Lord Justice Taylor.


5.        The issue that has to be determined then is how much further work has
          to be undertaken by the Coroner and his Jury with a view to reaching a

          verdict?


 6.        The Coroner is aware of the provisions of Rule 3& and 42 as well
           as the Rule dealing with self incrimination.      Counsel’s attention
           is drawn to the statutory provisions, in particular Section 8 (2) (b),
           8 (3) (d), 11 (2),11 (5),11(6),and 13 (l) (b) of the Coroners1 Act 1988.


 7.        The issue that has to be resolved in determining the scope of the

           Inquest is:-

                     a.   How large a‘'circle"does the word "how" enconcass.

                     b.      To what extent do the questions of "why did it happen"
                             and "who is to blame" fall within the compass of the
                             word "how".

           These questions of course apply to all Inquests but are particularly
           relevant in Inquests associatedwi&t a major disaster and where, as
           in this particular case, a public inquiry h a s / 1 j j i a c e .
           In this connection Counsel*s attention is drawn to R.B. Sturt
           H.M.Coroner for East Kent ex parte Peter Alan Spooner etc,
           t/here this question to a certain extent was canvassed.


     8.     One view that could I suppose be taken is to restrict the question
            of "how" to the establishment simply of the fact that a . • crush
            occurred within the terraces, but not to explore the reasons for
            this, taken together with the medical cause of death, the Jury
            could be invited to bring in a verdict.
     The difficulty with this is that:

                (i)     This it is unlikely that such a limited inquiry
                        would satisfy anyone.


                (ii)    Probably the decision would be appealed on the
                        grounds of insufficiency of inquiry.
                (iii)      would make it impossible for the Jury to consider
                        a verdict of Unlawfully Killed because the evidence
                        presented to them would not enable them to be satisfied
                        beyond a reasonable doubt that the criteria for such
                        a verdict had been fulfilled, (see McCurbin case).


9-   If this is correct, one seems to be left with an alternative which is
     that a full inquiry is needed, notwithstanding the Public Inquiry
     which had already taken place or the fact that the D.P.P. has considered
     the papers and has come to a conclusion not to take any action (this
     if you remember is the hypothesis of this part of the instructions).
     Furthermore it would seem that to a large extent, the ground covered
     by the Public Inquiry would have to be re-canvassed.    Counsel's attention
     is again drawn to the case involving the Coroner for Kent.


10. It seems to the Coroner that if the latter view is correct, then by way
     of example at least the following aspects would have to be explored:


                  (i)    The fans - time of arrival including possibly the reasons
                         for lateness of arrival.

                         Behaviour, demeanour and state of intoxication.

                  (ii) The site (including Club; Engineers-.    J      -t-
                       etc)- turnstiles, signs,access, stewarding and
                       possibly previous incidents in particular an incident
                       which occurred in 1981 when crushing occurred on these
                       terraces.


                 (iii) The police - the police were severely criticised in Lord
                       Justice Taylor’s report. Their management of the game,
                       including command and organisation within and without
                       the ground, and management ranging from the Site
                       Commanders to individual officers, particulary those
                       who have been the subject of complaint.


                  (vi) Others, e.g., licensing authorities, rescue organisations
                       etc.

                                                                   Executive
                      (v) Expert evidence from say Health & Safety/ Engineers and
                          others regarding configuration. Seasons for breaking
                          of barriers. Explanations as to why the vast majority
                          of the deceased died in Pen 3 as compared with only
                          about 7 in Pen 4 (incidentally, Counsel might be
                          interested to know that more than half of the people
                          who died entered the stadium after 2.30p.m. and about 22
                          are known to have entered the stadium when Gate C was
                          opened at or after approximately 14-52).
One should perhaps mention that an Inquest conducted on these
lines is likely to be an enormous . task.   Lord Justice Taylor
sat for 31 days and examined about 174 witnesses orally.    In
the Zebrugge Inquest over 400 witnesses gave evidence (some by
way of documentary evidence).
                                             of deaths
In this particular case, although the number/ are less than
the people who died at Zebrugge, the number of people who were
present at the time of the disaster are of course very much
larger and thousands of statements have been taken by the West
Midlands Police.


Because of the enormous task, not to say the cost, Her Majesty's
Coroner wants to be certain as he reasonably can be that his
assessment of the requirement for the scope of the Inquest as
outlined above is correct.   Counsel is therefore asked to advise
on the extent and scope of the Coroner's Inquisition in the case
of the Hillsborough Disaster, and in particular, to advise on
the word "how" together with this overlap of "why" and "whom".


Counsel is asked to consider the matter as soon as conveniently
possible.   Would Counsel please note that Dr. Popper is not
available between the 4th and 22nd of July and would like the matter
dealt with either before the 4th of July, if that is possible,
03? if that is not practical, as soon after the 22nd of July, as
it may be conveniently possible.


If Counsel feels, before giving an opinion, that he would want
to have a conference with Dr. Popper, then this can no doubt be
arranged.

FRIDAY 1 FEBRUARY 1991

CONFERENCE WITH COUNSEL MR WALKER.

FROM 5 PM UNTIL APPROX 8 PM.

In some respects we merely scratched the surface of the issues I had
raised with him but ran out of time.


Counsel confirmed t h a t Cunningham had recently been confirmed in the
Court of Appeal R v. Spratt 1989, in which case apparently a person
was acquited despite the f a c t t h a t i t was thought he was reckless,
because he f a i l e d to give thought t h a t his action could give r i s e to
harm. However, t h i s was an offence under Section 47 r a th e r than a
Common Law offence lik e Manslaughter and on the whole Counsel did not
think t h a t the Cunningham applied.


We then spent some time talking about Re Church.            I wondered whether,
i f there was an unlawful act other than negligence the requirements
for harm would be l e s s , i . e . only minor harm. After considerable
discussion Counsel took the view t h a t t h i s would not be applicable.


We then turned to Lawrence. Counsel took the view t h a t on the whole
i f the issue were to a ris e the Lawrence direction would probably apply.
He drew my a tte ntion to R v Seymour from which i t i s c le a r t h a t the
Lawrence/Caldwell applied generally. See Lord R o s k ill's judgement
( t h is is also cle ar from Jennings v US Government, which he did not
r e f e r t o ) . He drew my attention to Caldwell and in p a rt i c u l a r to Page
970 at (b) where i t is stated "in the absence of exculpatory f a c t o r s ,
the defendent's s t a t e of mind i s therefore all important where recklessness
is an element in the offence charged               ", We spent a l o t of time
discussing the f a c t t h a t not every r i s k taken could be described as
reckless and, by and large, i t appeared to me t h a t Counsel was advising
th a t in e ffe c t one had to look at the whole of the circumstances and
in e ff e c t the c r i t e r i a in ex p arti Gray which would seem to indicate
th a t one has to pass through a number of gates, so to speak, the l a s t
one of which is assessment of recklessness as defined. This would
therefore exclude from the d f i n i t i o n those cases where r i s k s were taken
e.g. by a surgeon. We also spent some time thinking about causation
and t h a t i t would be necessary to be able to show a d i r e c t re la tio n s h ip
between the deaths and the act.
We discussed at length the procedural aspects of withdrawing the verdict
from the Jury. On the whole Counsel f e l t t h a t in all the circumstances
i t would not be possible to do t h a t , although he did think i t might be
possible to withdraw in respect of a few p a r t i e s , i f fo r instance,
causation was c le a r l y not t h e re . One of the problems of withdrawing
a v e rd ic t in respect of named p a rtie s is t h a t there i s the p o s s ib i l i ty
t h a t i t r a is e s a presumption of g u i l t against the p a rtie s in respect
of whom i t i s not withdrawn, and the prejudicial e f f e c t of t h i s might
outweigh any possible benefit.


Counsel was of the view t h a t in summing up i t probably would be best
not to sum up against each named individual, picking out the pros and
cons, as t h i s was more lik e ly to generate a ju d ic ial review i f th a t
person f e l t t h a t in law there was no evidence against him (I am not
e n ti r e l y happy about t h i s aspect of the advice).


Counsel thought t h a t i t would be b e tte r to leave a special verdict
open to the Jury and refe rred me to ex parti Kendall (Knaoman, P 248).
'he d i f f i c u l t y with t h i s i s t h a t such a wording would have to be succinct
and in f a c t might not be b e n eficia l.


Counsel took the view t h a t in R v. Seymour, the reference in Lord R o sk ill's
judgement in P .1066 t h a t in the offence of manslaughter the r is k of death
being caused by the manner of the defendant's driving must be very high,
was an appropriate q u a l i f i c a t i o n . t o the Lawrence d ir e c tio n , but note
t h a t he does not seem to be supported in t h i s bv Archbold, nor the
House of Lords (                                           ).


I also drew his attention to Kong Cheuk Kwan anu in p a rt i c u l a r the
paragraphs, P25 and 26, where the issue of response to the action of
another is mentioned. He thought t h a t the points he had drawn my atte ntion
to in Caldwell covered t h i s .


Counsel agreed with me t h a t cross negligence was not s u f f i c i e n t to ground
a finding of manslaughter. There had to be something more, i . e . r e c k le s s­
ness. On the whole he also seemed to agree t h a t mere inadvertance which
Lord Hail sham equates with carelessness, query, which i s a word often
used to describe negligence, could be excluded.

                   ATTENDANCE NOTE



Conference with Dr. M. Powers, 1 Paper Buildings, Inner
Temple, London.  2nd July. 11.00 a.m.

Present:   Dr. Popper;   Dr. Powers; R. B. Hammond.



        Dr. Powers opened the Conference by assuming that
the D.P.P. will prosecute over the Hillsborough disaster.
The D.P.P.'s decision is still not known, but it was thought
that he was interviewing formally at the present time and
would make a decision in the near future.   Dr. Popper
thought that the D.P.P. will not prosecute.

        Dr. Popper said he was under no present pressure
to resume the inquest.  By and large the families were
happy with the initial inquest which he had held which was
a major diffusing job.

         On the interpretation of Section 16 (1) (a) of
the Coroners Act 1988, Dr. Powers agreed with Dr. Popper’s
conclusions as set out in the instructions.      The problem
was one of interpretation of an unclear section.     Although
under Section 16 (1) (a), where a Clerk to the Magistrates
would give notice that a person has been charged with, for
example, manslaughter, the Coroner could adjourn an inquest
into the death of a particular person, did this present
problems with adjouring the inquest for the other people
whose deaths were connected with this deceased. ^ It was
assumed that in these circumstances the D.P.P. will then
give the Coroner notice under Section 16 (l) (b) which
would allow the Coroner to adjourn the inquest into the
deaths of the persons not covered by the Section 16 (1) (a)
notice.    (The problem centred around the use of the word
 "'or "     "the end of Section 16 (1) (a) (i) (ii) and (iii)i.
The use of this word led to some possible confusion as tc
whether Section 16 (1) (a) and Section 16 (1) (b) were to
be taken as complementary or as operating separately to
 each other.     Dr. Powers thought that the right interprss-
 tion was that Section 16 (1) (a) would cover an adjourn­
 ment of a particular inquest into a death, and then the
 D.P.P. would be able to adjourn inquests into connected
 deaths by use of Section 16 (1) (b).     The purpose of xhe
 Section was to stop duplication of notices and there were
 three separate categories allowing adjournments of inques'
 within Section 16.    These were:

      1.          Section 16(1) (a) allowed an adjournment on the
 instructions of a magistrates' clerk where the Coroner is
told that someone has been charged with the manslaughter of
X.
       2.   Section 16 (1) (b)   allowed the Coroner to adjourn
where he is told by the D.P.P.   that someone has been charged
with an offence connected with   the death of Y, provided that
it is connected with the death   of X.

       3.   The Coroner is also able to adjourn when he is
informed by the D.P.P. that someone has been charged with a
specific offence (including manslaughter) of Y.

       The Section allows the Coroner to adjourn the inquest
on the giving of the above Notices and the Coroner is obliged
to adjourn in the absence of reasons to the contrary.   The
Coroner may feel that the inquest should proceed, but could
still choose not to do so.    The general guidance in this area
is that where the trial of another person would be affected by
an inquest into the death of the deceased, the Coroner should
use his discretion to adjourn.     Paragraph-14.29 in Jarvis^
on the power of Coroners to adjourn stated that the Coroner s
proceedings should always remain neutral.    In making his
decision on whether or not to adjourn the Coroner should take
on board the Wednesbury principles and give a reasoned argu­
ment as to why he has decided to adjourn.     Dr. Powers
thinks that going ahead with an inquest would certainly
prejudice someone else's trial and circumstances would have
to be very unique not to adjourn.    However, Dr. Powers stated
that the Coroner should always be wary of judicial review
which will examine the procedures and actual decision itself.
 It is therefore important that the Coroner should summarise
his reasoning in the transcript.

          Dr. Powers then considered the situation where no
 notice of prosecution was received from the D.P.P. Dr.Powers
 referred to page 212 of the Case Book on Coroners which was
 concerned with the Zeebrugge inquest, and concluded that
 Dr. Popper should hold an inquest on the same scale as the
 Zeebrugge inquest.    It was impossible to limit the inquiry
 into "how" the deaths were caused to the immediate causes of
 death.    Dr. Powers thought that it was important to use
 Lord Justice Taylor's report to see which part of this inquiry
 were relevant to the inquest.    The interim report was an
 inquiry into "how" the deaths occurred but this was different
 to the inquest in that the Taylor Report did not deal with
  individuals as such.

          Dr. Popper noted that there had been no resumption
 of the Clapham Inquest and there had been no prosecution as
 yet.   However, there was likely to be a resumation in
 October.
        It was felt that the impetus for the inquest was
reduced at the present time and if possible, Dr. Powers
thought that large chunks of evidence should be agreed if
possible.   He advised a procedural preliminary hearing
with the families representatives present where it would
be possible to adopt some of the documentary evidence.

        Dr. Popper did state that if he did have to resume
he would feel under some pressure.    This was due to the
following reasons:-

    1. It could be possibly the last chance for relatives
to attempt to get an unlawful killing verdict.

    2. The police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club may
feel that they want a "fair crack of the whip", which they
may feel they were denied in the Taylor Inquiry.

         On this basis it may be difficult to agree evidence.
Dr. Popper was especially wary of the point which had not
been raised in the Taylor Inquiry, of the intoxication of
the crowd.    Apparently of the deceased, 50% had no alcohol
in their blood, but the rest did have.    30% were above the
level for driving and a small number were very intoxicated.
Of those who died at least 50% came into the ground after
2.30 p.m.    All the people with high alcohol came in later.
20 of the deceased came in before 2.30 p.m.,   Three came in
at 2.30 p.m. and 59 of the deceased came in after 2.30 p.m.
Dr. Popper thought that this would lead to allegations that
perhaps the deceased were not the "innocents” that they had
been portrayed as.     The police would almost definitely
want this evidence put in.    It was important not to supress
this as it was relevant to whether there had been an unlawful
killing.     Dr. Popper said that he could not admit evidence
of recklessness on the part of, for example, the police if
he did not admit the other side of the story.      It could be
alleged that the crowd was in fact influenced by its own
 intoxication which made them far less inhibited.

        It was felt that although the "door" must be opened
fully, there must be some peripheral limits to the evidence.
Dr. Powers urged that the Coroner must have a clear idea of
the type and area of questioning that he will not hear.

        Dr. Popper felt that there was a real risk that the
D.P.P. will not prosecute as there were only 4 possible people
who could be the subject of such prosecution.    These were th
following:

    1.      The 2 police constables at the gates in the fencing
 inside the ground.    The allegation is that they pushed
 people back who were trying to escape the crush and were too
 slow to respond.



                             3.

                                                c o n tin u e d
 * ^ 2 * ^ Detective Inspector Duckenfield.   He was in charge
of the stadium and in fact gave the order to let people in.
He was told that if he did not let these people in there would
be deaths outside the stadium.   It was unfortunate that he
overlooked the existence of the tunnel, which should have been
cordoned off when the gates were opened.

     3.      _ The police constable outside the gates who was
controlling entries.   It was alleged that he was too close
when he finally lost control of the crowd.

-              the answer to these allegations could be the
ioiiowing:

     1.   It is alleged that the police constables inside the
ground were reckless by not opening the gates to relieve the
crush sooner.  However they were specifically trained to
watch for pitch invasions and had knowledge of the behaviour
of Liverpool fans.

     2.   Detective Inspector Duckenfield had opened the gates
for safety.  Was it right that he should be prosecuted for,
ior example, manslaughter, when he had simply failed to
recognise every possible contingency.

     3.   P.C.Marshall.   He lost control but this was partly
due to the lateness of a great group of people.    The alcohol
level of the crowd was high and the crush could only have
happened if people themselves were pressing forward.  The
outer perimeter gate had in feet been forced in any event.

j               is al?° Jhe Possibility that Sheffield Wednes­
day Football Club could b e held    liable.    T h e r e had been a
crushing incident in the same part of the stadium in 1981. but
fortunately there had been no deaths.       Action was moant to
have been taken over this incident, but staff had changed and
nothing had been done.     This was primarily a civil matter,
ihere were allegations that the crush barrier had not be»n
strong enough.    However, the Health and Safety Executive
fj + *h° had carried out tests on the ground were convinced
that the test on this particular barrier was O.K.           It was
only because of the enormous pressure exerted -on the barrier
that iu gave way.    J-his was not evidence of manslaughter in
Dr. Popper's opinion.

          D r ‘ PoPPe r 's only reservation was that although the
D.P.P. may not feel that there are any grounds for prosecuting,
he may feel that it is in the public interest that the trial
should g° ahead.     Dr. Powers thought that it would be a sad
reflection on our judicial system if this was the case.

          One of the important considerations of the inouest
would be now much it would cost and who would pay for it.
   -ij?per said "tha"t "the local authority were aware that they
would have to fund it as they were under a statutory liability.




                             4.

                                                 c o n tin u e d
Dr. Powers suggested that Rotheras should calculate the costs
of the inquest.    Dr. Popper said that it could be very high.
The transcript alone, cost £7,000 to collate.  It could be
possible to get money back for the local authority on these
transcripts by charging, for example, £1000 for a complete set.

          A deputy would have to be funded directly by the
local authority for standing in for Dr. Popper whilst he was
holding the Hillsborough inquest.

            Dr. Powers also suggested that Dr. Popper may need
  some legal assistance.   This could come in the form of an
 amicus curiae.     Alternatively Dr. Popper could appoint an
  assistant as someone with an interest under rule 20. Such
  an appointment could be made by agreement.    Dr. Powers
  thought it was important that Dr. Popper had an impartial advise,*,
  in court to assist with difficult issues.    Dr. Popper could
, consider giving someone else the presentation of the evidence
  so to distance himself from tie questioning.

           Dr. Popper would also need someone to simultaneously
 transcribe the inquest.

           With regards to the jury Dr. Popper was anxious not
 to have to discharge a jury during the inquest, which could
 last 2-3 months.   He was prepared to lose 4 jurors. However
 Dr.Powers thought that Dr. Popper should not commit himself
 to losing more than 2 jurors before discharging the jury. In
 criminal cases the judge is allowed to discharge one criminal
 juror during the trial.   Dr. Power thought the right approach
 would be to regard the juror who drops out as being one of the
 minority and that if such a juror were to drop out then Dr.
 Popper should only accept a unanimous verdict.   If a juror
 is ill then the inquest should be adjourned.

           It was suggested that some research be made into
 the criminal court procedure as to the discharge of juries.

           Dr. Popper stated that in the proceedings the
 local authority solicitors could not be included as they were
 possibly implicated.    However the local authority would need
 some warning on the costs of the inquest, which would prin­
 cipally be the funding of a deputy, venue and legal assistance
 during the inquest.

                      DR.   S.   POPPER      -   CONFERENCE        WITH     COUNSEL

                                 17th January 1990 at 2 p.m.

                            1 Paper Buildings, Inner Temple.




Present     :                         Dr. S.L. P o p p e r
                                      D r . M.J. P o w e r s
                                      R.B. H a m m o n d



Counsel believed there were three                            matters       outstanding,           which       he
identified as being the following

1.    The West Midlands Police Report to the Director of                                               Public
       Prosecutions and the outcome of other reports by the                                            Police
       Complaints Authority

2. , The second part of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry

3.    The possibility of civil proceedings.     It was thought these
       claims would not be worth very much as a large proportion of
       those people who died were young and unmarried.    Damages would
       therefore be mainly limited to bereavement, pain and suffering
       and funeral expenses.     However, it was thought      that the
       families may seek larger amounts by attempting to embarrass the
       Police Authority, and this may affect the Inquest.

Counsel thought that the following options were open to D r . Popper


1.     Resume the Inquest.    There had not been any pressure as yet
       from the families to do this, although there may be in the
       future.   Under Section 8 of the Coroners Act 19 ' there is a
       basic duty on the Coroner to hold an Inquest within a
       reasonable time, subject to certain exceptions.   Under Section
       16 (4) one of these exceptions is that a Coroner may be allowed
       to adjourn an Inquest pending a criminal inquiry.         Other
       exceptions are contained within Coroners Rules 26, 27 and 28.
       Under Rules 26 and 27, where the Coroner has been given
       information from the Police or Director of Public Prosecutions
       that a person may be charged with an offence, he must adjourn
       for a statutory period of 28 days. Thereafter, the Coroner may
       keep the Inquest adjourned on his own discretion.   It was this
       discretion which Dr. Popper was exercising at this current
       time.
 2.     Co unsel suggested that an a l t e r n a t i v e to h o lding a full Inquest
        w o u l d be t o p r o c e e d w i t h an I n q u e s t on a l i m i t e d b a s i s .                  He
        suggested           that   Dr.       Popper       could       see   each        family    as  a unit
        s e p a r a t e l y and d e a l w i t h t h e time, m a n n e r a n d m o d e of d e a t h and
        l e a v e t h e h o w a n d ,n o n - r e q u i s i t e , w h y i n r e s e r v e .   It w a s t h o u g h t
        t h a t t h i s w o u l d e n a b l e Dr. P o p p e r t o be s e e n t o be c a r r y i n g out
        his       duties      properly         whilst         at      the   same        time   not    getting
        e m b r o i l e d in a r g u m e n t s o n t h e w i d e r i s s u e s of t h e t r a g e d y .

 After making these initial observations Counsel turned to the other
 i s s u e w h i c h D r.      P o p p e r w i s h e d t o e x p l o r e , b e i n g w h e t h e r o r n o t to
 r e l e a s e t h e d o c u m e n t a t i o n h e h a d in h i s h a n d s f r o m t h e P o l i c e an d
 Director        of    Public         Prosecutions.           Counsel thought              that    the cases
 concerning         Peach        and Hicks s h o w e d t h a t not o n l y w a s t h e C o r o n e r
 u n d e r n o o b l i g a t i o n to reveal d o c u m e n t a t i o n , he was u n d e r a positive
duty not to.     Counsel believed that should Dr. Popper release
documentation, he could'be subjected to judicial review and the DPP
may try to prevent him from releasing documents by injunction or,
alternatively, may follow up the release of documents with an Action
for breach of confidence.
                                           X
Widgery J held in the Peach case, (1980) fee WLR 496 at 503, that
there would be a clear breach of confidence if the Coroner were to
release Police documents.   He had no legal right to do so.     This
viewpoint was supported in ex parte Hicks, 26th January 1987, when
Croom-Johnson also held that there was no right to call for
documents upon the Coroner.

Under the Rules of the Supreme Court there were provisions to order
discovery of documents from a non-party, who could conceivably be
the Coroner in a situation like this. However, Counsel thought that
the Coroner should still not release any documents until the High
Court had made an Order, and in such a situation he would have the
advantage of getting his costs at the same time as being protected
from an Action for breach of confidence.

Counsel did think that there was an obligation under Coroners Rule
57 to disclose the post mortem reports, and Dr. Popper indicated
that this has already been done, but he was pleased that Counsel
supported his action.

Counsel and Dr. Popper then returned to discussing the more general
aspects of Counsel's advice.   Counsel believes that his suggestion
of having a preliminary short form Inquest for each family would
have the advantage of leaving the general matters alone.        Dr.
Popper, however, felt that there would still be a need to examine
evidence in detail to ascertain the "where" of death.

Counsel felt that each family would benefit from getting the basic
information as to how their relatives died at an initial Hearing.
He thought that it would be beneficial to have a Senior Police
Officer present at the Inquest to summarise the non-controversial
evidence,   which  will  have   been  agreed   between  the  parties
beforehand.   Dr. Popper felt that this evidence would be difficult
to agree if, for example, the family solicitor wanted to see all the
witness statements and documents first.   Counsel accepted that this
would be a dilemma.   However, he thought that his suggestion would
still have its advantages as he was sure Dr. Popper did not want 95
separate full Inquests. Moreover, the family solicitors may want to
know at this stage the details of any pain and suffering for the
formulation of civil damages claims.

Counsel's strategy was to suggest resuming the Inquest in the form
of an administrative meeting where all parties would attend.      He
suggested Dr. Popper could then announce in open Court the course of
action he was taking and then take representations from interested
parties.

 The initial individual family Inquests could be dealt with without a
 jury.  If it was necessary to have a fuller Inquest at a later date
 to deal with general matters, a jury could be used.   There would be
 a problem with presenting the jury with the information from the
 initial Inquest, but this could be perhaps achieved by merely
 showing them the documentation.   Counsel was particularly concerned
 that Dr. Popper should not have a repeat of the Taylor Public
 Inquiry, as he did not have the resources or the requisite

                                                  Cont/d
authority.   In the event that Dr. Popper decided to take Counsel's
recommended course of action, Counsel thought that Dr. Popper may
not even have to have a final Inquest as to the general matters, as
these would have been fully aired in the Taylor report, civil
proceedings and possibly criminal proceedings.

Dr. Popper welcomed Counsel's advice, but felt that if the DPP
decided not to go ahead with a criminal Trial, public pressure may
well come back onto him to explore all the wider issues at a full
and lengthy Inquest.  Counsel accepted this possibility, but thought
that it was a risk Dr. Popper may have to run.

Dr. Popper thanked Counsel for his kind advice and indicated that he
would think very carefully about his suggestions.

FILE NOTE DATED 12.10.90. 5.15.p.m.    MR FRAZER RANG-

He wanted to know when I was having my P r e - inquest Review.

He was obviously very anxious that we should have this as

soon as possible.

I explained that I was still worrying about the

technicalities about it but on the whole I felt that if I

was going to do it, it would be towards the end of October.

He said that that was O.K. though the sooner I did it the

better.
He then re-confirmed that they were getting instructions

direct from the Hillsborough Family Support Group and it

was therefore possible to communicate with people very

quickly.
He mentioned that there were one or two people who had some

small queries on the individual inquests and was I

proposing to deal with these and if so when.      I said I

hadn't really intended to do that but I would consider the

point.     He suggested that they would ask the families to

let him have in writing any points which they want to put

to me and it might be possible for them to put these to me

in writing.     If we could sort them out they could either be

dealt with by correspondence and/or perhaps in the

beginning before we got down to the generics proper.

 I said that I thought that that was a good idea.

 I then explained to him that I was not intending to go over

 all the ground of the rescue.    Mr. Frazer agreed with this.

 He said he thought in his view probably 6 minutes past 3




 LESACG
was the cut-off point.   I said I felt that it might be a

 few minutes beyond that but that was basically what I had

in mind.   I explained to him that although we had dealt

with "the rescue" at the interin inquests, this was because

I had felt that it was only fair that the familes should

have some idea of the amount of effort and time that had

been put into this and also that should they wish to have

this explored at another place, they would at least know

who the people were who were involved.     He acknowledged

this as having been a good and proper thing to do.     I asked

him whether the points which were being raised were

substantial.   He said he didn't think so.    He said as far

as he could recollect they were relatively minor matters.

He said having fixed the end point, could I give him an

indication of how far back I was going to go.     I said that

was a little bit more difficult, but I would expect to go

fairlY far away back, namely including travelling

arrangements though very superficially, but that as we

approached the ground and also got nearer to the time, so

the inquiry would become more intensive.     I also said that

I was expecting to take some evidence of some previous

events insofar as that was necessary, again not in great
detail.

I said that I thought that when we got down to it he would

be quite satisfied indeed.   I had the feeling that we might

be doing a more thorough job than he was expecting.

He said one of the things that people were asking was




LESACG
           the witnesses would come in person, whether it
   would be documentary, whether they should come everyday and
   t hafs why they wanted to have this meeting,   x said ! was
   very sensitive to his views and 1 would certainly be bac*
   in touch as soon as possible           u
                                  He said he would now wait to
   hear from me.

FILE NOTE DATED 11.9.90. TELEPHONE CALL TO MR. STURTT.

0304-240250     TIME   23 minutes - 10.20 - 10.43 approx.

I discussed with Mr. Sturtt the Hillsborough Inquests, in

particular I wanted to get his feeling about calling the

evidence again which was included in the summary and which

dealt with what in short we refer to as the 'rescue'.

His initial re-action was that we might have to repeat that

because it might go to causation, but upon further

reflection, he agreed with me that one could certainly

argue that it was post incident and therefore not necessary

to repeat it.

He confirmed to me that he took the view that this inquest

had the potential of getting completely out of hand and it

was essential that I should keep very afirm control on it

and on the length of the proceedings.     He felt that the

parties had to clearly understand the necessity for

control, that fact that it was with me.     He also drew my

attention to the judgement in his case whether the judge

had pointed out that a line had to been drawn somewhere.

He also pointed out that I should not overlook the fact

that Lord Justice Taylor had had an Inquiry, and that was a

very relevant factor to the extent of the Inquisition.        He

reminded me of his illustration of drama and backdrop, and

indeed he thought that the 'rescue' so to speak could well

be treated as part of the scenery or stageing, whereas the

action was the bit that had to be looked at in greater

detail but even that, on a selective basis.

I asked him what his view was with regard to meeting with

the lawyers and in particular in camera and excluding Press

etc. He was not very keen on this. He said he had met with
               I U. frcd            \
the lawyers   ^ fcJie Inquest Review/but he put no

restrictions on people there but he did make an order that

the proceedings should not be reported.   He was not keen on

talking to laywers.   He thought it was important to keep a

distance and be rather magisterial.

He confirmed that he would do anything he could to help and

that I should not hesitate to contact him but he was

anxious that I should do it at the office rather than at

his home, and that we should correspond with him at the

office rather than at his home.

FILE MOTE DATED 24.10.90.

Meeting with Mervyn Jones, Stan Beechey, Caroline Perkins

and Sue Harper for part of the time and myself at Nechells

Police Station, 2 4 . 1 0 . 9 0 . ______________________________

A long meeting to discuss progress on preparation for the

Inquest. Caroline made a few notes which she will

circulate.   We discussed various matters including the

apcommodation.     Sue Harper reported progress.   Apparently

it was not possible to make accommodation available for the

Jury in the canteen.    Whilst they were prepared to provide

light meals in the jury room, I felt that on balance,

taking everything into account, we ought to give the Jury

their entitlement and let them go and fend for themselves,

subject to appropriate warnings.

We discussed the location of the T.V. screens and Videos,

Overhead Projectors, Audio equipment for the audio tapes.

Sue Harper would be liaising and sorting things out and

making sure that it was all dealt with properly.      It would

appear that we were getting a lot of co-operation from the

local authority.    Council meetings were scheduled for

November the 28th and January the 9th.     In addition to that

there was a meeting on the 6 th of December and the Mandela

and Committee Room would not be available.

Jackie Harrison, the West Midlands Police Press Officer had

         we&T the Press in hand.

We discussed attendance at the Pre Inquest Review and

agreed that we would restrict this to legal representatives




BACAAY
and interested parties only so as to deal with procedural

matters.

We discussed warning police officers of their likely

attendance and I said that on balance I felt that it would

be best if we alerted everybody who was on the list that

they were potential witnesses, we could then be more

selective.         -    p

We discussed the final list of witnesses.     I said I would

Hrttee this as soon as possible, probably fc© the end of next

week.    We agreed that we would allow witnesses to have a

look at their recollections or statements.     These would be

provided on the day.    We discussed the financing, travel

arrangements.    Apparently vouchers can be issued.   We

thought this should be dealt with by Sgt. Tredgold possibly

using Social Services as liaison.

We discussed the^mbursement of expenses of witnesses.           I

said I thought on the whole this should be dealt with by

the local authority, though Sgt. Tredgold might have to do

a little bit with the collecting of forms and so on.        A

suitable pro-forma will have to be drafted.

We discussed documents and exhibits.    We agreed that as far

as possible we should try and restrict these.     Mr. Jones is

very much against having        bundles.   He found that these

had been very confusing at the Public Inquiry.     The matter

would be compounded of course because of the Jury.     I said

I favoured using the minimum of documentary evidence,

preferring witnesses to read out relevant sections.        We




BACAAY
 agreed that we would continue with consequtive numbering.

 It looked as if we would probably need 20 copies of each

 exhibit or document.   One for each of the solicitors 4 for

 the Jury, 1 for me, 1 for Mr. Jones, 1 for the shorthand

writer anc* a couple of spares or so.    We agreed that if the

 solicitors wanted to introduce any documents, they would

have to produce the copies that were required.      We could

not provide the service.   We discussed the transcripts.       I

explained that these would be charged for for the benefit

of Sheffield.   That meant of course that Sheffield should

have to deal with the photocopying etc.     I said that we

would see how many we would need after our meeting on the
30th.

We discussed letter from Mr.Glover.     I said I would reply

to it.   They would deal with any police matters.    We again

discussed the scope of the Inquest and decided that a

convenient point at which we ought to draw the line would

be the arrival of the first ambulance on the pitch.     This

was really intended as a marker.   We agreed that we would

have to be fairly firm to avoid too much straying into post
incident.

I explained that the only problem I could see was that if

somebody had alleged that the medical treatment had caused

the death.   I felt that if that was put forward as a

serious suggestion, one might have to take that inquest

out, making it plain that no-one deal with it on that basis

and not as part of the Hillsborough Disaster.    We thought




BACAAY
 that it might be a good idea to make this point at the
 procedural meeting.

 I suggested that we try and find out how many people had

 filled in questionnaires/given statements or who claimed to

 be in Pen 3.    I thought this might possibly   be a back-up

 check on the calculations of Mr. Burns and the H.S.E.

 We discussed the experts.    We felt that we would have

 Mr. Philips, Mr. Stalker, Mr. Burns, H.S.E. numbers to be

 decided.    On the whole, we thought we wouldn't pursue the

 Cranfield Disaster as it looked as if this would not be
 helpful in sorting out the issue before us.

We discussed the PACE statements and in the end felt that

it was right to use these.     it was agreed that I would

write to find out whether videos would be available. We

noted that there were two or three who had refused videos.

I would have to check who they were before I sent the

letter.     The people who refused the videos were Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Greenwood,
everybody else agreed.

                                MINUTES OF MEETING
                          Held on Friday 2nd Kovembes 1990
                                         at
                           Nechells Green, Police Office

Persons Present       Dr POPPER - H.M. Coroner
                      Deputy Chief Constable Mr J.M. JONES
                      Detective Superintendent BBECHEY
                      Detective inspector PERKINS
                      Mrs D S HARPER PAO


1.    Proposed witness expense form discussed, 49 to the necessity of it being
       sent to witnesses with the witness warning notice* and the wisdcm in
       showing claimable amounts on the form. Mrs HARPER suggested that the
       subsistence details t>e omitted, tut the rate for travel should remain.
       Dr POPPER will study the form and redraft it, This will then be given to
       witnesses when they attend court, and complete it with the help of Social
       Services.
2.    The meeting was Informed that the new liaison officer in Sheffield was
       Sergeant John MAWSON. The liaison officer in Merseyside is Sergeant
       Viv HARTNETT (Tel 051 777 6215).
3.     The model of Hillsborough Stadium has been located at the offices of
       H.S.E. Mrs HARPER informed the meeting that Mr John BATLEY has
       undertaken to have this taken to the Town Hall. Mr JONES stated that the
       model should be kept under the supervision of the coroners officers, and
       Mr BATLEY should be informed accordingly.                     „   j
       Mr BEECHEY stated that he was intending to go to Sheffield on Tuesday
       November 1990 and on that day would be examining the model with a view to

       £ * $ 8 reminded Mr BEECHEY that Miss Dawn G00DHALL would have to
       consider changing the name plateB on the model.

 4.    Mr Beechey stated that on Friday 16th November 1990 he intended to go to
        Sheffield with DI PERKINS, DS GRIFFITHS, PC BROWN and perhaps other staff
        to check all is in order in the town hall. Mrs HARPER af reed
        also would be attending on that day, and it was s u g g e s t e d to Dr POPPER
        that he may also visit th* town hall.
 5.    Mrs HARPER will liaise with Ann SMITH and list all     equipment which would
        be required for the administration.
 6.    Dr POPPER was concerned with the task of ushering people into the court.
        Mr JONES emphasised that at LJT Public Inquiry, signs had proved
        adequate, but agreed that on the first day. the assistance of a
        commissionaire may,be sort.
Mrs Harper has reserved 12 car parking spaces at the Town Hall.
It was agreed that members of the jury should be Instructed to report at
the Town Hall at 1,30pm on Id.11.1990 and they would then be briefed as
to all a d m i n i s t r a t i v e matters including car parking.

Mrs HARPER enquired as to the likelihood of rest day working, it was
thought that this would pnly arise in 2 instances, firstly in the event
of poor weather conditions, when staff may have to travel to Sheffield on
a Sunday, or may be unable to travel home on Friday, aA»secondly should it
be necessary to work at weekends to complete witness warning for the
following week.
If weekend cover was introduced for this reason it would only be an 8 hr
day for 2 days per week.

The nameplates displayed on the benches of Counsel/Solicitors have to be
prepared, and Mr JONES suggested that in Dr POPPER'S next correspondence
with lawyers, details of named are tequested.

With regard to the safe at the Town Hall, Mrs HARPER will speak with the
keyholder and agree times when access will bs available to the lawyers.

The subject of refreshments for persons attending court were explained by
Mrs HARPER. Firstly the jury would have flasks of tea/coffee provided in
their room. Arrangements have been made for the Coroner to receive
refreshment when required and the public/lawyers would be able to use the
facility of the service area which will be available all day. There will
not be any provision by the v r v s .

Mr JONES suggested that Dr POPPER write to th* Solicitors concerned and
confirm the dates when the court is not sitting i.e. 28.11,90. 9.1.91 and
6.2,91.

Mrs HARPER has arranged for the provision of 2 sets of headphones for
the Stenographers,

She also informed the meeting that the transmission of the proceedings
relayed to the Mandela Room* will only show the court and will not aoom
in on the court screen when pre-recorded video film it shown, nor will it
relay detail of documents highlighted by the O.H.P or the epidiascope.
Mr Jones stated, this fact should be borne in mind, and should the press
wish to see what is being shown, they would have to corns into the public
gallery.

Mrs HARPER also made the meeting aware that the playing of audio tape,
would cut Out any simultaneous diction within the court.

Whilst no-one ie aware of any witness being wheelchair bound,
arrangements must be made to cover this possibility, and a roving
microphone should be on hand.

          18.     The fire service have Approved thv venue   foe   the court   use.

          19.     A chair has baen found, for Dr POPPER which he will be able to move
                  without assistance.

          20.     Mr* HARPER hat written to Chief Superintendent MOUNTAIN in respect of
                  car-park passes for Furnival House, Also in respect of officers now in
                   receipt of an essential fear allowance, the finance department has been
                  advised.

          21.      With regard to the Security at Furnival House at present the keys are
                   held by South Yorkshire Police* As from Friday 16th November 1990 the
                 ■ keys will be repossessed, and Securiguard will be employed from that
                   evening. Mr JONES stressed that it is incumbent on us not to leave any
                   sensitive material anywhere except in locked cupboards.
                   After 19.11.90 DI PERKINS will be the keyholder.

          22.     It was decided that the team of Coroner# officers should travel to
                   Sheffield on Sunday 18th November 1990, working at 2 x 10 day, with a
                   briefing at the Hoat Bouse af j . $ 0 p m .

          23.     Mrs HARPER then left the meeting.

          22 .     Attention was then turned to Mr JONES agenda to cover points not already
                   raised for the assistance of Mrs HARPER.

          Zh.     It was agreed that the jury would find it difficult to handle too much
                   non-viva voce evidence, and this should be avoided where possible,

          25.      There were reservations as to the statements of MESSRS, FOSTERS & TAYLOR
                   being circulated as statements, It was agreed that it would be
                   preferable if these were thought of as "speeches," allowing therefore for
                   anything contentious, to be changed, until it becomes an agreed document.
                   It can then be read out unchallenged, If any point cannot be agreed
                   upon, this should be omitted from the ’speech* and a witness called to
                   cover that matter. Mr Michael P0W6RS could read out the agreed speech.

          26.     Agreement was reached that these two "speeches" should be amalgamated, be
                   anonymous and in the third person. It should be titled ‘A Summary* and
                   be typed onto plain paper.

          27.     Dr Popper confirmed that there would be no pre-circulated evidence,
                   provided to legal representatives. However he had considered the
                   lawyers* request for the notice of witnesses, and proposed that the list
                   he had provided to the meeting should be typed in alphabetical order, and
                   supplied to the lawyers.
                   This liBt should be retyped as followsi
                   Surname in Capitals, followed by first Christian name if known, and then
                   initial of any subsequent name. The witnesses should not be numbered and
                   descriptions should be accurate.

          25.   The meeting was informed that DS TREDGOLD would be responsible for the
                witnesses refreshing their memories by being shown their statements.
                There would be no discussion about the content of the statement with the
                police officer.

          29.   W ith regard to Cor* bundles, Dr POPPER suggested that *11 documents which
                ware required by any party ihould be pooled together and become a court
                c o f & bundle, After further debate it was decided that the cofe bundle
                should be built up as the evidence was given and as such Miss
                NORTHCLIFF’S request for her 3 bundles to be accepted from the outset
                would be refused. It was proposed that 20 ring'binders continuing
                transparant sleeves, and 20 empty ringbinders would be provided for use
                by the Coroner, Coroners officer*legal representatives, and the jury.
                Then ad the documents are introduced they would be given a ’C number and
                thereby build up the core bundle (The sleeves being used for the
                photographs). Also required would be 20 copies of the 1076 Green Guide
                and 20 copies of the 1966 Green Guide,

          30.   With regard to the re-opening of the mini inquests, Dr POPPER suggested
                that if necessary these should be reconvened at a convenient point at the
                end of the general evidence, and before expert witnesses.

          31.   The matter of the cut Off point should be addressed by contacting Hr
                FRASER, and enquiring as to how many of those he represents wish to hear
                evidence to 4pffl. Dr POPPER stated he still favoured the cut off point to
                be 3,15pm. but that he would not b® inflexible on this point and would
                consider each request on its merits.

          32.   Mr BEECHEV reminded the meeting that at the mini inquests, questions had
                 been asked by the Jury and certain families, but answers had not been
                 given, the relatives having been told that there would be an opportunity
                 at a later forum to raise their queries. This was the forum where they
                 expected the answers. As such Dr PUPPER requested that the transcripts
                 of the preliminary inquests should be examined and these questions noted,

                With regard to the compilation video which would be shown during the
                resumed inquests, Mr JONES informed the meeting that this film was proved
                by DI Layton. It was not created by the West Midlands Police, but was a
                compilation of films agreed to with the Treadury Solicitors,

          33.   In relation to the video Dr POPPER stated that he did not intend to show
                the tape on 19.11,90. He would firstly deal with legal submissions,
                followed by agreed ’summaries*, after which he would show video prior to
                hearing evidence.
                It was also considering showing Mr PHILLIPS video, but not until Hr
                PHILLIPS was called to the court.

          34.   Dr POPPER stated he would toon be in a position to supply the list of
                 witnesses for the first five days. During the week commencing 12,11,90
                 the list of those witnesses likely to b« called on the first 2-3 days
                 could be faxed to the lawyers, This task will be undertaken from
                 Nechells.
      The Coroner will write to the legal representatives in relation to
      nameplates, list of legal representatives circulated, transcript#
      (availability and cost), court dates, and batting order.

      Dr POPPER it in favour of a *ite visit for the jury, A route will be
      prepared when Dr POPPER indicate* what he would want the Jury to see.
      Also it would be helpful if a ecripr. was composed to be read to the jury
      as they were taken around the area.

35.   Mrs HARPER to be requested to organise * coach for 28,11.90 at 10 am for
       approximately 3hrs.

36.   Mr JONES will write to the secretary of   Sheffield Wednesday football club
       requesting the visit to the ground.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH JIM TURNBULL..

I wanted to just re-duscuss some of the aspects of

Hillsborough to obtain his feelings on the matter



1.   I outlined my proposals for the format of the Inquest

     including the number of witnesses.    I asked him whether

     he felt that I was going the right thing.       His response

     was that he thought it was absolutely right and

     precisely as it should be done.

2.   I asked him what he thought about the cut-off point at

     3.15 subject of course to any legal submissions which

     might be made on the 19th.His view was        that my

     feelings on the matter were    in    line with his butfrom

     a pragmatic point of view it might be kind if there

     were just a few individuals who needed this sort of

     information explored to deal with what happened even

     after 3.15.   I had already been inclined to perhaps

     do this, so his view confirmed my feelings.       Obviously

     one would have to have proper advance warning of the

     cases where this was likely    to    arise.

3.   I discussed the involvement    of     Counsel.     He could see

     certain advantages in this but on the whole I think

     he would have preferred if Counsel had been Retained in

     London but on the understanding that I could get in

     touch with him on the relevant date and have conference

     on the phone if necessary.    This is for the opening.




BACABR
4.   I asked him what he thought about extending the inquiry

     to include the licensing aspects i.e., Sheffield City

     Council. He said a similar thing had occurred at

     Bradford though perhaps not quite so acutely with the

     Fire Service.                He thought that it was necessary to deal

     with these aspects.

 Token conversation with Mr. Sturt.


Mr- . Sturt said he was on the point of ringing me to check whether
theycould do anything to help me. He confirmed that if there was
anything or anyway they could help they would be delighted to do so.

 1          opportunity of outlining to him the number of witnesses
we had and the generalway in which I wanted to proceed.       I also
 thought that the wording of the Act was perhaps a little wider
than the rules as to , the rules were really based on how the
verdict should be drafted. He felt that that might be so but in
any event the word HOW was a fairly flexible word, on the other
hand he didn't think it was riqht.to deal with issues of WHY
something happened we were/efftaDlish HOW the deceased came by his
  eath and that of course meant and investigation of the circumstances
as well as the immediate cause of death, tfhough one had to have
some causal connection. I said that on the whole I agreed with it
TT~3 ^ t°°k the view that in the word HOW was ep compass. so much of
WHY and WHOM as was necessary to establish how something had come
about. I also said that whilst I didn't think that minor matters
of negligence might be relevent bearing in mind that an unlawfully
jelled really was something which the Coroners Jury could determine
had to explore sufficient evidence to establish whether or not say
recklessness had been made out in the terms of the . - direction.
Mr. Sturt agreed.

He asked whether I had had a letter from the D.P.P. to confirm that
it didn't wish me to adjourn if I were to find that there might be
something in the evidence. I said no because I assumed it was
unneeftssary in view of the fact that he had decided not to prosecute.
Mr. Sturt felt that it would be wiser if I did obtain his confirmation
because technically once I heard any evidence which might give rise to
the possibility of a charge I ought to adjourn,(that is actually rule
28). He said that he had obtained such a letter in the Zeebrugge
case in fact he obtained two because in the middle of his case
something had come up which was rather specific to one individual.
He said that I shouM. give the D.P.P. a ring and would not anticipate
any problems.

I discussed with him the scope of the inquiry in particular the events
on the field, i.e. the rescue. He said that he had got into trouble
with that as well and the way he had dealt with it he had reserved
half a day to deal with the rescue but by and large the reason he
had done that was so that people had an opportunity of thanking and
acknowledging the great effort which people had done. I explained
to him that in my case I had difficulty because whereas the same
person may be praised by one and possible condemmed by another on the
grounds that they had left their son/ loved one too soon. Mr. Sturt
felt that as indeed I do that even if it were true that in the heat
of the moment and under pressure somebody had made some error in the
extent of the resuscitation this was not something for which they
could be blamed. It certainly wasn't an
I thought that was an interesting useof the word because this was  one
of the arguments which I already had in mind about this aspect. I did
say to Mr. Sturt that I wasn't making a definitive decision until I
had heard the legal arguments and indeed something might be said
which I had:1nt thought of and which would sway me.

I then discussed jury visits, he said they had done two, but he had
been very very careful to comply. The jury had been kept under the
care of the Coroners Officer, very little was said, he made it quite
clear to then that the were not to try and do a reconstruction. He
hadn't accompanied them and he also made sure that the other parties
were not with them.
We discussed one or two other     matters   which   were   not r e l e v a n t   to

     Dear Dr Popper

     RE; HILLSBOROUGH

     Thank you for your letter of the 15th February 1990.

     I note what you say in connection with the disclosure of
     inquestsi0n t0 the steer^n® Committee by means of resuming the

     We have considerable sympathy for the relatives of the
     deceased and we are anxious to assist but we must ensure that
     the criminal investigation and any criminal prosecution is not
     prejudiced in any way by such disclosure.

     I have today sent papers to Mr Gareth Williams QC and
      *                Counsel who have been advising the Director
     of Public Prosecutions in connection wi i matters arising from---
     the events at Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989.

     I hope very shortly to receive their Opinion and thereafter X
     will contact you to discuss the possibility of a meeting.

 We have spoken with Mr Jones to keep him appraised of our
 feelings on this delicate point.
     Yours sincerely

    ^           Dear Mr Green

                Po. TTTT.TiS’RO'ROUGH DISASTER

                 1.      You will of course be aware tliat on the 15th. of April an^
                          incident occurred at tlie Hillsborough Football Ground which
                          resulted in the loss of 95 lives as well as injury to other
                          spectators.
                 2.       Lord Justice Taylor was charged with holding a Public Inquiry
                          anrf that the first part of it has been completed. I understand
                          that Lord Justice Taylor&s interim report is being published
                          on h August 1989*
                 3.        As Coroner for South Yorkshire West District, it falls to me
                           to deal with the deaths by way of Inquest.
 ■-"V


C                4.        it is my present intention to resume the Inquests on the 15
    ^                      January 1990.
                 5.        Mr Hytner QC in his oral submission to Lord Justice Taylor
                           at the close of the oral evidence stated:-
                           "It is no secret, and I say this at once, that many of the
                           bereaved have specifically instructed us that they wish
                           consideration to be given to criminal prosecution or criminal
                           prosecutions in due course, but this they -understand is not
                           the time nor the place for that to be said.

                  6.        This point is also reported rather more specifically in the
                            Daily Telegraph, Saturday 15 July where it is stated:-
                            "Solicitors representing the bereaved and injured believe ^ ^
                            the Inquest is likely- to return verdicts- of --Unlawful Killing .
                            They say that if the Crown Prosecutor fails to act they
                            seek leave to begin private criminal action against the peop1

                       Ferry Disaster -which, claimed 193 lives -was issued at Bow Street
                       last month. Mr Michael Humphries of* the Liverpool Solicitors
                       Group said v*My clients want the people responsible for this
                       disaster made to pay the proper price for what has happened*."

           7«          You will of course be fully aware of the. 'provisions of
                       Section l6(l)(a) of the Coroners Act 1 9 8 8 which in effect
                       provides that where the Clerk of the Magistrate-* s Court
                       informs the Coroner that certain serious offences have been
                       charged, the Coroner shall in the absence of reason to the
                       contrary adjourn the Inquest* Sub section l6(l)(b) is even
                       wider in scope and enables the Director of Public Prosecutions
                       to request the Coroner to adjourn an Inquest in certain       '
                       circumstances.'
                       Section 1 6 (2 ) provides savings which enable the Coroner not
                       to adjourn Inquests which fall within Section 1 6 (1) or where
                       having adjourned an Inquest, he: may be permitted to proceed.
                       I believe in fact that where Inquests are adjourned by
                       Coroners under Section,16(1) it is in fact very rare for the
                       Coroner to resume these, and the matter is usually completed
                       •under the provisions of Section 16(^) and (5 ).

           8.              Rule 27 of the Coroners Rules 198^ substantially covers the
                           point covered in Clause 16(1)(a)L of the Coroners Act 1988.

           9*              Rule 28 of the Coroners Rules provide that if during the
                           course of an Inquest evidence is given from which it appears
                           to the Coroner that the death of the deceased is likely to
                           be due to an offence within Rule 26.3 and that a person
                           might be charged with such an offence, then the Coroner,
                           unless he has previously been notified by the Director of
                           Public Prosecutions that adjournment is unnecessary, shall
                           adjourn the Inquest for 14 days or such longer period as he
                           may think necessary and send to the Director particulars of
                           that evidence.
                           At any time before the date fixed for the holding of the
                           adjourned Inquest the Director of Public Prosecutions may ask
                           the Coroner for further adjournment and the Coroner may
                           comply with his request*

10, X appreciate that you have not yet had an opportunity to
    assess the evidence in the Hillsborough Disaster, and therefore
    are not presumably in a position to say whether any charges
    may be brought which fall within-the provisions of Section
   >l6(t)(a) or Section l6(l)(b).

11. X also fully appreciate that it would not be right for you
    to take any decision purely upon what legal representatives
    of bereaved families might say or what is stated in newspaper
    articles,

12* However, these comments are very relevant to me because they
    indicate the line of thinking which at least a portion of
    the interested parties are likely to pursue.

I3e You will of course be aware of Regina v St.! Pancras Coroner*s
    Court ex party Higgins, Divisional Court QBD, 23 May 1988,
    where their Lordships appeared to indicate that a Coroner can
    withdraw the verdict of Unlawful Killing from the Jury where
    there was no evidence which could conceivably have amounted
    in law as sufficient to justify such a verdict.

14. You will appreciate that it is impossible for me to take a
    view until in fact the evidence has been given at the Inquests,
    and it will be at that stage no- doubt that I will have to
    decide whether there is evidence which can be left to the
    Jury to consider a verdict of Unlawful Killing or whether the
    evidence is of such a nature that I can properly withdraw
    that verdict from their consideration.

15* This position precisely encapsulates the problem which I
    am now faced with:-

    a. I anticipate that it will be necessary to call a considerable
       number of witnesses and that consequently the Inquests will
       take some considerable time. This apart from being
       expensive will of course generate a great deal of stress
       both for the bereaved but also for the witnesses, some of
       whom may well wish to shield under the provisions of Rule 22
       (Rule against Self Incrimination).

      19* You will appreciate that there is a considerable amount of
           public interest in this disaster as well as a great deal of
         , anxiety and personal grief. I am very anxious that whatever
           is done by me should be done correctly, but with a view to
           minimising the upset and pain which the Hillsborough Disaster
           has, is and will cause.

      20. I would be grateful if X could hear from you as soon as
          possible. Irrespective of what the decision might be,
          several urgent matters have to be dealt with and I would like
          an indication of your thinking. If it would help to discuss
          this a mutually convenient time could I am sure be arranged.

 finding          my    entry          point.           There        was      no     difficulty             in g e t t i n g      into        the

 The    concertina                gates          were       s hut,      I didn't           see    any       gates       opened whilst                   I

 I took       up my m atc h                 viewing          position           in    penr 4,         standing          n e xt    to     the

 Towards          kick       off       at    3.00pm          the      pressure            b e h i n d me     started          increasing.

 Before       the       players             came       on    the     pitch,          I was       feeling          more     pressure,               so

 I. g r a b b e d      hold       of    the       railing          and       put     my    feet       on    the    bottom         bar     of

 t h em .     This         meant        that       the       pressure          of     the       crowd       had    t u r n e d me a r o u n d

 to    face       pen 3,          with       my    left        shoulder/facing                   the       goal.        The      pressure

 was    greatest             at a b o u t         2.55pm          u n j/fl   3 . 05pm.

 The    crowd          in P e n 3 w a s            mol/concentrated                        at    the       very    f r o n t , about           8 or

 9 steps          up    from       th e      front          wall.        I saw        two       lads       walking       on      top     of    my

                   Behind       the    West       Stand,         as    I came     out       of       the       tunnel       I had        to    step       over

                   two    dead     bodies,         their         heads     were       covered w i t h a jumper.                           By    the       back

                   wall     were      more     dead      bodies.           There       was       a       line       of a b o u t    eight       Policemen

                   standing        by t h e s e      bodies,           facing     the       back          of    the       stand with           their

                   backs     to    the      bodies.           I then       left       the    ground             and       caught     a bus       b a ck     to

                   the    railway        station.

                   At    first     the      fans     were        dajfnq    more       than       the       Police.           The     Police          were

                   hesitant,          they must          hay®         thought     it w a s           a    pitch        invasion          or    something.

                   I saw a fan           get      out j f f      the    gate     in the          front          of     pen 3 a n d        go    up    to a

                   this     incident         is    t h at     there       was    no    person             directing          the     c r owds,

On    r o ut e       to     the       ground          we    drove       together           for          about       10 or            15 m i n u t e s

I did       see       police           standing             at    the       junctions.

Upon       my arrival                 at     the      ground           _________ a n d             I had       to      go       to    the      players

got    our       tickets              which          were        6 for       Leppings              L a ne ,    standing.                We     then

trying         to     get        into        the      ground,          There        was    no       orderly            queues.            I didn't

take       any       notice           what       was       happening           but      for        some       reason            1 decided             I

wouldn't             tr y    to       g et      in at       t ha t     point,        I walked             along         Lepping              L an e

towards          a    pe tr o l        station where                   I purchased                 a soft        drink           and      then m a d e

my way         back         to    the        ground         entrance,,            1 did        note       t h at       whilst           I wa s        going

know which                entrance              to    use       all    I thought           t ha t        it w a s       just          a Leppings

the    ground.

followed           me,      I    should         think       about        SO      or     30     in all.            Upon        entering            the

ground       all        I could          see     as     a entrance               to     the     ground            was    the       tunnel         and

the    goal        and     pitch         beyond.          There        wa s      no     police          or    stewards             at    or     n ea r

the    entrance            to      the     tunnel         to     guide        us.       I went          into       the     tunnel          and

upon    going           through          it     seemed          there       wa s      more      and      more        people          there.I

in f ac t     was        pushed          against          the     ri ght         hand        wa l l .    I then went

into    Pen 3 which                 was        crowded          but    no m o r e        than       I ’ve         experienced

carried           by    the     people         coming           into       the       Pens       to a       point         at    about

front        fence - I think                  I was          about        20    f ee t     or so a w a y            from       it.       At    this

point        I was       unable          to    move          I was        being        crushed           by    people          in all

directions.              A ll      I can       remember              about          the    t im e      no w    is    seeing          the       kick

off.      The      pressure           then         got       harder        and       harder         on m e . I           had my arms             out

of     the     crowd      at       shoulder          height              to m y      s id e s .     All       the     people

about        me    and    me       were       shouting              for    the m a t c h          to     be    stopped             and    to    open

t he     front         gate     and also            p us h      bac k,         At    this       t i me     I could            see    police          on

the      front         fence       shouting          push           back,       but       nothing          happening.               The       crowd

didn't         move      and       the    pressure              got       ha r d e r .

shouting           gat    back-          He    was       pulled           off       the    fence         bv a       police          o f f i c e r -w h o

he     th en      hit.    Three          policemen              then a r r e s t e d            him w h i c h         included            the     one

t ha t    he      hit.    He       was    taken away                 after          being       wrestled            to    the       ground.          I

also      remember            other       police             which        were       Helping*            At    this       time       the       front

g a te    was      opened          and        I particularly                     remember           one p o l i c e o f f i c e r         who        ha d

h is     coat      off.       He    was        at     the       front          with       his     f o ot on         the w ai l       trying          to

Dull      people         out       but    he       couldn't              because          of    the      pressure             the    people          had

on     them.I          remember          asking          a    old man           if    he wa s          all     right,          he w as         about

50     to 5 5 w i t h         white       hair       and. g l a s s e s             and    a thin          bu il d .

At- t h i s       time    he wa s         immediately                    to m y      left.        He     t o l d me       he       was    alright.

I didn't           notice          what       happened              to    him after            that.

Immediately              in f r o n t         of    me       wa s    a youth          between            IS a n d 20.              The    first

time      I noticed             him      he    had       gone        into       u n c o n c i o u s n e s s . He          was

facing         sidewards            t ow ard my              right,        his       head      was       slumped          on       the    person

in f r o n t       of    him.       His f a c e     was        red.        1 tried          to      revive          him       by     hitting

his      face      and    he       came        round           for       a few moments.                    1 told

him    to     stay       awake         and     not      to    go    down        or    he w o u l d       have        had

it.     I also          told       him    that       I would          look        after         him.      I wa s        no w      beginning

to     panick       myself,            thinking          about        my     girlfriend               and      if

I was        going       to    get       out.     I d o n ’t k n o w            what       happened            to    the       youth after

t h a t . I ’m not            sure       whether         he    went        unconcious                again.         I would

describe           him about             2 0 y e a r s , he         was      clean         shaven and               had

s t e el     rimmed       glasses             with      short       dark        h ai r     parted         on        the right. I

The     next       thing       I know          was      a youth        who        w as     slightly            to    the       right      of me

climb        on    top    of       the    people         in    front         of me         he    had      his       foot       stuck

between my              legs       for    a few moments.                   I thought             I would            h a ve     to

do     the    same       to    get       out.     1 then a t t e m p t e d                to    put m y        f oo t     on

someones           back       in    front       of me.         T he    barriers                must     have        c o l l a p s e d at     this

p oi n t     because          there       was     just        enough         to      lift       my    foot.         I then

became        aware       that         there      was        room     to m y         left       and       got       out      and

to     the    centre          of    the       fencing.         I asked            someone            where          the exit was            but

through           it.    On    the       other       side      I sat         down         by    the     pillar          to     the      left.     I

was     shaking          but       X couldn't            feel       any      pain.         The       events         I've       described

must       have     taken          p l ac e    o v er    15 or 2 0 m i n u t e s                but     I can o n l y             remember

t he    instances             I 'v e     described.

After        sitting          for      a while          I moved        to       the       outside         wall       where          1 sat    and

talked        to a n o t h e r         man.     I then went                by     the      police         box       and      looked       onto

At     no    time       throughout                the     time      1 was        in the        ground            did        I see a n y

fights        or    disturbances                   or     see    any       person          committing              a    criminal

offence        or       drink          any    alcohol.

Al l    I can s a y              that     I think            would      be    of      interest           to      the        enquiry          is

firstly        the       way       in w h i c h         the     crowd was             handled          before           it    got       to    the

on e a c h      persons            ticket          before        they        got      to    the    ground and                 last       year

when        I got       to       the    ground          there       were      officers            present              at

the     turnstiles                which       were        searching           people.          Also         last        year       there          were

people        outside             the     gates         to    the     ground          telling          us     to       go    into

the     ground          in so          doing       not       allowing         people         to m il l           about.        Also          last

year        there       were       police          and       stewards         on      the    inside           of       the    ground          which

I did        not    see          this     y e a r,      not     e v e n at       the       entrance           to

there        should          have       been       police        on     the      ground        side         of     the

didn't        understand                what       was       happening           and       this    made          tnere

reaction           to    the       events          slow       arm     perhaps          making          xt m o r e           difficult

for     people          to       get    out.       I think          the      police         may    have          been        more

prepared           for       a    public          order       situation            than a distaster.                         I was       not

aware        of a n y        medical          help        being       given.          I wa s      not       seen        by a n y o n e

until        i returned                to L i v e r p o o l .         I also          feel     that         the        whole       of    the

ground        facilities                including             ground         entrances            a re      outdated           and       that

major        investment                should        be      made     to     provide         decent           facilities                for all

supporters              not       only       at    Hillsborough               but      also       at     other          grounds.                   I

also        wish    to       add       that       I attended            to    cup f i n a l s          at     Wembley and                I

found        that       the       same       situation           wa s      being       allowed           to      develop           there          with

             no    orderly     queues      to   enter    the    ground     and     once   inside   the   ground    the

             section        behind   the    goal   being       allowed     to      overcrowd,   whilst    the    e nd

             sections       were     relatively      empty      of   p e op le .

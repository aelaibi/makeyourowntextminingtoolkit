about    half an hour in / h i s                traffic and the              time      I w ould    estimate

betw e e n     1130 am - 1200\mi d d a y .                People         were walking about              up and down

the m o t o r w a y selling          tickets.            Whe n we e v e nt u al l y started off a g a i n                    1

saw that        the    cause       of the       congestion was              due to traffic          on the       dual

been held up so              long.        We    e ve nt ua ll y made          our way to G l o s s o p where

instead        of taking          the A 6 2 8 Jf took         the A 5 7 , S nake         pass Rd and at about

12.40    pm     (1240)       we stoppg>o at a pub,                 I do not know its name                   but was

having       r esturation w o r / carried out                    on      it an d was       near Lad y Bower

w i t h us and ate           in the       car and then w he n the                  pub opened at          one o ’clock

we went        inside and st ay ed              for about        one      hour and during           this     time       I

had two        pints    of    lager.                      and               had three             and

a basket meal.               We    c o mm en ce d our j o ur ne y and had a free                    run where w hen

we    came to a j u n c ti o n where                 the A&101        diverts awa y from the A 5 7 .                    We

took    the A6101           after    seeing a signpost                   for H i l l s b o r o u g h w h i c h was      four

to twenty minutes                 to walk       to the ground.               We    parked the       car at about

2.20    pm     (1420).        We w a l k ed      past a pub w here                people    I think were          locals

were    sitting        outside and a sk ed them d i r ec t io n s                     to the ground.            I. did

not    see any fans           drunk       or    consuming alcohol                 on the way to the            grounds.

 I saw Police           in pairs          but    they were         there       only    if you      required

a s s i s t a n c e and traffic           control.          W i t h in    sight      of the gr ou nd        it was

    could       not get a ticket-                  On a pp r oa c hi n g    the ground          1 did not see any

    Police       checking       the     tickets        of fans.       W«r' a rr i ve d at 2.40            pm     (1440)      and

    I saw to my          right as        I was about            to/t ur n towards           the ground entrances

    about       three t ho us an d       people a l l/ m a s s e d t og et he r a ro u nd the                  t u r n s t i le

    way towards          the N o r th staro entrance                 thinking            that   I w ould       enter

    Le pp i ng s       Ln End but        I saw that          it was        for    seats     only.       I then had to

    make my wa y back             over      to the       right.      We were         s hu ffling       f o rw ar d and

    s ho v ed also       by the       crowd.          I did not think             that this was          f r ig ht en in g
#   as    the    three       of us kept        together.          We were         then     c onfronted         by gates,.

    Just    prior       to this my mate                      was ki ck ed         by a Pol ic e        horse.         On the

    other       side    of the gate           I saw one s t ew ar d trying                 to   close    it he was

    un ab le to        close     it due       to the      crowd     pushing agai ns t            it.     The      gate

    opened and the s t ew ar d was                    pushed agai ns t           the wall.         He was       shouting

    that    the gate was           to    be    closed.           We were         then drif te d a r o u n d         to where

    two    p ol iceman were,            one    of the       pol ic em en was A s i an both wear in g

    helmets.           As we    passed them t he y"were               on my        right and        I saw       people

    goi ng t h ro ug h the turnstile^r on my                      left and we were w aved                    on by the

    two P o l i c e m e n     through tfere folding              gate w h i c h      I now know to be gate C.

    I did       not    have to show my ticket                   to an yo ne       I did not see any Po li ce                      or

my mates and ducked under                      one    barrier       in an atte mp t         to get down to the

front,        as we started          to get       crushed.         We    stop pe d about          half way          down

then     i m m e d iately     in front         of me and        I had my arms             up resting across

his sho u ld er s and base                of his      neck,                     was    to my right w i t h one

person between us.                I looked twice to see                    if he was alright an d he was

swetting and he said,                  ’Yes".         On asking         him the third time               he had

d i s a p p e a r e d and    I had     lost sight          of him.        The     game     had s ta rt ed and               I

then asked                   if he had seen                        but    he had not.             I then heard my

people        up out of the          crowd.          I shouted and w a ve d to him and he

 this was        somewhere        in the v ic in it y of th^r tunnel                      area.     I was

that    people        could be       lifted out also.                I made       my way up the steps                    to

                        h a p p e n this year.             I made my way             towards the          back of the             stand and was

                         about       half way from the              back as          I looked a r o u nd the game was                    still       in

                        the    gang way            was     getting filled.             I then went         further       back      up the

                        stood      in the          seats and        I saw the         players being taken off the                    pitch.         My

"COMPLAINTS" MADE AGAINST THE CONDUCT OF THF 'C HIEF" CONSTflBTF- - -
K ? P S I L of the Clerk and Financial Officer
1      Matter for Consideration
       Letters of complaint dated 7 and 8 February respectively from Mr Trevor
       Hicks and Mr Phillip Hammond and 9 March from Mr B W Devonside. The
       complaints from each of them concern the conduct of the Chief Constable
       in statements he made to the media following immediately upon the
       announcement of his retirement. These letters are annexed to this report
       as appendix 1.
2      The Legal Position
2.1    Section 86(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1985 places
       upon the Authority the duty to record complaints against officers for whom
       they constitute the appropriate authority: the Chief Constable is such an
       officer.
2.2    The Act defines a "complaint" as "... any complaint about the conduct of a
        police officer ...". The responsibility on the Authority is to record the
        complaint and unless it exercises the discretion afforded in Section 86(2)
        PACE, to have it investigated. That discretion is not to investigate if
        satisfied that the conduct complained of, even if proved, would not
        justify a criminal or disciplinary charge. In the opinion of the
        Authority’s solicitor this would include a situation where an
        investigation would not provide any further information and on the only
        available evidence no disciplinary offence can possibly be made out.
3      The "Complaints" bv Mr Trevor Hicks
3.1    The disciplinary offences inherent in the allegations which can quite
        properly by regarded as "complaints" are discreditable conduct, abuse of
        authority and falsehood and one or a combination of these can be distilled
        from each of the complaints. It is not intended to go through each
        complaint with a fine tooth comb setting this against those disciplinary
        offences but rather to adopt a broad brush approach concentrating on the
        major issues as seen by the Solicitor to the Authority. However Members
        may wish to consider each complaint against the backcloth of those
      . definitions and the Solicitor will be available at the meeting to discuss
        the finer detail if this is considered necessary.
3.2   The Chief Constable after receiving details of the complaints by Mr Hicks
       and Mr Hammond, wrote to the Clerk and Financial Officer submitting
       comments which he would bring to the attention of members. The Solicitor
       to the Authority considers it proper and appropriate that these comments
      are taken into account. The Chief Constable’s letter is Appendix 2 to
      this report.
       Complaint 1
       "Mr Wright is guilty of abuse of the privilege of his position in
       suggesting to the media he was aware that information would come to light
       in the inquest that would present ’a different picture’". He infers this
       relates to drink and all its effects. Assuming Mr Wright has seen such
       "evidence" it is "confidential" until deemed otherwise bv HM Coroner and
       should remain that wav. Clearly a breach of "privilege".
Comment

It is noteworthy that the Chief Constable does not particularise the
information. If he had this may have opened him up to greater criticism.
Neither is the statement considered to have been given in an "oppressive
manner" a prerequisite if the offence of abuse of authority is to be made
out. The statement made by the Chief Constable in the context of this
complaint was qualified and in the opinion of the Solicitor to the
Authority no disciplinary offence or criminal offence is made out in this
complaint.
Complaint 2
^.By suggesting that this ’puts a different complexion on the end product’
he prejudges the verdict of the Coroner.- This is outside his authority
and insults the jurisdiction of the C o r o n e r ’ s offir.p".
Comment
As in the first complaint, Mr Hicks fails to take account of the
qualifying nature of the Chief Constable’s quotation. In it he uses the
word ’may" which is clearly equivocal and does not support the element of
prejudice that Mr Hicks attributes to his statement.
Complaint 3
.111 believe that his pronouncements could prejudice innuest jurors who will
of course be drawn from the area covered bv the newspaper cited".
Comment
This taken together with the previous complaint has to be regarded as an
allegation of contempt of court. Because the Coroner’s Court is a court
of inferior jurisdiction this is a matter for the High Court which
oversees issues of this nature. This allegation is considered to be more
serious and less clear than many of the others. However every statement
quoted in the article has this qualifying element which has been mentionelv
previously and taking cognisance of the considerable publicity already
given to Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry the Solicitor to the Authority is
of the opinion that the Authority could quite properly decide not to
pursue this further.
It is appropriate to take complaints 4 and 6 together.
Complaint 4
-He goes on to infer that Lord Justice Tavlor was not aware of all of t.hP
facts and ’there is a lot of information that has not vet come out’. He
has therefore bv his own omission failed to do his job. If he is awarp nf
the, information that is material to Lord Justice Tavlor’s conclusions he
should have ensured that it was nlacpd before him".
Complaint 6

"If as I suspect this is merely the same information then Mr Wright is
well aware that this has been available for many months. Clearly it
cannot be ’new’ or ’additional’ to that considered bv Tavlor. Under these
circumstances his actions constitute a deliberate attempt to mislead - an
offence under the discipline code or worse".
Comment
Together these complaints give most   cause for concern although they are by
their very nature speculative since   Mr Hicks does not have evidence either
way. However in the opinion of the    Authority’s Solicitor the Chief
Constable’s statement to members is   a complete vindication of the
propriety of the comments contained   in the newspaper article.
Complaint 5
"If as Mr Wright claims this material relates to drink and presumably it
is additional to that contained in the summary document produced bv
Professor Usher for Justice Tavlor (the one withdrawn from circulation)
and to the postmortem reports - in which case we will be asking our
lawyers to obtain details of it and to establish whv this was withheld
from us".
Comment
This is not a complaint in the meaning of the Act and the Authority can
quite properly resolve not to do any more about it.
Complaint 7
"Mr Wright claims to accept the findings of the Taylor report and even
calls it ’a superb document’. Yet he persists in claiming the primary
conclusion is wrong. That is as clear an example of double standards as
one could ever see and serves to underline questions regarding what his
motives are".
Comment
This allegation is not considered to be a cotopla-int within the meaning of
the Act.
-4 -



4      The "Complaints" bv Mr Phillip Hammond
       Complaint 1
       "In making his pronouncements immediately after announcing his retirement
       Mr Wrioht abused his privileged position bv inferring to the media that he
       had ’confidential* information that would come to light in the inquest
       and that this was derogatory to those who lost their lives".
       Complaint 2
       "He similarly inferred that Lord Justice Tavlor was not aware of all of
       the facts and ’that there is a lot of information that has not vet come
       out’. He has therefore by his own admission failed to do his job".
       Comment
       In all the media reports that have been considered there has been no      4
       suggestion by the Chief Constable that information that is yet to come to
       light and/or is additional to the evidence presented to the inquiry was
       derogatory to those who died in the disaster. There is no evidence
       therefore that any disciplinary offence has been committed with regard to
       the first complaint and it will be quite proper for the Authority not to
       pursue this particular complaint. The second complaint is foresquare with
       the fourth complaint made by Mr Hicks.
5      The "Complaints" by Mr B W Devonside
       Complaint 1
       The distressing innuendo insinuation and veiled hints that additional
       evidence, not revealed to Lord Justice Tavlor. will show alcohol played a
       ma.ior part in the tragedy. The post mortem reports do show that some of
       the deceased had been drinking: so what? It is not in a free society, an
       offence to consume alcohol, and if police officers were vigilant and_ _ _ _
       suspected alcohol-related offences outside the ground then no doubt greatj
       play would have been made of those arrest figures. In mv view Mr Wright 1
       is trying to fabricate a smoke-screen after the event to protect his_ _ _ _
       officers, and mavbe even his own reputation.
       Complaint 2
       An apparent attempt to influence either public opinion or the minds of
       potential iurors bv making sweeping statements in and out of the press. I
       don’t know how the sub iudice rule applies, but the lawyers in Liverpool
       have advised us strongly not to allow ourelves to be exerting any
       persuasive influence. Surely the same applies to Mr Wright?
       Comment
       These complaints come within the ambit of the complaints made by Mr Hicks
       and Mr Hammond and should be dealt with accordingly.




                     I
6     Recommendations
6.1   That members give consideration to whether the allegations made by Mr
      Hicks, Mr Hammond and Mr Devonside should be investigated as complaints
      under the provisions of PACE.
6.2   If any are to be investigated then
      (a)   those complaints be referred to the Police Complaints Authority to
            supervise the investigation; and
      (b)   that the Chief Constable of West Midlands be appointed as he has in
            all other complaints arising out of the Hillsborough disaster to
            investigate these complaints subject always to the approval of the
            Police Complaints Authority.

   fao:- K.C.Johnston- Clerk & Financial Officer.                7th February 1990


   Dear Mr. Johnston,

   re: Chief Constable Mr. Peter Wright.

   I wish to file a complaint against Mr. Wright.
   I would ask you to cause this to be recorded and, in view of his
   ^forthcoming "retirement", request urgent attention to its resolution.

   Despite "setting aside" the national press on the basis that   they are
   reporting second hand, I consider his actions and comments during the
   interview with the "Sheffield Star" of the 5th instant to be at best a
   breach of his privileged position and at worst a deliberate attempt to
   divert the cause of justice.

   As some comments can be considered as being actions designed to influence
   the outcome of the Coroners      Inquest,  I have copied this letter to
   Dr.Popper at the Medico-Legal Centre for his attention.

   Similarily, a copy will be forwarded to the West Midlands Police
   Investigation Team and because of Mr.Wrights rank, The Police Complaints
   Authority.

   My specific complaints are as follows:-

        1) Mr.  Wright is guilty of abuse of the privilege of his position          in
        suggesting to the media he was aware that  information would come           to
        light in the Inquest,that would present "a different picture".

        He infers this relates to drink and or its effects.
        Assuming Mr.Wright has seen such "evidence" it is"confidential" until
        deemed otherwise by H.M.Coroner and should remain that way. Clearly a
        breach of priviledge.

        2)By suggesting that this     "puts a different complexion on the end
        product" he prejudges the verdict of the Coroner.    This is clearly
        outside his authority and insults the juristiction of the coroner's
        office.
        3)1 believe that his pronouncements could prejudice Inquest Jurors,
        who will of course be drawn from the area covered by the newpaper
        cited.
   4)He goes on to infer that Lord Justice Taylor was not aware of all of
   the facts and "that there is a lot of information that has not yet
   come out." He has therefore, by his own admission, failed to do his
   job. If he is aware of information that   is material to Lord Justice
   Taylor's conclusions he should have ensured it was placed before him.

   5)If,  as Mr.Wright   claims,   this material relates to drink then
   presumably it is additional to that contained in the summary document
   produced by Professor Usher   for Justice Taylor ( the one withdrawn
   from circulation) and to the post mortem reports,- in which case we
   shall be asking our   lawyers to obtain details of it and to establish
   why this was with-held from us.

   6)If,  as I suspect,    this is merely the same information, then
   Mr.Wright  is well aware that this has been available for many
   months.Clearly it cannot be "new" or "additional"to that considered by
   Taylor.
   Under these circumstances his actions constitute a deliberate attempt
   to mislead- an offence under the discipline code or worse.

   7 )Mr.Wright claims to accept the findings of The Taylor Report, anc^^
   even calls it "a superb document".
   Yet he persists in claiming the primary conclusion is wrong. That is
   as clear an example of "double standards" as one could ever see and
   serves to underline questions regarding what his motives are.


It is my complaint     that  in making these claims now and publicly Mr.
Wright has committed a disgraceful act.  That this act is quite clearly
not what  should be expected from a Chief Officer, that it could effect
the Inquest's impartiality and finally it appears to be a blatant attempt
to distort the course of justice.

As stated earlier,in view of Mr. Wrights rank and the time cycles
involved I have forwarded a copy of this letter (and the article) to
Captain Taylor at The Police Complaints Authority for their immediate
attention and action.

I appreciate that the normal protocols will need to be observed but
suggest that the 1st May deadline leaves little time for delay.    ^

                            Yours Faithfully,




                              Trevor Hicks.

Dear Mr. Johnston,

re: Chief Constable Mr. Peter Wright.

I am the father of Philip Hammond who died in the Hillsborough
Tragedy and have taken a close interest in actions surrounding
the investigation of that day.

I wish to file a complaint against Mr. Wright and would ask the
authority to cause this to be recorded and arrangements made to
investigate it quickly,    especially in view of his forthcoming
retirement.

My complaint is twofold:-

     1)In making his pronouncements  immediately after announcing
     his retirement Mr. Wright abused his privileged position by
     inferring to the media he had     "confidential" information
     that would come to light in the Inquest, and that this was
     derogatory to those who lost their lives.

     2)He similarily inferred that Lord Justice Taylor was not
     aware of all of the facts and        "that there is a lot of
     information that has not yet come out." He has therefore by
     his own admission failed to do his job.

It is my belief that these disgraceful acts could effect the
Inquest's impartiality and was a deliberate attempt to distort
the course of justice.      Quite clearly not what should be the
actions of a Chief Officer.
In view of Mr. Wrights rank and the time cycle involved I would
advise that  I have forwarded a copy of this letter to the Police
Complaints Authority for their attention and action.

                        Yours Faithfully,



                            Philip Hammond.

    Dear Sir

    I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about
    comments made by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
    Mr Peter Wright, both stated orally and published in
    particular, in ’The Star' on 5 February 1990 and ’The Guardian'
    6 February 1990. My complaint relates to the following:

    1. The distressing innuendo insinuation and veiled hints that
    additional evidence, not revealed to Lord Justice Taylor, will
    show alcohol played a major part in the tragedy. The post
    mortem reports do show that some of the deceased had been
    drinking; so what? It is not in a free society, an offence to
    consume alcohol, and if police officers were vigilant and
    suspected alcohol-related offences outside the ground then no
    doubt great play would have been made of those arrest figures.
    In my view Mr Wright is trying to fabricate a smoke-screen
    after the event to protect his officers, and maybe even his own
    reputation.

    2. An apparent attempt to influence either public opinion or
    the minds of potential jurors by making sweeping statements in
    and out of the press. I d o n ’t know how the sub judice rule
    applies, but the lawyers in Liverpool have advised us strongly
    not to allow ourselves to be exerting any persuasive influence.
    Surely the same applies to Mr Wright?

    hy concern is the misuse of privileged information, or of
    positions of power and authority, such as to devalue our trust
    and faith in the judicial system.

    I look forward to hearing from you.

    Yours sincerely

COMPLAINTS BY TREVOR HICKS AND PHILLIP HAMMOND

I refer to your letter of 20 February and the enclosed letters of complaint by
Trevor Hicks and Phillip Hammond.  I think it would be appropriate if the
Authority had some comment from me to consider when deciding how this
complaint should be pursued.

To put the complaints in context following the announcement of my retirement I
gave a personal interview to reporters from 'The Star' and 'The Times'.   I
agree that the direct quotes contained in the articles are a fair reflection
of the comments I made but not necessarily in the order in which I made them.
I accept no responsibility for articles that appeared in other newspapers.

I will now comment on the specific complaints raised by Mr Hicks which also
subsume the general complaints made by Mr Hammond.

        1.      Mr Wright is guilty of abuse of the privilege of his position in
                suggesting to the media he was aware that information would come to
                light in the Inquest, that would present "a different picture".

                He infers   this relates to drink and/or its effects.  Assuming_______
                Mr Wright   has seen such "evidence" it is "confidential" until deemed
                otherwise   by HM Coroner and should remain that way.  Clearly a
                breach of   privilege.

       Anyone with knowledge of the Hillsborough Inquiry will be aware that
       evidence not heard at the Inquiry will emerge at the Inquest.  The cause
       of the barrier collapse in pen three and the specific place where deaths
       occurred are obvious instances of evidence not yet revealed.
       Furthermore, the West Midlands enquiry on behalf of the Director of
       Public Prosecutions and HM Coroner has continued since Lord Justice
       Taylor's Inquiry concluded on 29 June 1989.  This enquiry is still on­
       going and may also produce fresh evidence.  I have not inferred that the
       fresh evidence relates to drink and would make it clear I have no
       knowledge of what specific evidence will emerge.
                                          - 2 -                      28 February 1990
R C Johnston Esq BA IPFA


     To say as I did that this additional evidence "may put a different
     complexion on the end product" was a proper comment and not a breach of
     privilege, whatever that may mean.


     2.          Bv suggesting that this "puts a different complexion on the end
                 product" he prejudges the verdict of the Coroner.  This is clearly
                 outside his authority and insults the jurisdiction of the Coroner s
                 office.

     In support of his complaint, Mr Hicks uses a selective quotation which
     leaves out the qualifying words included in the article.  Given
     additional evidence will be produced and having regard to my role as
     spokesman for the South Yorkshire Police, I see nothing wrong in
     expressing the belief that this additional evidence may put a different
     complexion on the end p r oduct.


     3   .       i believe that his pronouncements could prejudice Inquest jurors^
                 who will of course be drawn from the' area covered by the newspaper
                 cited.

     The allegation that my comments could prejudice potential jurors again
     has no basis when reflected against what I said during the interviews.
     Having regard to all the publicity given to Lord Justice Taylor s
     Inquiry, all that has been said by many people publicly during and since
     the Inquiry and specifically the recent ’First Tuesday' programme, the
     suggestion that my statement could prejudice jurors is quite simply
     nonsense.


      A.         He a ™ * nn to infer that Lord Justice Taylor was not aware of all,_of
                 the facts and "that there is a lot of information that has not ye^
                 come out".   He has therefore, by his own admission, failed to do ^.is
                 iob.   If he is aware of information that is m aterial to Lord Justice
                 Taylor's conclusions he should have ensured it was placed before
                 him.

      All the evidence in the possession of the South Yorkshire Police has been
      handed to the West Midlands enquiry and this includes information coming
      to notice since the conclusion of Lord Justice Taylor s Hearing.    e
      information not presented to the Hillsborough Inquiry and the basis for
      my comments is indicated in my response at 1. and I cannot add to it.



         5   .    if. as Mr Wright claims, this material relates to drink then
                  nresumablv it is additional to that contained in the summa_ry
                  document produced by Professor Usher for Justice Taylor (the pne
                  w i thdrawn from circulation) and to the post mortem reports -_^n
                  which case we shall be asking our lawyers to obtain details of it
                  and to establish why this was withheld from us.

          I have not claimed that the material related to drink.

     6.   If, as I suspect, this is merely the same information, then Mr
          Wright is well aware that this has been available for many months.
          Clearly it cannot be "new" or "additional" to that considered by
          Taylor.

          Under these circumstances his actions constitute a deliberate
          attempt to mislead - an offence under the discipline code or worse.

     I can only refer to my comments above in relation to new or additional
     evidence.   Solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police have sought
     information on the matters outlined at 1. from the West Midlands Police
     but on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions and
     H M Coroner they have declined to release it.


     7.   Mr Wright claims to accept the findings of the Taylor Report, and
          even calls it "a superb document".

          Yet he persists in claiming the primary conclusion is wrong.  That
          is as clear an example of "double standards" as one could ever see
          and serves to underline questions regarding what his motives a r e .

     I have from the outset made it clear that I accept the findings of Lord
     Justice Taylor and as Chief Constable I have ensured that all his
     recommendations have been pursued vigorously and with expedition.   I have
     also said that I consider his Final Report to be a superb document that
     addresses all the ills of football.  If the recommendations of the Report
     are implemented they will go a long way to ridding the sport of the
     problems that have attended it over the past decade.

     There is nothing inconsistent in accepting the conclusions of judicial
     proceedings without necessarily being in agreement with all the views
     expressed or the weight given to the various factors involved.  For
     instance, the South Yorkshire Police accepting the criticisms contained
     in Lord Justice Taylor's Report agreed to settle compensation claims.
     Other parties involved who were also criticised declined to do so.

     My motives, which Mr Hicks calls into question, are quite
     straightforward.  They are to ensure that all available evidence is
     forthcoming for those investigating the events at Hillsborough whether or
     not it is critical of police action.  It remains a fact that all the
     evidence has not as yet been publicly presented.   It may be that when it
     is the conclusions already arrived at will be unaffected.   On the other
     hand it may present a different picture of the causal factors that
     resulted in the terrible tragedy at Hillsboro'ugh.


The only matter in Mr Hammond's letter not covered above is the rather
astonishing claim that my comments were derogatory to those who lost their
lives.  I am unable to account for how he came to that conclusion.

The interview I gave to 'The Star' immediately followed that given to 'The
Times'.  I think members should also see the printed account of that
interview, a copy of which I enclose.

I have carefully read my comments as reported in both newspapers and being as
objective as one is able I cannot find any comment or even sentiment on which
a disciplinary charge could be based.

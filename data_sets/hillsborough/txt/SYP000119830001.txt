                I have        17    1/2    years          service        and    between              1974-1977          and       from       1983       to

                the     present          date       have    had     reason          to    attend          numerous           football          matches

                both     League          and    FA    Cup    Semi        Finals          at    the       Hillsborough              Ground          and

                have     on m o s t       of    these       occasions           performed                duties        in    Lappings          Lane

                area.

               On     the     morning          of    15 A p r i l      1989     1    reported             for     duty       at    8»30am          at

                designated           duties          of    this     serial          was       to    man    the      barriers            at    the       road

                junctions           in L e p p i n g s      Lane.

                After        arrival       at       Hillsborough           we       were       briefed           and    took       meal       and       then

               made      our       way    to    Leppings          Lane,        where          together           with       PC    1620       Patterson

                I was        detailed          to    man    the     barrier          at       the     junction          with       Farndale

               Road.         We     arrived          at    our    point        at    about          11.30antfat             this       time    there

               were      a    few    Liverpool             supporters           in       the       are|                     whom       appeared          in a

                relatively           sober          but    joyful        mood.           Our       m a x ft dCfTl           at    this       t ime      were

                checking           vehicles          wishing        to    park       in F a r n d a l e , a            number          of    these

                being        stewards          vehicles          who     had    been          told       they     were       allowed          to     park

                in    the     side       streets.

               As     midday        approached             the    dumber        of       fans       in    t he    area       increased             many

                seeking        directions             to    public        houses          by       name,     Working             li& n5> C A u y -/

n a m e , many       of    which       we     were    unaware                of     the      location           of.

Between        midday       and       1 pm    the    number             of         f a n s in t h e     area       began       to

increase        many       of    these        were    in       possession                    of a l c o h o l      in v a r i o u s

forms,     ie       cans,       bottles        of    wine,          bottles             of       spirits.            They      gathered

in    small     groups          near    the     garage          and          on    garden          walls        drinking            and

shouting        football             chants.         Constant                complaints             were        received            from    the

resident        of

that    drunken           youths       were     walking             into          the     passageway               at    the    rear       of

her    h o u s e , and      urinating           and       t h ro w i ng           cans       into       her     garden.             PC

Patterson           and    myself       had     cause          to       speak        to      a    number        of      youths       about

this    matter.

From    1 pm    onwards          the    volume        of       fans          arriving             increased,             a    large

number     of       these       fans    were        carrying            4     packs          of    beer/lager,                although          it

was    obvious        that       many        were    drunk.

The    general        mood       of    the     fans       at    this               time was         good        they were           singing

and    shouting.

During     this       time       there        were    a    large             number          of    individuals                walking

back    and     forth       along       Leppings           Lane         approaching                   people         and      asking       for

"spare*        tickets.              Occasional           shouts             by    someone            in    the      crowd      that       they

had    tickets        caused          pandemonium              with          people          running          about          seeking       this

p erson.

From    about        1 .45pm         onwards        there       were          large          numbers          of     fans      being

escorted        by    Mounted          police        officers                and     mobile           dog     patrols,          many       of

these     fans       were       in    possession           of       4    packs.

The    fans     that       have       been     sat    about             drinking             in    the      street           have    moved

off    towards        the       ground        leaving          the       streets,                walls      and      gardens

littered        with       empty       bottles        and       cans.

By    about     2.30pm          the    streets        are       relatively                   quiet         with      only      small

numbers        of    fans       passing        us.        At    about             2 . 4 5 pm      the      street        is    suddenly

packed     with       a    large       number        of    supporters                   being         escorted           by Mou nt ed

officers,             many    of    the       supporters             are       in       possession                 of    4    packs          of

beer/lager             and    are       obviously             the    worse          for       drink,              singing          and       shouting

At    2,55pm          things       begin       to       quieten          down       and       I left             PC     1620       on    the

barrier          to    go    to    C l a y w h e e 1s La ne          for       meal.              As    I approach                 the

building          a    large       number          of    officers             come       running             out        and       into

Transits          and       depart.           I am       informed             by    Traffic             officers              in C l a y w h e e 1 s

that      there        is    some       trouble          at    the       Leppings             Lane          e nd .

I was       told       by    an    Inspector             to    return          to       my    point.

1    rejoined          PC    1620       at    the       junction          of       Farndale             Road          and     it    was       whilst

here       that       we    were     informed            by a       resident             that          there          was     some       trouble

in    the       ground       in    the       cage       at    the    Leppings                Lane       end        and       that       the       fV

where       the       lady    had       obtained             the    information                   was       saying           that       there

were       people          dead.        Neither          PC    Patterson                or    myself              were       in    posession

of    a    radio       so    we    were       unable          to    seek       instructions.

At    about       this       time       people          starting          walking             along          Leppings              Lane       from

the       ground,          some    we    could          see    were       limping             or       appeared              to    have       other

minor       injuries,             many       were       crying          and    obviously                distressed.                     We

offered          assistance             to    some       of    the       injured             but       it     was       refused.              Some

of    the       fans       passing       shouted             obscenities                at    myself              and      other        officers

in    the       area.

Many       people          approached          us       asking          for    directions                   to     phone          boxes,          b ut

by    arrangement             with       some       of       the    residents                in F a r n d a l e            Road     the       tans

requesting             a    phone       were       allowed          to    make          use       of    the        private          phone          of

these       residents,             many       of    whom       it       must       be    said          offered             and     gave       far

more       than       just    the       use    of       the    phone.

After       a    time       the    number          of    fans       increased                as    did        the       obscenities                and

threats          to    any    Police          officer          in       the    area.              Due       to     our       not    being

aware       what       was    happening             we       decided          the       best       course             of     action,          there

not       being       any    s u p e r v i s o r y ,r a n k        in    the       area,          was       to       remain        where          we

were       in    the       event     anything            happened.                 Eventually                 4    dog       vans arrived

  in   the        area          and    parked          up   on     the       forecourt             of    the       garage       opposite,

  it   was        at       about       this       time       that       a    lone       Special          Constable             IN P O S S E S S I O N

 OF    RADIO           came       along          Leppings          Lane       from       the       junction             with    Herries          Road

 on    the        opposite             side       of    the       road,       at       this    time          the    street          was    packed

  solid       with          Liverpool             supporters,                these       supporters                were       venting       their

 anger        on       any       Police          officer          they       saw,       including             this       Special?          who

  instead             of    keeping          his       mouth       shut       and       getting          out       of    the    way       walked

  in a m o n g         the       supporters             and       was       replying          to    what          was    being       said    to

 him.         I felt             that       there       was       every       danger          that       due       to    this       Special's

 action           a    serious          violent             incident          could       have          developed            and     would

  have,       were          it    not       for    the       presence             of    the    dog       vans.           Whilst       this

  crowd       was          passing          I got       the       impression             from       their          actions          that    there

 was     a    strong             likelihood             that       trouble             would       develop          and       that    myself

 and     other             officers,             being       greatly          outnumbered,                   would       have       been

  seriously                assaulted             but    luckily             for    us    they       passed          without          incident.

 After        the          fans       had    passed          by    we       located       a    sergeant             and       after

  attending                at    the    Leppings            Lane        gate,          finding          no    one       there,       we

  ventured             to       Claywheels             Lane       to    await          instructions.                    We    were

  eventually                transported                back       to    Doncaster             at    about          7pm.

  In   conclusion                 I would          like       to       say    that       I have          in m y         service       performed

  duty       at       numerous          events          involving             large       crowds             but    on       this    occasion

  there       seemed             to    be    a    greater          volume          of    alcohol             in    evidence          on    this

  occasion             than       in    the       past.                                                 _______________

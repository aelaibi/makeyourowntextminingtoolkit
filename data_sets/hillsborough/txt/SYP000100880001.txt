             for    duty       at    Hillsborough                   regarding          the       FA    Cup       semi-final                between

            Liverpool             and     Nottingham                Forrest.

             I was      in     serial          27       and    in    charge       of       the    serial          was       Ps       lioeley      A

            Division-Our                 duty       was       to    man    the    barriers             on       Leppings             Lane       with       the

             side      roads,        a    duty          always       given       to    A    division             on    any          football          match

            at     Hillsborough                and       I would          say    that       the       majority             of       officers          in

             serial       27      had     done          this       duty    many       times       before.

            We     arrived          and       briefed          at    Hillsborough                at    10am       (1000)             and    were       on       our

             points       by      1045am        <ip45).I             was       detailed          the       junction             of    Leppings             Lane

            junction           with       Fielding             Road       in    company          with       a    probationer                Pc    598

            Stubbings.I              have       17 y e a r          service       in       the    South          Yorkshire             Police.

            On     this      day     supporters                were       arriving          early          around          11.30am          (1130)          and

            from       this       point        on       it    steadily          grew       to    around          2.30pm             (1430)       when

            Leppings           Lane       was       a    flood       with       supporters.                The    fans          who    arrived             early

            were       in a       very        jovial          mood    and       the    atmosplTere               was       good       there       was       a

            good       rapport           between             these    fans       and       us.    However             as    the       kick       off       time

            approached              the       atmosphere             was       more    tense.There                were          a    lot, o f     fans

            walking          up     and       down      Leppings           Lane       begging          for       spare          tickets.Fans

            were       walking           to    the       ground       carrying             cans       of    beer,bottles                   of    cider          etc.

and    the       vast       majority            who       were          arriving                at    around          2.30          pm       (1430)

and    after          had     consumed              large          quantities                   of    alcohol.                 I    was       being

asked       by       fans     if       they     could             walk       down       Fielding                Road          to    an       alley       to

urinate,             this     was       of    course              declined.                 I    could          see       fans          climbing

over       the       fencing           at    t he    entrance                to    Leppings                Lane       and          in    my    opinion

these       were       t he       'mob'       element.

I    did    not       get     involved              in    the          incident             in       the    ground             and       I    did       not

see    any       stewards.

I did       not       receive           any     radio             transmissions                      because          none          of       the

Police          Constables              in    my     eyesight                had       personal             radios,                however

whilst          at    the     junction,              two          special          constables                   walked             past       us    and

both       had       radio's.               Myself        and          Pc    Stubbings                only       received

information             about           the    disaster                 by    residents                   who    were          watching             a TV

and    coming          o ut       to    tell        us.           As    fans       were          leaving             we       were       being          met

with       the       full     verbal          abuse.               I    was       in    fear          that       if       a    fan       or    Police

Officer          attempted              to    arrest              or    go    over          the       top       it    would             have

errupted             into     a    full       scale           battle          outside                the    ground.                 I    have       never

been       in    a    situation              where        I       was       verbally             abused          with          every          swear

word       ever       invented,              I was        threatened                   with          assault          and          spat       at    and

in    all       this    I     could          not     do       a    thing,          I    had          no    radio          to       call

assistance             or     inform          control              of       the    events             outside             t he      ground          after

the    disaster.                  In    fact        myself             and    Pc       Stubbings                were          called          to    a

house       where       a fan           had    used           the       phone          to       phone       home          and       then

collapsed             into        an    epileptic                 f it,      this       fan          was    eventually                   conveyed

to    hospital          by        ambulance              that          we    sent       for.

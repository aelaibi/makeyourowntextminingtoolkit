TAYLOR REPORT

I am sorry to be late responding to your note of the 26 June;
C4 would wish to be present at the briefing meeting with Lord
Ferrers on 10 July.

2.   We have the following comments on the offences and
penalties section of your draft submission, circulated on the
22 June:

     (a) Ticket Touting: The pressure to make ticket touting
     generally unlawful is increasing (you may have read
     references to .allegations of Mafia infiltration at
     Wimbledon!); any Government announcement on ticket
     touting at football grounds will further reinforce this
     demand.  Our present stance is based on the intrinsic
     differences between football (with its potential for
     violence and need for segregation) and other activities.
     However we have also maintained that there are measures
     promoters can take the (Ryder Cup Scheme) which can
     adequately address the problem. There may well therefore
     be some voices asking why the police and not the clubs
     should assume the burden of ticketing security.

     (b) Missile throwing: It will be necessary to exclude
     innocuous missile throwing (para 13 of the draft
     submission) since the football itself is frequently
     thrown from the crowd back onto the pitch in the course
     of the game.  I think a missile is anything thrown (ie
     including fruit whether soft or hard).

    (c) Obscene and racial chanting: The enforcement
    difficulties will be immense, but a rejection of Taylor's
    recommendations will send undesirable signals of what the
    Government considers the priorities.

    (d) Encroachment on the pitch: We presume that the main
    mischief arising from pitch encroachment is the inter-
       mingling of rival fans this permits thus defeating
       segregation. This seems an important practical point
       we fully agree with Miss Edward's concern that ACPOs
       curious rejection of the "reasonable excuse" must be
       resisted.

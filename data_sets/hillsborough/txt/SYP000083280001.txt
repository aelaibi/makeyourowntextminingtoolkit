             I arn a single man living at the above address with my parents.
                                                                                 s'

             when he married                            on

             Nicholas was a very keen Liverpool                   football   supporter and went to

             the FA Cup Semi-Final         on Saturday 15th April             1989 (150489)   at

             Hillsborough,        Sheffield,   between Liverpool and Nottingham

             Forest.     He travelled to the mat ch                    mini-bus w ith about

             thirteen of his friends,          including                          of

                                       Li ve r poo 1.

             On Saturday 15th April          1989    (1504-89),        I went to work and at about

             3.00pm    (1500)     I turned on the        radio to listen to the match and

              listened as the tragedy in the Leppings Ln end of the ground unfolded,
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  S2754

I returned home from work at approximately 5.45pm                 (1745) and again

became aware of what had happened when I switched on the

television.          At approximately 6.40pm      (1840)                     tele phoned

me and told me that Nicholas was missing,             but         thought I-yg' would I

alright because he was with a friend of theirs named                            who had

lived in Sheffield and knew the area.              I told him to keep me informed

of what was happening and he telephoned me a further three times to

say that Nicholas was still missing and that he had checked the

hospitals and still there was no trace of Nicholas.                  The fourth time

he telephcmed was at approximately S.30pm             (2030) and at that time he

asked me how to spell N i c h o l a s ’ surname which made me very worried.

Soon after the phone call          I went round to                  parents house at

                                              and told her what was happening,

                 mother telephoned N i c h o l a s ’ parents and they too came to the

house.     We continually tried to get through on the emergency telephone

number,    but we could get no news.          We then decided that we should go

to Sheffield to try and find out what had happened to Nicholas

                 father, Pat and Peter J O Y N E S , Nicholas'   mother and father

and I left for Sheffield at approximately 9.55pm                 (2155).

We arrived in Sheffield at approximately midnight                 (0000) and checked

at the Northern General Hospital,            but there was no trace of Nicholas,

I lost track of the time but I believe             it was about     1.00am    (0100)

when we went to Hillsborough Football Stadium.               I saw

there who told me that Nicholas had died,         I then told     and
                                     H22.IO
N i c h o l a s ’ mother and father. Pat then went in and identified t/fe body

of Nicholas to the Police.            I did not want to see the body.           Before

we left Sheffield we telephoned                    and told her that Nicholas

was dead.

                    also told me that the friend he had mentioned earlier,

    ADJOURNMENT DEBATE - THE FUTURE OF FOOTBALL, FRIDAY 8 MAY 1992

    1. Following this morning's meeting and subsequent advice from
    PS/Secretary of State I attach a revised version of the speech.
    Apart from a few corrections to the punctuation the main change
    is to the all-seating paragraph on page 4 which strengthens our
    position as you requested and the deletion at the bottom of page
    4 of the sentences which were implicitly critical of the failure
    of the Premier League clubs to re-distribute any of their new
    found wealth to other clubs, as the FA had proposed should happen
    in their earlier Blueprint.
    2.  I also attach a copy of Chapter 12 of the Green Guide which
    sets out the advice on temporary stands. I have highlighted para.
    190 which covers inter alia temporary tubular stands. This makes
    clear that they should be capable of withstanding any load or
    force to which they may be subjected. It is a responsibility of
    the local authorities in issuing safety certificates to ensure
    that this guidance is properly applied.

    3.   You also asked what FIFA and UEFA stood for. I can confirm
    that the former stands for Federation Internationale De Football
    Association and the latter stands for Union of European Football
    Associations.

 1 9 0 .All temporary stands should be capable of withstanding any load or force to which thev mav be
 subjected and account should be taken of any external factors such as wind forces F a S r ^ o f any one
 support member or connection should not render the structure unstable, cause local, or give r L to
 progressive, collapse. As far as practicable the area around supporting frames should be secure to
 prevent unauthorised access, and frames should be so designed that they are firmly locked into
 position and cannot be tampered with by unauthorised persons.

 1 9 1 .Consultation with the local authority and building authority (if different) should take place at an
 early stage prior to the erection of any temporary stand. Consultation should also take place with the
 fire authority about access for fire-fighting purposes.


 Siting
 1 9 2 . Choice of location may be limited but factors which need to be considered include- load-bearina
capability of th e g ro u n d , its s lo p e or u n e v e n n e ss , drain age, availability of m ains services
access/egress for spectators and for emergency vehicles, overhead power lines, and the proximity of
surrounding building. ,n relation to the risk of fire. The condition of the site should K
checked to ensure its load-bearing capabilities have not deteriorated; settlement of ground may
cause instability and so require repacking and relevelling. The site should be prepared and main
tamed so as to provide an even surface for those parts to which the public have access. In order to be
accessible for the disabled the ground surface should be such as to ensure their mobility at all times.


Assembly/Dismantling
n f J J c 6 asse.m b|y ^ nd dismantling of stands should be carried out by or under the supervision of
persons experienced and trained in the proper performance of such work, in accordance with the
manufacturers instructions whenever available, or in accordance with drawings and specifications
prepared by a competent engineer.                                                     u s^ in ta n o n s

1 9 4 .Work should be carried out only where lighting is sufficient to allow it to be safely and properly
performed and checked. No assembly or dismantling work should be carried out to the danger of
members of the public in the vicinity.                                                         uanger o t

          The work should be carried out in a proper manner, using correct parts, and tools of a proper
    size and design. Care should be taken with the handling of c o m p o n en ts to avoid dam ag e or
    distortion.

    1 9 6 .All components should be closely examined during assembly and dismantling for signs of wear,
    deformation or other damage, and where necessary replaced by sound components of matching
    material, properties and dimensions. Temporary repairs using makeshift com ponents should be
    avoided.

    1 9 7 .Care should also be taken to ensure all components are correctly aligned; they should not be
    bent, distorted or otherwise altered to force a fit.

    1 9 8 .On completion, assembly work should be checked with particular attention given to fastenings
    and connections.


    Tents/marquees and other such structures.
    1 9 9 .These types of structures can present special fire safety problems and guidance is contained in
    th e Home Office/Scottish Office publication "Guide to Fire Precautions in Existing Places of
    Entertainment and Like Premises" (ISBN 0 11 340907 0 £8.50).

    2 0 0 .Tents should be capable of withstanding all forces to which they may be subjected, particularly
    wind (including uplift so caused) and those caused by the build up of snow or heavy rain. Emergency
    arrangements should be made for the dismantling, either partial or total, of a tent should abnormal
    conditions arise that could lead to any collapse or distortion. Where such work in any way affects the
    stability of the tent or the safety of members of the public, the work should not commence until the
    immediate area has been cleared of all but essential staff.

    2 0 1 .Supporting poles or structures, guy ropes and stays should be used as necessary, correctly
    formed and secure anchorages made to ensure that the tent is stable and maintains its correct shape.

    2 0 2 .The stability of the main tent poles and supporting structure should be independent of the
    sheeting fabric, ie any tearing or defect occurring in the fabric should not result in the collapse of all
    or any part of the main structure.

    2 0 3 .Particular attention should be paid to the main supporting poles or structures and top braces of
    large tents where they have to be raised to a considerable height. Damage or distortion to these
    members could considerably weaken the structure. Where such damage does occur, the members
    should be replaced or repairs or modifications carried out so as to bring them up to full working
    strength.

    2 0 4 .Where solid frames or units, eg doors, are linked to a tent structure they should be rigidly
    formed and adequately braced, and care should be taken that they do not overstress local areas of
    the tent.

    2 0 5 .Foundations to poles or frames should be properly prepared and subjected to regular checks as
    should wire bracing or guys, the tension of which should be re-adjusted as necessary.

ADJOURNMENT DEBATE ON FUTURE OF FOOTBALL
DRAFT SPEECH


I am grateful         to the Hon Member for Vauxhall                      for raising this
very important question of the future of football. I welcome this
opportunity      to     pay      tribute    to    what    is   being      achieved       by    the
football     authorities          and clubs alike          in modernising             facilities
and    in   improving       standards       of    behaviour     both       on    and    off    the
pitch,       and      to    set     out    the     Government's           position       on    the
direction football might take in the future. I should make clear
that I am primarily speaking about the position in England.


However, before I deal with the specific issues raised by the Hon
Member for Vauxhall              I would first of all like to say a little
about the place of sport and its priority in the new Department
of National        Heritage.       The Government          remains        committed to the
well     being     of      sport    in     this    country.         The     improvement         of
facilities for participants and for spectators, the provision of
opportunities         for all those who wish to take part in sport and
the    achievement         of higher       standards      of performance          remain key
objectives       and have        a high priority on the agenda for the new
Department.      In fact sports provision will be enhanced by giving
it a direct voice within the Cabinet. I am sure that I need not
remind you that both my Rt Hon and Learned Friend the member for
Putney and myself are committed sports supporters, not to mention
that other well known sports enthusiast,                        the Prime Minister.              I
was    delighted      to    learn that       the    Sports     Council,         which    is the
premier voice for sport in England, has welcomed the decision to
transfer        sport       to     the     new    Department        which        it     sees    as
strengthening sport's role and raising its profile.


In    looking    at the       sports      role of the new Department,                   we have
decided     that      it    would    be    appropriate         to   bring       together       its
general     sports      responsibilities           including        for    the    comfort       of
spectators       at     sports     events    with        the   responsibility           for    the
safety of those spectators which has hitherto been exercised by
my Rt Hon and Learned Friend the Home Secretary. It has therefore
been agreed that this Department should be responsible for all
                                                             1
safety       of    sports        ground       matters        including       the    Government's
policy on all seating at football grounds.                              I would make clear,
however,      that my Rt Hon Friend the member for Galloway and Upper
Nithsdale retains overall responsibility for sport and safety of
sports ground matters in Scotland.


Turning       to    more        specific         football      issues     I    would       like      to
congratulate the Hon Member for Vauxhall for the timing of this
debate following Tuesday's announcement that England is to host
the 1996 European Championships.                          It has been a long time since
1966 when we last hosted an international football tournament and
this     success         bodes       well    for     the    future.     It    reflects         UEFA's
confidence in the quality of our stadia, the improved behaviour
of     our   spectators          and       our     ability    to    organise        a    successful
tournament.          I     am     sure       all     Hon     Members     will       join       me     in
congratulating            the    FA     on    this    achievement        following         the      most
professional bid which we supported.


Our clubs were re-admitted to Europe two seasons ago largely on
the strength of this improvement in spectator behaviour.                                       We are
pleased to see this improvement continuing this season,                                        despite
one or two incidents. This improvement has been due to a lot of
hard work not least by the police with the benefit of increasing
use of CCTV and by the clubs through better stewarding and other
measures.         It also reflects a change in attitudes by spectators
the    great       majority       of    whom       were    always   law-abiding           but whose
image was tarnished by a hooligan minority.


We    cannot       afford       to    be     complacent,       however,       and       must    remain
vigilant to ensure that there                        is no regression to the totally
unacceptable hooligan behaviour that in the past so marred not
only our enjoyment of                  football but also the reputation of the
country. That is why we supported the legislation introduced last
year to create three new football related offences which ban the
throwing of missiles,                  chanting indecent and racialist abuse and
going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.
The quality of some of our stadia has been improved immeasurably
as    a    result     of     the     implementation          of    Lord       Justice       Taylor's
recommendations which as Hon Members know cover a wide range of
safety      measures        including       all-seating.           Before      the    tragedy          at
Hillsborough         I know that           a number of clubs were aware of the
imperative          need     to    improve        the    comfort        and    safety          of     the
facilities      on     offer to spectators at their grounds.                              But these
clubs were in a minority and what the Taylor report has done is
to bring home the message to many of the other clubs that their
grounds       were         simply     not        up     to   the    standard          that          their
spectators          were     entitled       to     expect.        The    Taylor       report,          as
endorsed       by     Government       -    the       valuable     work       of    the     Football
Licensing Authority - and the UEFA club competition requirements
of all-seating             for high risk matches              from next         season and for
standing accommodation to be phased out for other matches by the
year 2000 - have all acted as a spur to clubs to introduce the
necessary improvements.


Government           has     played         its       part   in     assisting             in     these
improvements. The special position of football was recognised by
the reduction in Pool Betting Duty from 42^% to 40% for a 5 year
period in the 1990 Budget. This concession will make available to
football,      through the Football Trust,                    around £100m for capital
works for the improvement of comfort and safety at grounds. As a
result the Football Trust has approved grants of some £40m from
the       reduction    in     Pool    Betting         Duty monies         for major projects
ranging       from     £2m    for     Liverpool         towards     the       £8m    cost       of    the
extension of the Kemlyn Road Stand to, for example, some £420,000
to Bradford City for a 1870 seater family stand. Of the stadia
earmarked for the 1996 European Championships the Football Trust
has       already    approved        over    £800,000        for    improvements           at       Aston
Villa and       is currently considering what                      level of grant aid to
give to Manchester United.


I recognise          the     remarkable      achievements          some       clubs   have made,
with the benefit of Football Trust monies,                              in improving safety
and comfort in moving towards implementation of Taylor. But other
clubs    have    made    little     or   no    progress       in    implementing      all­
seating.


I have listened very carefully to the Hon Member's                          views on all
seating       at our football grounds.          We will continue            to listen to
all views on this question which I know from my short time                              at
the new Department raises strong feelings amongst a wide range
of football supporters.           I appreciate that for many standing at
football matches is an integral part of their enjoyment.                            I have
sympathy with the clubs in the lower divisions who are attracting
gates    of    only    several    thousand.     In    looking       at the particular
circumstances of these clubs it may not be realistic to expect
them to       provide the same high standard of facilities as those at
the big       Premier League clubs. It may not make sense                   to close off
sparsely populated terraces at some grounds where safety risks
may be minimal or non existent.                On the other hand clubs in the
top two divisions must maintain the momentum towards providing
the appropriate level of facilities and comfort which spectators
are entitled to expect as we approach the 21st century. Of course
all   clubs     need    to make     their     grounds      safe.    The    recent   tragic
events     in    Corsica     have     reminded        us    of     the    importance    of
providing safe facilities.


I can assure the Hon Member that if,                       following the receipt of
these    views    and    representations,        we     decide     to     relax the    all­
seating requirement, we will make an announcement as a matter of
some urgency.


Quite apart from the drive for stadia improvement, football is of
course moving into what I hope will be an exciting new era with
the setting up of the Premier League at the start of the 1992-93
season. We believe that there should be co-operation between the
Football Association, the Premier League, the Football League and
the PFA in deciding the future development of the game. In all of
this the role of the Football Association as the governing body
of the game needs to be fully respected.
In addition to improving their facilities, clubs are making much
greater efforts to improve their relations with their supporters
and taking their views into account.                          Football in the Community
Schemes      are    thriving          throughout       the    country      and these      are   an
excellent way of bringing clubs, local communities and supporters
closer together.           I applaud the joint initiative by the FA, the
Football League and the PFA which, with financial assistance from
the    Football      Trust,       aims       to   bring      all   clubs    in   the    Football
League       into    the    PFA        administered          national      scheme      aimed    at
providing a programme of community developed in football in every
area of the country. As I have said great progress has been made
in curbing the worse excesses of hooligan behaviour. As a result
more   families are going to football and attendances are set to
rise this       season for the sixth consecutive season.                            All   in all
football faces a bright future.


[Finally,      but not          least       in importance,         we can be proud of our
achievements on the field and the opportunities that lie before
English        football          in     Europe.     Following         England's        excellent
performance in the 1990 World Cup last season Manchester United
won the European Cup Winners Cup. Although we have not been able
to    repeat       that    level       of    European     success     at    club    level      this
season the progress               of our representatives has been sufficient
for us to earn an extra place in the UEFA Cup next season. I send
my    best    wishes       to    Leeds       United,    Manchester United,             Sheffield
Wednesday and to the winners of tomorrow's Cup Final in their
European quests next season. More immediately we can look forward
to England's participation in the European Championship Finals in
Sweden in June.            Graham Taylor's team are approaching the final
stages following a very impressive run of results and I think we
have every reason to be optimistic about the prospects for the
team and I wish them every success.]

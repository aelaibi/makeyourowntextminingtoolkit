At    this       t ime    1 saw S u o e r i n t e n d e n t                  Hurray       running             up a r m     down       tne

changing            direction          as    the     linesman           did.




The      linesman          either          ignored       hi m     or was          not     aware        of    his      presence.




A t t h i s t im e t h e game                wa s    called         off      and     t h e players              and    of f :l.c i al s

At    thi.s t i m e        two    supporters             ran      onto       the     pitch        from       the      Leppings        Lane

end      of    the    ground,          one    ran a c c r o s s         to     the       Not ti ng ha m Forest               e nd    of    the

ground         in f r o nt       of    the    S p i o n Cop,           made       threatening               gestures         towards

that      crowd.           This       man    was     detained           as     he    tried        to    run      back     towards          the

Leppmgs             Lane    end       of    the     ground        by    two       Police         Officers          who    1 c o uld

The      supporters          in       the S o u t h     Stand          started           to    get a n n o y e d       and    I heard

one      snout,       "Get       the       bastards        off      the      p i t c h we        have       come      to w a t c h    90

minute         of    football."              when      I advised             him     he       added,        "Why      don't    you        go

down      t h e re    and    lock          them     up?"

               the video,             located        in the    centre     left of the           picture.


                                                                                                                /-j faoH-
               At this          point      I was      en ga ge d w ith the d e c e a se d Carl D. H E W I T T               CNA44),



               The       body    is at my feet              to my right,         as you     look at the screen.

               S e ve ral       frames      later you         lose sight         of me    but    can see my helmet               lying

               on top of the body.
                                                                                                                  PAGE           2
                                                                                                                  S957B



              I first           came across H E W I T T    lying on the      pitch.       I have e x a m i ne d a

              s ke tc h plan of the           pitch a nd have        indicated,      by means      of a colo ur ed

              spot,    the a p p r o x i m a t e    position,    on the     pitch,     where H E WI T T was        lying.

              I have s igned the             plan    (Ref S J F 1)   (Exh         ).



              I took H EW IT T to the m o r t u a r y and stayed w it h the                  body a c c o m p a n y i n g   it

              to the M edico Legal             Centre.



              I w o ul d just add that              I carried H EW IT T from the          pitch to the mortuary,

             a s s i s t e d by football           fans.   We used a n a l u m in i u m     ladder     to   carry him

              on,   this was          p roduced by one of the fans.

                                                                                     S.J.   F io re-Hi rs t S I G N E D

                 I have today                been s hown a pho t o gr ap hi c                   print     (Ref S F 1 V 4 7)

                 (E x h                    ) w h i c h shows       t h r e e ^ a 1 i cernen a nd a civi li an                 carrying a

                 body over the                 pitch.         The j g ^ t o g r a p h    shows         the   p ol i ce m en from the              rear

                 and their faces                  cannot       be seen.



                 Assuming          the       body to be that of Carl                     D a r r e n HtWI^JT, the             policeman

                 s hown on the front                   right       of the     stretche r j&eurty a ppears                     to be me,

                 although          I cannot          be   certain.
                                                                                                                       P AG E       2
                                                                                                                       S957C

              The     p h otog rap h shows       that    the head w o ul d be towards me,                w h ic h    is

              correct as        I recall        the    incident.       I also    recall       Carl's; head being

              covered w ith a police               coat.       I recall      a w rist watch,         jeans and

              ’t r a i n e r s 5 , all    of w h ic h the      p ho to g ra p h shows.



              As    I recall,       I was     the only        police   officer    on the       stre tc he r     party but

              I may be m i s t a k e n      over      this.



             One      thing   I am       certain of      is that the         body was      c a r d e d on an        a 1 urniniurn

              l a d d e r ; a one    piece      ladder as o p po s e d       to a stepj/ladder,

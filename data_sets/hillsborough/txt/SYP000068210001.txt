near       to    the B e e h i v e          and       left        the    car,       as     it was         the       b est    place           to

We    got       to    the B e e h i v e          at     abQju t'.2,, 0 Q p m        ( 1400)        had a         cou p l e       of    bottles

packed          inside          but I n e r e         was     a happy          atmosphere,                a    lot    of     singing.

We    left       the       Beehive          at     about            '15pm      ( 1 4 1 5 ) and          we     made     our       way        down      to

At    about          3..30 pm ( 14^tJ) w e                  got    to the       entrance            of     the g r o u n d s ,           walked

in t h r o u g h       the       mam        gates           and     hit       the    m a s s of         p e o p 1 ew a i t i ng       to     go

throuqh          the       turnstiles.                  1 expected             a    l a rge       crowd,        but       I did        expect

there       to       fae some         kind       of     queuing          system.             Last       years        semi        final        match,

which       myself          and       my    brother           went       to    there         was     some       kind        of    queuing

s y s t e m a n d we            entered          the        ground with             no    trouble.

We    got       into       the     crowd and                headed towards               Turnstile             B,    we     knew        which

turnstile             we w a n t e d        but       the     crowd was             not      moving           anywhere.               I looked

forward          and       saw t h a t        the       turnstiles             were       open       but       nobody        was       going

through.              We    d i dn ’t mo ve             for    about          2 0 m i nut es        and        of /f o u r se         t he    e r owd

was    getting             big g e r .        There         was     at    least          2 m o u n t e d j / o b b 1 es          in the

horses,          pushing           the      fans        away      from        the    turnstiles,                and     in m y         opinion,

as    the       crowd       could          not     m o ve,     the       horses          were      aggravating               the       crowd        and

were       not       helping,           because          there          was    nowhere            for     the       crowd        to m o v e

to.        On    one       occasion           in      the     20 minutes,                1 saw       something              thrown           past

the    officer             on    t he      ho r s e .

A    lot    of       the    f ans       were       trying         to     talk       to    the      officer,           saying,            “W h a t

the    h e l l ’s h a p p e n i n g ? "               " W h a t ’s g o i n g        o n ?"        " W h y a r e n ’t we           going

anywhere?"                 All    the       officer           replied          was,        "Calm        down,        i t ’ll      be a l r i g h t ’1

and    "Push          b ack” and            it w a s        becoming           an a g g r e s s i v e          manner        and       tempers

were       generally             getting           frayed.

look      on     his       face      he     j ust      looked          bewildered           and       he    didn't          seem      to      have

control          and       he     didn't         know what             to    do.      At     one      stage       1 heard            hj-jij. say;

c o r n e r f r o in ’Ga te C ’ by                  the      end       tuynst i1e .           I remember               thinking            that

the    turnstiles                weren't          being       usad,          which       is w h a t        I had a s s u m e d           early..

At    one      stage        a man          stood       n e t /to me,              said     "G r a b    rne " a n d       called          to     hi s

mate      who       was      behind         him and A a i d             "I'm       going"        at    which          point        I turned

 •ound a n d          saw a w h i t e            male/aged             about       30,      I half          grabbed          h i m w ith         his

mates       and       he was         white        anek r e a d y        to    f ai n t .      I shouted               "Give        him     some

r o om"     and       I shouted             this       several,         time s ,      because          everyone             was     shouting

and    screaming.                  Eventually               the       crowd       gave     him a small                amount        of     room

and    I j ust         ericouraged               him    to    t a ke        deep    breaths.               The    s m aII      gap       then

closed         up a g a i n        and      I don't          remember             seeing      h i m aga i n .

Also      in the           20 m i n u t e s       period,             I saw 2       kiddies           who,„-Had o b v i o u s l y

fainted          or at          l e a st    f elt      fai n t ,       they                bej^ff^ p a s s e d         b ack       o ver      the

crowd       to      the     side.

The    three          of    us     decided          that      we       needed       to     get     out      of    the       crowd        because

we w e r e n ' t m o v i n g a n y w h e r e ,               but      more        importantly,              we w e r e       just        getting

crushed          in    the       crowd and             it w a s        very       uncomfortable.

At    that       stage        we    made         our    way       b ack      towards        the       gates       that       blocked            off

the    road a nd             I then         saw     that      the       gates       were      clo s e d ,        so    the     3    of     us    had

a bit       of      a breathing              s p ot     for       a    couple       of m i n u t e s .

It w a s       at     this       point        I could         see .Gate C             from where             I was          standing.                It

got    opened          and       I saw a few                bobbies          go    in t h r o u g h        the    gate       a nd a l s o        a

few    fans         got     in as          well.        A    police          ho rse      nearby        had       to    i n t e r v e n e to

policemen           stood          around        the       gates.               There       was       nobody        around            to     check

We    were     in a          relatively              fa st       moving          crowd.            Once       inside          the         enclosur

people        seemed          to    pause        to       get     t h eir        bearings             and     to    see w h e r e            they

through        the     gate,            At      this       state         I was         constantly                looking             over      at

the     turnstiles             and       shouting            \          \ , to        let     him      know where                we       w e re.

      -took     the       man       he w a s         with        to    the       wall       and       I could           see      the       bloke         w

sure       he was       alright          and     he       thanked          us.     We     then       carried          on w i t h          the

crowd which             at    this       p o int      was       streaming              into    the    tunnel          and       also          goin

A ll ,3 of        us w e r e       together           yfien we         walked           into    the       tunne 1 »            1 remember

it w a s     very       d ark      but    you/could              make       people        out.        I was^aflTar e of a

steadily          and     I remember             a     couple         of    guys^MTinating                 in the          tunnel.                 I'

was    a    crowded          tunnel       but        not    excessive             and     no    crushing             at    that          time.

As    the    3 of       us    came       to    the        end    of    the       tunnel        1 could          see       the       pitch          as

people       just       in f r o n t      of     the       tunnel          entrance           who    were       unable          to       move.

Me    and               then       decided           to    try and move                sideways           to    get       out       of    the

towards       the       middle        of/the          pen.        I d i d n ’t see                        agai n unt i 1 l a ter                        o

th a t    s i t u at i o n was            extremely             serious.              Also       people       around        me,

including           myself,              were       starting         to     pan i c     and       were       taking       no     interest

in the        game       whatsoever.                     You were          stood       in    the       crowd and          could        not

        somewhere           and      realised                I was                      nq    on    something,                 I looked         down and

        I was       stood       on a        blokes            back        and      he    was       face       down        on    the     terracing,

        the     lads      either          side          of me        were       also         stood       on     him and          at     t his     stage       he

        was     totally          lifeless.                   We    knew       he    was       there       and        we    were       j ust     screaming

        got     the     impression              he       was       a w e ll        built          bloke       and     not       a young         lad.

        The     crowd       then moved                  slightly           and      I was          carried           off       him a n d      I never

The    next        incident         was,       as    far as          I'm     concerned,              the       worst.            3!

physically            got     lifted       off       the       floor       and my            feet    were       just        wedged

together          and     I was      no    longer           in      contact         with       the       ground and              1 weigh            14

force       of    the     crowd.          It wa s         really        bad a n d            also    in       trying        to    break

free,       my    foot       got    pulled          out     of m y      lace        up       shoe.

Whilst       still        off      the    ground,           I started             tilting           to    the       right        but       my

feet      were      wedged.          When       I f elt            myself     tilting              I think          it w a s      at       t ha t

Fi n a 1 1y , I hit           the    f 1 o o r b ut         i n the        m e a n t im e , s om e b 1o ke              had       fa 11e n

underneath           me      and    I was       lying          on    top     of     him.           I kept       thinking              to

myself       t hat      the      time     had       come       and    that        I ’ve       gone.

The    bloke        underneath            me    was       screaming           to me           “ pull      me    up,      pull         me    up

m a te,     please        pull      me    up",       but       I couldn't            do       anything,             I felt

paralysed.              At    that       time       .1 was         ready     to     lay       down and          let      it      happen.

All    my    energy          had    gone       and       I was       completely               exhausted.               I could             now

feel      people's           feet    starting             to       trample        on m y       feet       and       legs      and      the

next      thing      I knew         was    that          somebody          had      grabbed          the       back     of m y         neck

and    was       d r a g g i ng me       up.        As    I came        up    I got           hold       of    the     g u y w ho          was

under       me    and     brought         him       up w i t h       me.      Once           up,    I stood          there        and       just

stopped,          probably          because          of     sho c k ,      and      I didn't             k now who          had       pulled

I waited          in the      crowd        until       there        was       no m o r e      crushing          and     pushing;,

was     looking        into     the      terraces           tor     his       parents.            I think        his    n ame         was

                E v e n t u a i 1y he      spotted          them.

It w a s     at    t hat     time,       I decided            to    get       out    on    to      the     pitch.           I

l e isurely went             from my          position and               got    down       to      the     front       of       pen 4

where       I got     out     o ver      the     wall.

Almost         instantly        I saw                  and asked              him    if    he'd         seen                but       he

h a d n *t .

I couldn't            believe        the      amount        of     bodies        I saw       on     the       pitch when              I go

out.

In the         next    hour     and      20     minutes          I spent         looking           for    my     brother,             whic:

involved          looking      at       all     the    bodies           and    generally            searching           round          the

p itch.

I d i d n ’t see a n y          bad      behaviour            except          one    isolated            incident           in w h i c h

fan was         verbally        swearing          at    a     police          officer.

I later         found            outside          the       g r o u n d » We        then went            straight           back       to

I forgot          to m e n t i o n      t hat    I retrieved              my    shoe       from         the     terraces.

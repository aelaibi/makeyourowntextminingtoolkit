 REVIEW OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS (DESIGNATION       OF   FOOTBALL
 MATCHES IN ENGLAND AND WALES ORDER) 1990

 I wrote to you on 14 January requesting comments on the first
 draft of a submission to Ministers which sets out the need to
 amend the designation order. Thank you for your response(s).

 2.   The reply from Mr Clayton raised serious doubts about
 amending the Order to give full effect to the proposals in my
 paragraph 18. I had also overlooked F 8 's needs to keep certain
 matches "designated" in order to make restriction orders
 effective.   I shall be pursuing these matters further with Mr
 Clayton and Mr Hopley but before I do, I would welcome comments
 on my revised views about including home matches at Berwick
 Rangers in those which should be designated (18(iv) of my
 original draft).

 3.   Apart from the fact that of all the professional clubs in
 the country, Berwick Rangers probably have the unenviable
 position of being the one in the most parlous financial state
 (they may not exist as a club for more than a few weeks or even
 days) there are difficulties in designating matches by a named
 team. Therefore, if Berwick overcome their present problems to
 survive and if we still wish to have their matches designated we
 shall have to think more carefully how to cater for this English
 club who play in the Scottish Football League.

 4.   However, on reflection I am not at all sure that Berwick's
 matches should be designated. They are presently covered by the
 wording of the current Order but I do not see why.      The Order
 does not apply to other Scottish League clubs (who play in
 Scotland) so Berwick are unusual on that count. Neither are they
 members of the (English) Football League - whose matches are
 designated - so they are unusual on that count also. While it
 is possible for them to draw a large (Scottish) club at home in
 the Scottish Cup competitions, I see little difference between
 Berwick and other English non-FL clubs who play at designated
 sportsgrounds eg Telford Utd who play in the GM Vauxhall
 Conference and whom we now wish to exclude from the Order, who
 could also draw large (English) clubs at home in Cup tournaments.

  5.   In the circumstances therefore, unless there are any special
  reasons which I have overlooked why Berwick Rangers' matches
  should be designated under the Order, I propose we exclude them
  from mention altogether. I would welcome your early comments on
  this revised proposal.

 REVIEW OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS (DESIGNATION OF         FOOTBALL
 MATCHES IN ENGLAND AND WALES ORDER) 1990

 1.    We are planning to introduce a Commencement Order in respect
 of section 9 of the Football Spectators Act 1989, later this
 year.   This will create an offence of admittingspectators to
 watch a designated match at unlicensed premises.

 2.   Developments in the football world to introduce a new FA
 Premier League will require us to amend the designation order.
 Also, the present order includes as designated matches some we
 never intended to cover. Moreover, were these matches to remain
 designated after section 9 of the Football Spectators Act comes
 into operation, the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) will
 experience difficulty licensing some of these matches and, in
 some cases, where they would wish to refuse a licence, the
 timescales set out in the 89 Act for the procedures to make
 representations would make licensing impossible.

  3.   The position is set out in the enclosed draft submission we
  intend putting to Ministers.    I should be glad to receive any
  comments on it by Monday 27 January. Meanwhile,    as I shall be
  on leave 18 to 25 January, any enquiries about the submission
  should be made to David Webb on ext 3650.

REVIEW OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS (DESIGNATION                      OF     FOOTBALL
MATCHES IN ENGLAND AND WALES) ORDER 1990


Purpose



This    submission    seeks   the     approval    of    Ministers          to   make

arrangements to reduce the number and type of football grounds

that require licences from the Football Licensing Authority (FLA)

to    allow   the   admittance   of   spectators       to    watch    designated

matches.      It is proposed that this           is done by amending the

Football Spectators (Designation of Football Matches in England

and Wales) Order 1990 which, because of recent developments in

the    football world to set up a Premier League,                  will require

amendment in any event.



2.     This   is not the only designation order which refers                      to

football matches: there are several others which exist under the

football-related public order legislation.             These orders too will

need to be amended to take into account the creation of the
Premier League.     F8 Division will advise separately about these

other orders in due course.         It would have been helpful if the

list of designated matches could have been the same for all the

various designation orders.        Unfortunately, this is now unlikely

to be possible.



Background



3.   It   is    intended   to    commence       section    9   of    the     Football

Spectators Act 1989 by early summer 1992 (a separate submission

will be made to Ministers about this later).                     This will create

an offence of admitting spectators to watch a designated football

match at a ground not covered by a licence issued by the FLA.

The football matches which are designated are set out in the

Football Spectators (Designation of Football Matches in England

and Wales) Order 1990.       Although it was originally intended that

only Football League and international matches played in England

and Wales should be so designated,                the wording of the Order

includes other matches many of which attract few spectators and

present no real safety problems.                But licensing grounds where

such games take place would impose on the FLA a licensing duty

beyond their resource capabilities.



4.   At   the    moment    the   Order    covers, among          others, matches

involving members of the Football League.                 However, those in the

First Division are resigning from the FL on forming the new FA

Premier League details for which are intended to be finalised in.

time for the 1992/93 season in August.                    If the Order is not

amended   to    take   account    of     this    change     of      status    matches
involving the Premier Division clubs will not be covered and

would not therefore require FLA licences.



5.    While the Order also covers full international matches eg

England v Scotland at Wembley, UEFA competition games and matches

in all four Football League divisions which account for almost

all   the   high    risk    matches,        it   also    includes       the   following

examples which rarely, if ever present significant danger:



      (i)   matches        between        league      clubs'    reserve,      youth      or

            women's sides played at a ground designated under the

            Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (one with a capacity

             in    excess       of   10,000      at   which     football,        rugby   or

            cricked        is   played)       other     than    the     club's    ground.

            These matches rarely attract more than a few hundred

             spectators wherever they are played.



      (ii) matches between any representative side of a country

             (other than full             internationals,            'B' or   'under 21'

             internationals          or    schoolboy       internationals          all   of

             which should be played at licensed grounds and always

             are) and matches involving a team which represents a

             club in a country outside England and Wales played at

             a designated sports ground.                 This might cover matches

             between a small French club on tour at Easter who play

             a small English           (twin towned)           club at a designated

             sportsground.            Such       matches       are    unlikely     to    be

             numerous and it is unlikely that anyone would wish to

             prosecute the organisers were they to break the law
            requiring the match to be licensed in ignorance.        But

            we would not wish such persons to find themselves in

            breach of the law.



6.   None of these types of matches would be expected to attract

a large crowd or present a particular danger.          Nor would there

be many such matches.     But any additional unnecessary work would

be unwelcome to the FLA and would be a waste of scarce resources.

These matches should not require the premises at which they are

played to be licensed.



Problems



7.      The present Order also covers matches in competitions such

as the FA cup which involve minnows such as Telford Utd which

plays in the GM Vauxhall Conference and whose home ground is

designated under the 75 Act.      Such minnows occasionally progress

through the early rounds and can draw a Football League club at

home.     Under the current Order such a match would require a

licence unless police recommendations about the likelihood of a

breakdown of safety or public order required the game to be

played elsewhere.



8.      Such a match at say Telford against Leeds or some other club

of   similar   standing   and   following   would   present   particular

problems of crowds and safety at a ground the management of which

is unused to handling such events.          This would be a case where

the licensing arrangements might serve a useful purpose.         If time

allowed the FLA could review the        safety certificate      for the
ground      issued     by    the   local    authority,    inspect      the   ground

themselves and decide whether to licence it for this match or to

refuse a licence which would involve rearranging the game at

another,        more   suitable     ground.        However,   there     would    be

considerable problems considering an application for a licence

in the limited time available in these circumstances and, in the

event      of   a   likely    refusal,     insufficient    time   to    allow   the

notification and representation procedures to be exercised (see

para 9 below).



9.      However, were Telford to draw a lowly 4th Division FL club

eg Aldershot, such a game would be unlikely to attract a large

crowd, certainly not one which would exceed the capacity approved

by the safety certificate.            Such a match should present no undue

dangers and should not therefore require a licence although it

should be emphasised that the principle means of ensuring safety

at    a    designated        sportsground     is   the   safety     certification

procedures carried out by the local authority.                      Since it was

decided not to take forward the national membership scheme the

main focus of the licensing scheme has become unclear.                   It is now

to be used as a rather blunt instrument to ensure football league

clubs eliminate standing accommodation in accordance with the

Taylor recommendations.



10.       It is ironic that were the minnow to be a team such as

Farnborough whose ground is not designated under the 1975 Act

(capacity less than 10,000) but who recently knocked out Torquay

Utd to draw West Ham Utd at home, and had the local police raised

no objections to the match being played (it was in fact played
at West Ham's ground where          the tie resulted in a draw)             the

Farnborough ground would not have a safety certificate nor would

the match have required a licence.              However, a Farnborough vs

West Ham match at Farnborough or a similar game hosted by a

tiddler at an undesignated sportsground would present perhaps the

greatest danger of all to spectators: greater even than the cup

final at Wembley.        This is because Wembley frequently holds big

matches while small teams such as Farnborough rarely have more

than   a   few   hundred   spectators,      never   have   multi-thousands,

probably have an ageing ground with limited facilities, stadia

of dubious structural safety which have never had to meet safety

certification      standards     with    inexperienced     management       and

stewards.



11 .   For this reason therefore it could be argued that matches

where small teams with non-designated grounds who draw important

Football League teams at home and where the police raise no

objections to the game going ahead (unlikely) are those which

should require licences:         this would be the only safety check

available    although,     as   mentioned      in paragraph   7 above,      the

purpose of a licence has become unclear.             Thus, while prudence

dictates    that   the   FLA would      find   licensing   such   grounds    an

unwelcome additional burden,         the law which does not presently

cover such games,        should be extended to do so.         However, this

would be impossible without amending the primary legislation AND

reorganising the way the FA Cup competition is run.               Both would

be unwelcome, difficult, and attract enormous adverse criticism.
12.     The difficulty stems from the timetable and procedures for

the cup rounds.       When the draw is made matches take place about

3 weeks later.        Where FL clubs are drawn against each other as

usually happens or where a FL club draws a non-League minnow at

home,    this does not present a licensing problem.                  The FL home

ground will already hold a licence to permit ordinary league

games.        However, where a non-league club draws a FL club, the

minnow intends to hold the home fixture and the police raise no

over-riding objections (this would be rare) the small club would

have     to   apply   for   a   licence.     Even    if    the    club     did   this

immediately it would leave the FLA with less than 3 weeks to

process the application and make a detailed inspection of the

ground.        But were the FLA to be minded to refuse to grant a

licence they would be required by s10(3)                   of the 1989 Act to

notify the club in writing of the proposed refusal, the reasons

for it, and to provide the applicant with 28 days within which

to make representations which have to be considered before the

final decision is made.



13.     This would lead to the ridiculous position where, if the FLA

could do the initial processing of an application in time but be

inclined to refuse it, the match would have been played before

a final decision could be taken.              The situation would be even

more ridiculous were the minnow to play a cup match away at the

ground of a FL opponent, hold the big club to a draw and wish to

hold the reply at their own ground 10 days later.                    The 1989 Act

provides       no protection     whatever    in    terms   of     safety    at non­

designated       sportsgrounds     and,    until    such   time    as    it can be

reviewed and amended (or replaced) with something that better
suits    the    purpose       we    shall       have      to     rely   on    the    football

authorities to ensure such potentially dangerous (and fortunately

few) games are played at more suitable venues.                          There is unlikely

to be any opportunity to revise the primary legislation for some

considerable time.



Options



14.     The only options are as follows



        (i)    prevail on the football authorities to revise the way

               in which they organise                    their competitions         to allow

               much   longer periods between                   the draw and         the date

               matches have to be played,



        (ii) enact      legislation            to   prevent       minnows     holding      home

               games against FL opponents in the latter states of

               competitions,



      (iii) confine the licensing requirements only to Football

               League    (and       Premier         League)      club   grounds      and    the

               national football stadia, leaving the decision whether

               to allow minnows to host big clubs at their unlicensed

               grounds    -        many    of       which      will     not   have     safety

               certificates         -     to   the       discretion     of    the    football

               authorities,         bearing         in    mind    any    informal      advice

               offered by the local authorities, Police and Emergency

               Services.
15.    The proposal         14 (i ) is out of the question.          The FA cup

competition is a long standing institution.                    It is arranged so

that the preliminary rounds take place throughout the season

keyed in with the league fixtures to end with the cup final at

the    close    of   the    season.     There   would be neither          time    nor

opportunity to rearrange the competition to extend the periods

between draw and matches without changing the competition beyond
recognition.



16.    Proposal 14(ii) is equally unacceptable.                  Any minnow that

progresses to the 1st round 'proper' of the FA Cup (when the 3rd

and 4th division clubs join) has done well.                To get as far as the

3rd round       proper' when the 1st and 2nd division teams become

involved amounts           to something of a feat.             To deny    them the

advantage of a home tie by means of legislation would be totally

against       any    concept      of    fair    play    even     though     police

recommendations about safety and order usually act to prohibit

such a fixture and have it played at the big club's ground or at
some other more acceptable venue.



17.    This therefore leaves 14(iii) as the only acceptable option;

to    amend    the Designation         Order   to   require    licences    only    in

respect matches between teams representing national football and

matches between Football League and Premier League clubs played

at their own grounds or at the National Football Stadia, and to

leave decisions about the safety of allowing the non-league clubs

to host 'big' matches to the football authorities.                    In effect,

this is what happens at present.                However,      it means that the

Football Spectators Act 1989, the basis of which is the safety
of spectators at football matches,         will play no part in some

matches played at non-designated grounds which carry an element
of danger.



Recommendations



18.    Ministers are recommended to authorise the amendment of the

football Spectators (Designation of Football Matches in England

and Wales) Order 1990 to cover as designated matches only those

which take place in England and Wales which are: —



       (i)   full, 'B', under 21 or schoolboy internationals played

             at sportsgrounds designated under the 1975 Act,



       (ii) part of a competition organised by UEFA played at a

             designated sportsground,



      (iii) between the first teams of clubs both of which are

             members of the Football or Premier Leagues played at

             designated sportsgrounds,



      (iv) played by Berwick Rangers first team at their home

             ground - this last category is to take account of the

             anomaly   of   Berwick   Rangers   who,   while   playing   in

             England are members of the Scottish Football League.

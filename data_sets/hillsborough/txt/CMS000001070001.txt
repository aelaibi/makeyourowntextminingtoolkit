I enclose part of a letter from S Popper, HM Coroner responsible
for carrying out the inquests into the deaths at the Hillsborough
Disaster.  At the conclusion of the inquests he indicated that
there were a number of matters which he intended to raise with
the Home Secretary.   His letter contains 3 schedules, schedule
C being co^ a rned with the inter-relationship of inquests and
Public Inquiries.   Is this a matter for your division and if so
could I have a contribution to our reply as soon as possible
please. Thankyou.

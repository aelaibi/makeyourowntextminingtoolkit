1.   I am employed as a Control Officer for SYMAS.


2.   My date of birth Is 1st June 1942.


3.   I began work as an ambulance man with West Riding County
     Council Ambulance Service In April 1965.        The ambulance
     service was taken over by SYMAS In, I believe, 1974.       In
     1975 I was appointed a Control Officer.


4.   On Saturday 15th April I had been on duty during the morning
     and came off duty at 0200 and went home.


5.   At about 1515 I received a telephone call from             at
     home.    She Is a Control Assistant.   She asked me to report
     back to control because there was an Incident at the
     Hillsborough football ground.


6.   I arrived at control at 1550 and assisted                  on
     the emergency desk.   A lot of vehicles had been deployed to
     Hillsborough but, of course, the other "normal" emergencies
     were happening in the SYMAS area and I assisted            in
     providing ambulances      for these emergencies.     We also
     received some calls which related to the Hillsborough
     incident and we passed messages to the separate incident
     room which had been set up and was operating prior to my
     arrival at control.


7.   I went off duty at 2000.




Dated this   &^ day   of         1989.

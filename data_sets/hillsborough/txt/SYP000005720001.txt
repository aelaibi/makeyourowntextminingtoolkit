             I never         saw     a turnstile.            People were          being     crushed outside,              up

             agai n s t      the gates.         It was       g e tJ A :h g bad,    towards        the stage       of     panic.

             crowd.

             Once     inside        the enclosure        area,       it wasn't          so bad      I rrever handed any

             We were         carried down this           t u n n e 1 , more       or    less      like a wave,          by the

             S u d d e n l y there was a terrific                  surge     from the       ba>d£ and       I was       propelled

             down     the terracing         towards          the    perimeter          f e/fce.     I ended up a bout               4

         what    happ e n d to him.         It must          have    been about 3pi]

         I was     s truggling       to keep my feet                on the       ground and keep breathing.

         People were          screaming         out and shouting                it was absolute          chaos.         My

         arms    were       pinned to my sides               by the       crowd a r o u n d me.         I could not mak

         any    v o l untary m ov em e n t s         of my own during             this    period of time.

         I saw     people        on the ground          t owards       the      bottom of the          pe/imeter        fence.

         I think        they were        dead,       they were all            blue,    in a pvip e :, someone           threw

         a coat over          the face      of someone           lying        there.

         pretty       clear,      I ran along          it,    to see       if    I w ould    find the other             lads       I

         knew,     but      couldn't.

         E v e r y b o d y was    in a daze,          there were          bodies       lying on various parts                 of

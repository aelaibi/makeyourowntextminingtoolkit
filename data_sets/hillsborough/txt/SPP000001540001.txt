FILE NOT# DATED 16.11.90.

A lot of statements arrived on the 16th at about 2.30 or so

from Mr. Frazer.    Somewhat later another batch of

statements came from Hammand Suddards and later still about

5 critique of the proposed summaries from Dr. Eastwood's

solicitors.

I spoke with Mervyn.    He informed me that Caroline had

considerable difficulty getting responses from some

solicitors and that there was quite a lot of objection to

the content.    I said in the circumstances we wold not use

them but would proceed without them and without much

further ado.    We agreed that we would bring some witnesses

forward for Tuesday afternoon in the circumstance.     We

would start with Inspector Layton on Monday afternoon.       I

went through the statements which Mr. Frazer had sent.

Three or four of them referred to various witnesses with

copy statements which I have requested so that I can assess

them.    With regard to the rest, it seems to me that they

have completely misunderstood a. what is happening and b.

what the objects of an inquest are.    I can see at the

moment no reason why I should depart from my decision to

treat the cut-off point as far as the how is concerned at

about 3.15 or in fact even earlier.

that it has serious implications both ethically and legally I must again
make it vclear that I cannot countenance condone approve or give consent to
any ‘action or inaction which could be or could be contrued as being designed
or intented to shorten or terminate the li£e of this young man. This particularly
applies to the withholding of the neccesit-ies of life such as food and drink
clothing and warmth ( and, on reflection 'this includes medical care
include antibiotic cover where necessary^)

I would be grateful if you would please/ reply by return and confirm
that this is understood and that no su</h activity or inactivity will
be undertaken in relation to this patient.


I am aware that there are occasions when people are terminally ill say
from cancer that a clinical decision/ may be taken not to seek to prolong
life by heroic medical intervention /and                 this may include the withholding
of say antibiotic drugs.                '            /

The problem in this case is that sdthough this young man may be severely
brain damaged it is clear from wmat you said that he is not brain dead
and indeed may not be terminally' ill in the conventional sense

I am in some difficulty as I have's never s e ^ ihis^patient am not responsible
for his clinical management and il.n any case have ,no
not dead. However it must be app W e n t that there must be a difference if
he dies as a result of say hypoxic brain damage or if he dies as a result
of some       new act     implemented tftecaui e it. is thought that his prognosis
and quality of life are such h(4 might be better dead than alive.

You will also appreciate that fany clinical decisions which you may take
are of course your sole resporfisibilty and you have always to be in a position
to defend them and to show thlat they comply with the law of this land
                             I                   ■

I have no doubt that your leg*al advisors will be able to guide you further
in this matter.                   . J


I think that I might just me*ntion that if you feel that you need clarifiation
of the legal position with ^regard to any or all of your proposed actions
th&fc it might be worth askijng ynur legal advisors whether it would be possible
to make an application to tfhe the High Court for directions and guidance.

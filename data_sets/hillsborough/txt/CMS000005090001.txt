FOOTBALL POOLS BETTING LEVY
I was delighted th a t John Major felt able to help football clubs cope with
th e costs of implementing the Taylor R eport b y red u cin g th e football pools
b e ttin g levy in the B ud get. The expected £100 million will certain ly help
th e clubs considerably over the n ex t five y e a rs.
I do not th in k , how ever, th a t the scale of added resources which this
change re p re se n ts will be enough to enable Scottish League clubs to cope
with the tim etable fo r implementation of all-seated accommodation
recommended in th e Taylor R eport. In niy le tte r to you of 8 March, I
said th a t a 5 -y ear extension would be req u ired if Scottish clubs were to
surv iv e the tran sitio n req u ired to meet the Taylor recom mendations. I
still hold to the view th a t extension of the tim etable will be req u ired for
Scotland and I would welcome your agreem ent to such an extension.

I am copying th is le tte r to the Prime M inister, John Major, C hris Patten
and P eter Walker.

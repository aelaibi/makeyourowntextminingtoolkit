                                                               Date:             January 1998




         <2X X /    AAt       L jk X fcr*.

Thank you for speaking to me today about the scrutiny o f evidence concerning the
Hillsborough football stadium disaster which is being conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith.

2.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to carry out this task by the Home Secretary.
His objective is to establish whether there is any significant evidence about the disaster which
was not previously available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting
and police disciplinary authorities. If there is significant new evidence, he intendrto see
whether it might have affected the outcome o f any o f the proceedings. He hopes to report
his findings to the Home Secretary early next year, and the Home Secretary intends to publish
his report.

3.      You may wish to see his terms o f reference, and I attach a copy.

4.      As I §aid when we spoke, the Judge is looking at the way in which evidence was
collected from the police officers who were involved in the disaster. We have found that
officers at the scene - including o f course yourself - were not asked to make witness
statements in the usual way. Instead they were asked to write down their ‘recollections’ of
what had happened. South Yorkshire police later passed these to the West Midlands police,
who investigated the disaster on behalf o f Lord Taylor.

5.      Some officers’ recollections went to the West Midlands police investigators in a
different form from that in which the officers had originally produced them. They had been
‘vetted’ by people at force headquarters, who made changes to them and asked the officers
who had made them to sign them again in their altered form. We have o f course discussed
the background to that with South Yorkshire police management and their legal advisers.

6.      One o f these altered documents was yours. What we are curious about, as I said on
the telephone, is the extent to which officers who were asked to sign altered recollections
were reluctant, and/or put under pressure, to do so. We wanted to make contact with you
because the recollections which you produced seem to have undergone important changes.

7.     I attach copies which we have made o f your original and amended recollections, as
they are preserved in the South Yorkshire police archive. The original version exists both
handwritten and as it was typed up by the South Yorkshire Police typing service, and I attach
copies o f it in both forms. The typed copy o f your original version (headed ‘document
record print’) clearly shows the changes which were made to your ‘recollections’ before you
were asked to sign them - the reference to the 10 a.m. briefing as ‘short and sharp’ has been
removed, as have all o f your ‘additional points arising’ at the end.

8.    The amended version o f your recollections is the other typed document enclosed.
You seem to have signed it at the bottom o f each page.

9.      The Judge would be grateful for any observations you may want to make to him
about the extent to which you were reluctant to sign the amended version o f your
recollections or to which you felt police management pressurised you into doing so. I do of
course understand that this is a very unusual request, and that it may put you in some
difficulty (especially given your outstanding action against the Chief Constable and since, as
I said when we spoke, I have unavoidably had to contact you via South Yorkshire police). I
entirely appreciate that you may wish to seek advice before responding. But I wonder if I
might nevertheless ask you to let us have what you want to say by Friday 16 January. I am
o f course very willing to talk again over the phone if that would help.

10.      I look forward to hearing from you.

 Approximately          2.40        pm.      Young    Police     Constable        with    ’stupid       and    legless’

 drunk    wandering                about    in concourse at rear A-G               turnstiles.           Did not      know

 where     to    go.           Took        him   to Police Room.           Had     to    support      drunk all       way.

 (Police Constable 1719 or 1715 or similar).

 2.4 5 pm               Checked          watch   leaving     police       room,    radio message,             "Get    some

 more    horses        up    here"         (or   similar).         Auto    -   assumed        Leppings     Lane       end.

 Unknown       officer       said,        "Sounds     like   its    getting       busy    at     your    end Harry".

 Returned       to Leppings Lane end via route under North Stand.                                     Getting busy.

 Concourse       rear       11-16.         Climbing over        wall      above    gate       ’B ’.   Joined Police

 Constables       at        ’B ’    gate     entice     down.       Fans       distrustful.             Waving       their

 tickets.        Inspector John Bennett had climbed onto turnstile roof to deal.
  Aware     of       the   crush outside          11-16      turnstiles.          Coming through           very    slowly.

  Stepped        away      from        turnstiles     to watch       Inspector Bennett            but     two     or   three

  times     I        was     pulled       by    Liverpool      people       who    had     got      inside       who   were

  complaining about the crush outside.                          "You should be out there.                       People are

  gonna get killed".

 Through the gate in the wall between the two concourses at the rear of two

 sets of turnstiles.                    I became aware of a movement of people.                           From previous

 experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

 for waiting friends responding to a kick off or crowd cheer or similar.                                                     1

 stepped        through        into      the    concourse     behind A-G.           (Not      sure     whether      pulled

^||ain by fans).

 Twice called on radio using allocated call sign ’India 7'.

 I seemed to recall that all the turnstiles had stopped.                                        Men were screaming

 trapped        in     them.           Gate    'C' was open and       people were coming through.                      The

 terror      in        the        turnstiles communicated             itself       to    me      and      brought      the

 seriousness of the situation to mind.

 I went out through gate ’C ’ .

 I remember           standing         alongside      Inspectors      Graham Delaney and Bob Purdy and

 Sergeant John Morgan pulling people out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                                                  I

 feared some would be killed.                       Some were reluctant to come.                  I think they had

 go-   so   close          tothe       turnstiles      they    had    the single intention                 of    passing

 through.        I     shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the iron

 bar   that is a continuation of the wall                           housing gate         'C'.       The    crush quite

 suddenly        eased.            I    saw    gate    'B'    had    been    opened.          The      queues      became

 controllable          and     containable          again.      The    two turnstiles            nearest        gate   ’C'

 appeared to function again.                      Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

 up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of
 this agitated crowd fans who produced tickets.                         I told the stocu-ds on gate

 'C' to take the stubs.

 By now I have no idea of time or what is happening outside.

 By word of mouth information passed,                     "Inside - Pitch invasion".Went to                        the

 pitch via rear of police control box and down the first steps                                    inthe South

 Stand.      I saw no players or officials on the pitch.

 The    invasion appeared to have spread as far as the penalty spot.                                    I got on

 lO    the pitch and had got near to the goal post when I noticed those on the

 pitch were not running towards opponents end or away from Police Officers.

 Some were holding themselves, others lying down.                           I looked towards the fence

" o lding     back     fans       in   the    Leppings    Lane   terraces.         Police    Officers         were

standing on           the    fence     and    leaning    over.     Through    the   gaps     in       the   legs    I

could see the faces of fans pressed against the fence.                              I realised they were

stood up dead.              The gate         to this pen was opened.         I think       it was number 3

gate.

Automatically (or it seemed) Police Officers formed a double line up to the

gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                            When there was no one

at your end of the line                   to pass on the casualty, you carried it on to the

pitch.        Police Constable               2417   Pete Rotchel    and I carried          the    unconscious

body of a 14 years old boy,                    dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

to     the   pitch.         I felt     his     heart   beat but his breathing          was       so    extremely

shallow that I thought he was dead.                      We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

realised      he     was     in    fact      breathing   himself.      We    did    not     interrupt        this

natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

and protected.              I remember as I was kneeling over him that 1 was kicked in

the back.       I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.

  People       came    with a board            and    this    boy    was    carried    away.         More    came    with

  another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                                              I

  remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

  I turned       and       saw    behind me       a fireman         apply    cardiac    massage       to a male        in

  early       thirties.           He    then    gaveoral     resuscitation             and I knelt          beside   the

  casualty to do cardiac massage.                       As the fireman sat            back he signalled         me not

  to continue.             We checked for vital life signs,                    there were none.              I covered

  the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.

  -     neard someone say,               "They're charging".               I looked towards the Spion Kop and

 saw    people        on    the    field moving         towards      it.      They     were    not    running.        It

^^oked        as though a confrontation was imminent.                          I went beyond the half way

 line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.                                  There was a line across

 the    width     of       the    pitch.       This   halted    the progress          of the Liverpool           fans.

 Some of them were crying.                      Some were frustrated.            Some were angry.              It did

 not help to hear the                   mass of Notts fans behind chanting                and goading.They

 seemed unaware of the                  tragedy.

 4.20 pm               This was the first lull in the sequence of events since I left

 the police room.                I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.                    I became aware that

 my radio was still working.                     There were public address announcements and the

 ground slowly emptied.

 3 . 0 0 pm            Given hot drinks.               Mustered serials          in North Stand and spoke

 to officers distressed by experiences.

About     5-30    pm        I    went   to     gymnasium     which     was    being     used    as    a     temporary

mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

 *1. 00 pm             Went off duty from the gymnasium.

of two       sets       of     turnstiles.                 I became          aware         of a m o v e m e n t        of    people.

From      previous           experience              I knew       it wa s        too m u c h        for     turnstile             flow

a n d there        were        too m a n y         for w a i t i n g      friends           responding               to a kick

off    or    crowd       cheer          or s i m i l a r .        I stepped              through       into          the    concourse

b e h i n d A - G . (Not           s u re     whether           pulled again               by fans.)

I seemed          to    recall          that all           the    turnstiles              had s t o p p e d .          Men were

screaming          trapped             in them.            Gate    *C*       wa s    open and          people          were       coming

through.           The       terror          in the        turnstiles            communicated              itself           to me a n d

brought         the     seriousness                of    the     situation           to mind.

I went       out       through          gate       *C'.

think       t hey had          got      so    close        to    the    turnstiles              they      had       the     single

intention          of    passing             t h rough.          I shouted           at     s ome    a n d as        many     as

possible,          I pulled             under        the    iron       bar    that        is a      continuation              of    the

The    invasion a p p e a r e d              to    have       spread        as     far as         the    penalty          spot.           I

got    on to       the      pitch and             had    got     near       to     the      goal    post       when       I noticed

t h ose    on     the     pitch were              not    running           towards          opponents          end       or a w a y

gate      to    this      pen was           opened.          I think        it was          no.    3 gate.

Automatically               (or      so     it see m e d )       police          officers          formed          a double          line

up to the gate               and       formed a          chain        ga ng      to    pass       out    casulaties.                 When

there      1-        -            at y o u r       end of        the       line       to    pass    on    the       casualty          you

carried         it on      to     the       pitch.           PC 2 4 1 7     Pete       ROTCHEL          and    I carried             the

unconscious              b o d y of a 14 y e a r s              old     boy      dressed          in b lue         tee    shirt       and

blue      jeans     on to         the       pitch.           I f el t      his     heart      beat       but       his    breathing

was    so e x t r e m e l y       shallow          that       I thought            he was         dead.        We    prepared             to

do m o u t h     to m o u t h w h e n          I realised             he w as         infact       breathing             himself.

We    did not       interrupt               this      natural         breathing             and monitored                his

c o n d i t i o n v er y     closely.              Keeping          him warm and              protected.                 I remember

as    I was      kneeling            over     him that           I wa s       kicked         in the       back.          I seemed

surrounded          by the           click-whizz              click-whizz              of    cameramen.

People         came w i t h a b o a r d a n d                this     boy was          carried away.                 More       came

with another              board        to    carry away             the y o u n g          woman    being a t t e n d e d            to

early      thirtie s.             He      then     gave       oral      resuscitation and                     I knelt          beside

the    c a s u a l t y to       do     cardiac massage.                     As     the      fireman       sat       back       he

  T h ere    were     none.            I cov er           the     casualty's              face w i t h         the      front           of    his

  sweater.

  1 h e ard s o m e o n e       sa y      " T h e y ’ re        charging"                I looked            towards          the       Spion

 Kop a n d saw           people         on     the        field moving                 towards          it.        They       were       not

  running.          It      l o o k e d as        though a           confrontation                    was     imminent.                 I went

 beyond       the     half w a y         line a n d m a d e               uniformed               officers          form       up       in a

 line.        There      was       a    line a c r o s s           the         width      of      the    pitch.           This          halted

 the    p r ogr ess      of     the L i v e r p o o l            fans.           Some        of     them were           crying.               Some

 were       frustrated.                Some       were angry.                   It     did     not      help       to   hear        the m a s s

 of Notts,          fans      behind          chanting            and      goading.                 They      seemed         unaware           of

 the    tragedy.

 4.20pm             T h is    was       the       first         lull      in the          sequence            of    events          since       I

 left    the     pol i c e      room.             I    l o o k e d at m y w a t c h               it was       4.20pm.              I    became

 aware      that m y         radio was                still     working.                There        were      public         address

 announcements               and       the    ground          slowly           emptied.

 About 5.30pm                I went          to       g y m n a s i u m w h i c h was             be i n g   used       as    a    temporary

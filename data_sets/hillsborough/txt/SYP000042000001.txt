 NATURE OF             COMPLAINT

  On Saturday, 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, a
  disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

  Leslie Jones of                             Liverpool,
                                              —          the father of one of the
  deceased, Richard Jones, has made the following allegations relating to your duties
  at the ground on 15 April 1989;

  (a)      You failed to acquaint yourself with the planning and problems related to
           the control of the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest Semi Final on Saturday,
           15 April 1989.

  (b)      You failed to monitor the crowd numbers packing into Pens 3 and A.

  (c)      You failed to act when it became obvious that Pens 3 and A were over full
           when you had an excellent viewpoint from the Police Box above the pens.

  (d)      You failed to make provision for fans coming through gate »C' after you
           had given the order for the gate to be opened.                  "       ““

  (e)      You failed to act when it was obvious that people were in distress.

  (f)      You attempted to mislead the Assistant Chief Constable at the ground and
           others, namely, representatives of the Club, the F.A., and the fans
           themselves regarding the origin of the order for gate ’C ’ to be opened.
           That is by inferring supporters had forced open the gate when you had, in
           fact, given the order to open the gate.
  You have the right to consult a friend at all stages of the investigation and service of this form does not necessarily imply
  that disciplinary proceedings will follow. It is served to safeguard your interests.

   You are not as the Regulation explains, obliged to say anything concerning the matter, but you may if you so desire make
   a written or oral statement concerning the matter to me or to the Assistant Chief Constable. (The Chief Constable has
   delegated his authority under Regulation 15 of the above Regulations to the Assistant Chief Constable).

                                                                             3 THE AOOIOTANT-

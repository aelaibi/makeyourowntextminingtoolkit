            I am a married man residing at the above address.

           On the afternoon of Saturday 13 April        1989 (150489)    I attended the FA

           Cup Semi Final Football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

            at the Hillsborough F o ot ba 11 Ground in Sheffield.

            I attended as a Liverpool >dipporter.       I have supported Liverpool         for

            over forty years now.     I am not a season ticket holder at Anfield,                 but

            up until    last season I was a development agent at Anfield which

            involved fund raising for the club eg selling lottery tickets.                I

            regularly attended home matches at Anfield last season,          however,         I

            have not been to a match this season.

            I obtained my match ticket Urrough the development office at Anfield.

            The ticket was for the seating area in the West §>Chd and cost me

            twelve pounds.
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S3510

I travelled t n t.hp rriAt-r*h with the following people-

     My son,                      hes Jxfen seen by the Police,

     My other son.

                         I think he lives in                            he travels
              W
to most Liverpool        games with us.

We travelled to Sheffield in my private vehicle.              We went via the M38

motorway and through Manchester.          We only had one real hold up on the

way to Sh/ffield,        that being at the motorway island at the end of the

M&3 ffljyorway,    prior to getting    into Sheffield.    The ho 1d up was due to

t he volume of traffic.         We travelled di rectly to Shef field wi thout

making any stops.

We arrived in Sheff ield at about one thi rty (1330) and parked our car

on the main A61 near to a large hospital about a mile and a half away

from the g r o u n d .   We left our car and bought some chips nearby.          Soon

after                     and         left me and made their own way to the

ground.     This was because they had standing tickets and I was the only

one with a seat ticket.          Shortly after they had left me.       I met an old

friend of mine and had a brief conversation with h i m .           I then made my

own way to the ground.

There we re a lot of othe r people also mak ing their way to the g ro u nd .

I do not recal1 seeing supporters drinking alcohol,             it was m a i n 1y cold

drinks as it was such a warm day.           I did not see any disorder or any

fighting,    neither did I see any drunkeness all the supporters were in

good spirits.       There were a     number of Policemen in the streets on the

way to the ground.         I did not receive any directions from the Police,

but then I did not need any as I knew the way to the ground from

having a tte nde d the cor responding semi final match at Hillsborough in

1988.     I arrived at the turnstile area in Leppings L a n e at some time

between ten past and twenty past two           (1410 1420).    Upon arrival at

the turnstile area it was very busy on both sides,             the standing and
                                                                                      PAGE          3
                                                                                      S3510

         the seating turnstiles.         There was   a large crowd of people in the

         turnstile area outside the seating          turnstiles trying to get inside the

         ground. j F * h e   crowd was unorganised   and there were no queues at all.               I

         remearner thi nk ing at the time that       the re was an obvious lack of
    p.
            licemen outs i de these turnstiles       I d o n ’t thi nk I saw any at all.        I

         did not see any stewards outside the tur ns til es.          The crowd was

         stretching back to the street.           I remember looking at the crowd

         outside the other block of turnstiles to my right,            the standing

         turnstiles.         The congestion was even worse there.      There was alot of

         pushing and shoving        in the crowd where    I w a s , but after a few minutes

^        I got to a turnstile I handed my ticket          in to the turnstile operator

         and was given the stub portion b a c k .        I entered the ground at about

         twenty five past two        (1425).

         Having entered the ground,        I made my way towards the stai r case at the

         rear of the stand,        to the right of the central tunnel.      I think there

         was a sign by the stai r case that said *s t a n d ' I did not see any

         unauthorised entry to the ground at all.            I bought a match programme

         on my way to the staircase.           I did not see any fighting or disorder

         inside the ground,        neither did I see any persons drinking or any

         drunkeness.

^        At the bottom of the staircase that leads to the stand there were six

         stewards.       They were recognisable by their fluorescent bibs.          Two of

         these stewards were checking^"! ckets of people going           into the s t a n d .

    ^X.The other four seemed ta/be standi ng a b o u t , not really do i ng anything

             remember at the adrresponding match last year that at the time we

         got into the grmrfrsd, there were a number of stewards lined up across

         the tunnel ej^france preventing access to it.           There weren't any

         stewards fr f the tunnel this y e a r.      I did not see any Police by the

         tunnel /ntrance,        the only Police that I saw inside the ground were on

          vhe/fnside of the turnstiles         checking certain people as they entered
                                                                               PAGE      4
                                                                               S3510

the ground.      I showed m y ^ M c k e t    to the stewards and made my way up the

staircase.      It was t£*#n quite easy to find my seat as the rows were

lettered and the^f was a steward at the end of the aisle who pointed

out my s e a t v // I took up my seat at about two thirty (1430) .          My seat

was abotrr twenty rows back from the front, and was towards the corner

flag near to the North Stand.               From my seat I could see the front

perimeter fence,      but not the terraces behind.          For the next twenty

five minutes I spent my time reading my match programme and looking

around me to see if there was anybody that I knew.               I watched the

players have their pre match kick about and then turned all my

attentions to the pitch when the game kicked off at three o'clock

(1500).      It was a couple of minutes after the kick off that I became

aware of people climbing over the front perimeter fence behind the

Liverpool goal.       I stood up and I could see people climbing out and

being pulled out from the pen.              My thoughts immediately turned to my

sons          and          who were on the terraces.         I was looking down to

see if I could see them,         but it was not possible to identify anyone

from my position.        I remember seeing a Policeman run onto the pitch

and approach the match referee.              Following this the match was stopped

and the players started to leave the pitch.               My only real thoughts

were for the safety of                          and           I remember seeing a

Policewoman take her tunic off and tend to an injured person on a

hoarding on the pitch down below where I was.               She was obviously

trying to revive the person when another officer, a Sergeant or

Inspector I think,       came over to her,        tapped her on the shoulder and

pulled her away.       The Policewoman was in tears and it was as if she

wanted to go back and carry on trying to revive the person.                 I can't

describe the person on the hoarding              I couldn't even say if the person

was male or female.         I remained by my seat still       looking for

       and               It was not until about ten past four        (1610),    that I

         saw them both on the pitch below me, safe and well.               They shouted up

         to me and said that                     was alright and that they would see me

         outside.          I left my seat straightaway and I met them by the open gate

         that    leads back out into the street.            We left the ground and went to

         find a telephone.         We were allowed the use of a telephone at a garage

         nearby.

         Throughout the course of the afternoon I did not witness anything that

         I would consider to be a criminal              offence.

         I did not sustain any             injury at Hillsborough.

         I did not witness any             deaths or assist with any of the dead or

         I did not see a crush barrier br& # K at any time and I only became

         aware that a crush barrier h^ra broken later that evening.

         I would like to say thaj/xhe              match was badly organised by both the

         Police an^ the FA.                cannot understand why so many Policemen were

         1 ined up aSypossJ & e      cent re of the pitch when they could have been at

         the Leppings Lane end of the ground helping the injured.               The fire

         brigade officers appeared to get much mo re involved than the Police.

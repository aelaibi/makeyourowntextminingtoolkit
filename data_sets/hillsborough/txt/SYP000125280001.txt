 <352

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAHT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS NOBODY WHO APPEARED TO BE IN CONTROL, TOO MANY POLICE WERE BEING

 USED IN CROWD CONTROL STANDING ON THE HALFWAY LINE, AND I D O N ’T REMEMBER ANY

 GIVING FIRST AID THEY ALL APPEARED S T U N N E D .           THERE WAS NO MEDICAL OR

 ^Urgency     equipment       available   until   quite   sometime   later.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IN HINDSIGHT I THINK THAT IF THE INNER GATE HADN'T BEEN OPENED A POTENTIALLY

 SIMILAR SITUATION MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED OUTSIDE.                  WHOEVER OPENED THE GATE

 WAS JUSTIFIED IN OPENING IT BUT HE COULD HAVE HAD BETTER INFORMATION AS

 TO WHAT PENS TO USE.

Q14

 034

 I ^ T H E R E ANYTHING   THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I STOPPED OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND WAITED FOR MY SON AND I

 WITNESSED THE CROWDS GETTING LARGER        OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 I'M NOT THAT INTERESTED IN FOOTBALL.

 AFTER ABOUT 2.30PM THE CROWDS STARTED TO GET VERY OVERCROWDED.

 I HAD TO MOVE OVER TO MY RIGHT FROM OUTSIDE THE WEST STAND

 AND THEN I WAS FORCED TO MOVE OUT INTO LEPPING LANE TO GET OUT

 OF THE CRUSH.

 I ^ E N T UP TO VEER ROAD ABOUT 3-4 SHOPS UP FROM THE GATES.

 I HEARD THE POLICE MAKING REQUESTS FROM A VAN PARKED NEARBY ASKING THE

 LIVERPOOL FANS TO STOP PUSHING THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM INSIDE. THERE

 WAS THREE ANNOUNCEMENTS WHICH BECAME S T R O N G E R , BUT THE CROWDS D I D N ’T

 RESPOND.   I D O N ’T THINK THEY COULD DO ANYTHING IF THEY WANTED TO.

 ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CROWD HAD GONE AND I NEVER REALIZED UNTIL LATER


Qi5

 THAT   THE GATES HAD BEEN OPENED.

 THERE WERE STILL A FEW FANS OUTSIDE AND THE POLICE MAN ON HORSEBACK

 CHASED THE REMAINING FANS FROM OUTSIDE THE GROUND,          THIS   MUST HAVE
                                                                           PAGE

 BEEN WHEN THEY REALIZED SOMETHING HAD GONE ON INSIDE.
             \                  POJ-       13%  ,
 IN MY OPINION 11^ THE GATES HAD NOT BEEN OPENED THERE WOULD HAVE

 BEEN DEATHS OUTSIDE^WITH THE CROWDS T H E R E .

 ONCE THE CROWDS WERE OUTSIDE,    IN MY OPINION YOU COULD HAVE BROUGHT

 IN ALL THE POLICEMEN YOU LIKE AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE HELPED,    IN FACT,

 I THINK THE CROWD MIGHT HAVE PANICKED.

 I THINK THAT THE GATES SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENED BUT THERE SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN SOMEONE INSIDE DIRECTING THEM WHEN THEY GOT THERE.

 THERE WAS JUST CONFUSION OUTSIDE NO ONE KNEW WHERE TO GO.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I D O N ’T THINK ANYBODY COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING BECAUSE I D O N ’T THINK

 ANYONE KNEW THE EXTENT OF THE SITUATION.        MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT BECAUSE OF

 OVERCROWDING PEOPLE WERE BEING LOCATED WITHIN THE GROUND.

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1)    IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE NUMBER OF FANS LEAVING THE TERRACJMS BY A VARIETY

 OF MEANS PRIOR TO THE GAME STARTING THAT OVERCROWDING j ^ S EVIDENT

       AT 2,50 PM <1450) THE SECRETARY, GRAHAM MAC!      Y   AND ANOTHER CLUB OFFICER

 WERE STANDING ON THE HALFWAY LINE POINTING TOWARDS THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACING

 AND WERE IN DISCUSSION AND IT WAS QUITE Ci.EAj* TO ME THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED

 ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE TERRACING.

 3)    GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THE GROUND AND THEIR EXPERIENCE OF PREVIOUS

 PROBLEMS THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, AND CAUSED TO H A P P E N , THE RE-SITTING OF MANY

 FANS TO ADJACENT TERRACING WITH OBVIOUS ROOM TO ACCOMMODATE THEM.

 THE STADIA IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TOTALLY IN ADEQUATE, THE FACILITIES

 GENERALLY FOR FANS ARE BACK IN THE 2 0 ’S .     IT'S TIME THAT STADIA IN THIS

 COUNTRY WERE BUILT TO MEET THE NEEDS AND PROVIDE THE FACILITIES FOR THE

 d(fcoRT OF THE ORDINARY FAN.

 I THINK THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE NEEDS TO GET I T ’S ACT TOGETHER AND SHOULD WORK

 MORE CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY TO SOLVE ONCE AND FOR ALL TO

 SOLVE OVERCROWDING AND RIOTS AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS.

HAVE HELPED AVOID A CHAOTIC SITUATION.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

AN ANNOUNCEMENT COULD AND SHOULD BE USED IN AND OUTSIDE THE GROUNDS,         THE

CONTROL OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE PENS WITHIN THE GROUNDS ALSO NEEDED TO BE

SUPERVISED.     I THOUGHT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE ON DUTY.       THERE

APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF POLICE OR STEWARD CONTROL OVER THE SUPPORTERS

   [SIDE THE GROUND.

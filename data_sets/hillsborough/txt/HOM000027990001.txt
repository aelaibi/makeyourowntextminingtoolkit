                 HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM DISASTER


With      permission,          Mr    Speaker,        I should           like    to m a k e      a
s t a t e m e n t about the final r e p o r t o f Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r ' s
Inquiry       into      the     tragedy        at    the     Hillsborough           football
s t a d i u m in S h e f f i e l d on 15 April 1989, w h i c h is p u b l i s h e d
'today.


S h o r t l y I will, of course, r e f e r to Part 1 of the Football
S p e c t a t o r s Act and the G o v e r n m e n t ' s i n t e n t i o n s w i t h r e s p e c t
thereto.          But that m a t t e r m u s t be put in c o n t e x t and I
will      try to f o l l o w the t h e m e o f the R e p o r t and come to
the m e m b e r s h i p s c h e m e at the r i g h t moment.


We are inde b t e d to Sir P e t e r for the Report, w h i c h is a
careful and t h o r o u g h a n a l y s i s o f w h y we have had so m a n y
m a j o r t r a g e d i e s at football g r o u n d s o v e r the y e a r s and w h y
we have had d i s o r d e r and h o o l i g a n i s m .            Sir P e t e r e x p l a i n s
how in his i n t e r i m r e p o r t he c o n c e n t r a t e d on o v e r c r o w d i n g
b e c a u s e that was the c a u s e of the H i l l s b o r o u g h d i s a s t e r ,
but now he goes on to talk o f a game, the i m a g e o f w h i c h
has been m u c h t a r n i s h e d , and of a b l i g h t o v e r the game d u e
to old grounds,               poor    facilities,          hooliganism,           excessive
d r i n k i n g and poor l e a dership.
 Sir P e t e r does not s p a r e t hose w h o run the industry.                                        He
 says        indeed        that         the        provision          they      make      for        their
c u s t o m e r s is o f t e n not m e r e l y b a s i c but squalid,                            and he
says that s q u a l i d c o n d i t i o n s can have an i m p a c t on s a f e t y
but t h e y also lead to l ower s t a n d a r d s of behaviour.


The Football A s s o c i a t i o n and Football L e a g u e have not seen
it as any part o f t h e i r d u t y to o f f e r g u i d a n c e to clubs
on      safety     matters              and        it    is     questionable            whether        the
directors        of the clubs                      are g e n u i n e l y i n t e r e s t e d    in the
w e l f a r e o f t h e i r own s u p p o r t e r s or t h e i r good b e haviour.

    without         reasonable            excuse:              and      it     also      asks      for

Subject:             Hillsborough chronology update

Attached are the latest actions and events updated to this morning.

Also attached is a copy o f my letter to Hammond Suddards requesting their analysis o f police generated
documents on CPS possession, for the purpose o f voluntary disclosure by us. Their telephone response this
morning is that ACC Daines is now on leave until 4.1.99 as is the reviewing solicitor Peter Metcalfe. They are
therefore unable to assist us until some time after 4.1. They will contact us again early in the N ew Year.

You may feel that we are unable to make a fully informed disclosure decision for the HFSG until we have
established the status o f the many police documents.

The only other documents held that are not subject to PII or legal privilege are transcripts o f evidence o f various
judicial proceedings, and reports and judgements from those proceedings. I have ascertained that there is no
problem with Crown copyright re disclosure o f any documents.

I will be in the office until 1600 today and am then on leave until my return on 5.1.99. However I can be
contacted at home on                    Answerphone) or on my mobile on

Dear Sirs

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY

Further to my fax of yesterday, attached are the two schedules of material
reviewed by the CPS in 1990 and 1997 and still in our possession.

We have been asked by the HFSG to commence disclosure immediately and without
waiting for any judicial review hearing to be set following the intimated
application by both defence solicitors. This request is being considered and a
response will be given as soon as possible.

In order to assist in the provision of voluntary disclosure of relevant and
material documents in the possession of the CPS, I would be grateful if you
could indicate which of the police generated items may be disclosed by u s . I
presume that as South Yorkshire Police have custody of the Hillsborough archive
that the Chief Constable can give permission for disclosure or the waiver of PII
re West Midlands police material.

Perhaps you could arrange for a copy of the schedule to be annotated as to.--
1. Items subject to PII which is not waived.
2. Item subject to PII which can now be waived.
3. Item subject to PII which is known to be in thepublic domain (and therefore
previously waived).
4. Items not subject to PII which known to be in the public domain (and
therefore previously waived).
5. Item not subject to PII and not in the public domain which can be disclosed
6. Any other claim for items.

I am mindful of the rules concerning the disclosure of witnesses’ addresses and
their statements without their consent.  This is a point we may need to consider
for those statements not in the public domain.
I would be grateful if you could indicate today when you might be able to
provide a substantive reply so that I can inform the parties to the private
prosecution of any delays in the making of the CPS decision re voluntary
disclosure.

Yours sincerely

      Dear Mr F.nzor '/ .

     ;Adlingftoii'-v- DuckenfieldandMturray; v
      Leeds Magistrates’ Court - 21 December 1998

      We refer to your letter o f 18 November and note the advice contained therein.

      In regard to the CPS conclusion that “we should not intervene to take over any o f the
      charges” we are bound to say, as per our detailed letter o f submissions dated 9 October
      1998, that full and detailed reasons for the decision taken are required to be made known in
      this situation and we reiterate the request for those reasons.

      We ask for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in coining to its
      conclusion was that set out in your letter o f 27 July 1998 to HFSG, specifically “there is
      clearly no case to answer'7. It may well be implicit that this is the case, but you will
      appreciate the desire for us to clarify the basis for file CPS decision before taking matters
      further.

       Insofar as the letter o f 27 July 1998 maintains that the CPS policy in this case builds o n that
       contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, please advise which aspects o f the Code have
       been considered in coming to the conclusion reacted, and the weight given to any such
       factors.

       You w ill appreciate that as the criminal prosecution is proceeding, we are bound to take any

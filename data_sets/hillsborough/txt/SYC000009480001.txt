      Dear S i r s ,
                                          /
      Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.



      If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
      of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represeat,
      on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
      due course.

      I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
      evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
      coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
      inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

      Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
      under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
      witnesses who wis h to give evidence.         I am at present engaged in considering
      this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

      Wit hou t prejudice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
      to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
      appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
      consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

      M a y I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
      attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

      I also w a n t to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
      names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
      to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

      I. would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
      h e a r d from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       Yours f a i t h f u l l y .

He:                • .

As you a xe aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
“be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
 on the 15th of January 1990.

 I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
 behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
 Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake.

 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 lours faithfully,

    We refer to previous correspondence in connection with this
    matter.  We do of course appreciate that for very obvious reasons
    it will be some time before the Inquest in full will be convened
    but in the meantime, in view of the distress that the
    continuation of this matter is causing to our clients, we would
    be obliged to receive advance disclosure of the post mortum
    report and await hearing from you.


    Yours faithfully

                     /

 I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
In \eath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
   .k Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
 following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

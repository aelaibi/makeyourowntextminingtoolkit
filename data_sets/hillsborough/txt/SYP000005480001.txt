Vauxhal1 Belmont.

We a r r i v e d        at     1.15pm         (1313)         in S h e f f i e l d     having         me t    no m a j o r         delays,

we     did    not       stop       on    route        we     parked       the    car      in    ’H a l f o r d ' s       car P a r k 5

about        h al f     a mile          from       the     Hillsborough             Stadium.

At     approximately                 1_125prn we           arrived        at    Hillsborough                Stadium           and      called

in a     take-away              food       outlet          to    get     something         to    eat,        t h is      was      n ea r     to

the     Leppings             Lane       entrance           to H i l l s b o r o u g h .

At     about       2.30pm          (1430)          myself        and David          made       our    way        to    the       Leppings

Lane     entrance             to     enter         the     ground,        we    had    tossed         up w h o         was       to    ha ve

what     t ic k e t ,        1 was       to    have        the    seated        North      Stand        ticket           and      David

wa s    to    have       the       standing           West       Stand      ticket.

On arrival              at    the       Leppings           Lane       there     appeared         to     be a g r e a t            number

of     supporters             milling          about,           not    making       their       way     into          the     ground         but

just     stood about.                      I saw         no a l c o h o l      consumption.                 On    entering             the

Leppings           Lane       g at e     myself          and     David      were      split      up     p r i or       to     going

thr      _         he    designated                turnstiles.              David      was      to    enter           by a n o t h e r

turnstile             to me        so    1 j us t        forced        my way       through          the     crowd          to    the

turnstile             designated              for     the N o r t h       Stand.          The    entire           enclosure

between           the m a i n L e p p i n g s            Lane     entrance          and    the       turnstiles               was      full.

I only        queued a             couple          of m i n u t e s      once    reaching            the N o r t h S t a n d

turnstile,              on e n t e r i n g         I was        searched        I then made            my way            to      the    seat

on d i r e c t i o n         of a s t e w a r d .

Before        entering             the     ground          I had made           arrangements                to m e e t        up w i t h

David        Be n s o n after            the       match        had    finished.

The     match         was     abandoned             due     to    the     disturbance            in the          West         Stand.

Prior        to    this       I observed              t ha t     pens     3 and       4 behind          the      West         Stand        goal

were     over-flowing                   this was           about       1440     h o u r s , from        t h is        I hoped          D a v id

had     not       made       his     way      to    th at       ar ea,    but    I did         not    know       what         particular

p e n he w o u l d           stand       in.

On     instruction              by      the    public           address        system      I left           the N o r t h         Stand

                                                                                                                                        S548

             and    made    my way        to   the       p l a ce    I had       previously            arranged         to m e e t      up

             with    D av i d ,     I waited         u n til        most    supporters            h ad    left      the      gr ound and

             as    David    had     not    returned            I made       my way       b a ck    to     the     car     and     then

             returned       to     the    ground,         at   about        5.15pm        (1715)         1' c o n t a c t e d    home    to

             enquire       whether        David      had made             any    contact.

             I was    also        unsuccessful            when       I contacted           the     emergency            telephone

             numbers.         I then wa it e d            at   the        car    park    for      my     father      to a r r i v e .

             David's       parents        also    arrived            at    the    same     time.          Together           with    lir a n d

             Mrs    Benson        I attended         a    p o 1 i ce      stat i on     in H i l l s b o r o u g h      to      furnish

                  F r o m w he re      I was      standing       prior    to the m atch           I had a clear view of

                  fans a p p r o ac h i n g       the W S t a n d    turnstiles         from Leppirtgs Ln.

                  F r o m a bout       12 onwards        there was a steady               influx of supporters,               most        in

                  t ickets       at    the      players entrance.           These     had     to be dir er ct ed a ro u n d         the

                  g ro u nd     to the       players     entrance.

                  A    lot of F orest            suppo rt er s    tried     to get      through       the sterile a rea           but

                  had       to be sent          round   the ground.

                  A number        of      infirm and e l d e r l y were          e sc o r t e d   through the area          to other

             The     numbers were          immense,        impossible          to    control,       they were        being

Dear Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,

Re: hillsb o r o u ch - Kevin w il l ia m s    (Deceased)

I am grateful fo r the lette r dated 16th December 1997 fro m th e Secretary to th e scrutiny
(CF Bone), i am particularly appreciative to be given th e o p p o rtu n ity to read th e le tte r
fro m Dr. lain west, indeed, Mrs. Anne william s has w ritte n to me personally in th e past
about th e pathological findings in her son Kevin. I have always a tte m p te d courteous
replies b u t pointed o u t th a t it was perhaps u n fo rtu na te th a t I had never been given th e
o p p o rtu n ity to speak o r liaise directly w ith her independent experts.

as   you w ill be aware, pathology is rarely absolute and experts n o t in fre q u e n tly have
d iffe rin g opinions.

I feel th e fo llo w in g points are w o rth y o f com m ent.

1.      Usage o f th e te rm trau m atic asphyxia

A t th e beginning o f th e autopsies on th e Hillsborough casualties, there was a discussion
am ongst th e pathologists in attendance on th e Sunday m orning ab ou t th e m ost
appropriate term inology fo r deaths th a t were due to asphyxia and being crushed. There
was agreem ent th a t w here breathing/respiration had been restricted (with specific
reference to the chest) and th a t this was th e predom inant factor, th a t th e term traum atic
asphyxia was appropriate as th e cause o f death. Most authorities regard this as equivalent
to crush asphyxia. Bernard Knight in his te xtb o o k astutely m entions th a t th e te rm is
unfortunate as it could equally be applied to entities such as hanging and strangulation.

                                                   I
     However, in th e case o f th e Hillsborough autopsies, it was used in th e usual sense already
     stated, it was accepted by th e pathologists in attendance th a t th e exact patho­
     physiological mechanisms leading to death in th e crush situation w ould probably be
     variable. I should perhaps explain th a t individuals dying fro m causes such as drow ning and
     hanging can also have d iffe re n t patho-physiological mechanisms leading to death and
     d iffe re n t autopsy appearances, w e still use, however, th e term s drow ning and hanging,
     it was considered th a t th e same principle applied to traum atic asphyxia, w e have to be
     very honest w ith ourselves as doctors th a t th e exact mechanisms leading to death in
     traum atic asphyxia are n o t totally and fully understood. This fa ct is interestingly im plied
     in Dr. west's le tte r w here he refers to both im pa irm en t o f respiration and also physical
     interference o f blood return as factors. These d iffe re n t mechanisms will, w ith o u t doubt,
     give rise to d iffe re n t autopsy appearances. For example, th e classical te xtb o o k changes
     o f traum atic asphyxia are probably b e tte r explained by physical interference o f return of
     blood, w ith o u t d o u b t many cases are mixed in th e ir mechanisms.

     Perthes original description o f traum atic asphyxia in 1900 certainly dealt w ith th e classical
'W   severe extrem e which is well described in forensic m edicine textbooks. Pathologists
     involved at Hillsborough were, however, also very m indful o f co n trib u tio ns by, fo r
         ample, Poison & Gee in th e ir textbook on forensic medicine. They clearly highlight th a t
     a i times the signs o f traum atic asphyxia can be negligible. This is also in keeping w ith the
     views o f Professor Simpson w ho also considered th a t at tim es th e dem onstration o f
     traum atic asphyxia was n o t easy and close scrutiny was required, interestingly, the
     litera tu re reports o f this latte r group w ith fe w e r changes relate to instances such as
     ‘pinning’. I was privileged to see many o f the autopsies on the Hillsborough casulties (not
     only my own) and it was very clear th a t a broad spectrum o f changes was observed w ith
     reference to traum atic asphyxia. In essence, these varied fro m m ild to severe.

     in view o f th e problems over th e last few years w ith Hillsborough, I have o f course given
     careful retrospective consideration to th e te rm in o lo g y used. If deaths w ere due to
     crushing and asphyxia, exactly w hat term inology should have been used? It could still be
     debated w hether th e te rm traum atic asphyxia should be used only in th e original classical
     sense o r in th e broader fashion th a t incorporates all evidence fro m th e literature.
     Perhaps retrospectively it w ould have been b e tte r to simply have given th e cause o f
     death as 'crushing' o r ‘asphyxia due to crushing'. This would, w ith o u t doubt, have
     circumvented the current problems. It could also have then covered th e neck, chest and
     abdomen.

     I have n o t been able to review the autopsy reports o f o th e r pathologists involved w ith
     th e Hillsborough autopsies. I suspect, however, th a t a significant percentage o f deaths
     fro m stated traum atic asphyxia will n o t have w holeheartedly conform ed to classical
     criteria.    This was also th e impression gained by myself as one o f th e only tw o
     pathologists w ho attended th e Hillsborough stadium.

     My own usage o f th e words traum atic asphyxia as a cause o f death incorporated the
     opinion th a t th e asphyxia was due to a restriction o f respiratory movem ents. I accepted
     the literature evidence th a t a spectrum o f changes o f degree would be seen, usage of the
     term was n o t exclusive to th e existence o r c o n trib u tio n o f injuries elsewhere.




                                                   2
2.        Specific points relating to my autopsy on Kevin WILLIAMS

I feel it useful to co m m en t on several specific aspects o f my autopsy on Kevin w il lia m s .

My autopsy re p o rt draws specific attention to extensive cyanosis extending down to the
upper part o f th e chest. This was particularly severe down to th e level o f th e clavicle and
then unequivocally present b u t less severe to a level approxim ately below th e nipples. I
had the firm opinion th a t there was a distinct compression line extending fro m th e rig h t
axilla below th e rig h t nipple and across th e chest. The skin compression, I interpreted,
was below th a t line o f demarcation. The congestion and cyanosis was above th e line. This
appearance was very comparable to many o f th e Hillsborough autopsies, n o t only my
own.

Although all autopsies w ere undertaken carefully and th o ro u g h ly th e re was no im plied
necessity to photograph all significant findings, as fo r example is th e norm in cases of
m u rde r and manslaughter. I believe this approach was adopted by all pathologists and
was appropriate fo r th e problem in hand.

   otograph 51-1 was th e general body ide n tifica tion photograph taken on all casualties.
II was n o t taken specifically to show injuries. It does, however, show th e tw o types <of
cyanosis already m entioned, one can discern th e severe typ e extending to th e clavicle
and th e less d istinct typ e to below th e nipple. I have to accept, however, th a t
photographic representation o f this is poor. It was not, however, as explained, th e reason
fo r th e photograph.

 Likewise photographs 51.2 and 51.3 were taken specifically to show th e neck injuries.
 They were n o t taken to show th e chest cyanosis. I do n o t believe they are interpretable
 w ith regard to this in view o f photographic edge e ffe c t and flare. Indeed, the
 photographic legends makes no claim to show this fo r these reasons. I note these edge
 and flare effects are also visible in o th e r photographs (such as Hammond 93.2).

 A significant autopsy fin d in g (not m entioned by Dr. west) was th e presence o f bruises
 w ithin the heart muscle itself. I fe lt this was strong confirm atory evidence o f some fo rm
 of crushing/compressive trauma to th e chest. This appeared to f i t in w ith th e low er line
 o f cyanotic demarcation.

 Although n o t o f th e extrem e classical type, my autopsy re p o rt does indicate severe
 asphyxial changes in term s o f extensive cyanosis o f th e face to g e th e r w ith petechial and
 larger purpuric haemorrhages. There were also large purpuric haemorrhages on the brain
 surface w ith congestion o f th e blood vessels.

 The existence o f neck injuries sustained by Kevin are clearly n o t in d o u b t and are
 described in th e form al autopsy report. In my opinion, th e pallor on th e neck am idst th e
 blue areas o f cyanosis indicated compression to this area and was consistent w ith th e
 underlying laryngeal injuries. Although th e larynx was undoubtedly fractured, I fe lt th a t
 the contribution o f th e injuries to death was uncertain. As highlighted specifically in my
 report, there was no associated bruising o f th e neck muscles, oedema and swelling o f the
 larynx was also absent. Although Hillsborough was n o t comparable, deaths fro m fo r
 example strangulation w ould usually have such injuries.

     I was and remain o f th e firm opinion th a t Kevin died predom inantly fro m compression
     to th e area o f th e chest largely below th e nipples. I also believe th a t th e re had been

                                                   3
compression to th e neck area w ith associated injuries which on balance should be
regarded as a c o n trib u to ry factor. I fe lt th a t stating th e cause o f death as traum atic
asphyxia was appropriate to th e overall situation. This was in no way intended to
downgrade th e possible significance o f th e neck injuries. I certainly th a t th e death was
far m ore complex fro m purely injuries to th e neck and incorporated a strong com ponent
o f traum atic asphyxia. These findings, presumably, reflected th e m u ltip lic ity and
com plexity o f crushing events w ith crowd situations.

I have b rie fly reviewed th e 17 autopsies undertaken by myself on th e Hillsborough
casualties. Approxim ately one th ird o f these had associated neck injuries in addition to
traum atic asphyxia due to restriction o f breathing. Two o f these actually had fractures
to th e larynx. In all these instances, I regarded traum atic asphyxia as th e prim ary
significant process and used it as th e cause o f death.

Approximately tw o thirds o f th e cases o f traum atic asphyxia examined by myself on th e
Hillsborough casualties showed changes th a t fell well below those regarded as classical in
textbooks o f forensic medicine, indeed, a small num ber could be contrued as mild . so ft
tissue injuries w ere present in th e chest in some b u t it was certainly n o t th e norm .
   eluding those cases w ith definitive neck injuries, I have reviewed th e casualties in th e
pnotographic album w ith specific reference to th e degree o f facial cyanosis present,
approxim ately tw o thirds I w ould regard it as mild and in th e others severe.

 in summary I am able to review th e autopsy findings on Kevin WILLIAMS in th e co n te xt o f
 m v o v S ' experience on o th e r Hillsborough casualties. The findings are entirely
 consistent w ith o th e r casualties dying fro m traum atic asphyxia in th e absence o f nec
  injuries indeed, some o th e r casualties dying fro m traum atic asphyxia in th e absence o f
  neck injuries had an essentially similar appearance. I believe th a t this gives strong
 supportive evidence to my opinion th a t th e neck injuries do n o t have to be regarded as
 th e prim ary cause o f death.

 l regard it as m ore meaningful to possibly consider and in te rp re t th e injuries sustained by
 Kevin w illiam s in th e overall context o f Hillsborough rather than o th e r variable situations
 where traum atic asphyxia can occur.

 3.      Dr. lain west's le tte r

 Hopefully, th e preceding com m ents will facilitate my response to Dr. lain w e sts letter.
 Dr. lain w est based his opinion purely on autopsy photographs and my own autopsy
 report, unfortunately, photographs are notoriously variable in th e ir ability to accurately
 portray pathological findings such as colour. This is especially so when, as already
 explained, photographs w ere n o t taken to show th e points in question.

  Hopefully, I have already covered m ost relevant aspects o f th e te rm traum atic asphyxia
  com m ented upon by Dr. west. With reference to th e striking effects o f traum atic
  asphyxia, Dr. w e st uses th e te rm ‘generally'. This w ould th e re fo re, presumably, im ply
  meaning ‘n o t always', as already com m ented upon, Dr. w est himself appears to accept
  th a t d iffe re n t mechanisms o f death operate in traum atic asphyxia. He does n o t com m ent
  specifically on th e literature evidence a ttrib u tin g traum atic asphyxia to cases w ith less
  than striking changes. As already explained, Kevin w il l ia m s , in my opinion, did show
  changes o f significant asphyxia and findings consistent (and inte rp re te d by myself as
  indicative) w ith chest compression.


                                                  4
I accept th a t th e re has to be a degree o f expert uncertainty about th e haemorrhages
w ith in th e lungs. My personal usage o f th e words petechial haemorrhages certainly
relates to asphyxia rather than bruising. The larger haemorrhages in th e lungs could have
been asphyxial o r bruising. I believe th e la tte r b u t accept th e doubt.

I note Dr. west's com m ent about th e absence o f pathological findings relating to bruising
on th e skin o f th e chest wall and muscles. This com m ent, however, relates to th e plane
o f dissection between skin and chest on opening th e body. Like myself, I am n o t aware
th a t any pathologist extensively incised th e skin and muscles to seek o u t possible 'hidden'
bruises, in cases th a t on an alternative basis were deemed to be traum atic asphyxia. I have
again reviewed my own experience in th e 17 autopsies on th e Hillsborough casualties. A
small num ber (3) sustained chest bruising o r rib fractures. In o th e r instances, o f cases o f
undoubted traum atic asphyxia, such injuries were generally absent.                    I have been
undertaking autopsies fo r various hm Coroners fo r nearly 20 years and th e to ta l num ber
is in th e order o f many thousand. This has incorporated a m oderate num ber o f cases of
traum atic asphyxia due to vehicle injuries and th e m ining industry. Accordingly, I can
concur w ith Dr. west's opinion th a t such injuries are indeed often present. They were not,
however, a fre q u e n t and absolute fin d in g at Hillsborough. This in some way m ust be
   'ated to th e nature o f th e crushing/com pression/pinning events,                   suggested
explanations could be made b u t th e exact reason has to be accepted as uncertain. It does
indicate, however, th a t one cannot automatically extrapolate and expect observations in
one particular situation fro m o th e r heterogeneous causes o f traum atic asphyxia. I feel
th a t th e absence of findings should th e re fo re n o t be th e reason fo r excluding a cause of
death when th e findings were also absent in o th e r d e fin itive cases.          Also, when the
injuries lie on a spectrum o f degree and th a t th e re w ere o th e r indications o f traum atic
asphyxia.

I should also add, th a t although n o t com m ented upon by Dr. West, th e bruising to the
heart muscle was supportive to crushing/compression o f th a t area o f th e chest. Indeed,
one o th e r o f my Hillsborough autopsies showed n o t only bruising to the heart b u t actual
laceration.

A remarkable feature o f th e neck injuries was th e virtual to ta l absence o f neck muscle
 bruising or swelling o f th e respiratory passages. For myself, this possibly downgraded the
 importance o f the neck injuries. Dr. w est feels th a t th e prim ary and only cause o f death
was compression o f th e neck. I would be unhappy to fo rm this opinion in th e absence of
associated so ft tissue injuries and th e features elsewhere. My own opinion was th a t the
primary cause o f death was compression o f th e chest. As already explained, evidence at
autopsy showed w ha t to me was clear compression o f th e chest below th e level o f the
nipples.      This was associated w ith cyanosis above and heart damage providing
co n firm a tory evidence. I also fe lt th a t th e re was unequivocal compression o f th e neck
and associated injuries. I regard these, however, as c o n trib u to ry rather than prim ary. I
find it paradoxical th a t Dr. w est considers th e neck injuries as th e only cause o f death, in
th e absence o f so ft tissue injuries b u t then criticises traum atic asphyxia as th e cause of
death, when s o ft tissue injuries w ere also absent.


I also note Dr. west's com m ents w ith regard to emergency tre a tm e n t. My own opinion
is th a t crich o th yro id o to m y w ould n o t have in any way altered th e fatal sequence o f
events in Kevin w il lia m s , especially as th e re was no significant s o ft tissue damage or
swelling o f th e laryngeal tissues, to cause respiratory obstruction
You will be aware o f my opinion on th e tim in g o f Kevin WILLIAMS' death fro m my main
inquest evidence. I feel th a t I should say th a t this was, in my opinion, strongly supported
by the area o f defined pallor on th e neck to g e th e r w ith the demarcation line o f cyanosis
on th e chest. A t th e tim e, I felt, and still do th a t any significant circulation a fte r release
o fth e crushing episode w ould have altered this evidence. Especially over 15 m inutes or
so (up to 3.30 pm). Accordingly, I fe lt th a t Kevin was essentially dead around th e tim e the
compressive forces w ere released.

For similar reasons, if th e neck injuries had been th e only cause o f death (which I do n o t
accept), l believe my opinion on th e tim in g o f death w ould have been broadly similar. I
note th a t Dr. w est in his discussion on neck injuries and speed o f death, does n o t qualify
th e term s 'quite quickly' and 'significantly longer'.


4.     Amending o f statistical in form atio n

perhaps relevant to this cu rre n t discussion are com m unications in 1985 between Mrs.
Anne williams, Mr. c.P. Dorries (HM Coroner, Sheffield) and myself. I believe th a t Mrs.
   illiams at th e tim e, was a tte m p tin g to change th e w ording on th e coroner's A fte r
mquest Certificate, as fa r as I understand, this is used by th e Coroner to assist statistical
collection by g o vern m e nt sources. Mrs. william s was a tte m p tin g to change th e parts of
th e body injured fro m 'chest' to 'neck' and th e typ e o f injury marked as 'crush' to
‘com pression’, I remain com pletely neutral w ith regard to interchange between the
words crush and compression. As far as I understand, however, Mr. Dorries did n o t perm it
this. I did take Mrs. williams point, however, th a t th e actual dem onstrable tissue injuries
sustained w ere predom inantly neck rather than chest. However, this was n o t m eant to
imply, in my mind, th a t those injuries w ere th e m ost significant o r th e only cause of
death. Compression o f th e chest, although clearly highly significant, simply produced less
definitive perm anent tissue injuries. The change, as you will see, was n o t m eant to alter
th e overall co n te xt o f my autopsy re p o rt o r th e cause o f death. It was m ore o f a
sym pathetic gesture, on a n o t to ta lly unreasonable medical basis, to a relative who
continued to be substantially distressed. Mr. Dorries at th e tim e, (in w riting) I feel quite
correctly, com m ented th a t th e re w ould appear to be little gain in adding to Mrs. Anne
williams' distress simply fo r th e sake o f being inflexible. In view o f cu rre n t events,
perhaps retrospectively it can be seen to have been unwise. The legal/statistical
definitions relating to th e certificate w ere never fu lly explained to me. However, if the
parts injured were m eant to relate to th e prim ary cause o f death, th e alteration was
probably u n fo rtu na tely inappropriate.

I will, o f course, be only to o happy to answer any fu rth e r queries.

  HILLSBOROUGH - KEVIN WILLIAMS




  Thank you for your letter of 4 December to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

 2.       The Judge has asked me to reply and to say that he is grateful to you for writing. He
 has also asked me to seek any comments you may have on the attached letter he has had from
 Dr Iain West, who has advised Mrs Anne Williams about her son Kevin’s case. The parts of
 Dr West’s letter which are particularly relevant are the last paragraph on the first page and the
 first two on the second page.

 3.      Dr West adheres to the view that Kevin died as a result of compression to the neck
 rather than to the chest or to both neck and chest. As we understand it he examined
 photographs of Kevin Williams, and did not undertake a post-mortem examination of his
 body. He says ‘there is no evidence o f the changes which are associated with traumatic
 asphyxia resulting from concurrent compression o f the chest wall'.

4.             I should be grateful for any further thoughts you may have on this.

The Hillsborough Scrutiny,

Dear Lord Justice Stuart Smith,

Re: HILLSBOROUGH

You will be aware fro m th e Hillsborough evidence th a t I was th e pathologist w ho
u n de rto o k the autopsy on Kevin w il l ia m s and also th e pathologist portrayed in the
‘McGovern Hillsborough' television docum entary.

A th ird party (not directly involved w ith the Hillsborough tragedy) has suggested th a t I
should w rite to you. indeed, until earlier this week, I was n o t aware th a t it was permissible
to do so. i assumed th a t one w ould be contacted if appropriate.

i have a form al com plaint lodged w ith the Broadcasting standards Commission ab ou t my
portrayal in the McGovern Programme. This, however, has been suspended by th e BSC in
view o f your scrutiny, i have w ritte n to the BSC stating that, if permissible, I w ould have
no objections to my form al com plaint being made available to you. Granada, in fact, have
defended th e ir program m e by stating th a t there was no im plied criticism o f my actions.

Dr. walker reviewed the program me in the British Medical Journal (BMJ vol 13 7 December
1996 p 1491). I have a published reply dated th e 22nd March 1997 page 901 (copy
enclosed).

Although I undertook several o f the autopsies, I am aware o f opinions relating to my
involvem ent w ith the case o f Kevin w il l ia m s . In summary, these have comprised :
1.    That pressure may have been b ro u g h t to bear on pathologists to make th e ir
evidence f i t a 3.15 pm cu t-o ff tim e.

2    That there may have been a conspiracy between a pathologist or pathologists, HM
coroner and even the police to suppress or even alter witness evidence.

3        The accuracy o f my own autopsy evidence in relation to the case o f Kevin Williams.

My responses are as fo llo w s :

A.    Despite th e adverse publicity, I remain reasonably happy w ith th e facts and
opinions conveyed by myself in my autopsy reports. Also, my opinions expressed a t the
inquests.

B        I understand th a t at least one other expert pathologists opinion has been sought
w ith reference to Kevin Williams. I cannot com m ent on this as I have i     S
to see the report(s). I have, however, heard hearsay in fo rm a tio n about th e report. The
opinion may have stated th a t severe swelling o f the airways may have caused obstruction
a n d h a v T ^ een amenlable to firs t aid rectification, such swelling was absent on my
autopsy examination o f Kevin williams.

c     My involvem ent w ith the Hillsborough tragedy was lim ited to the autopsies giving
oral evidence seeing many relatives a fte r my oral evidence at:m >in te rim i n a u e s t and
speaking to one witness (PC Bruder). I regard my involvem ent as th e re by peripheral an
in many respects having been drawn in secondarily to th e cu rren t problems.

    D     Having undertaken th e autopsies, I had no or minimal w ritte n or verbal
    com m unication w ith Dr.popper between undertaking th e autopsies and giv'ng oral
    evidence I had m inim um com m unication w ith Dr. popper during the inquest w ith the
    exception o f th e T a sT o f Kevin Williams. I have had no or m inim al w ritte n o r verbal
    com muniation w ith HM coroner since the com pletion o f the inquests. I had never worked
                        o r Popper p rio r to Hillsborough and did n o t w ork fo r him again a fte r
    Hillsborough.

    f       I was at no tim e involved w ith recom m ending a 3.15 pm cu t-o ff tim e fo r the
    inquest indeed my autopsy reports made no specific co m m en t ab ou t th e tim in g of
    death. I made no'com m ent to HM Coroner about this p rio r tci giving <
    tim e I was somewhat surprised bv th e artificial concept o f a 3.15 pm cut-off tim e and the
    exclusion o f evidence fo llo w in g th a t tim e. I am, however, appreciative o f^ th e le g a l
    reasoning behind it.sim ilarly,however, I also understand th e reasoning behind the
    criticism o f relatives w ith regard to this point.

    F        in view o f th e tim e interval, I am unsure when I firs t heard th a t a 3.15 pm [cut-off
    p o in t was being m uted. I believe, however, th a t th e re m ust have been at least an
    unofficial rum our during the interim inquests in view o f HM coroner's response to the PC
    Bruder evidence.

     c       Prior to giving oral evidence on Kevin Williams, I was requested by HM co ron e r (in
     th e presence o? a police officer) to read th re e witness statements. These are still ,n my
     possession and relate to Derek Bruder, Debra Martin and Michael craighill.

     There appeared to be uncertainty at th e tim e w he the r th e individuals referred to in the
     statements o f Martin and Bruder did relate to Kevin williams. The uncerta'n^ ^ f ^ unc^ :
     th a t the statem ent o f Debra Martin was given no m ore emphasis to myself and was n o t
considered fu rth e r. I was requested, however, to consider carefully th e statem ent o f PC
Bruder Although th e tim es were n o t stated, th e possibility was raised o f life being
present in a casualty a fte r th e 3.15 pm c u t-o ff p o in t and perhaps even at 3.32 pm. The
re p o rt included medical features such as convulsions, a pulse and being sick.

My professional opinion expressed at th e inquest was th a t Kevin wj[ | iar™
somatically or brain dead by the 3.15 pm cut-off tim e. My opinion was th a t he w ould n o t
have been alive, if indeed he was th a t casualty, in view o f my autopsy findings The main
autopsy finding in relation to this opinion was the presence o f 'compression pallor o f the
skin. I do and still do believe th a t this w ould have disappeared if Kevin Williams was th a t
casualty and had been alive a t th a t tim e.

in view o f th e im portance o f PC Bruder's statem ent, it seemed desirable to explore tha
medical aspects w ith him. This was undertaken w ith th e full permission and approval
^ o m HM CoroneT This was purely to enable myself to assess th e strength o f my own
evidence in retetlon to PC Bruder's evidence. Even fo r doctors, deciding th a t a person is
“       S      s o     S    extremely d ifficult. Especially so w ith th e distinction between
somatic and brain stem death.

 Mavina listened to PC Bruder's evidence, I felt no professional need to alter my own
 iDinion I found that PC Bruder was in essence a lay person with very limited knowledge
 nf Hrst aid For example he had no knowledge that a first aider could feel their own pulse
                                   it being th a t o f the casualty. His concept o f convulsions was
 n o ^ th a t u r d e r s to S in medical term inology. People w ho are deceased can also
 regurgitate stomach contents into their mouth.

 MV opinion tn a t Kevin Williams died in th e wav th a t I stated was M sed on th e balance o f
 probabilities having read PC Bruder's evidence and having spoken to him.

 i havp no knowledge as to w hy PC Bruder was n o t invited to give evidence.in my own
 nrnfpssional practice I often come across situations where there are differences in ° P |ni° ^

  of our conversation.

  i rprtainlv discussed the m atter with PC Bruder on the telephone. Also, as far as I can
     mpm her I also believe that I m e t PC Bruder face to face at the Medico-Legal Centre,
  Sheffield in’ the presence o f a police officer, unfortunately, my diary relating to this tim e
  fc n n fnnnpr in E     S      Also as yet I have been unable to confirm this latte r point
  s p £ H                                          to the start o f your scrutiny but, o f course,
  to o k it no fu rth e r action when I heard your scrutiny was to commence.

  I am personally aware o f no pressure fro m HM co ron e r or th e police to pressurise PC
  Bruder to change his evidence.

  I also received no pressure fro m HM coroner or the police to make my pathological
  evidence f i t any presum ptive 3.15 pm cu t-o ff point.

  I had no verbal or written communication with the police officer who was involved with
  PC Bruder's second statement.
h.      it should be m entioned th a t I regularly m eet police officers in th e course o f road
tra ffic accidents w ho act as ide n tifyin g officers, it is virtually norm al practice on these
occasions to enquire about signs o f life and death w ith respect to casualties. This is to aid
HM Coroner about when and where th e casualties have died. For this reason, talking to
PC Bruder did n o t seem o u t w ith th e norm .

I.    My discussions w ith o th e r pathologists were lim ited to those during the
perform ance o f th e autopsies. There was agreem ent th a t w here appropriate the term
traumatic/crush asphyxia' would be used as a cause o f death. Although at times this can
have restricted pathological meaning, it was fe lt th a t the usage o f this te rm ino lo gy was
appropriate in the co n te xt th a t several mechanisms o f death could occur.

J.     w ith reference to my own experience, at th e tim e o f Hillsborough, I had been
practising pathology fo r 17 years. My tim e as a consultant histopathologist had been 12
years. During this tim e I had undertaken thousands o f autopsies on both unnatural and
natural deaths. I had both training and experience in Home Office w ork under Professor
Alan usher. I had also acted as a locum forensic pathologist fo r professor usher in the
Sheffield area during his absence.

ironically, I also wear an additional hat o f being an examiner in firs t aid fo r St. John's
Mnbulance.


SUMMARY

in summary, I believe th a t I gave an accurate professional facts and opinion to the Court
about the autopsies I undertook, w ith no bias to any party.

I certainly applied no pressure to any th ird party to alter th e ir evidence. I also
experienced no pressure myself to ensure th a t my pathological findings fitte d any
presumptive tim in g o f events.

My pathological opinions were based purely on my own autopsy findings and nothing
else.


Yours sincerely,

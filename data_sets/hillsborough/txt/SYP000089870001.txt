Those officers who were                 engaged on public                  order    patrols during            the

evening      of Fr id ay      14 April       1989     (140489)         were briefed at 7 .00pm                     (1900)

that day by Ins Beeden.                   I prepared a brief>fng of all                      other      officers

which took        place at 9 . 0 0 a m       (0900)       on S a t u r d a y    15 April       1989     (150489),

in the gy mn as iu m at 14est Bar PoliceiStyation.                              I began my briefing                  by

referring       to the ope ra ti on of the                previous year and e xp lained to the

officers       present     that      the single major                difference was that               superv is io n

of traffic was          not    to be our         responsibility.                I then      ref err red to the
public order         patrols which had been             in ope ra ti on since 7. 0 0 p m     (1900)

the    previous      evening and     I reported that           no football       related    public

disorder        had occurred.       The    officers who        had been enga ge d on the

F r i d a y evening     public    order    patrols were        not    present at my briefing

and    I referred to their          returning       to duty at m i d -d ay to continue             their

public order         r es po nsibilities       until    the early hours of the following

mo rni n g .

I   referred then to the           police      op er at io n at the M i d la nd Station.           I

e xp la in ed that a single         special      train was travelling            from Liverpool

and that that w o ul d arrive at W a d s l e y Bridge R a i lw ay Station.                     I

referred to service trains                from Liverpool        and other       parts of the

country        carrying Liverpool         supporters w h ic h w ould u n d o u bt ed ly arrive

at M i d l an d S t a ti on as w ould all        special      trains    carrying       supporters

from Nottingham.

1' e x p l a in ed that our      intention was         that   rival    football       supporters

w o u ld be segr eg at ed on the          platforms      by B r i ti sh T ra nsport Police

Officers,        that Liverpool      supporters w o ul d be directed towards                 the

S o u th    luggage exit and N o t t i n g h a m    supporters        towards    the N o rt h end

gate       in Sheaf Street.       Liverpool        s upporters w o ul d be e n co ur ag ed to

board S outh Yor ks hi re T ransport             buses    parked      in Cross Turner Street

and N o t t i n g h a m supporters w o ul d be s im ilarly encou ra ge d to board

buses       parked   in Sheaf Street.           It was    hoped that      they w o ul d    return to

the R a i l wa y S t a t i o n by bus and       con se qu en tl y they w ould         required to pay

a return fare of £ 1 . 0 0 when boarding at                   the M i d la nd Station.       S o ut h

Y or ks hi re Tra ns po rt    had provided 35 buses each of w h ic h w o ul d                convey

80 passengers.           It was    our    i ntention that as supporters                emerged from

the    platform and made          their way to the buses              selective       searches would

be carried out by officers.                 I i nstructed officers             that    they should

look       for offensive weapons?          drink and any        person who was the worse

for drink and         I s u g g es te d that    if it became         obvious    that searches

liquor w o ul d discard         it prior        to his being       searched-

As each bus was occup ie d 2 constables were                       to board the bus and

a c c o m p a n y the driver    to the football           stadium.        It was hoped that

the bus w ou ld be able to                return to the R a i lw ay S t a ti on and            I

inst ru ct ed officers         to    return on the empty buses                 so that       they might

make further         journeys.        Once    it became     impossible          for    the buses to

return to the R a i l w a y S t a t i o n due to traffic             congestion w h ic h we

had hoped w o u l d not,be           before 2. 4 3 p m    (1445)    officers w o u l d         remain

some    football        supp or ters were emerging amidst                    ordinary    rail

H i l l s b o r o u g h Football   Gr ou nd were       requesting addditional              police

manpower.         I informed him that              the m a j o r i t y of    *D* D iv i s i o n officers

were alre ad y at the ground and that                     only 3 serials          remained        in the

city     centre.        I could see some of those officers                     taking     their meal           in

the     restaurant at West Bar Police S t a t i o n and                     I informed the sergeant

that     I w o ul d address        those officers as to the                 request for further

manpower.         I instructed the sergeant                 to a s c e rt ai n the s ev erity of the

It then became a pp arent             that a serious               incident     had o cc ur re d at the

 H i l l s b o r o u g h Football   Gr ou nd w h ic h        could have had serious

conseq ue nces      for the      city centre           later       in the day,       and Chief         Inspector

DONNELLY,      Inspector BEEDEN and                  I retired to my office               to discuss and

decide upon policing a r r a ng em en ts                for the       city centre         in the knowledge

that     those officers who m we had e xp ec te d to be ava il ab le                             to us were

likely to be d et ained at the football                        ground.

We decided to make           use of the Pub W a tc h early warn in g system to

request all       licensees         in the      city centre          to close their             premises

until     further     notice.       A further          duty group was sch ed ul ed to

report for duty at 6 . 0 0 p m           (1800)       and we decided to contact                     those

officers      ind iv id ua ll y at home and             require       them to report             for duty

i mmediatel y and all          officers         on duty       in    ’D 1 * Sub D iv i s i o n were

summo ne d to the gym na si um for briefing.

I s u b s e qu en tl y a d d r e s s e d that    briefing.           I informed the officers                     of

what     had taken     place at H i l l s b o r o u g h and the            possible

consequences        should     large numbers            of    irate football           supporters

return to the         city    centre.        I informed the officers                   that      I w ould

take     command of the        policing         in    * D 1 ’ Sub D iv is i o n and           remain   in the

response        vehicle and 3 area               cars were     to be deployed w ith 2 officers

in each to be          responsible          for the     routine       policing of the         sub division.

All    other officers were                to be d ep lo ye d    in relation to the football

supp or ters       returning        to the M i d la nd Station.             3 sergeants and

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 constables were a v a i la bl e             to me at that       time.      I

d iv id ed them       into 3 serials             each under     the      command of a sergeant,             2 to

be d ep lo ye d on foot and               1 to    remain mobile.           1 foot serial was          to be

d ep lo ye d    in Snig Hill and another was                   to be d ep loyed       in F i tzalan

Square.         The 3rd serial was to remain mobile                        to be ava il ab le    to

respond to any           part     of the     city    centre     including       the M i d l a n d Station.

As those officers            left the        police     stat io n to take          up their    positions,

members        of the 6 . 0 0 p m    <1800)       duty group began to arrive.                 I formed

them into serials            of     1 sergeant and 6 or 7 constables a nd deployed

them to other vulnerable                   parts of the        city      centre.     Other    officers

then became av ai la bl e            from H i l l s b o r o u g h a nd    I deployed them at various

locations        t hroughout        the    city centre and at             the M i d ia nd Station.

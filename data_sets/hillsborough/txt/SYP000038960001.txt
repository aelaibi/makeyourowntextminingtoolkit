                                NATURE OF COMPLAINTS



1.    That he failed to acquaint himself with the planning and problems related
      to the control of the semi-final on 15 April 1989.

2.    He failed to prevent a dangerous build up of supporters outside the
       Leppings Lane gates.                                                                 /

3.    That he failed to monitor the crowd numbers packing into pens 3 and 4.

4.    He failed to act when it became obvious that pens 3 and 4 were overfull    /
       when he had an excellent view point from the police box above the pens. ^

5.    He should not have opened the gates under any circumstances giving
       unlimited and uncontrolled access into the football ground by supporters.

6.    He failed to control the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening         /
       of Gate C.

7.    He failed to make provision for fans coming through Gate C   after he had         /
       given the order for the gate to be opened.                              \^/
8.    He failed to respond to the developing tragedy and was slow to effect a
      rescue operation.

9.    He failed to act when it was obvious that people were in distress.

10.   He was deceitful and intentionally misled senior police officers and
      members of the public regarding his command and control of police officers^/'
       on the day.

11.   He attempted to mislead the Assistant Chief Constable at the ground and               /
      others, namely, representatives of the Club, the F.A., and the fans               /
      themselves regarding the origin of the order for gate *C* to be opened. V     /
      That is by inferring supporters had forced open the gate when he had, in
      fact, given the order to open the gate.



      ALTERNATIVE TO COMPLAINT 10

                FOREWORD



This report is submitted in the normal and accepted

complaint format.        However, some explanation is

required to assist the reader in identifying where to

find certain statements and documents.



In the margin of the report it will be seen that

Document numbers, Statement pages, Appendices and on

occasions Lord Justice Taylor’s interim and final

report are referred to as well as to extracts from the

transcripts of his Public Inquiry.



Where a document number or statement is prefixed with a

part number this can be found within the seven volumes

(parts) of evidence submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions.



eg:    PART IV                or          PART IV

           Document No 6                  Statement

           Pages 44-52                    Pages 2331-2356



If a document number or statement is not prefixed with

a part number that particular item can be found within

this file.



Where reference is made to a video then each VHS tape

has been given a separate, Part III, document number.

Not only that but within the same Part III is a written

description/schedule of what the video contains.        For

example;
                                                              6
                   Part III (Documents)

                   Document No 115

                   (Video)

                   Pages 757



identifies the VHS tape number as 115 and the schedule

page in the documents where the description can be

found.



A similar system is used to identify photographs which

also feature in Part III.    For example;



                   Part III (Documents)

                   Document No 150

                   Photo No 14



This easily identifies that this photograph can be

found in the Album marked Document Number 150 and

within each album the photographs are numbered

consecutively.



A reference to one of Lord Justice Taylor’s reports

will be shown as follows;

                  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING COMPLAINTS



                  R1    On 15 April 1989 a Football Association Cup Semi

                  Final match was played between Liverpool and

                  Nottingham Forest Football Clubs at the neutral

                  Sheffield Wednesday ground at Hillsborough.     It is

                  well documented that shortly after ’kick-off* the

                  match was abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and 4 of

                  the Leppings Lane/West Stand terraces, which resulted

                  in the death of 95 Liverpool Supporters and injuries

                  to many others.



                  R2    As a result of the tragedy Mr G J DEAR, QPM,

                  Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

                  appointed to investigate the disaster and to collate

                  evidence for H M Coroner and for a Judicial Inquiry

                  which was carried out by Lord Justice TAYLOR.     On 27

                  September 1989 following submission of the TAYLOR

                  Interim Report into the disaster to the Director of

                  Public Prosecutions Mr DEAR agreed to accept

                  additional responsibility for the criminal and

                  disciplinary aspects of the investigation.     On 1 April

                  1990, with the retirement of Mr DEAR, these

                  responsibilities were transferred to Mr L SHARP, QPM,

                  LLB, Chief Constable of Cumbria.



Part IV           R3    Richard JONES (25 years - deceased) was the son

Statement Pages   of the complainant Mr Leslie JONES and attended the

2368-2377         match with his sister Stephanie JONES and his

                  girlfriend Tracey COX.   Arising from his son’s death,



                                                                              9

                      JONES Senior makes a number of complaints relating to

                      the lack of planning and control/management of

                      Liverpool supporters at the match; the alleged attempt

                      to mislead his Assistant Chief Constable and members

                      of the public concerning the opening of exit Gate C;

                      and the delay in responding to people in distress;

                      against Chief Superintendent David Godfrey DUCKEHFIELD

                      and other officers.



    Part IV           R4    Trevor HICKS the father of Sara Louise HICKS

    Statement Paces   (19 years - deceased) and Victoria Jane HICKS (15

    2331-2356         years -deceased) attended the match with his wife

                      Jennifer HICKS and the two daughters.       Whilst he went

                      to stand in pens 1/2 and his wife went to a seat in

                      the North Stand, both girls went into pen 3.       Mr

                      HICKS makes a series of complaints which also relate

                      to the lack of planning and control/management of

                      Liverpool supporters both prior to and during the

                      match as well as to organisation of the rescue

                Leppings Lane end of the ground.



                DETAILS OF COMPLAINTS



Document 1      R6    On 19 October 1989 Mr JONES sent a letter to the

Pages 1-2       South Yorkshire Police Authority enclosing a schedule

                of specific complaints against individually named

                officers including Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.

                This was forwarded by Assistant Chief Constable Mr

                ANDERSON, South Yorkshire Police, on 23 October,

Document 2      together with a separate letter to Mr JONES, Assistant

Page 3          Chief Constable, West Midlands Police requesting Mr

                DEAR to undertake the investigation and indicating

                that Captain TAYLOR would supervise on behalf of the

Documents 3-4   Authority.   This was confirmed by letters from Captain

Pages 4-5       TAYLOR on 25 October and on 27 October Assistant Chief

                Constable Mr JONES accepted the investigation on

                behalf of Mr DEAR.



                R7    As a result of receipt of the letter/schedule

                from Mr JONES, he was seen by Detective Chief

                Superintendent Michael Jon FOSTER on 2 November 1989,

                in company with his solicitor and he then made a

                formal statement of complaint.   Those relating to

                Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD are as follows:-
•
    a)   You failed to acquaint yourself with the

         planning and problems related to the control of

         the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest Semi Final on

         Saturday, 15 April 1989.



    b)   You failed to monitor the crowd numbers packing

         into Pens 3 and 4.



    c)   You failed   to act when it became obvious that

         Pens 3 and 4 were over full when you had an

         excellent viewpoint from the Police Box above

         the pens.



    d)   You failed   to make provision for fans coining

         through Gate ’C* after you had given the order

         for the gate to be opened.



    e)   You failed   to act when it was obvious that

         people were in distress.



    f)   You attempted to mislead the Assistant Chief

         Constable at the ground and others, namely,

         representatives of the Club, the F.A., and the

         fans themselves regarding the origin of the

         order for Gate ’C* to be opened.    That is by

         inferring supporters had forced open the gate

         when you had, in fact, given the order to open

         the gate.

             R8    Dealing with the complaints made by Mr HICKS

             involving Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, on 7 June

Document 5   1989 Mr HICKS sent a letter to the Home Secretary

Pages 6-7    Douglas HURD primarily complaining about another

             senior officer of the South Yorkshire Police.



             R9    That letter was interpreted as containing a

             further complaint against Chief Superintendent

             DUCKENFIELD:-



             a)    That you were deceitful and intentionally misled

                   senior police officers and members of the public

                   regarding your command and control of police

                   officers engaged on that duty.



             RIO   The complaint was initially allocated to Mr

             Kenneth Philip Douglas COOPER, Assistant Chief

             Constable Northamptonshire Constabulary for

Document 6   investigation by letter dated 25 July 1989, with the

Page 8       Police Complaints Authority being formally requested

Document 7   to supervise the investigation in a further letter the

Page 9       same day.



             Rll   On 4 August 1989 Mr SKITT, Deputy Chief

             Constable, Northamptonshire Constabulary agreed to the

             appointment of Mr COOPER as the Senior Investigating

             Officer on behalf of his Chief Constable.   This

Document 8   appointment was later ratified and in a letter dated 4

Page 10      August Mr HICKS was informed that Captain TAYLOR of

             the Police Complaints Authority was to supervise the

             investigation.
                  R12   Following his appointment, Mr COOPER saw Mr

                  HICKS on 24 August and he made a formal statement    of

                  complaint outlining a series of new complaints against

                  a number of officers including Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD.     Details of the complaints against this

                  officer are as follows s-



                  b)    Failed to prevent a dangerous build up of

                        supporters outside of the gates.



                  c)    Failed to control the movement of supporters

                        subsequent to the opening of Gate ’C* and



                  d)    Failed to respond to the developing tragedy and

                        were slow to effect a rescue operation.



                  R13   Subsequent to this interview Mr COOPER received

Document 9        a letter dated 5 September 1989 from Captain TAYLOR

Page 11           informing him that, the enquiry would be dealt with by

                  another force.    On 27 September following protracted

                  negotiations, responsibility for all criminal and

                  disciplinary aspects of the investigation into the

                  Hillsborough disaster, including the earlier

                  complaints by Mr HICKS were passed to Mr DEAR for

                  enquiries by West Midlands Police.



Part IV           R14   Arising from that transfer of responsibility, Mr

Statement Pages   HICKS was re-interviewed on 22 November 1989 by

2331-2356




                                                                            14

                      Detective Superintendent TAYLOR with a view to

                      clarification of the complaint contained in his

                      earlier letter to the Home Secretary.    He then made a

                      further/alternative complaint against Chief

                      Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and another Senior Officer

                      as follows:-



                      e)      That he colluded with Mr JACKSON the Assistant

                              Chief Constable to mislead the public over the

                              opening of Gate C.



    Documents 10-11   R15     Correspondence relating to the acceptance of

    Pages 12-13       that investigation by Mr DEAR and supervision of the

                      investigation by Captain TAYLOR is included in the

                      file.



                      R16     Regarding the complaint by Mrs McBRIEN, on 7

    Document 12       November 1989 she sent a letter to Mr DEAR (one of a

    Pages 14-28       number of letters received from this lady who is

                      understandably still very distressed and having

                      difficulty coming to terms with the death of her

                      son).    The letter was couched in such a way that it

                      could be regarded as a complaint against South

                      Yorkshire Police, consequently it was decided to

                      obtain clarification.



                      R17     On 6 December 1989 Mrs McBRIEN was interviewed

                      at her home by Detective Superintendent TAYLOR and she

                      then confirmed her intention to complain.    She made a




                                                                                15
                          formal statement of complaint against Chief

                          Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and another officer.

                          Details of this complaint are as follows:-



                          a)    You should not have opened the gates under any

                                circumstances giving unlimited and

                                uncontrollable access into the football ground

                                by supporters.



Documents 13-14           R18   Correspondence concerning the acceptance of that

Page 29                   investigation by Mr DEAR and from the Police

Page 30                   Complaints Authority confirming supervision by Captain

                          TAYLOR are produced.




Documents 15-16           R19   Letters dated 13 December 1989 and 24 January
Pages 31-32
Pages 33-34               1990 have since been received from Mrs McBRIEN

                          concerning her complaint and enclosing respectively a

Document 17               newspaper cutting and a more detailed account of
Page 35

                          considers these add to or clarify the details of her

                          complaint.



                          R20   As will be appreciated these complaints raise

                          allegations of both criminal and disciplinary

                          offences.    The file on the criminal aspect of the

                          investigation is already with the Director of Public

                          Prosecutions and the Police Complaints authority.

                          This report deals solely with the disciplinary

                          aspects.



                                                                                   16

                     R21     That he failed to acquaint himself with the

                     planning and problems related to the control of the

                     semi-final on 15 April 1989.



Part IV              R22     Made only by Mr JONES, he explains it as failing

Statement Pages      to correctly make plans before the match and did not

2368-2377            provide himself with the knowledge necessary to

                     control a football match of this nature.



                     R23     This particular complaint is part and parcel of

                     the evidence gathered towards the proof of the

                     criminal offences of Manslaughter or Culpable

                     Malfeasance which is currently being considered by the

                     Director of Public Prosecutions.    Should that evidence

                     be insufficient to prove these crimes then this

                     particular complaint could still give rise to

                     disciplinary offences under the Police Discipline

                     Code.



                     R24     The allegation requires consideration of the

                     following disciplinary offences;-



                     (i)     Disobedience to orders.



                     Without good and sufficient cause disobeyed or

                     neglected to carry out a lawful written order, viz the

                     South Yorkshire Police Standing Instruction for

                     Policing Football Matches.    Contrary to The Police

                     (Discipline) Regs 1985. Schedule 1 . Regulation 4(1).

                     paragraph 3(a).
Part V          R25    The written order in question is the South

Document 192    Yorkshire Standing Instructions for the Policing of

998-1044        Football Matches.   Although there are various other

                documents, instructions and guidelines in existence,

                some national and others confined to South Yorkshire

                Police, it is only the Standing Instructions which are

                relevant to the disciplinary charge under

                consideration.



Part V          R26    At paragraph 5.1 the Standing Instructions

Document 192    require:-

Page 1002       "In estimating manpower requirements, the following

                factors must be considered:



                (ii)   the history of previous encounters between clubs

                       and the supporters of the clubs."



Part V          R27    Although the Standing Instruction goes on to say

Document 192    at paragraph 5.2 that it is the responsibility of the

Page 1003       Force Football Liaison Officer to collate and

                disseminate intelligence relative to football fixtures

                within South Yorkshire, that same paragraph makes it

                clear that the Football Liaison Officer is there to

                "assist" the officer in command, in this case Chief

                Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.



Part IV         R28    The intelligence report for the 1989 semi-final

Document 179    was compiled by Detective Sergeant CHARLESWORTH and

Pages 867-872   was incorporated into the briefings to all officers,




                                                                         18
 but this particular Standing Instruction must be taken

 to include encounters between various clubs at

Hillsborough in previous years, particularly in FA Cup

 semi-finals.



R29    The incomplete nature of the information

received from other forces to prepare the intelligence

briefing is dealt with later in this report.



R30   Documentary evidence suggests an awareness of

crowd crushing on the Leppings Lane terraces as early

as 1956.     In 1981, during another FA Cup semi-final

there was a significant crushing problem on those

terraces and crowd injuries resulted.    Although some

remedial action was taken during the following years,

including the installation of the radial fences on the

Leppings Lane terraces, there is evidence that some of

the crowd were injured on those terraces in 1988.



R31   Although Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has

refused to answer any questions in respect of this or

any other matters, from his unsworn testimony to the

Lord Justice Taylor Inquiry it seems that his

knowledge of these past events, was sketchy, to say

the least.



R32   However, he had only a short time to prepare for

the match (discussed in more detail later in this

report) and he had at his disposal to advise him, the
                  best expertise that South Yorkshire Police could

                  produce.     That advice was to the effect that the 1988

                  semi-final at Hillsborough between the same teams had

                  been policed effectively and successfully.     Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD was entitled to assume that

                  any lessons learned by police from past events at

                  Hillsborough had been remedied, no problems had arisen

                  in 1988 which called for any serious alterations to

                  the police plan and he would have virtually the same

                  team of key personnel to help him police the event in

                  1989.



Part V            R33      At paragraph 6.3 the Standing Instruction

Document 192      requires that the Operation Order for a particular

Page 1004         match:

                  "Will specify individual duties for each serial so

                  that supervisory officers are aware of their exact

                  roles prior to, during and after the match."



Part V            R34      The Operation Order signed by Chief

Document 194      Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and approved by Mr JACKSON,

Pages 1128-1210   the Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), makes no

                  mention of the responsibilities of serials or

                  individuals in respect of monitoring or distributing

                  the crowd so as to prevent or relieve overcrowding

                  other than in respect of "safety" which seems to

                  relate to evacuation procedures.




                                                                             20
Document 192      R35   At Appendix B of the Standing Instructions is a

Pages 1016-1018   guide to General Briefing which is directed at the

                  officer in command and at paragraph 5 it states:-



                  R36   "A description of the ’event* about to take

                  place will be given along with the system of policing

                  to be adopted (escorting and segregation of rival fans

                  etc), the basic reasons for the officers presence and

                  what is expected of them, ie to facilitate the

                  attendance of spectators, to exercise crowd

                  control...."



                  R37   This particular paragraph appears to be

                  mandatory and goes straight to the point of the

                  accepted police responsibility to facilitate the

                  attendance of spectators, and to exercise crowd

                  control.    These responsibilities are clearly intended

                  to be separate and distinct from "safety aspects

Part V            because at paragraph 16 the Standing Instruction

Document 192      states:-

Page 1017

                  "Explain emergency evacuation procedures."



                  R38   There is nothing in the Operation Order, nor in

                  the briefings which specifically addresses police

                  responsibilities in respect of crowd control.



Part V            R39   At Appendix C of the Standing Instruction

Document 192      guidelines are given in respect of Individual

Page 1019-1021    Briefing.
                               R40   Directions are given to "Officers on the playing

                               area track" and at paragraph (a) (iv):-



                               "Spectators will not be allowed to remain in

                               passageways adjacent to entrances and exits or to be

                               in terrace or stand gangways.   Persons seen to be so

                               remaining will be directed to move."



                               R41   This, an accepted police responsibility, seems

                               to be particularly relevant to Pens 3 and 4 of the

Part V                         West Terraces and the associated entry tunnel, yet the

Document 194                   Operation Order is silent in this respect.

Pages 1128-1210

Part V                         R42   At Appendix L under the Section on "Safety at

Document 192A                  Sports Grounds - Stewards," at paragraph 3, the

Page 10441                     Standing Instruction states:-



                               "Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground

                               in accordance with a detailed prearranged schedule

Document 192             R44      Also in Appendix L of the Standing Instructions,

1044J                    under "Specific Duties of Stewards" at paragraph 7, it

                         states:-



                         "Specific duties to be undertaken by stewards include:



                         (a)      Preventing overcrowding, ensuring that crowd

                                  limits in various parts of the ground are

                                  complied with and that gangways and exits are

                                  kept clear."



                         R45      It has to be recognised that this order is a

                         police instruction directed at police, not at

                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.     The Club’s

                         perception of the duties of their stewards differs

Part 1                   from the police perception as is evidenced by the

Document 1               Club’s internal memorandum on the subject.     A copy of

Pages 1-5                that memorandum was received by police in 1988.



Part V                   R46      The Standing Instructions had been properly

Document 192             communicated and promulgated, were continuously

Pages 998-1044           reviewed and amended within South Yorkshire Police

          1-52
                         from his unsworn testimony to the Lord Justice Taylor
                  Inquiry it is clear that he was aware of the Standing

                  Instructions although not fully conversant with them.



                  (ii)   Neglect of Duty



                  Without good and sufficient cause neglected or omitted

                  to attend to or carry out with due promptitude and

                  diligence anything which it is his duty as a member of

                  a police force to attend to or carry out, viz he

                  failed to brief himself adequately in respect of the

                  planning and problems related to the control of the

                  policing of the FA Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on

                  15 April 1989.



                  Contrary to The Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

                  Schedule 1. Regulation 4(1) paragraph 4(a).



Part V            R48    Although Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has

Statement Pages   refused to answer any of the Investigating Officer’s

2457-2469         questions in respect of this, or any other matter,

                  there is a considerable amount of information which

                  shows in some detail what Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD did in those respects.



                  R49    That he had between 16 and 19 days notice that

                  he would be in command of the police operation on the

                  day, seems clear.
                          R50   It is also clear that the draft planning was in

Part II                   the hands of other officers.   Chief Superintendent

Statement Pages           MOLE took the lead assisted by the Police Headquarters

846-859c                  Operations Department, the Force Football Liaison

                          Inspector and a significant number of others.



                          R51   That Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD was

                          personally involved with the best experience that the

                          force and others, could offer is beyond doubt.



                          R52   It is also pertinent that although the Operation

                          Order was signed by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

Part II                   the final approval was that of Mr JACKSON. the

Part I                    R54   He also attended the stadium on 1 and 5 April

Statement Page 607        1989 for the Millwall and Wimbledon matches and made

                          the opportunity to see for himself the area he would

                          command on 15 April 1989.



                          R55   It also seems clear that he did not undertake

                          research personally into the documentary evidence

                          relating to the history of the matches held at
                      Hillsborough and the problems that arose therefrom.

Part V                In this respect he could have studied the Police

Statement Pages       Headquarters and the *F* Division Policy Files

3480A-3480B           which document these matters in detail.



                      R56   There are also strong indications that the

                      nationally adopted but loosely structured system for

Part IV               bringing to notice information and intelligence about

Document 179          matches teams and supporters, failed to bring to his

Pages 867-872         attention matters which could have been relevant to

                      Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD on the day, and

                      before.



Part IV               R57   For example, there is nothing in the

Statement Page 1145   intelligence report to indicate the tendency of

                      Liverpool supporters to arrive late.   Subsequent to

Part IV               the event reports from the Metropolitan Police about

Document 180          the past behaviour of Liverpool fans include

Page 883              significant references to this propensity.     Although

                      this tendency was not unknown to Merseyside Police and

                      South Yorkshire Police, the information was not

                      specifically passed to South Yorkshire Police and was

                      not included in the intelligence report which deals

                      only with potential crimes and disorder.     Whilst the

                      new computer based police football intelligence system

                      will make such information readily available, in April

                      1989 it is not apparent from the written orders and

                      briefings that it was ever considered as a serious

                      possibility.   Entreaties for early arrival were made



                                                                                26
 through the media and club programmes but no plans

were made to cover the contingency of late arrival by

large numbers of fans.



R58   All of this forms part of the evidence submitted

to the Director of Public Prosecutions for

consideration of the criminal offences of Manslaughter

or Culpable Malfeasance.   The evidence required to

prove Manslaughter must amount to gross negligence or

recklessness but the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

is an alternative offence to Manslaughter and although

it is based on the same evidence it requires a lesser

degree of negligence or recklessness and embraces

neglect of a duty.   The mental element required to be

proved for Culpable Malfeasance is the same as for the

disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.   Should the

Director of Public Prosecutions decide that there is

insufficient evidence to prove the offences of

Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance, there will be

insufficient evidence to prove the disciplinary

offence of Neglect of Duty.



R59   There is sufficient evidence to show that Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD did enough in his planning,

orders and briefings to satisfy the requirements of

the South Yorkshire Police Standing Instructions.

Time was short; he was newly promoted into an area

where Hillsborough events were prominent; to a




                                                         27
                   considerable extent he had to take the well-tried and

                   overtly successful South Yorkshire Police system as he

                   found it; he had the best advice possible; and on the

                  day he would have a very experienced team working for

                  him with reserve resources available to deal with

                  unforeseen contingencies.    There is insufficient

                  evidence to prove a disciplinary offence of

                  Disobedience to Orders.



                  R60   In that case this complaint is unsubstantiated.



2.                R61   He failed to prevent a dangerous build up of

                  supporters outside the Leppings Lane gates.



Part IV           R62   This complaint is made only by Mr HICKS who can

Statement Pages   have no personal eyewitness knowledge of what occurred

2331-2356         outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles other than at

                  about 2 pm when he entered the ground and the scene

                  there was calm.   He has levelled the same complaint

                  against other officers, including Superintendent

                  MURRAY and the Ground Commanders, Superintendents

                  MARSHALL and GREENWOOD, but in respect of Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD his specific complaint must

                  relate to the manner in which he planned the policing

                  of that specific area, allocated resources to it,

                  briefed the senior officers who were deployed there,

                  responded to their requests for assistance and

                  directed their activities.




                                                                            28
                  R63      The disciplinary offence which has to be

                  considered is:-



                  Neglect of duty.



                  Without good and sufficient cause he neglected or

                  omitted to attend to or carry out with due promptitude

                  and diligence anything which it was his duty as a

                  member of a police force to attend to or carry out,

                  viz he failed to prevent a dangerous build up of

                  supporters outside the Leppings Lane gates at

                  Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989.



                  Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

                  Schedule 1. Regulation 4(i). paragraph 4(a).




Part V            R64   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD in his
Statement Pages
2457-2469         Operation Order for 1989 had ensured that the
Part V
Document 194      reduction in manpower did not affect the Leppings Lane
Pages 1128-1210
                  turnstile area and 53 police officers were deployed

                  there.



Part IV           R65   He had also taken steps to encourage the
Document 185
Page 929          supporters to arrive at the ground early.    Some

                  turnstiles were open from 1130 hours and all were open

                  by 12 noon.



Part V            R66   Although supporters arrived in considerable

2740-2750
                  of them started to gather on or around the bridge over
                                                                           29

2756-2762               noticeable reluctance on the part of many fans, to

2763-2767               enter the ground.

2768-2772

2917-2924               R67     Police officers made random checks to locate non

2925-2930               ticket holders and others carried out searches both

2806-2810               inside and outside the ground to prevent crimes and

2811-2814               breaches of the ground rules.



Part V                  R68     By 1400 hours it was apparent to Chief

Statement Pages         Superintendent DUCKENFIELD that far fewer Liverpool

2457-2469               fans had entered the stadium than Nottingham Forest

2470-2488               fans.    The Kop and the South Stand were filling up

                        steadily, but the North and West Stands, were

                        relatively empty.



                        R69     On the West Terraces, the Liverpool end, pens 3

                        and 4, the central pens, were filling up, but pens 1,

                        2, 6 and 7 were nearly empty.    Pens 3 and 4 are the

                        two pens behind the goal.



Lord Justice TAYLOR*S   R70     At 1415 hours a tannov message was broadcast to

Interim Report          the crowd for them to move forward in pens 3 and 4 to

Para 59                 make room for others.



Lord Justice TAYLOR*S   R71     At about 1417 hours the Traffic Division

Interim Report          reported that the indications were that the majority

Para 61                 of the Liverpool supporters were in the Sheffield

                        area and at the turnstiles the numbers of fans coming
                      along Leppings Lane towards the stadium had Increased

Part V                to such an extent that Superintendent MARSHALL
Statement Pages
2527-2547             radioed to the Police Control Box for the road to be

                      closed to traffic.   The request was granted and

                      implemented by about 1430 hours but by then the

Part III              the CCTV camera 1 showed that the area

                      R72   In 1988 there had been three special trains from

                      Liverpool to Sheffield and the passengers on that

                      train had been met by police and either bussed to the

                      stadium or escorted in crocodile fashion along

                      Leppings Lane to the turnstiles.   In 1988 the iron

                      perimeter gates had been closed early so that entry

                      into the area outside the turnstiles was restricted

                      and police officers had little difficulty in

                      controlling the crowd in separate queues with no

                      overspill into the South Road area near to the outside

                      of Gate C.



                      R73   In 1989 there was only one special train from

Part V                Liverpool, it arrived by 1400 hours and the 350 or so

Statements            Liverpool supporters who had travelled on it were met

2633-2647             by police, escorted in crocodile fashion down Leppings

2648-2654
                         Lane and gained access to the ground easily and safely

                         by 1420 hours.    The escorting officers were then

                        deployed on other duties in accordance with the

                        Operation Order.    The increasing crowd which followed

                        them came along Leppings Lane unescorted and although

                        police officers mounted and on foot were deployed to

                        keep them on the pavements, the numbers were such that

                        the crowd overspilled onto the roadway hence

                        Superintendent MARSHALL'S request to close the road to

                        traffic.



                        R74     There is an argument which runs to the effect

                        that traffic flow is one way of keeping crowds

                        confined to a pavement or similar controllable safe

                        space, but in the circumstances prevailing at the time

                        I have no doubt that the request and the decision were

                        correct.



                        R75     But in 1989 the iron perimeter gates outside the

                        Leppings Lane turnstiles were not closed early as they

                        had been in 1988.    Consequently the previous year’s

                        filtering effect of those gates was not possible in

                        1989 and the crowd became swiftly a single seething

                        mass of people filling the whole area between

                        the iron perimeter gates and the turnstiles including

                        the area of the South Road near to the outside of Gate

                        C.    This effect can be seen clearly from a comparison

Part III                of the relevant 1988 and 1989 CCTV videos from camera
Document 143A
Schedule Paee(s) 803A   1.    This may go some way to explain the various




                                                                                   32
                  arguments which emerged during the Lord Justice

                  Taylor Inquiry, about filtering the crowd in Leppings

                  Lane with barriers or otherwise.    The fact is that

                  when the iron gates were eventually closed (just

                  before the opening of Gate C at 1452 hours), they were

                  broken open by the Liverpool supporters in Leppings

                  Lane, but it must be remembered that the forcing of

Part IV           the iron perimeter gates did not occur until after

Statement Pages   Gate C was opened.    The fans still in Leppings Lane

1678-1679         saw Gate C open and made a "bee-line" for it knowing

1680-1686         that the kick-off was imminent and there had been no

1687-1696         indication that the start of the game would be

Part V            delayed.   If these iron perimeter gates had been

Document 190      closed early, as in 1988, better crowd control may

Pages 987-990     have been possible.



                  R76   It may be pertinent that for Sheffield Wednesday

                  Football Club league matches, which of course occur

                  almost fortnightly throughout the football season,

                  spectators with tickets for the West Stand, North

                  Stand, the West Terraces and the South Stand, all use

                  the Leppings Lane entrance.   Those for the South Stand

                  enter the ground through turnstiles 19-22 and 23-28

                  and reach them along the private road at the rear of

                  the South Stand (called South Road).   To achieve this,

                  the iron perimeter gates outside and across the mouth

                  of the Leppings Lane turnstiles, are kept open.     No

                  such considerations are necessary for a FA Cup

                  semi-final.   The league match positioning of the iron
                   perimeter gates could be regarded as the "norm" and

                   that may have influenced the configuration used on 15

                  April 1989.



                  R77      Up to the time that Leppings Lane was closed to

                  traffic, although there was a large mass of people

                  outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, and there were

                  large numbers of Liverpool fans still approaching the

                  turnstiles along Leppings Lane, there was nothing

                  either inside or outside of the ground which was

                  recognised by the Police Control Box staff as a cause

Part V            for alarm.    It was about this time that Superintendent

Statement Pages   MURRAY advised Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD    that

2470-2488         everyone would get into the stadium by kick-off    time,

2457-2469         and he rehearsed his policy for delaying the

                  kick-off.     This specific aspect is considered

                  elsewhere in this report.


                  R78      Between 1430 hours and 1444 hours the crowd in

Part IV           pens 3 and 4 continued to increase to the detriment of
Statement Pages
1731-1741         pens 1 and 2; and 6 and 7.     The crowd outside the
1742-1750
1751-1757         Leppings Lane turnstiles continued to grow and spread
1758-1763
1805-1808         both along Leppings Lane and over the River Don bridge
1809-1816
1817-1820         faster than the trickle of fans coming through the

                  turnstiles could disperse it.    The police officers

                  deployed on foot and on horses were no longer able to

                  carry out their appointed duties because of the crush

Part V            of the crowd.    The foot officers at one stage were
Statement Pages
2821-2829         forced    to retreat through the turnstiles and then
2890-2895
2912-2916         emerge again through Gate C.
                  R79      The mood of the crowd rapidly changed and any

                  attempt to control them was resented.    Officers and

                  horses were attacked and there is some evidence that a

                  significant proportion of the crowd, mostly young men,

Part V            who had been drinking, tried to push their wav forward

Statement Pages   through the crowd.    There were some signs of panic,

2843-2848         mainly at the turnstiles themselves, as people were

2849-2857         pressed against the turnstile walls.    In the crowd

                  young people and women were fainting and some fans

Part V            climbed over the turnstile building and the dividing

Statement Pages   fence.    Only some of this could be seen on the CCTV

2527-2547         monitor in the Police Control Box, but Superintendent

2947-2955         MARSHALL on the spot had gained a vantage point on the

2964-2970         parapet of the River Don bridge.    He radioed to the

3043-3048         Police Control Box at 1444 hours for reinforcements,

3184-3190         for a Tannoy message to be broadcast to urge the crowd

3368-3371         to stop pushing, and for this to be reinforced by a

Part II           police vehicle equipped with a public address system.

Statement Pages   Because of police radio failure at about that time

1123-1128         only the requests for the tannoy and the

                  reinforcements were received and acceded to, but

Part V            Police Constable BUXTON in a police Landrover equipped

Statement Paees   with a Public Address system arrived at the scene,

2830-2835         by 1446 hours and started to broadcast to the crowd to

                  stop pushing forward towards the turnstiles.    By this

                  time the crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles

                  had grown to some 5,000 strong.    Police Constable

                  BUXTON radioed from his police vehicle requesting




                                                                            35
Part V             that the kick-off be delayed.    From the Police Control

Statement Pages    Box the request was refused.

3311A-J

3368-3371          R80     The mounted police officers, now reinforced,

Part V             formed a cordon across the mouth of the Leppings Lane

Statement Pages    turnstile area, and the iron perimeter gates were

2836-2842          shut.    This reduced the pressure within the iron

2843-2848          perimeter gates which gave a few minutes respite during

2849-2857         which the area outside the turnstiles could be

2858-2863         cleared.     However, time was of the essence and clearly

2864-2867         because of non-ticket holders; tickets with confusing

2868-2873         direction printed thereon; supporters trying to buy

2874-2878         their way into the ground; and some supporters getting

                  stuck in the turnstiles; the turnstiles were not

                  functioning quickly enough to achieve this, so at 1447

Part V            hours Superintendent MARSHALL asked the Police Control

Statement Pages   Box for permission to open the exit gates, an

2527-2547         extraordinary action but one well justified given the

                  circumstances prevailing at that time.



Part V            R81      At 1448 hours while Chief Superintendent

Statement Pages   DUCKENFIELD was considering the request, Gate C was

2457-2469         opened so that police could eject a youth who had

                  climbed into the ground without a ticket.     As the gate

                  opened some of the fans outside took advantage and

                  about 150 of them forced their way through it into the

                  ground.     The gate was quickly closed with the

                  assistance of a mounted officer who blocked off the

                  entrance.




                                                                              36
Part III                 R82       This "illegal" entry was seen on the CCTV

742-747
                         Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD who was still

                         considering the request for the exit gates to be

                         opened.     Superintendent MARSHALL made a second and then

                         a third request for the gates to be opened.     At 1452

                         hours Gate C was opened wide in response to Chief

Part V                   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD*S approval so to do.
Statement Pages
2457-2469
                         R83       Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD*S approval was

                          for the "gates" to be opened so he was surprised very

Part V                    shortly afterwards when Police Sergeant HIGGINS

Statement Pages          radioed for Gate A to be opened.     Approval was given

3043-3048                and Gate A was opened despite protests from the stewards

                         employed at that location.     Gate B was also opened for a

                         short while.



                         R84   Gate C was opened for about five minutes and

                         during that time about 2,000 fans passed through it at

Part IV                  no more than a fast walk but the sight of this gateway

Statement Pages          to the match was too much for the Liverpool fans outside

1821-1831                the iron perimeter gates.     They pushed towards Gate C .

1832-1841                broke through the iron perimeter gates and joined onto

1842-1847                the rear of the fans going through Gate C.

Part III                 From the video pictures available from the CCTV camera

Document 110             1, there was a third group of fans who went through

Schedule Pages 742-747   Gate C on that occasion - these fans who had been

                         standing about for a considerable time without




                                                                                      37
                         attempting to enter the ground through the turnstiles.



Part V                   R85     Of those who entered through Gate C, either at

Statement Pages          1448 hours, or at 1452 hours, there can be little doubt

3006-3012                that some had tickets for the North and West Stands.

3013-3019                some had tickets for the West Terrace, some had no

                         tickets at all.



                         R86     Some made their way to the wing pens 1 and 2,

                         some went through the opening in the dividing wall

Part III                 making their way to the West Stand or to the pens 6 and

Document 110             7.    But from the CCTV pictures from camera 1 . there can

Schedule Pages 742-747   be no doubt that the majority of them went straight and

                         unchecked to the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4.



                         R87     These matters are identical to those currently

                         under consideration by the Director of Public

                         Prosecutions in respect of Chief Superintendent

                         DUCKENFIELD’S culpability for Manslaughter or Culpable

                         Malfeasance.



                         R88    Should the Director find that there is

                         insufficient evidence to prosecute these criminal

                         offences, then the same must be said in respect of the

                         disciplinary offence.    In which case this complaint is

                         unsubstantiated.

                         packing into pens 3 and 4 .



                                                                                      38
Part IV           R90      This complaint is made by Mr JONES only and he

Statement Pages   explains that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD should

2368-2377         have ensured personally that the number in those pens

                  only reached a safe level.



                  R91      The disciplinary offence which has to be

                  considered iss-



                  Neglect of Duty



                  Without good and sufficient cause he neglected or

                  omitted to attend to or carry out with due promptitude

                  and diligence anything which it is his duty as a

                  member of a police force to attend to or to carry out,

                  viz he failed to monitor the crowd in pens 3 and 4 at

                  Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 so as to ensure that the

                  number of people in those pens did not exceed a safe

                  level.



                  Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985

                  Schedule 1. Regulation 4(i). paragraph 4(a).



Part II           R92      Because a knowledge of the Guide to Safety at

Document 88       Sports Grounds 1986, known as the Green Guide is a

                  requirement for a Police Football Ground Commander,

                  Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD must be taken as

                  having a responsibility in respect of capacity and

                  safety of supporters.




                                                                            39
                     R93   At Hillsborough, The Club have provided a system

                     albeit an unsatisfactory one, to monitor the number of

Part V               supporters entering the ground by reference to a

Document 189         turnstile counting system.   That Chief Superintendent
T "
Pages 963-986        DUCKENFIELD had access to this information and did

Part II              consult it, albeit through subordinates, is well

Document 89          documented.   That it could not be related specifically

Pages 571-573        to pens 3 and 4 is also clear.



                     R94   That only leaves the option of visual

                     monitoring, either by stewards, or police, or a

                     combination of both.



                     R95   Clearly, on 15 April 1989, the perception of the

                     Club as to whose was the responsibility for the

                     monitoring and packing of the crowd, differed from

Part V               that of police.   The South Yorkshire Police Standing

Document 192         Order on Policing Football Matches promulgates the

Pages 998-1044       view that it is a prime responsibility of the Club

                     with police responsibilities in this respect catered

                     for by training of stewards and briefing both annually

                     and match by match.



Part I               R96   The Club’s view does not reflect the Police

Document 1           Standing Instruction.   From the Club’s internal

Pages 1-5            memorandum dated 8 June 1988, which was copied to, and

Statement Page 605   received by South Yorkshire Police, a much narrower

                     view is taken of the responsibilities of stewarding.
Part V              R97   The net result was that Chief Superintendent

Statement Pages     DUCKENFIELD took the view, shared by the senior police

2457-2469           officers in South Yorkshire, that on the terraces

Part II             supporters find their own level, and on the day

Statement Pages     neither police officer, nor Club employee recognised

846-859c            the fact that pens 3 and 4 were overcrowding early

860-869             enough to do anything to alleviate it.




Part III            R98   In so far as Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD is

Document 176        concerned on the day, his view was the view from the

Schedule Page 864   Police Control Box window and on his CCTV monitors.

                    Additional information was available to him from the

                    Club Control Room (crowd numbers) and from officers on

                    the ground.    That he could see the imbalance of the

                    crowd in the various pens at the Leppings Lane

Part IV             terraces is beyond any dispute, but there is no
Statement Pages
1898-1908           evidence that he could see, or should have seen that
1909-1915
1916-1923           the imbalance was in fact serious overcrowding and
1924-1929
1965-1971           crushing in pens 3 and 4 .   By the time information
1972-1975
2035-2041           came to him from the track around the ground, the
2042-2046
2047-2055           situation was beyond monitoring and packing.

                    R99   This particular aspect is part of the evidence

                    currently under consideration by the Director of

                    Public Prosecutions in respect of Chief Superintendent

                    DUCKENFIELD’S culpability for Manslaughter or Culpable

                    insufficient evidence to prosecute these criminal




                                                                              40
                  offences, then the same must be said in respect of the

                  disciplinary offence.   In which case the complaint is

                  unsubstantiated.



                  R100   He failed to act when it became obvious that

                  pens 3 and 4 were overfull when he had an excellent

                  view point from the police box above the pens.



Part IV           R101   This complaint is made by Mr JONES only and he

Statement Pages   explains that because Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

2373-2376         could actually see the pens on the terraces himself

                  and had the CCTV monitors on which he could view the

                  crowd, he should have recognised pens 3 and 4 were

                  overcrowded and done something about it.



                  R102   The disciplinary offence which has to be

                  considered is:-



                  Neglect of Duty



                  Without good and sufficient cause neglected or omitted

                  to attend to or carry out with due promptitude and

                  diligence anything which is his duty as a member of a-

                  police force to attend to or carry out, viz he failed

                  to recognise that pens 3 and 4 were overcrowded and

                  failed to take action so as to prevent and alleviate

                  that overcrowding.
                        Contrary to The Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

                        Schedule 1. Regulation 4(1) paragraph 4(a).



Part III                R103   Photographs have been taken from the Police

Document 176            Control box in an attempt to show the view that Chief

Schedule Page 864       Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and his staff in the Police

                        Control Box, had on 15 April 1989.   The photographs

                        show empty terraces because, not unnaturally, the

                        Leppings Lane terraces pens 3 and 4 have not been used

                        to accommodate spectators since the tragedy.   The

                        pictures give a clear sight of the perimeter fence,

                        the radial fences, the tunnel entrance, and the gates

                        in the radial fences.   On the day the presence of the

                        supporters obstructed the view of most of those

                        structures which played a part in the crushing which

                        resulted in deaths and injuries.



Part III                R104   There is video evidence of supporters in pens 3

Document 128            and 4 . not taken from the view point of the Police

Schedule Page 774-775   Control Box, which shows the crowd playing with an

                        inflated beach ball, some supporters sitting on the

                        radial fences, some supporters standing on crush

                        barriers, and some supporters climbing from one pen to

                        another, but there is no evidence of any activity or

                        disorder in pens 3 or 4 which would have caused the

                        attention of the Police Control box staff to be

                        directed specifically to these pens prior to the

                        occurance of the crushing.
Part III                 R105   At 1452 hours a photograph was taken of the

Document 162             Western Terraces which clearly shows the uneven

Schedule Pages 841-843   distribution of the crowd with the central pens 3 and

Photo 28                 4 much more full of supporters than pens 1 and 2, and

                         6 and 7.     That is about the moment that Gate C was

                         opened on the directions of Chief Superintendent

Part III                 DUCKENFIELD.     A similar photograph was taken at 1454

Document 162             hours and that would be about 2 minutes after Gate C

Schedule Pages 841-843   was opened.     From a study of the photograph there does

Photo 29                 not appear to be a serious overcrowding problem at

                         that time.     Although the view is not that which Chief

                         Superintendent DUCKENFIELD would have had, the large

                         spaces on the terraces in pens 6 and 7 are very

                         noticeable, and clearly there is room in pens 1 and 2

                         for more supporters.




Part IV                  R106   These two photographs were taken by Mr.
Statement Pages
2090-2091                        a spectator in the crowd, and can be compared

Part IV
Statement Pages
2092-2093
Part III                 R107   Although this photograph does not depict the
Document 162
Schedule Page 841        view that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had on the
Photo 1
                         day, the scene at the front of pens 3 and 4 is one of

                         a very densely packed crowd.    However, it must be

                         recognised that this photograph was taken from the

                         opposite end of the ground to the Police Control Box.




                                                                                     43
                   The perspective of the two views was different and it

                   cannot be shown that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                   was able to see what the camera saw.



                   R.108   The Police CCTV camera which covered the West

                   Terraces, and thus pens 3 and 4, was camera No 2 but it

                  was never in recording mode so no pictures from it are

                   available.



                  R109     Although it has proved to be impossible to

                   establish an exact time, it seems likely that at about

                   the time that the teams came out onto the pitch, or

                  were kicking off. Police Constable ILLINGWORTH and

                  Police Constable SMITH tried to send a radio message

                  from the perimeter track directly outside pens 3 and 4,

                  to the Police Control Box to the effect that a serious

Part IV           crushing problem was occurring in those pens. Neither

Statement Pages   message was acknowledged as being received and they

2145-2147         were not repeated.     There is no evidence that either

2148-2151         of these messages were received in the Police Control

2165-2172         Box, but it may be that an unintelligible message

2173-2182         heard by Police Sergeant GODDARD in the Control Box

                  relates to one or other of them.



Part V            R110     At about 1500 hours, or shortly thereafter,

Statement Pages   Inspector BULLAS from his position in the West Stand

3269-3274         overlooking pens 3 and 4, saw some abnormal crowd

                  behaviour in pen 3.     He describes an extraordinary surge
                  in the crowd much like a river of molten lava from a

                  volcano.   He tried to contact the Control Box to

                  report it but heard no acknowledgement.   There is no

                  evidence that this message was ever received.

Part V

Statement Pages   Rill Superintendent MARSHALL, Chief Inspector PURDY,

2527-2547         Chief Inspector WARING, Police Sergeant GREEN, and

2616-2619         other officers all recall the radio difficulties they

2694-2699         were experiencing at this time.

2719-2728

                  R112   This particular aspect is part of the evidence

                  currently under consideration by the Director of

                  Public Prosecutions in respect of Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD*S culpability for Manslaughter or Culpable

                  Malfeasance.   Should the Director decide that there is

                  insufficient evidence to prosecute these criminal

                  offences, then the same must be said in respect of the

                  disciplinary offence.   In which case this complaint is

                  unsubstantiated.



                  R113   He should not have opened the gates under any

                  circumstances giving unlimited and uncontrolled access

                  into the football ground by supporters.



Part IV           R114   This complaint is made by Mrs McBRIEN only and

Statement Pages   she explains that it was unnecessary to open Gate C

2432A-R           because the crush was at the turnstiles not in the
                         vicinity of Gate C.     Police should have controlled the

                         crowd and delayed the kick off rather than open an

                         exit gate.



                         R115     It is difficult to see how this specific

                         complaint gives rise to any specific disciplinary

                         offence.     In logic it cannot be said that gates should

                         not be opened under any circumstances.    Without

                         entering the realms of fantasy it is possible to

                         envisage many circumstances which would justify the

                         opening of a gate or gates, and on 15 April 1989, such

                        was the build up of circumstances at the Leppings Lane

                         turnstiles that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had

                        no alternative but to open the gates.      The late and

                        uneven flow of Liverpool supporters at the inadequate

                        number of unsatisfactory constructed turnstiles,

                        aggravated by a substantial minority of fans who had

                        drunk too much, many of them without tickets, led,

                        among other things, to a loss of police control at

                        Leppings Lane.     Whether or not these circumstances, or

                        some of them, should have been avoided or prevented,

                        is discussed elsewhere in this report, but the fact

                        remains, given the circumstances prevailing at the

Lord Justice TAYLOR’S   time, "Superintendent MARSHALL was right at that     stage

Interim Report          to ask for it and Mr DUCKENFIELD was right to

Para 228                agree."     The opening of the gate or gates was a

                        positive decision made by Chief Superintendent

                        DUCKENFIELD and cannot amount to a neglect of duty.




                                                                                     46
                  R116   It might be argued by the complainant to be a

                  wrong decision but that does not amount to neglect.



                  R117   It is pertinent here to consider the option of

                  delaying the kick-off and announcing that fact to the

                  crowd outside the turnstiles so that the anxiety of

                  getting into the ground "on time" is removed and with

                  it the need for pushing and shoving.



Part V            R118   Although Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has

Statement Pages   refused to answer any questions about this, or any

2457-2469         other matter, a number of issues are capable of proof.



                  R119   First, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had

                  decided in advance his policy about delaying the

                  kick-off.   It was that if there was an identifiable

                  problem, such as a serious incident, accident on the

                  motorway or fog on the Pennines, which would prevent

                  large numbers of fans arriving on time, he would

                  consider delaying the kick-off but not in respect of

                  those fans who had got to the area within a reasonable

                  time but had chosen not to enter the ground as soon as

                  possible.



Part V            R120   Second, that shortly after Superintendent

Statement Pages   MARSHALL made his request to the Police Control Box

2527-2547         for Leppings Lane to be closed to traffic, Chief

2457-2469         Superintendent DUCKENFIELD rehearsed that policy in

2470-2488         conversation with Superintendent MURRAY.
Part V            R121   Third, that Police Constable BUXTON asked for

Statement Pages   the kick-off to be delayed some time before Gate C was

2830-2835         opened at 1452 hours.



                  R122 Fourth, that some players came onto the pitch

                  from the player’s tunnel at 1438 and after kicking a

                  ball about for a while they left the pitch through the

                  player’s tunnel at 1444.



                  R123   Fifth, that the Liverpool team came out onto the

                  pitch through the player’s tunnel at 1454 hours.

Part III

Document 128      R124   Sixth, that the Nottingham Forest team came out

Schedule Pages    onto the pitch through the player’s tunnel at 1455

774-775           hours.



                  R125   Seventh, that the referee and two linesmen came

                  out onto the pitch at 1457 hours.



                  R126   Eighth, that the match started at 1459-30 hours

                   (BBC Time).



                  R127   Ninth, that there was a group of press and other

                  photographers around the mouth of the player’s tunnel

                  from 1439 hours to 1459 hours.   They were there, not

                  only to photograph the teams and match officials as

                  they came onto the pitch, but also to photograph Mr

                  Brian CLOUGH the Nottingham Forest Manager, a

                  controversial figure who had recently been banned from

                  the trainers bench by the FA.
                          R128     The only indication that Chief Superintendent

                          DUCKENFIELD ever considered delaying the start of the

                          match arise first, somewhere between 1417 and 1435

Part V                    hours, when Superintendent MARSHALL requested the

Statement Pages           closure of Leppings Lane.     Chief Superintendent

2527-2547                 DUCKENFIELD then sought the advice of Superintendent

                          MURRAY as to whether the crowd of supporters still

                          outside Leppings Lane turnstiles would get into the

                          ground by kick-off time, and was assured that they

                          would.    He then asked Superintendent MURRAY to remind

                          him of the agreed policy for delaying the kick-off.



                          R129     Second, there is no doubt that at about 1452

Part V                    hours, that Police Constable BUXTON asked for the

Statement Pages           kick-off to be delayed.     That message was received in

2830-2835                 the Control Box and the request was refused.      That

                          time is much closer to the arrival of the teams onto

                          the pitch.



Lord Justice TAYLOR’S     R130   In his unsworn testimony to the Lord Justice

Public Inquiry            Taylor Public Inquiry, Chief Superintendent

24,25     & 26 May 1989   DUCKENFIELD refused to accept that he was considering

Page No    113-143        delaying the kick-off.    At various stages of his

            1-130         evidence he gave three    reasons as to why he

             1-52         thought it was too late to delay the kick-offs-



                          (i)    One of the teams had already come out onto the

                                 pitch.




                                                                                     48
R131   It seems very likely that what Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD saw was the players coming

onto the pitch for the early kickabout at 1438 hours.

That time corresponds to the time he was consulting

Superintendent MURRAY about the delay policy.       That is

only correct if Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD is

right in his estimation of the timing of the request

for the closure of Leppings Lane to traffic.

Superintendent MURRAY’S log ends with that request

timed at 1417 hours.   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

estimates the time of the request as 1435 hours, or

thereabouts, and that estimation has some support from

Superintendent MARSHALL.



(ii)   The sight of a group of photographers at the end

       of the players’ tunnel had mislead him into

       believing that the teams were coining out.



R132   The photographers were in that position for such

a lengthy period of time as to be a very unreliable

signal that the teams’ arrival on the pitch was

imminent.   Nevertheless, that could easily have been

the belief of Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD who

would have had no reason to watch them other than by

infrequent glances from time to time.



(iii) He believed the teams were coming out but does

       not know why he believed that.
R133   It seems likely that Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD did consider the option of delaying the

kick-off at the time he was consulting Superintendent

MURRAY about the policy.   He looked out of the window

of the Police Control Box and saw either the players

having an early kickabout at 1438 hours, or the ring

of photographers around the players tunnel.   From this

he wrongly concluded that the players had come out to

start the match, or their arrival on the pitch was

imminent.   He therefore decided that he had lost the

option of delaying the kick-off.



R134   That may have been so in respect of Police

Constable BUXTON’S request because the timing of his

request is uncertain.   However, it seems likely that

he would have made it before the opening of Gate C at

1452 hours, otherwise it would have lost its point.

That the request was received in the Control Box, and

refused, seems to be beyond doubt.



R135   Although Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has

refused to answer any questions on this or any other

matter, it seems likely that his failure to delay the

kick-off stemmed not from the inflexibility of his

policy which he had discussed with Superintendent

MURRAY, but because he had mistimed and misread the

situation when he was considering delaying the kick

off.   That he was reluctant so to do is clear from his
                  policy and his opinion that to postpone a kick-off

                  whenever a proportion of the fans choose to arrive

                  late at the turnstiles, would set a precedent and

                  develop into a practice which would make kick-off

                  times meaningless.     That he had the opportunity to

                  delay the kick-off is clear.     That he should have done

                  so is also clear, but that is not to say that if he

                  had done so it would have solved the problem at the

Part V            Leppings Lane turnstiles.    Indeed, there is some

Statement Pages   suggestion that the crowd outside the Leppings Lane

2821-2829         turnstiles were misinformed that the kick-off would be

2633-2647         delayed, but that message had no effect.



                  R136   Because Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, for

                  whatever reason, chose not to delay the kick-off, we

                  shall never know what the effect on the crowd would

                  have been.   What we do know is that having lost

                  control of the overcrowding outside Leppings Lane and

                  having rejected the option of delaying the kick-off,

                  Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had no option but to

                  open the exit gates.



                  R137   That the possible effects of such an action

                  required steps to have been taken is considered

                  elsewhere in this report, but this particular

                  complaint is unsubstantiated.



6.                R138   He failed to control the movement of supporters

                  subsequent to the opening of Gate C .



                                                                           51
7.                R139     He failed to make provision for fans coming

                  through Gate C after he had given the order for the

                  gate to be opened.



Part IV           R140     These complaints are made by Mr HICKS and Mr

Statement Pages   JONES and they explain that although not witnesses to

2331-2356         the influx of supporters into the stadium once Gate C

Statement Pages   had been opened, once through the turnstiles the only

2368-2377         sign visible was above the tunnel which led to pens 3

                  and 4.     The natural inclination of the crowd would be

                  to make for the tunnel and should have been

                  controlled.



Part V            R141     The decision to open Gate C was made by Chief

Statement Pages   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and passed to

2457-2469         Superintendent MARSHALL by Superintendent MURRAY over

2527-2547         the police personal radio which was on

2470-2488         "talk-through."    That means all officers in possession

                  of a personal radio, on duty at Hillsborough that day

                  should have heard the message.    Of course, the din

                  within the stadium, preoccupation with other matters,

                  and the fallibility of personal radios, would all

                  create difficulties in this respect.



                  R142   However, the decision to open the gates was not

                  followed by any direct or indirect orders to deal with

                  the 2,000 or so fans who entered the ground in this

                  way for a period of five minutes.    On entering the
Part IV            ground there were no stewards or police officers

Statement Pages    checking or directing them so the majority of them

1863-1869         made for the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4 . either

1870-1878          following those in front, or making for the only sign

1879-1883          clearly visible to them, above the tunnel.    Once

1884-1889          inside the ill-fated pens the crowd pressure was such

1890-1897          that lateral movement through the gates in the radial

Part II            fences into other less crowded pens was not possible.

Statement Pages

941-949           R143   In his unsworn testimony to the Lord Justice

                  TAYLOR Inquiry, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                  stated that he had not considered where the fans would

                  go once Gate C was opened.   It did not cross his mind

                  to deploy police officers to block the concourse end

                  of the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4, and he had no

                  knowledge to suggest that this had been done in 1988.



                  R144   That he had time to consider such action seems

                  clear because from 1447 hours when Superintendent

                  MARSHALL made his first request, until 1452 hours when

                  the Gate C was opened, five minutes elapsed.    During

                  that period, however, he was concerned with other

                  matters.   It must also be said that the five minute

                  period embraces within it the time taken for the

                  request to be received by the radio operator and

Part V            conveyed to Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.   His

Statement Pages   decision has then to be conveyed to his radio operator

2457-2469         and on to Superintendent MARSHALL.   Once the decision




                                                                           ti
2470-2488         was made there was some dispute between stewards and

2554-2565         police about the opening of the gates, probably

2566-2577         because those on the inside of the gates did not

2578-2588         appreciate the problems on the outside.

2589-2596

                  R145   This suggests that the period of time available

                  to Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD between the well

                  documented first request from Superintendent MARSHALL

                  at 1447 and the actual opening of Gate C (on video) at

                  1452 was considerably less than five minutes.



                  R146   Although Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has

                  refused to answer any questions on this, or any other

                  matters, it seems clear that his failure to control

                  the influx was not a deliberate decision not to act,

                  simply he did not even consider taking such action.

                  This was acknowledged by Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD at the Public Inquiry.



                  R147   Having given the decision to open Gate C, Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD kept the matter in mind

                  because he continued to watch what effects the

                  extraordinary influx of fans would have inside the

                  stadium.   For example, it was at this time that a

Part V            request was made for Gate A to be opened.   Although

Statement Pages   puzzled by this request, because he believed he had

3043-3048         already given permission for Gates A, B and C to be

                  opened, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD approved the
                          order for serials to be deployed on the concourse

                          inside Gate A and the North Stand.       Because he had
                                 %


                          time to do that it can be argued that he had time to

                          arrange for the reception of the influx through Gate

                          C.     There are two points of significance in that

                          respect.



                          R148       First an influx of unchecked fans through Gate A

                          could lead to disputes as to seating in the all-ticket

                          North Stand and possibly a pitch invasion from that

                          area because of the lack of perimeter fencing.



                          R149       Second, there would be no disputes as to places

                          on the Western Terraces which were standing only, and

                          no danger of a pitch invasion because of the perimeter

                          fences.



Part V                    R150       Because the Senior Officers of South Yorkshire

Statement Pages           Police, including Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.

2457-2469                 believed that crowd monitoring and crowd packing were

Part II                   the responsibility of Sheffield Wednesday Football

Statement Pages 860-869   Club, the possibility of overcrowding simply was not

                          considered.



                          R151       However, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                          personally, and through his subordinates did continue

                          to monitor the effects of the influx through Gate C

                          onto the West Terraces, but saw nothing which they
                          recognised as overcrowding or crushing in pens 3 or 4

                          until it was too late to prevent it.



                          R152   Because of Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’S

                          refusal to answer questions there are a number of

                          unresolved issues in respect of this particular

                          complaint.



                          R153   First, did he intend to authorise the opening of

                          Gates A, B and C, or just Gate C?    It seems very

                          likely that he intended for all the gates to be

                          opened.



                          R154   If he was expecting Gates A, B and C to be

                          opened simultaneously then he could have expected the

                          supporters would be able to "find their own level" by

                          distributing themselves to three separate match

                          viewing areas.



                          R155   If so, for how long did he intend Gate C to

Part II                   remain open?     The iron perimeter gates outside the

Statement Pages 958-960   Leppings Lane turnstiles were closed by police in

Part V                    order to prevent any more supporters from entering the

Statement Pages           overcrowded concourse between these iron perimeter

2815-2820                 gates and the turnstiles.   The opening of Gate C would

                          then have relieved the pressure there very quickly and

                          allow the gate to be closed again to allow for

                          controlled entry through the turnstiles.   That might

                          well have produced only a relatively small number of
                         supporters to enter the ground unchecked and the "find

                         their own level" policy might have had some chance of

                         limited success.     However, once the crowd outside the

                         iron perimeter gates saw the opening of Gate C, the

                         rush towards it burst open the iron perimeter gates so

                         that an unbroken stream of supporters flowed from

                         Leppings Lane itself into the stadium.     That was

Part III                 clearly visible on the CCTV monitor for camera 1 and

Document 110             should have sounded warnings to anyone who was

Schedule Pages 742-747   watching it.     Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                         undoubtably was so watching.



                         R156     It is probable that Chief Superintendent

                         DUCKENFIELD did not intend to close Gate C himself,

                         and in view of his approach to policing the event

                         which emerges from his unsworn testimony to the Public

                         Inquiry, he would have waited for a request to close

                         the gates from his officers on the ground, or would

                         have expected them to take such action themselves.



                         R157     Clearly the opening of Gate C, and other gates,

                         was the right decision given the circumstances

                         prevailing at the time.     It was intended to relieve

                         the crowd pressure outside the Leppings Lane

                         turnstiles so as to prevent injury or even death

                         there.     The opening of Gate C achieved that.



                         R158     Clearly, no orders or directions were given for

                         police, or stewards, to control the influx of



                                                                                    57
supporters through Gate C, and to that extent Mr

JONES’s and Mr HICKS’s complaints are correct.



R159   The following disciplinary offence arises for

consideration:-



Neglect of Duty.



Without good and sufficient cause neglects or omits to

attend to or carry out with due promptitude and

diligence anything which it is his duty as a member of

a police force to attend to or carry out, viz he

failed to control the movement of supporters

subsequent to the opening of Gate C at Hillsborough on

15 April 1989.



Contrary to The Police (Discipline ) Regulations. 1985

Schedule 1. Regulation 4(1) paraerapn 4iai •'



R160   It can be proved that Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD did fail to control the movement 6f

supporters once he had authorised the opening oi

C, in fact he did not even consider deploying any of

his very large work-force to steer the supporters away

from pens 3 and 4.   He could have achieved this quite

simply by directing a small number of officers, or

even stewards or a mixture of police and stewards, to
                           act as a cordon at the concourse end of the tunnel

                           leading to pens 3 and 4.



Part II                   R161     There is a suggestion that this had been done in

Statement Pages 1128A-B    1988 at Hillsborough but that was not known to Chief

                           Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, despite what appeared at

                          the time to be a commendable system of debriefings and

                          information sharing, adopted by South Yorkshire

                          Police.



                          R162     Although Hillsborough has some history of

                          overcrowding, before the 1989 semi-final it would have

                          been a reasonable assumption to make that these

                          incidents had been addressed and remedial action

                          taken.    This is particularly so when on the face of

                          the record available to Chief Superintendent

                          DUCKENFIELD, the 1988 semi-final had been policed so

                          successfully.    The order for the 1989 semi-final had

                          been prepared by the well respected and experienced

                          Chief Superintendent MOLE, the previous officer in

                          command, and the planning team, and the key personnel

                          were the same in 1989 as had policed the 1988 event

                          and before.



                          R163   The philosophy of policing football matches, not

                          only of South Yorkshire Police but also nationally,

                          was reflected in the South Yorkshire Police Standing

                          Instructions for Policing Football Matches, with its

                          emphasis on hooliganism, disorder and pitch invasion.


                                                                                    59
                R164   The fairly recent Bradford fire disaster, a West

                Yorkshire tragedy, was also prominent in the Standing

                Instructions with its emphasis on crowd safety

                evacuation procedures.



                R165   That some thought was given to crowd problems is

                indicated by the lengths that Chief Superintendent

                DUCKENFIELD went to in order to keep non-ticket

Part IV         holders away and to get the fans into the ground as

Document 185    early as possible.   But even in this respect there is

Page 929        no indication that it was an "overcrowding problem

Document 186    which was envisaged."

Pages 930-931

                R166   Having got the job as officer in command no more

                than sixteen to nineteen days before the event, it is

                reasonable that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had

                to take the ground with its various configurations, as

                he found it; and the advice of experienced officers,

                as given.



                R167   Consequently, it is understandable that his

                planning made no specific provision to deal with

                overcrowding.   In any event, he knew he had a

                considerable number of officers held in reserve so as

                to provide flexibility on the day.
                   R168    Given the circumstances on the day at about 1452

                   the decision to open Gate C was the right one.      Given

                   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’S understanding of

                   the priorities for preventing disorder and evacuation

                   if necessary, it is perhaps understandable that he

                   gave no thought of overcrowding as a police

                   responsibility.



                   R169    When the decision was made to open the gate, no

                   warning was given by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                   either to police or to the Club.    Not even

                   Superintendent GREENWOOD, the Ground Commander inside

                   the stadium, was alerted.    The fact that the personal

                   radio system was on "talk-through" is quite inadequate

                   for action to be taken by officers on the ground even

                   if they heard the message.   The message was directed

                   to Superintendent MARSHALL from Superintendent

                  MURRAY.    To expect other officers to act on that

                  message is dangerous and unrealistic.



Part II           R170    The day in question was plagued by the

Statement Pages   intermittent failure of the police personal radios

1123-1128         which made the gathering and dissemination of

Part V            intelligence, information, request and decision, a

Statement Pages   serious problem.   For one period at about 1440 hours

2470-2488         the Police Control Box was out of radio contact.

2489-2501         Although quickly repaired the remedy was a hand held

                  set in the Control Box which meant that the control




                                                                               61
2502-2514   could not override any messages.    Superintendent

2527-2547   GREENWOOD’S request for the match to be stopped and

2566-2577   various messages from the track serials reporting

2694-2699   distress in the pens were not received.    No effective

2719-2728   radio messages reached the Control Box from the

2939-2946   perimeter track or from Leppings Lane at the relevant

2947-2955   times. Undoubtedly the poor radio communications on

3184-3190   the day made it extremely difficult for Chief

3269-3274   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to make proper assessments

3305-3311   and exercise effective command.

3315-3323

3324-3328

            R171    It is arguable that between the request at 1447

            and the opening of Gate C at 1452, there was time for

            Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to organise a police

            reception group to control the sudden influx of

            supporters, bearing in mind all of the matters inside

            the stadium which were capturing the attention of the

            Police Control Box at that time.   The supporters would

            come in unchecked perhaps with weapons perhaps with

            intoxicating drink, perhaps without tickets.     The

            danger of a pitch invasion or similar disorder must

            have appeared to be more than likely.   Consequently,

            such arrangements as were made by or for Chief

            Superintendent DUCKENFIELD were in prevention of that

            risk.   Attention was spread around the ground and not

            confined to the West Terraces.
                   R172   The view from the Police Control Box of the

                   crowd and the pens was not the view captured by

                  various still and video cameras.   Nor was it the view

                   enjoyed by supporters in various parts of the ground.

                  Gate C remained open until about 1457 hours and there

                  is no evidence to show that Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD saw anything amiss, or was informed about

                  anything amiss, on the West Terraces apart from an

                  imbalance between the crowd in pens 3 and 4, and the

                  crowd in pens 1 and 2, and 6 and 7.   Even after the

                  match had started and police officers on the track

                  were beginning to realise that there was an over-

Part II           crowding problem, John MOTSON. the BBC TV commentator

Statement Pages   broadcasting live, a man who is very experienced

1110-1118         observing large crowds at football matches, did not

                  notice until 1504 hours that there was a crowd problem

                  at the Leppings Lane end.   Albeit that his attention

                  would be centred on the play he was observing from a

                  position far superior to that of Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD and does lend credence to the view that up

                  to the point of stopping the game Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD was not aware of the real problems in pens

                  3 and 4.   It was not until 1505 hours that Mr MOTSON,

                  in his live television commentary suspected that there

                  was an overcrowding problem on the West Terraces.     It

                  is difficult to prove that Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD should have taken action to block off the

                  end of the tunnel, or some similar action designed to




                                                                             63
divert the flood of supporters coming through Gate C,

into the wing pens of the West Terrace.



R173   As the stream from Gate C flowed through the

tunnel, the Police Control Box staff were keeping

watch in pens 3 and 4.     Although they had sight of the

pens through the window and they had the view from the

CCTV monitors, no attempts were made to direct the

attention of officers on the track, or in the West

Stand where they had an overview of pens 3 and 4, to

watch for overcrowding.    From the unsworn testimony of

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD at the Public

Inquiry, he relied upon all police officers to take

any action required of them and he delegated almost

unbridled authority to his commanders on the ground.

If there was a problem of any sort requiring his

attention Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD expected to

be told about it.   The police personal radios were

working at this time albeit subject to very heavy air

traffic and crowd noise.



R174   There is some evidence to substantiate the

belief of Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD that

officers would act on their own initiative.    The

Operation Order for 1988 instructed officers to

prevent:-



"Access to the track from the terraces without the

consent of a senior officer (except to receive medical

attention)."
                                                           64
                  R175   That prohibition was repeated in the 1989

                  Operation Order and was printed in capital letters,

                  presumably because there had been a pitch invasion

                  during the 1988 semi-final and a repetition was feared

                  in 1989.



                  R176   However, despite what appears to be a mandatory

                  order, there is clear evidence that even before the

Part V            crushing was recognised in pens 3 and 4 at least one

Statement Pages   police constable opened the perimeter gate and

3315-3323         relocated fans in other pens, without the prior

3324-3328         approval of a senior officer.



                  R177   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’S life-saving

                  decision to open Gate C in respect of the fans being

                  crushed outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles was not

                  fully thought through, but that presumes that his

                  knowledge of the ground, its geography and signing,

                  particularly at the Leppings Lane end, was sufficient

                  to expect a natural progression from Gate C to the

                  tunnel and into pens 3 and 4.   His knowledge of

                  Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 depended upon ten years

                  old experience, and two ground inspections at the

                  Millwall and Wimbledon matches on 1 and 5 April 1989.

                  Neither of these games attracted large crowds and his

                  inspections were conducted in the light of the

                  successful 1988 semi-final and the draft Operation

                  Order prepared by Chief Superintendent HOLE and

                  supported by the key personnel who would be working

                  with him on 15 April 1989.
                                                                   “ V     £5
                  R178   All of that would have coloured his thinking on

                  the day when the crisis occurred.    That he neglected

                  to make any arrangements to receive the crowd in the

                  ground once he opened Gate C is beyond doubt.      Given

                  the information available at the time, I doubt that it

                  can be proved that he should have done.



                  R179   This complaint forms part of the evidence

                  currently being considered in respect of Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’S culpability for

                  Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance.     Should the

                  Director decide that there is insufficient evidence to

                  prosecute these criminal offences, then the same must

                  be said in respect of the disciplinary offence of

                  Neglect of Duty.    In that case these complaints are

                  unsubstantiated.



8.                R180   He failed to respond to the developing tragedy

                  and was slow to effect a rescue operation.



9.                R181   He failed to act when it was obvious that people

                  were in distress.



Part IV           R182   These complaints are made by Mr HICKS and Mr

Statement Pages   JONES and by way of explanation they say it was

2331-2356         obvious the Police totally misread events, believing a

Statement Pages   pitch invasion/trouble was underway and mounted a

2368-2377         restraining rather than a rescue operation.    The

                  rescue commenced some ten minutes too late and was
totally disorganised, the death toll being much higher

as a consequence.    Chief Superintendent DUCKEHFIELD

did not use his senior officers to good effect in

order to coordinate the disaster and he failed to act

himself in a way his position demanded.



R183   In this instance Mr HICKS was an eye-witness but

there are a number of discrepancies in his

statements.    However, he is also Chairman of the

Hillsborough Family Support Group so his complaint

goes wider than his own personal experience.     The

first difficulty with his personal recollection is one

of timing.    On the day of the disaster when he was

under extreme emotional shock, he saw nothing untoward

until the game had been in progress for four or five

minutes. At that time he saw people pushing and

shoving in    pens 3 and 4, and people being pushed up

against the perimeter and radial fences.     One of these

people was an old man in a grey suit,

                             Mr HICKS shouted to a

senior police officer who ran onto the pitch and

stopped the game.   There is no criticism of any police

officer in    that recollection statement.



R184   In a   detailed prepared statement which was sent

to police on or about 18 May 1989 he describes a

similar series of incidents but says they occurred "a

little before kick off (approximately 1450 pm)."       This




                                                              67
                           change of timing is important because it suggests Mr

                           HICKS was witnessing crushing in pens 3 and 4 as early

                           as 1450 hours.   Still before kick-off he describes

                           people being hoisted out of pens 3 and 4 into the West

                           Stand, and an increasing number of fans climbing over

                           the perimeter and radial fences of pens 3 and 4.



                          R185   Having noted that the teams then kicked off he

                          describes a police cordon two to three officers deep

                          placed in an arc around pens 3 and 4 "and it was

                          obvious that their purpose was to prevent anybody

                          climbing over the barrier."



                          R186   While the game was still in progress he believes

                          that several fans were trying to climb the perimeter

                          fence and were pushed back into the pens by police

                          officers.   The officers in the arc, or cordon, were

                          standing watching with their arms folded.



                          R187   This continued for some five to ten minutes and

considered is:-



Neglect of Duty.



Without good and sufficient cause neglected or omitted

to attend to or carry out with due promptitude and

diligence anything which is his duty as a member of a

police force to attend to or carry out, viz failed to

respond to the crushing by overcrowding of spectators

in the pens 3 and 4 of the Hillsborough Stadium on 15

April 1989 and was slow to effect a rescue operation.



Contrary to The Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

Schedule 1. Regulation 4(1) paragraph 4(a).



R190   In the Police Control Box no one recognised the

overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until

the first fans spilt out onto the perimeter track just

before kick-off.   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD may

have been unsure as to what was actually happening but

it is more than probable that he assumed there was a

pitch invasion.

                         some of the crowd onto the perimeter track and tried

                         to relocate those released into pen 5.     That action

Part III                 is visible on a video recording and if it was

Document 109             observed by the Control Box staff, although it would

Schedule Pages 740-741   have alerted them to the fact that something was amiss

                         it would have seemed that it was being dealt with by

                         the officer on the spot.



Part V                   R193   From 1500 hours the perimeter gates to pens 3

Statement Pages          and 4 were open and remained so.     This should have

2566-2577                been seen from the Police Control Box and is such an

2578-2588                extraordinary event that it should have attracted

2589-2596                specific attention and enquiry.

Part V                      R197     Superintendent GREENWOOD was at the players

Statement Pages             tunnel as the teams kicked off.     Shortly afterwards he

2515-2526                   noticed the fans on the track and went to the West

                            Terraces end of the ground to investigate.     It was not

                            until he was close to pens 3 and 4 that he recognised

                            the overcrowding problem.     He climbed onto the wall

                            below the perimeter fence and signalled with his hands

                            for the crowd to move back.     This action was seen in

                            the Control Box, but in the absence of information

                            over the personal radio, again the matter would be

                            seen as being dealt with by the senior officer on the

                            ground.



Lord Justice TAYLOR IS      R198     As was suggested at the Lord Justice TAYLOR

Interim Report              Public Inquiry, the hand movements made by

Para 248                    Superintendent GREENWOOD may well have been

                            interpreted by the fans as being attempts to stop

                            supporters from climbing out of the pens at the

                            front.    If that was the likely interpretation made by
                   fans on the spot, it is not unlikely that these hand

                  movements were not properly interpreted by those in

                   the Police Control Box.



Part V            R199     Although Superintendent GREENWOOD tried then to

Statement Pages   contact the Police Control Box by radio, he was

2515-2526         unsuccessful so he had to resort to hand signals

                  indicating that the match should be stopped.      This

                  action was seen in the Police Control Box and

                  recognised.     Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD sent

                  Superintendent MURRAY from the Control Box to have the

                  match stopped via the linesman in accordance with the

                  agreed procedure, but before this could be done,

                  Superintendent GREENWOOD had run onto the pitch and

                  the referee stopped the game.



Part V            R200     Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD remained in the

Statement Pages   Police Control Box and Superintendent MURRAY returned

2470-2488         from his unsuccessful attempt to stop the match.     He

                  did not realise there were injuries at that stage and

                  did not so realise until he saw fans being laid on the

                  pitch.     He sent Superintendent MURRAY back down onto

                  the pitch to assess the situation and clear the

                  pitch.     The crowd on the pitch was increasing rapidly

                  and adding to the chaos were a significant number of

                  press photographers who, in their gruesome search for

                  pictures, upset many fans and minor scuffles broke

                  out.     None of this made it any easier for Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to see and interpret what
                            was happening so a Tannoy message was broadcast for

                            the pitch to be cleared.



 Part II                    R201    At about 1507, the Assistant Chief Constable. Mr

 Statement Pages 860-869    JACKSON. came into the Police Control Box and Chief

 Part V                     Superintendent DUCKENFIELD was unable to say with any

 Statement Pages            clarity what was happening.    It is likely that he told

2457-2469                   Mr JACKSON that there had been a pitch invasion and

                            although he refuses to answer any questions on the

                            subject it seems clear that Chief Superintendent

                            DUCKENFIELD did not tell Mr JACKSON that the exit

                            gates had been opened on his authority.



                            R202    Mr JACKSON left the Control Box and went onto

                            the pitch to gain more information and while he was

Statement Pages             away Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD requested

Part VI                     Operation Support from Police Headquarters.

Document 205
Pages 1315-1351             spontaneous public disorder.    This seems to indicate

                            that as late as 1507 when the request for Operation

                            Support was made, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                           believed he was dealing with a pitch invasion or

                           similar disorder.



Part II                    R203    On his return to the Control Box at about 1510,

StatementPages 860-869   Mr JACKSON was aware that there were casualties.      He

Part VI                    confirmed the request for Operation Support because

Document 216               clearly more manpower resources would be required, but

Page 1509


                                                                                     73
                  he also ensured that the emergency services were

                  alerted and that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                  implemented the South Yorkshire Police Major Incident

                  Plan.    Although there is no specific direction to
Part V
Document 206      implement the Maior Incident Plan it is clear that it
Pages 1352-1444
Part VI           was implemented at that time.
Document 216
Page 1521
                  R204    A call for more ambulances was made from the

Part V            pitch by Superintendent MURRAY at about the time Mr

Statement Pages   JACKSON arrived back in the Police Control Box.    It

2470-2488         was not until that moment that Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD was aware of the real nature of the

                  disaster.    Although the Major Incident Plan seemingly

                  inflexibly places the Divisional Commander in overall

                  command as Site Commander, there is no doubt that from

                  that moment Mr JACKSON had accepted he was in command

                  even if he did not say so specifically at the time.



Part V            R205    The awful truth of the dying, dead and injured

Statement Pages   was recognised at various times by individual officers

3315-3323         in different locations.   Even those police officers

3324-3328         closest to the front of pens 3 and 4 of the Western

3329-3336         Terraces did not immediately recognise the problem.

3337-3340         Even when they did recognise a problem, they thought

                  it could be resolved by a relocation of fans from one

                  pen to another.
                  R206   Of course, at that time they were unaware that

                  the exit gates had been opened so they could not know

                  that the trickle of supporters they were releasing

                  onto the track through the perimeter gates could never

                  match the flood of supporters entering the pens from

                  the rear.

Part IV

Statement Pages   R207   The lack of instructions as to overcrowding and

1916-1923         a formidable deterrent to opening perimeter gates

1924-1929         inevitably led to slow recognition by police of

2145-2147         crushing in the pens.   Certainly there can be no doubt

2148-2151         that the seriousness of the overcrowding in pens 3 and

2311-2313         4 between 1450 hours and 1459 hours was not recognised

2314-2316         and therefore was not effectively remedied.

2320-2322

                  R208   It should not be too surprising therefore, that

                  the staff in the Police Control Box were the last to

                  know. However, the delay in police recognition of the

                  problem was not as great as some witnesses believe.



Part V            R209   Although the immediate assumption in the Police
Statement Pages
2566-2577         Control Box was that a pitch invasion was starting,
2578-2588
2589-2596         and that assumption persisted until the request for

Part V            ambulances was received at about 1507, action was

3337-3340         hours gates 3 and 4 were open and remained so.
Part III                 R210     It is probable that it was at 1504 that the
Document 134
Schedule Pages 786-788   final surge occurred as a Liverpool player shot at the

Part V                   Nottingham Forest goal and hit the bar.     That is the
Statement Pages
3383-3386                most likely moment that a crush barrier in pen 3 broke
3387-3391
3392-3400                and the perimeter gates became blocked.     Police
3401-3410
3411-3418                and fans worked frantically at the narrow perimeter

Part IV                  gate to rescue those trapped. Police Officers and
Statement Pages
1617-1623                fans were trying desperately to haul fans over the
1731-1741
1751-1757                perimeter fence to safety.     Police officers, fans and

                         others were doing what they could to resuscitate the

                         injured, the dying and the dead as they were laid on

                         the pitch.     In the confines of the disaster site it is

                         not surprising that there were many officers, willing

                         and able, who could do nothing other than stand and

Part V                   watch.     That at least some of these officers were
Statement Pages
2515-2526                effectively directed is clear.     It is also not
2711-2718
3049-3054                surprising that hostility and aggression mounted in

                         some of the fans to such an extent that positive

                         action had to be taken by police officers.



Part V                   R211     The morbid press photographers had to be dealt

2633-2647
2655-2668                own protection.    Other officers, on their own
2671-2677
                         initiative went to the rear of the pens to persuade

                         reluctant fans to leave the pens through the tunnel.

Part VI                  Ambulances were sent for at about 1507.    The temporary

                         hours.
Part V                  R212   Sometime between 1506 hours and 1510 hours

Statement Pages         Police Constable SMITH radioed from the pitch to the

3315-3323               Police Control Box for bolt croppers to cut the

Part V                  perimeter fence.    Although he did not know it, Police

Statement Pages         Sergeant GODDARD had received his request and tried to

2566-2577               locate the necessary equipment at a nearby police

                        garage without success.    It was not until 1513 hours

Part V                  that Police Constable BICHARD, in the Control Box,

Statement Pages         requested Police Headquarters Control Room to call the

2578-2588               Fire Brigade to bring hydraulic cutting equipment to

                        the Leppings Lane entrance.



                        R213   Fire appliances with the necessary equipment

Part VI                 arrived at the stadium at 1522 hours.   Station Officer

Statement Pages         FLETCHER rushed the equipment to the front of the West

3664-3670               Terraces but by then the last of the dead and injured

                        were being removed from pens 3 and 4.



Lord Justice TAYLOR’S   R214   Clearly the Fire Brigade could have been called

Interim Report          earlier but it is extremely doubtful that would have

Para 301                saved more lives.



Part VI                 R215   On the day two South Yorkshire Metropolitan

Statement Pages         Ambulance Service Officers were on the ground with one

3529-3540               ambulance, and another ambulance on standby.    As soon

3541-3551               as the ambulance officers noticed the fans on

3552-3559               the track, and while the game was still in progress,

                        they went to them and began to render assistance to

                        the injured.
Part V            R216   Chief Inspector EDMONDSON in Police Headquarters

Statement Pages   Control Room, had been monitoring the police radio

2600-2605         traffic at Hillsborough and both he and Police

Statement Pages   Constable WAUGH heard sufficient for them to make

2608-2610         enquiry of the Police Control Box at 1459 hours as to

                  whether ambulances were required.    The response at

                  that time was in the negative but "standby."     It was

                  not until 1507 hours that the Ground Control notified

                  the Headquarters Control Room that injuries were

                  possible, that the call went to SYMAS that ambulances

                  might be required.    This was confirmed into a positive

                  request during the same telephone conversation.      The

                  first ambulance arrived at the stadium at 1513 hours

                  and in all, 42 ambulances arrived.



                  R217   It is correct to say that the distress of those

                  in the front of pens 3 and 4 was recognised by those

                  officers closest to them at about 1500 hours.     It is

                  also correct that the Major Incident' Plan was not

                  implemented until 1507 hours when the ambulance

                  service was called.   It is also correct that for

                  various reasons no cutting gear was located until the

                  request was made to the fire brigade at 1513 hours.

                  But there is no evidence to show that if these

                  shortcomings had not occurred then lives would have

                  been saved.   Given the poor radio transmissions and

                  reception and the chaos of the moment from

                  the vantage point of the Control Box it is difficult
        to see how these complaints can be substantiated.

        Once the real problem was identified in the Control

        Box the Major Incident Plan was implemented

        effectively and swiftly.   The fact that the injured

       were safely cleared by 1545 hours, the dead were being

       dealt with in the gymnasium under the supervision of H

       M Coroner by 1615 hours, and that all dead had been

       identified by 0430 hours on 16 April 1989 is some

       evidence to support that view.   That it could have

       been done better and perhaps quicker is not the real

       issue, that it was done to the best of the officer’s

       ability given the information available and the

       circumstances prevailing at the time, is.



       R218   This complaint forms part of the evidence

       currently being considered by the Director of Public

       Prosecutions in respect of Chief Superintendent

       DUCKENFIELD’S culpability for Manslaughter or Culpable

       Malfeasance.   Should the Director decide that there is

       insufficient evidence to prove these criminal offences

       then the same must be said in respect of the

       disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.    In that case

       the complaint is unsubstantiated.



10 *   R219   He was deceitful and intentionally misled sen*nr

       police officers and members of the public regarding

       his command and control of police officers on the day.




                                                                  79
11.               R220   He attempted to mislead the Assistant Chief

                  Constable at the ground and others, namely

                  representatives of the Club, the Football Association

                  and the fans themselves regarding the origin of the

                  order for Gate C to be opened.   That is by inferring

                  supporters had forced open the gate when he had, in

                  fact, given the order to open the gate.



Part IV           R221   These complaints are made by Mr HICKS and Mr

Statement Pages   JONES who explain it by alleging that Chief

2331-2356         Superintendent DUCKENFIELD misled Mr JACKSON, the

Statement Pages   Assistant Chief Constable, by making a false statement

2368-2377         to the effect that Liverpool supporters had gained

                  entry to the stadium by forcing Gate C at 1452 hours

                  whereas the gate had in fact been opened on the

                  instructions of Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.

                  This led to Mr JACKSON or Chief Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD repeating the false account to officials

                  of the Football Association and other people later in

                  the day.   The consequence was the maligning of

                  Liverpool supporters by the media which caused anguish

                  and distress to them.   Although Mr HICKS and Mr JONES

                  have no evidence to support the complaint they rely

                  upon the unsworn testimony given by Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and others at the Lord

                  Justice TAYLOR Public Inquiry.



                  R222   The disciplinary offences which have to be

                  considered are:-
(i)    Falsehood or prevarication.



That he, being a member of a police force knowingly,

or through neglect, makes any false, misleading or

inaccurate oral statement required for police purposes

viz made a false statement to an Assistant Chief

Constable that Liverpool supporters had broken down an

exit gate and forced entry into Hillsborough stadium

at 1452 hours, knowing that statement was false.



Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

Schedule 1. Regulation 4(i). paragraph 5(a).



(ii)   Discreditable conduct.



R223   That being a member of a police force he acted

in a manner reasonably likely to bring discredit on

the reputation of the force or the police service, viz

made a false statement to       members of the public so

as to create a false impression that Liverpool

supporters had broken down an exit gate and forced

entry into Hillsborough Stadium at 1452 hours on 15

April 1989.



Contrary to The Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

Schedule 1. Regulation 4(i). paragraph 1 .
                  R224   Whilst conscious of the fact that charges of

                  Discreditable Conduct should be brought sparingly, a

                  more specific charge would be difficult in these

                  particular circumstances where Mr KELLY and Mr KIRTON

                  of the Football Association are involved.



                  Alternatively Mr HICKS complains thats-



12.               R225   He colluded with Mr JACKSON, the Assistant Chief

                  Constable, to mislead the public over the opening of

                  Gate C.



Part IV           R226   This complaint is made only by Mr HICKS and he

Statement Pages   explains it by saying he questions whether Mr JACKSON

2331-2356         was unaware of the truth about the opening of Gate C

                  and there may have been collusion between Mr JACKSON

                  and Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to create a false

                  impression.



                  R227   The disciplinary offence which has to be

                  considered is:-



                  Falsehood or prevarication.



                  Being a member of a police force he knowingly colluded

                  with the Assistant Chief Constable, Mr JACKSON, so as

                  to make a false, misleading or inaccurate oral

                  statement, viz that Liverpool supporters had broken




                                                                            82
                          down an exit gate and forced entry into Hillsborough

                          Stadium at 1452 hours on 15 April 1989.



                          Contrary to The Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.

                          Schedule 1. Regulation 4(i). paragraph 5(a).



Part II                   R228   The Assistant Chief Constable Mr JACKSON.

Statement Pages 860-869   attended the match in civilian clothes, but was the

                          Chief Officer "on call".    He came down from his seat

                          in the stand when he saw fans coming onto the

                          perimeter track from the Western Terraces.      As he left

                          his seat the match was still in progress.    He did not

                          have a police personal radio with him, nor did he have

                          any other means of communication.



                          R229   By the time he reached the Police Control Box at

                          about 1507 the match had been stopped.    He did not

                          know that a sequence of events had occurred as

                          follows:



                          1447   Superintendent MARSHALL requests Chief

                                 Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’S approval to open

                                 the exit gates to relieve pressure outside the

                                 Leppings Lane turnstiles.



                          1448   While Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD was

                                 considering this request, Gate C was opened for

                                 police to eject a youth who had climbed in

                                 without a ticket.   Fans outside took advantage



                                                                                       S3
        of this opening of the gate and about 150 of

        them forced their way in before a mounted

        officer blocked the opening so that the gate

       could be closed.



1449   Superintendent MARSHALL repeated his request for

       authority to open the exit gates.



1451   Superintendent MARSHALL repeated his request

       with the caveat that if the exit gates were not

       opened somebody would be killed.



1452   Gate C was opened wide and in the five minutes

       it was open something in the order of 2,000 fans

       passed through it.     Fans outside the iron

       perimeter gates on the road side of the

       turnstiles at Leppings Lane had seen the opening

       of Gate C and in surging towards it had forced

       open the iron perimeter gates.



1454   Police Sergeant HIGGINS radioed a request for

       authority to open Gate A because of crowd

       pressure.     Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD gave

       the necessary approval and supporters entered

       through it.



1455   Gate B was opened briefly against the stewards

       wishes and about 200 supporters entered through

       it.



                                                         *84
                          1457   Gate C was closed.



                          1459   Gate C was reopened but only a trickle of

                                 supporters entered on this occasion.



Part II                   R230   On his arrival in the Police Control Box Mr

Statement Pages 860-869   JACKSON asked Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD what had

Part V                    happened but he was unable to say.   At that time Chief

Statement Pages           Superintendent DUCKENFIELD did not yet know there had

2457-2469                 been any injuries and was still under the impression

                          that there had been a pitch invasion.   It will be

                          recalled that it was shortly after Mr JACKSON’S arrival

                          in the Control Box that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                          requested Operation Support.



                          R231   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had still not

                          recognised an overcrowding problem so it may be that he

                          had not linked the opening of Gate C with the activities

                          of the crowd and police at the Leppings Lane end.

                          Although Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has refused to

                          answer any questions about this, or any other matters,

                          it seems certain that he did not tell Mr JACKSON that

                          the exit gates had been opened on his authority.

Part II

Statement Pages 819-829   R232   At about 1515 hours Mr Graham KELLY. Chief

Statement Pages 829A-J    Executive of the FA, Mr KIRTON. also of the FA, and Mr

Part I                    Graham MACKRELL. Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday

Statement Pages 36-59
                          Football Club, went to the Control Box to seek

                          information.     Clearly they wanted to know what had

                          happened and advice as to the abandonment of the

                          game.    By this time Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                          knew the nature and scale of the disaster and the

                          Major Incident Plan had been implemented.



                          R233    Although Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has

                          refused to answer any questions on this, or any other

                          matter, it is apparent that he told them there had

Part I                    been fatalities in the crowd, that the game should be

Statement Pages 36-59     abandoned, and he told them that a gate had been

Part II                   forced by Liverpool supporters and there had been an

Statement Pages 819-829   influx into the ground.     The words he is alleged to

Statement Pages 829A-J    have used are to the effect "That’s the gate that’s

Lord Justice TAYLOR’S     been forced:     there’s been an inrush."     At that time

Interim Report            the live pictures of a calm and peaceful Gate C would

21 June 1989              have been showing on monitor 1 in the Control Box, but

Pages 33-103              whether or not Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                          pointed to it, is not clear.     If those are the words

                          used by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD then strictly

                          they are not untruthful.    At 1448 hours Gate C had

                          been forced by     supporters and there had     been   an influx

                          of fans.   Again at 1453 hours, or thereabouts, the

                          iron perimeter     gates outside Gate C had    been    forced by

                          supporters and     this had swelled the influx. However,

                          he did not tell them that he had authorised the

                          opening of Gate C at 1452, even though he had the best
                           of reasons for so doing.   He might not in the strict

                           sense have told a lie, but he certainly did not tell

                           them the whole "truth."



                          R234   Clearly at this time Chief Superintendent

                          DUCKENFIELD knew there had been overcrowding and

                          crushing in pens 3 and 4.   By then he knew the extent

                          of the disaster, but there is no evidence to show that

                          he had linked his approval for the opening of the

                          gates at 1452 hours, to the overcrowding and crushing

                          that followed on from it.



Part II                   R235   The result was that he misled Mr KELLY and the

Statement Pages 819-829   others into thinking there had been an inrush due to

Statement Pages 829A-J    Liverpool fans forcing a gate.   It should have been

Part I                    obvious to Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD that Mr

Statement Pages           KELLY could not avoid talking to the media and that

36-59                     anything he might say, as the officer in command at

Lord Justice TAYLOR’S     the time, would be given great credence and emphasis.

Public Inquiry            Inevitably Mr KELLY was interviewed live on television

21 June 1989              and he repeated the police assertion that the fans had

Pages 33-103              forced their way in.



                          R236   Again, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has

                          refused to answer any questions on this, or any other

                          matter but in his unsworn testimony to the Lord

                          Justice TAYLOR Inquiry he explained that his reason

                          for not telling the "truth" was that he did not wish
                          to divulge it until he had spoken to a senior

                          officer.    He felt that if the crowd became aware of

                          the fact that he had authorised the opening of Gate C

                          there might be a hostile reaction which might impede

                          the rescue work.



                          R237   His explanation does not bear scrutiny.     By 1515

                          hours when he was talking to Mr KELLY and the others,

                          Mr JACKSON, the Assistant Chief Constable, had been at

                          his disposal since about 1507.    For whatever reason,

                          reluctance to tell Mr KELLY the "truth" did not

                          require that he was told an "untruth."    Better he was

                          told nothing than he be misled.



Part II                   R238   About 1530 hours Mr JACKSON and Chief

Statement Pages 860-869   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD by invitation, went to the

Statement Pages 819-828   Club Boardroom.    Mr KELLY was there, so was Mr

Part I                    MACKRELL. the referee and representatives of the three

Statement Pages 36-59     clubs, Sheffield Wednesday, Liverpool and Nottingham

Lord Justice TAYLOR’S     Forest.    Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD indicated

Public Inquiry            that the match was likely to be abandoned but he did

21 June 1989              not want the matter to be announced lest the

Pages 33-103              dispersing crowd hamper the emergency operations.     He

                          certainly did not disclose at that meeting the fact

                          that he had authorised the opening of Gate C but it is

                          not clear whether he repeated the story he had told

Part VII                  previously to Mr KELLY.   However, Mr JACKSON is clear

Appendix C                when he says that when he entered the Boardroom he

Pages 1315-1322           believed Liverpool fans had forced an exit gate and
                           had flooded through it into the ground, and he still

                           had that belief when he left the Boardroom.



Part I                    R239    It was about 1615 hours when Mr JACKSON was

Statement Pages 860 ■869 briefing the Chief Constable, Mr Peter WRIGHT, by

Part V                    telephone from the Police Control Box, that

Statement Pages           Superintendent MARSHALL told him that police had

2527-2547                 opened the gates at his request.    That was the first

                          occasion that Mr JACKSON learned of Chief

                          Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’S authorisation for the

                          opening of Gate C.



                          R240    It may well be that Lord Justice TAYLOR was

Lord Justice TAYLOR* S.   right   when in his Interim Report he said that the

Interim Report            likeliest explanation of Chief Superintendent

Para 284                  DUCKENFIELD’S conduct is that he simply could not face

                          the enormity of the decision to open the gates and its

                          aftermath.    That would explain what he said to Mr

                          KELLY and what he did not say to Mr JACKSON.



                          R241    However, it is a fact that the supporters either

                          deliberately, or by sheer weight of numbers, forced

                          open the iron perimeter gates just after Gate C was

                          opened at 1452.    Although it has not been possible to

                          interview Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD about this,

                          or any other matter, it is possible that in the

                          inevitable confusion of the moment the two gates

                          became confused in the minds of those in the stress of

                          the Control Box.   It is also possible that the earlier
                  opening of Gate C to eject a fan at about 1448 hours

                  which resulted in fans forcing their way into the

                  ground, had become part of the confusion over gates.

Part V            It was on this latter occasion that Police Constable

Statement Pages   BICHARD cried out, "They’ve broken down the gate."

2578-2888

                  R242   None of these events, including the unannounced

                  visit of Mr KELLY and others, occurred in a vacuum.

                  They all occurred at times when there was little time

                  for thought, never mind analysis.   Causes were not

                  important at that stage, actions were.   Lord Justice

                  TAYLOR may be right when he speculates as to the

                  reasons for Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’S lack of

                  candour, but it is an extremely difficult speculation

                  to prove.



                  R243   That Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD misled Mr

                  JACKSON, Mr KELLY and Mr KIRTON seems clear, that he

                  did it deliberately or deceitfully is not supported by

                  the evidence available.



                  R244   The evidence supports the view that Mr JACKSON

                  was unaware of the request and decision to open Gate C

                  at 1452 hours, and he remained unaware of that fact

                  until Superintendent MARSHALL enlightened him at

                  between 1600 and 1615 hours.   That being the case

                  there cannot have been collusion between him and Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.
                  R245   There is insufficient evidence to support a

                  disciplinary charge of Falsehood or Prevarication

                  against Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and the

                  complaints are unsubstantiated.



                  R2A6   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD was seen by the

                  Senior Investigating Officer Mr SHARP in an interview

                  room at Furnival House, Furnival Gate, Sheffield on 3

                  July 1990.    His solicitor Mr COUGHLAN was also

Part VII          present.     The interview was audio recorded and a full

Appendix C        transcript has been prepared and is produced by

Pages 1390 1399   Detective Chief Inspector Kevin TOPE.      Superintendent

                  DUCKENFIELD declined to answer questions put by Mr

                  SHARP concerning any of the allegations.     This leaves

                  only his written submission to the Inquiry by Lord

                  Justice TAYLOR, and the transcript of his evidence to

                  that Inquiry to answer the many outstanding questions

                  and is not an ideal situation.

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD as follows:

               Dear Mr Anderson

               HILLSBOROUGH COMPLAINT - LES JONES

               I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 23 October 1989 in
               respect of a complaint against police made by the above-named.

              On behalf of Mr Dear, who will act as Investigating Officer, I
              formally accept responsibility for the investigation into this
              matter.

              I have noted the Police Complaints Authority interest in the
              complaint.

 Home Office,

 f.a.o:- The Right Honourable Douglas Hurd                                 M.P.                              June 1989.


 Dear Home Secretary,


                                          re: Hillsborough Disaster


 I am     the    father      of     the    late    Sarah          and Victoria Hicks who unfortunately
t-’^re among the 95 people so tragically killed at Hillsborough.


You     will    require          little    reminder          of    the     increasingly acrimonious rounds
of    accusation        and       counter     accusation             that    abounded          in    the   media       until
you had the good sense to issue your instruction to the police and request
a general cessation.
Despite        acute    provocation          and       at    times        great    personal         anquish,      my    wife
and     I have     resisted         numerous        opportunities             to    fuel    that      deplorable         and
unseemly        state       of    affairs,     preferring             to    assist       the    Taylor       Inquiry      in
its difficult task - including being prepared to await the outcome before
making detailed comment to the media.


I write        to you       today    to request your                comment and          intervention following
  ;e statement,         widely reported                in the media,              by South Yorkshire’s Deputy
Chief     Constable         Peter     Hayes       to    the        effect    that     "no      further     action        was
required”        in     connection           with           the     actions        and     behaviour         of        Chief
Superintendant David Duckenfield.
I was under           the impression          that Lord Justice Taylor on the one hand and
the internal Police Investigation by the West Midlands force on the other,
would    draw    conclusions          when    and       only when           they had concluded their work
and     had    time    to    deliberate.           Despite          the    careful       wording,      the     issue      of
this statement by the Deputy Chief Constable pre-empts these findings!


Words fail me when I try to convey to you the hurt and totally unneccessary
anguish       this untimely statement has given my wife,                                  myself and presumably
the   other     families.          Apart    from       the        crass    nature    of     this action,          I find
the need to issue such a statement at this time beyond contempt.                                                           6
                                                                                                 DOCUMENT NQ,         5


                                                              2



     One can only conclude that this is yet a further attempt by South Yorkshire
     Police     to    divert        public    opinion       away    from    their       appalling     performance
     both on the fatal da y and subsequent to it.


    Apart      from    obvious       offence    to    the    bereaved,      how      are    the public      to view
    this premature ''absolution" by the Deputy Chief Constable!
    That a senior police officer - who by his own admission deliberately chose
     to deceive his superiors (and others!) should not be disciplined is totally
    incredible.
    Even if one believes Chief Superintendant Duckenfield's reasons for lying
    to the general public at the time,                      (and I am bound to say that I personally
         }not!)_ there could have been no credible reason to have misled the Deputy
    Chief Constable.


    Is    it   purely        coincidence       that    this       provided      an     excuse   for    the    Chief
    Constables silence during the lead-in /initial week of the Taylor Inquiry,
    when the fans were able to give their views?
    I trust      that       under    the     circumstances         you   will   understand my         fears of    a
    "whitewash"        at the least and at the worst a deliberate                             attempt to "close
    ranks” and distort the course of justice.


    I regret that Mr.Hayes's insensitive and untimely public                                  action has further
    reduced my opinion of the South Yorkshire senior police.
    It leaves me no alternative but to formally complain directly to yourself,
     .id to ask you as the vanguard of a Government claiming to be ‘’committed
    to    law and      order"       to make     an    unequivocal        statement         of your   opinion    and
    intended actions in the wake of this regrettable development.


    I will await your urgent response during the course of today or tomorrow,
    but    would      advise    that       should    I fail       to recieve      an    appropriate      response
    I reserve         the   right     to     follow Mr.Hayes         example      and      release   this    letter
    to the media tomorrow evening.


    Yours ^ a i ^ h f u l ly.

MR TR2VC2. HICKS,

In my view the correspondence also constitutes a complaint

consider exercising supervision of the conduct of the
investigation under Section 87(l)(b) of the Act. Assistant Chief
Constable K B P Cooper of Northamptonshire Police has teen
appointed to investigate the complaint, subject of course to your
agreement should you decide to supervise the investigation.

    I refer to today's telephone conversation regarding the Hillsbrough enquiry. As discussed
    I require Assistant Chief Constable Cooper, as the current Investigating Officer, to
    serve Regulation 7 notices on the officers named by Mr Hicks in his statement of
    August 1989. It is important that the notices are served without delay.

    I confirm that Mr Cooper is only required to serve the notices and the enquiry will then
    be dealt with by another force. As soon as the situation regarding the appointment of
    the new Investigating Officer is resolved, I will inform both yourself and Mr Cooper in
    order that arrangements can be made for the transfer of documents etc.

    Again thank you for your assistance in this matter.

West Midlands Police St
West Midlands




Dear Mr Dear


I do hope you don't mind my writing to you but I feel by being able to
do this will help me a great deal.     You see like many, many other
people, our family is seriously affected by events at Hillsborough on the
15 April where our son, John, was killed.     Luckily, my husband has been
able to continue with his work but I am finding that it is not possible
for me to live life as I knew it before.    Before the tragedy, I felt
life was pretty good.   I was employed as a school-teacher and was able
to drive and generally had a pleasant and positive attitude to life.
But most of all my husband and I were proud to be John's parents as he
was a good-looking young man who was very healthy with a wonderful
personality and who was doing well at school and taking three 'A' levels
- Maths, Politics and Economics.     We were looking forward to seeing him
attending Liverpool University this Autumn.    He had chosen Liverpool out
of the four acceptances he had

                                     - 2 -




received.    On the morning of the beutiful April day, life was so full of
promise.




I know the FA made a number of mistakes viz; holding the match at
Hillsborough instead of Manchester and allocating less tickets to
Liverpool fans.


But it was a real blunder for the police to insist on accommodating the
Liverpool fans at the Leppings Lane end and then not exercising strict
control at the main entrance.   Only ticket-holders should have been
allowed through those gates and only a manageable number at a given time
with proper queues at the turnstiles.    I feel the police gave the fans
far too much freedom to exert pressure which led to an uncontrollable
situation.   They allowed anyone, fans with or without tickets, to get far
too close to the scene of action and it seemed inevitable that certain
individuals would take advantage of such a position.
                                                              DOCUMENT No.




                                     - 3 -




The situation should never have been allowed to develop to such an extent
that fans could actually gain access by climbing walls into the ground.
It was a grave error to open the large concertina Gate C to eject one fan
who had invaded the ground.    It would have been sensible to have kept
him inside and put him out later when the crowds had dispersed.


But of course the crucial mistake was the request and then the order to
open Gate C again and leave it open for anyone to walk in so close to
kick-off.


In my opinion, there was only one sensible decision to be made at
that time and that was to have the game delayed and use the turnstiles
only for entry.   That way people would move in at a much slower pace and
the crowd would be less dense.   That way they would be able to see for
themselves where to go.   It was the sheer volume of people coming in
through Gate C and then down the tunnel that caused the disaster.     It is
no wonder that on-one had admitted to doing this as it was indeed an
extremely foolish procedure.


I, myself, would certainly not have liked to have been faced with a
request from a senior officer to open the exit
                                                            DOCUMENT No.




                                    - 4 -




gates to allow anyone in as that to me sounds a very unusual request
indeed and is undoubtedly a recipe for disaster.   If I had been faced
with such a request, I would have felt that I had no alternative to
having the game post-poned or even abandoned as that to me would seem the
only right decision to make.   The other decision was entirely wrong as
beyond that gate on the outside there was the space of the whole world
but within the stadium there was a limited space only and it was indeed a
very dangerous thing to exceed that capacity at any time.


I feel generally that the police in this country are doing a fine job on
all Saturdays throughout the football season as their job is indeed a
difficult one.   I also feel that the police operation adopted on the 15th
April was a well-thought out plan that had worked at Hillsborough
previously as John had attended the same match last year.   But it did
appear quite obviously from 2.30 pm that there were difficulties in the
Leppings Lane area and it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain
control.   I think the situation then should have been assessed and some
positive action should
                                                              DOCUMENT No.




have been taken at that time.   Strict control was definitely needed at
the turnstiles from 2.30.


I cannot criticize the police for not having officers directing the fans
to various pens.   I feel many fans choose the standing area because they
feel less restricted there in some ways.   They are not tied to one
particular spot as with seating; in other words, they have free choice to
go to any pen where they see room and if need be can move from one pen to
another by means of the gates at the top of the pens.   I suppose this is
what usually happened.   I don't think the fans would actually want the
police to tell them where to go under normal circumstances.    But what
happened on the 15th April 1989 was a different set of circumstances
altogether.   People, who were legitimate ticket-holders were not coming
in as usual through the turnstiles and finding their positions in the
pens.   It appeared suddenly that anybody and everybody had been allowed
in, indiscriminately, without warning, in such large numbers to create
overcrowding on a very large scale.


It was noted by the police at 2.40 pm that there was room on the
                                                             DOCUMENT No. 1 2



                                   - 6 -




terraces for another 3,000 fans only and at that time it appeared that a
very similar number were waiting to come in, outside the turnstile area.
However, within minutes, the 3,000 outside turned into about 5,000.     This
was clearly seen so it was extremely foolish to think that 5,000 could
fit into a place for 3,000 and throw the gates open.   It couldn't be done
and it shouldn't have been done.


It was wrong to allow ticketless fans in and it was posing a security
risk, too, as a large mob like that could have missiles or the like.     In
any case, no-one is allowed into any other place of entertainment without
producing a ticket first and that is the purpose of the turnstiles.     No
steward was told of the police decision to open the gates as I'm sure any
steward would have objected because surely it was against Club Rules.


I will now give you the information relating to our son, John.


John left home on the 15th April 1989 just in time to catch the Deeside
Liverpool Supporters' coach from outside the Victoria Hotel at Holywell,
Clwyd.


He travelled to the match with a ticket and consumed no alcohol on that
day.




                                                                               19

'ihe coach arrived at SheffieJd at approximately 2 pm and John and a
number of other young supporters made their way to the ground.


I was told that the organisation this year was totally different to that
of last year when there were a number of control points to check for
tickets before the fans arrived at the main gate and turnstiles.     In fact
on a number of occasions in the past, ticketless fans were taken to a
specified area where they listened to the match on a transistor radio and
so did not pose a problem.


This year there appeared to be no plan whatsoever operating at the
Leppings Lane end and widespread chaos developed when the road was
closed, following Mr Marshall's request, at 2.30.   It was a very foolish
move as fans were then able to spread out in all directions and checks on
them became impossible.   Fans with tickets were being pestered all the
time by fans without tickets asking if they had any spare tickets.     It
appeared that the police didn't understand what 'spares' meant!


By the time John and his friends managed to get through the maingate
there was utter confusion with fans
                                                               DOCUMENT No. ^ ^

 being helped over the turnstiles and walls by policemen and one
 policeman on the roof of the turnstiles.    Also, ticketless fans were
 attempting to bribe the turnstile operators and so were hindering the
 flow through the turnstiles.   Added to this was the fact that the tickets
 themselves were Incorrectly numbered or lettered.


John and his friends were being pushed and crushed at the turnstile area
at about 2.45.   As one of his friends suffers with asthma and started to
have an attack, they quickly moved out of the crush at the turnstiles and
went as far away as possible to stand outside the exit Gate C where there
were not too many people at the time.   They went there because they felt
safer and at that point they weren't even bothered about seeing the
beginning of the match.   They were concerned only with their own safety.


To their amazement, Gate C suddenly opened to eject a fan and police
officers there at the time mistakenly thought that the gate had been
opened in response to Mr Marshall’s request and so they told John and his
friends along with other fans, totalling about




                                                                              21
                                                                   DOCUMENT No. 1 2



                                       - 9 -




 200 t.o go in.   John and his friends looked back and saw the gate closing
 behind them and felt safe so they went to the lavatories and then quickly
 made their way down the tunnel and took up their positions in Pen 3.


 No sooner had John and his friends got into their places in Pen 3, then
 thousands of people came following down the tunnel after Gate C was opened
 again and left open.


 We know nothing more about John and are still trying to find the
 following information and should be grateful if you could help with this
matter.



 1)    What time John was found dead or injured?


2)    Who found him?


3)    Was he taken to hospital?


4)     Did he receive any medical attention at any time?


5)     Did anyone try to help him inany way?


It may help you to     know that Johnwas   wearing a red and white scarf.


The facts clearly indicate complete wrecklessness on the part of those
put in responsible positions on that day.      Power can indeed be a very
dangerous tool if put in the hands of




                                                                              22
                                                                Q O G U M m t m   12




 i^responsible individuals!    John should never have died at 18 - this was
 completely and easily avoidable!    We can all recover from mistakes made
 connected with the Economy; we cannot recover from the mistakes made by
 imcoinpetent people who were in a position of responsibility on the 15th
April 1989-     The price all the bereaved families have had to face is a
colossal one.    This is something that no-one can put right but we do hope
that at least justice is done!


If only Police Constable Buxton's request to have the kick-off post-posed
had not been rejected by Mr Duckenfield, I am sure there would not have
been that terrible tragedy.     Instead, Mr Marshall, in more authority,
requested that the exit gates should be opened to get rid of the crowd
surging around him.    That was not just a serious mistake, but a fatal one
where John was concerned!     I'm sure he would not expect that gate where
he was standing to suddenly open and allow him in - in to his death!       It
was utterly wreckless!


Mr Jack Stone, a gate-man at Gate A pleaded with the police not




                                                                                  23
                                                                 DOCUMENT No.   12




 to open the exit gates as it was against Club Rules and said, "all hell
will break loose if you open them," and it surely did!   He refused to
open his gate and stood firmly by it but was eventually compelled by the
police to do so.   I know he was just a gate-man but he knew his job - he
knew that exit gates were not to be opened until after the match; he knew
what the right decision was - if only the power would have been in his
hands instead of Mr Marshall’s and Mr Duckenfield's.   He obviously cared
for the fans and knew the dangers.   It was such a short time after he
pleaded with the police not to open the exit gates, that people died
inside the stadium and that wonderful and intelligent son of ours was
changed from a healthy, happy and lively person into a dead body labelled
No 68.   Although John was carrying a provisional driving licence, I went
through the trauma of not knowing the truth until about 4.30 am on Sunday
16th April when I tried to identify him.   He was beyond recognition and I
refused to believe it was him until his clothing was produced.    I would
like a copy
                                                                  DOCUMENT N o.   12

 of f.h( photograph that was available for identification purposes, if it
 is possible for me to try to comprehend how the most handsome young man
 in the world in my eyes could have been turned into something to
 grotesque!



 I ve been a Church-goer all my life but I have been unable to attend
Church since this tragedy because I just cannot forgive those policemen.
I feel that the police felt contempt for the Liverpool fans; I feel
contempt now for the South Yorkshire Police, especially as Mr DuckenfieJd
even lied about the fans and said that they had forced Gate C open.     This
is completely unforgivable!   I just hope that a verdict of unlawful
killing is pronounced as that would be the only thing that would make me
feel better as John was the most wonderful person I have ever known in my
life and the loss of his life is indescribable!


I m sure neither Mr Marshall nor Mr Duckenfield deliberately caused
John's death, but by their irresponsible actions they certainly caused
it.   It was clear to John and his friends that it was absolute
pandemonium at the turnstiles with fans constantly being




                                                                               25

 nllowMi to get over the wall and this is why John and his friends moved
 away to relative safety as they thought but instead were actually invited
 into that cage by the police; then John was allowed to be crushed by a
 terrific force with no police officer in the ground doing a thing about
 it.




Nothing can bring John back but I do wish that I could do something to
help to prevent further disasters.



First and foremost I would like to see all-seater stadiums.   I feel when
fans pay £6.00 to be spectators they should be entitled to both comfort
and safety.   They should be treated with the same respect as anyone else
who pays to be entertained.   They should be ushered safely to their
places and high safety standards should be maintained at all times.


They should be allowed refreshments including alcohol, as this is
available at most other places
                                                               DOCUMENT Not    12


                                      -   14 -




 of entertainment.     Fans should be treated as innocent and decent human
 beings and only if they misbehave should they have their photographs
 taken and be thrown out.


 I am totally against the ID card scheme and do wish that the Bill could
 be stopped.   I know I would certainly not wish to attend a place of
entertainment if I had to produce a photo and details of myself first -
I believe the fact     that I had paid for admission should surely be
sufficient.    These   young people are already finding it difficult to
manage to pay the £6.00, especially if they are still at school.        Why
should further expense be imposed upon them to cater for the hooligans
once again?



I would like to see all perimeter fences removed.


I would like to see newspapers and magazines sold at the ground    and maybe
even tapes.



I do, however, feel that ticketless fans should never, never be admitted
but most of all that exit gates remain closed until the end of the match.




                                                                               27

I think it would be a good idea to have Rottweillers standing by the
police to deal with any pitch invasions, maybe even teargas or the like.
Photographs should be taken of any offenders and they should not be
allowed to attend further matches.


I am enclosing a few photocopies to illustrate the kind of son we have
lost and why our lives have been totally ruined as a result of such poor
management.     Perhaps it would have been better to have had fewer
policemen but better trained for such an arduous task.     'Quality rather

    On Saturday, 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, a
    disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

   Leslie Jones of!_____________________________ ^Liverpool, the father of one of the
   deceased, Richard Jones, has made the following allegations relating to your duties
   at the ground on 15 April 1989;

    (a)        You failed to acquaint yourself with the planning and problems related to
               the control of the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest Semi Final on Saturday,
               15 April 1989.

   (b!         You failed to monitor the crowd numbers packing into Pens 3 and 4.

   [cl        You failed to act when it became obvious that Pens 3 and k were over full
              when you had an excellent viewpoint from the Police Box above the pens.

              You failed to make provision for fans coming through gate 'C' after you
              had given the order for the gate to be opened.

   (e)        You failed to act when it was obvious that people were in distress.

  (f)        You attempted to mislead the Assistant Chief Constable at the ground and
             others, namely, representatives of the Club, the F.A., and the fans
             themselves regarding the origin of the order for gate 'C' to be opened.
             That is by inferring supporters had forced open the gate when you had, in
             fact, given the order to open the gate.

    NATURE OF                 C O M P L A IN T



                   On Saturday 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Football ground, Sheffield, a
                   disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

                   has made previous allegations in relation to your duties at the ground.
                  He has now made the following further allegation;
                  That he, Mr Hicks, with regard to his previous complaint against you
                  of making a false statement, in that you were deceitful and intentionally
                  misled senior police officers and the public, (SEE REGULATION 7 NOTICE
                  OF 3 AUGUST 1989 SERVED BY MR COOPER ACC NORTHAMPTONSHIRE) now further
                  alleges that he questions whether Mr Walter Jackson A.C.C. was unaware
                  of the real circumstances relating to the opening of the gate. Mr
                  Hicks can see no reason why you would not have told Mr Jackson the
                  truth and therefore considers there may have been collusion between
                  yourself and Mr Jackson concerning this point.

Many thanks for your letter of       17 July 1990 which concerns the routeing
of your report to the DPP.

I quite understand that there are exceptional circumstances which surround
your investigation and that the bulk of the material which accompanies
your report isconsiderable.   It is also relevant     that the  matter was
referred to the   DPP by Peter Wright in the first instance, and the need
for expediency should require no argument.

Of course, I am directly concerned only with the matters which involve
officers of and below the rank of Chief Superintendent, so I cannot speak
for my Police Authority which is concerned with officers of ACPO rank.

I have no objection to your submitting       your   report   to   the   DPP     through
the PCA without sending a copy to me.

I understand that in due course I shall receive a statement from the
PCA in respect of your conduct of the investigation and that I shall
receive all the    reports and supporting evidence in good time for me to
consider any disciplinary aspects of the case.

 Following our telephone conversation of recent date I write to you with a
 proposition in connection with the routeing of the papers arising from the
 crime investigation into the Hillsborough disaster.

 You will know that my investigation into the criminal and disciplinary aspects
 is being supervised by the Police Complaints Authority. At the end of my
 investigation, which is not far off, the PCA must make a statement that it is
 satisfied with the conduct of the investigation.That statement will be sent
  o you, the complainants and to the officers whose conduct has been called into
 question. The only exception to that will be the PCA statement in respect of
 your Assistant Chief Constable Mr Walter JACKSON. In his case the PCA
 statement will go to your Police Authority.

In strict accord with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the way for
this to be achieved is for me to submit my original report to the PCA, and at
the same time send a copy to you (or your Police Authority). Once the PCA is
satisfied with my investigation it sends the forementioned statement to that
errect, to you (or to your Police Authority).

You (or your Police Authority) are then required first to consider matters
related to any criminal offences revealed in the report and refer them to the
Director of Public Prosecutions. Thereafter you are required to submit a
report to the PCA setting out your opinions as to the merits of the complaints
against police officers; any disciplinary charges preferred or proposed; the
merits or otherwise of convening a disciplinary tribunal; and any reasons for
not preferring disciplinary charges.

My proposition is that for various reasons; including the referral of the
matter by Peter Wright to the DPP in the first place; the complex circumstances
of the investigation; the bulk of the documentary and other evidence; and the


                                                      Continued...




                                                                                   42
                                                               DOCUMENT NO.      24

need for expediency; you allow me to deal direct with the DPP in so far as the
crime aspects are concerned. Of course, you will receive the PCA statement at
the appropriate time and you will receive all of the evidence and reports in
time for your consideration of the disciplinary aspects with the PCA. The
matters relating to your Assistant Chief Constable would not be affected.

I hope that this letter is comprehensible and that you will agree to my
proposal, in which case a short letter of reply would be appreciated.

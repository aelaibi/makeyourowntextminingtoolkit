            group       of    Liverpool                supporters             in a          small          function       room       inside             the

            ground,          they       were       having          a    buffet             and    a    few    drinks.           We    were          invited

            to    join       the    crowd          which          we    did       and       spent          about    forty       minutes             playing

            pool    and       having          a    couple          of       drinks.

            The    other          supporters             that          we    met       at    this          ground       offered       us       a    lift       on

            their       coach       to       go    to    Hillsborough,                       The       coach       was    parked          on       the    road

            about       a mile          from       the       ground          and       from       there       we    walked       to       the       ground.

            I saw       quite       a       lot    of    supporters                   drinking             from    cans    and       in    pu b s ,

S.o, 6-     We    arrived          at       the    turnstiles                at       about       2.40       pm    (1440)       at    the          entrance

 ^   ( I—   of    Lepjiings         Lane          there       were          hoards          of    people,          there       were       no       orderly

            qye'ues      whatsoever.                    There          were       a    few       police       officers          outside             the

            entranee          and       a    couple          on    horseback,                but       they       appeared       to       be       caught       up

            in    the    crowd          as    much       as       everyone             else       and       therefore          were       unable          to

            effectively             police             the    situation.                    Due       to    the    amount       of    people             trying

            to    get    to       the       turnstiles             I found             it    extremely             difficult          to       gain       any

            ground.           I became                 separated             from                      but    I always          had       sight          of    him,

            I was       able       to       get    through             the    turnstiles,                   before       him    and       then          waited

            on    the    other          side       for       him       to    go       through.

            I think          we    got       into       the       ground          at       about       ten    to    three       (1430)             or    there

            abouts.           We    walked             straight             towards          the       tunnel       entrance          to       the       ground,

             I knew          that       there          were       other       entrances                to    the    terraces          as       I have

            visited          this       ground          on    numerous                occasions             but    because       I always                like       ti

            stand       behind          the       goal       I headed             for       the       tunnel       area    as    the       two          pens    at

            the    end       of    the       tunnel          are       the    most          central          ones,

            untoward          about          the       day    at       all.           At    the       end    of    the    tunnel,          we       turned

            towards          our    left          to    take       up       our       viewing          position          in w h i c h      I believe

             for               but    I c o u l d n ’t    find       hi m,      I eventually            left    the       ground       of      my

             own    accord       at    about     four       thirty         4.30     pm    (1630),        via    the       Leppings          Lane

             end.I       feel    that       after     the      disaster         had      been    realised           the    police

             seemed       more       concerned        with      keeping          the     two    factions        of    fans       away       from

             each    other       than    they were             with    helping        the i n j u r e d        fans,        t h e r e w a s no

             1 did       not    like     the    way      the    press        behaved          during     the    disaster          and

             afterwards          I feel        their      attitude           was    very       callous.         I also          feel     that

             the    Liverpool          supporters           were      given        the    wrong        end    for    the    amount          of

             followers          they     have.        There         should      have      been       better     announcements                  over

             the    FA    system       about     what       was      happening           at    the     ground       and    therefore

             the    forest       supporters           would         have     been      aware     of     the    situation          and       would

             have    responded           to    these      announcements.

             I also       believe        that    the      consequences              would       n ot    have    been       so    great         had

             the    cutting          gear     been    available            at   the      ground.

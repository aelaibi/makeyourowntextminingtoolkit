                 On Saturday 15th April         1989 (150489)          I travelled to the Serni-Final

         Sheffield at about        10.10 am   (1010)



         We asked directions to the ground from the Police,             neither of us had

         been before.      Qm the way we found a pub full of Liverpool           fans I think

         it was The..       pub.    We tried to get tickets but did not get them ^

         mere    but iMter walked towards the grou/ft and bought £6 Leppings Lane

         end terrace we paid £23 each for ther              I can only describe the man

         who sold me the tickets as about              y r s , 5*7 - /S58, stocky bui Id,

         local accent.      After getting the tickets we a/ain went back to

         The Fox p u b .   11 was now about 12.30 (1230)/to 1 pm (1300).            We stayed

         for about an h o u r , and left about 2 pm (1/00) and walked to the ground.



         On reaching the turnstiles thj^ crowd seemed normal for a Semi-Final

         game.    It was about 2.30 p m / (1430) and the Police were asking for
5.0.6.
         tickets and it seemed rea/onably controlled.             We did not have any
u-<~.
         trouble getting in or V ^ a c h i ng the turnstiles,       the only problem was I

         had just bought a flag on a stick and a policeman would not let me in

         with it.    He took my name and address and let ms take the flag in but

         not the stick.



         We went in through the turnstiles givinfg up my ticket and down the

         tunnel to the terrace.        At this stag£ the tunnel' was       reasonable,      there

         was no crush.      It was about 2.35 j/m (1435) a im       on going through the

         tunnel we went to the right hancr pen behiya the goal.              At this point

         we could move around and pick your v^ew/ng place in c o m f o r t . / W e took
                                                                    P eJU 3
         up a position about halfway down the terrace to the right/ff the goal

         against a barrier



         There was the normal        crowd surging and swaying but at about ten to

         three   (1450)it started to get A / e r y     crowded.   The crush got worse and I
remember the teams getting announced and p e o p l e            jumping about.   After

this it got really tight and I was pushed to my left and went down

onto the ground.        I was lying on t h ^ t e r r a c e with my legs against the

steps and my body against a b ar rie r.             I could feel a pain in my left

knee but could not move.



     this point I had lost sight of                  and did not know where he was



As      lay on the ground people were falling all over mg and I was

trying to get up,      but I could not because of                   ies on top of me,

I do not know who but someone           pull^fd me up and             my way towards

the rear tunnel, on the way I c.    across        He said ^W\ts get out
                        Ajl       ^ ^ 5 7 S*T>VNJ|>
of here and we made our wav t< the tunnel.  The game hayS been stopped

and I could see people c 1 imos/ng over the perimeter f               ce onto the

p it c h .   O fT        W 5



We forced our way bac k/ u p the tunne 1 into the area at the rear of the

stand.       We stoodYthe/e for a while to get our breath back and then 1

saw peopl e be i ng V a r i e d   by m e .   These people appeared to be injured

but did not realise that they could be dead as I did not realise the

extent of the trouble.            I could not describe any of the people carried

past me.

Once    I had recovered and I heard a / a n n o y announcement to keep our

ticket stub I do not know whei               .s w a s .   We both Left the ground and

out into Leppings Lane still           irV/shock but we walked to the railway

station.       By listening to comments by p e o p i e A eaving the ground I

realised then that people had died.               Be f o r A we had left the ground

area I saw about six bodies lying dfeversra up,               I then realised that it

was serious tr ou ble .        I saw a man carrying the body of a young boy out

         of the tunnel,    the boy was blue in the face,   he was about   10 to 14

         years.    The man carrying him had a skin head hair cut about 26 to 30

         years,    he had black moustache,   I do not remember anything else about

         him.



         Ule got the first available train home and arrived in Black pool at

         about 8 pm (2000).

        SATURDAY 15th APRIL 1989


ROBERT BURNS   POLICE SERGEANT 1757
WOMBWELL SUB DIVISION, PENISTONE SECTION.


I commenced duty at Wombwell Police Station at 9am on Saturday
15th April 1989* Paraded Serial 15 officers, 8 male and 2 female
Constables.

On completion travelled to Hillsborough, Sheffield, by personnel
Transit van.

Full Hatch Order parade and briefing at 9«5Oam in the North Stand
conducted by Chief Superintendent DUCKINFIELD. On conclusion,
packed meal supplied and taken.        ^

Further detailed briefing of my Serial (15) and Serial 1*t Sergeant
13^1 CRAWFORD and B1 officers, by Inspector WHITE, in situ of our
areas of respective responsibilities. This briefing was conducted
on the terraced area of the West Stand with both Serials. My Serial
responsible for Liverpool supporters entering through turnstiles
number 9 to 16 inside the ground from Leppings Lane. Searching
regards prohibited weapons and items, alcohol, banners or missiles.
After match commenced, public order on the terraces, ^ocation being
in the tunnel of the North Pen and cantilever terraces between the
North Pen and North Stand. Emergency evacuation procedure explained
and officer from my Serial PC 853 BURKE deputed to the internal gate
between the North and Middle pens, on the terraces. This internal
gate was definately open, not locked by padlock at this time.

At 11am my serial commenced their detail at Leppings Lane turnstiles,
the Match Order stating turnstiles numbered 1 to 16 between Gate A and B«
I questioned this with INSPECTOR WHITE at this location and was told
the Order was wrong, my responsibility was for turnstiles 9 to 16.
Turnstiles 1 to 8 were cordoned off by a movable crowd control barrier.
This being placed between turnstiles 8 and 9« Officers from another
serial did take up position at turnstiles 1 to 8 . for supporters to
the North Stand. Having 8 male officers, one was allocated to each
turnstile more or less working as a pair for searching purposes. This
enabled me to hold the two female officers in reserve with instructions
to search any females. At some early stage I was aware of at least
two ground stewards on duty at the onaxskis moveable crowd barrier between
turnstiles 8 and 9 . ^wo other ground stewards were on the inside of
GATE B, being their responsibility for opening for access in and out
of Police Officers. These gates have plastic viewing inserts at head
height.

Ticket allocation was as follows
Brown Tickets - North Stand - Entry by turnstiles 1 to 8 .
Red tickets   - West Stand seating - Entry by turnstiles 9 to 16
Purple tickets - Standing terraces under West Stand and open cantilever
terrace between the West Stand and North Stand (area shown NW on plan.)
Entry to ground via turnstiles A to G.

Shortly after 11 am and my officers were briefed, with Inspector WHITE,
we had a general patrol of my area of responsibility, ie the North Pen
                                                                 Cont.

ie the North Pen / leading into terrace area (N on plan), cantilever
standing terrace (NW on plan) and visited ground staff at the snack
bar situated at this corner at the rear of the ^est Stand. I spoke
with these males, three, regarding their security. They were advised
to close the metal serving hatch at the first signs of any trouble
and request my attention. The Snack bar was open to customers at this
time. All turnstiles under my supervision were open and manned by
operators at about 11.30am.

From about 12 noon whilst on duty inside the ground at the turnstiles
at Leppings Lane, small groups of Liverpool supporters were entering
the ground. Jovial, friendly, male, female and children, all were
searched with no problems, between then and a gradual build up to
2 .30pm. Items of property ie large flags and pen knifes were consfiscated
labelled and handed into the property store. The amount of supporters
during these times was very light and unusual for a large Cup Match.
Man# groups of youths were seen to be standing outside on Leppings
Lane. Although stated these supporters were friendly, many were
complaining about not having the other end of the ground where they
could have received more ticket allocation being a larger club than
Nottingham Forest,with a larger support and following. This was their
main grievence other than being forced to being searched three times
over.

At about 2.30pm large numbers of Liverpool fans arrived outside on
Leppings Lane turnstiles, I presumed arrivals under Police escort
from the special train. The atmosphere of friendly fans began to change,
they were noisy and boisterous, shouting and pushing to get through
the turnstiles. Turnstile operators were complaining, some fans were
getting in by climbing over the turnstile. Many were identified and
being unable to produce a ticket or stub had to be manhandled and
forcibly ejected outside through the bottom gate. ( Marked C on plan.)
No ejections were made through Gate B. This is a usual practice at
Matches, as fans waiting to enter through turnstiles A to G, form up
outside Gate B.

At about 2.^5pm the situation inside and outside got worse. As their
numbers increased the situation became electric. Crushing was occuring
outside. Numerous fans, male and female with children, young and elderly
were complaining about being crushed outside. Many were in a distressed
state, sweating, breathless and pale in colour. Some rubbing their chests.
There were too manj to deal with individuals. Many pleading to help
the people outside.

During this time which I can only describe many of these young male
fans by their actions as animals. Fans outside were shouting for
assistance, banging on the metal Gate B they were being crushed.
Fans were being crushed inside the actual turnstiles. Incidents
were happening all the time. The panic similar to mass hysteria made
searching impossible and I instructed my Serial to act only on Public
Order. Numbers started to climb outside walling onto the roof of the
turnstile building at the same time as others cleared the turnstiles
were running towards the ground entrances, pushing others aside to
gain better haste. Many were actually jumping over the turnstiles
and fleeing towards the ground. Turnstile Operators were shouting
and complaining many were getting through with no tickets by climbing
over the turnstiles.

The majority of these late arrivals were obviously under the influenze
of alcohol, the air at this location thick with the smell of alcohol.
The breeze from outside where the crushing was taking place, carried
a sickly smell of stale alcohol into the ground. There was far too many
to be able to take action against. This was becoming a volitile situation.
Large numbers had climbed onto the perimeter walling, onto the lower
roof of the turnstiles and were jumping off from a height of about
some 8 to 9 feet, into the ground. Many fans xkxkx inside the ground
were handing their full tickets up to those on the roof and due to their
numbers we were unable to prevent this. Complaints and requests for
help outside from those entering the turnstiles were becoming numerous.

At this stage, being unable to communicate with Match Control by
Personnel Radio due to volume of air traffic, static and noise caused
by fans, I had to shout to Inspector BENNETT, who had arrived at my
location, regards the situation of people outside being allegedly
crushed,KH±Kzste asking him for assistance from Control ..^Due to the
volume of air traffic/ static and volume of noise in the area, it was
apparent the Inspector was unable to make contact. I was requesting
the opening of the outer Gate B, be opened temporarily to relieve
crushing pressure. Inspector BENNETT climbed onto the roof of the
turnstiles and walling to view the situation outside the ground.
I could see through the turnstiles and over the heads of fans, outside
the ground onto Leppings Lane. There was a mass of supporters waiting
to get inside the ground. It was obvious to me that the closer to
kick off time became, this volume of supporters were not going to get
inside the ground by then, a disaster would occur outside the turnstiles.

The situation by this time was chaotic, outside and inside the ground.
Supporters fighting to get through turnstiles, others coming over the
walling onto the roof, in droves. Whilst dealing with an incident of
fans crushing to get through a turnstile, part of the metal rain
guttering above me collapsed and struck me accross the shoulders.

During these incidents which were out of control, even to 100 Police
officers, PC RICH on my Serial, brought to my attention, one of these
fans that had jumped from the roof was an off duty Liverpool Police
officer. He had been shown a plastic type Warrant Card, believed
           or similar name. I believed he was referring to a male I
had just seen jump down from the roof with others. Aged about middle
thirties, deep tan complexion, dressed in red pullover and wearing
a red and yellow Liverpool flat cap.PC RICH informed me that the one I
described was a friend of the alleged officer he had spoken to. This
officer stating he had no ticket. These two with others had ran off
in the direction of the North Pen area. Whilst engaged, I challenged
a middle aged male inside the ground I had seen handing a ticket to
a young boy aged about     years on the roof of the turnstiles. Stated
to be his son and they had got separated outside. The same person
was seen on two other occassions of the same actions but disappeared
before I could get to him.

Due to the situation not alleviating ie crushing, pushing and complaints,
at the turnstiles. SaotKxaf She operators refusing admission with brown
and purple tickets, causing complete blockage, these holders could not
get back outside whilst stuck in the narrow entrances. It was obvious
to me the Operators were also reaching breaking point with the volume
of supporters and their actions. I was aware of the presence of other
officers from another Serial who had been outside, inside the ground
with myself. One unidentified female officer stated they had come inside
as they were , .       , ,,
             being crushed by the pressure outside.         Cont

To alleviate this situation, I instructed the Operators by shouting
to be heard, to let these supporters through as quickly as possible
with whatever colour of ticket they had in their possession and we
would transfer them whilst inside, the ground. This seemed to increase
the flow, those with brown tickets were transferred through by myself
assisted by two Ground Stewards, by opening the crash barrier between
turnstiles 8 and 9. There was numerous of these fans mainly mannerly
middle aged male and female, who thanked us for assistance. Many
in a distressed condition still complaining of crushing outside.
Red ticket holders were pointed in the direction of the steps leading
up to the West Stand upper seating area. There were ground stewards
on duty checking these tickets. Purple ticket holders were directed
towards the North Pen tunnel and cantilever standing area NW. During
this time fans were still pouring over the walling and running in all
directions, nothing or no one kxsxbx could have stopped them.

Whilst transferring these fans towards the North Stand, I was aware
of PC's PEARSON, BOOTH AND BURKE struggling with an adult male, who
was finally arrested and escorted towards me by the latter two officers.
He was still struggling and the barrier was opened to let them thssgk
through into the walkway towards the rear of the North Stand and
Police charge office. This male was drunk, disorderly and force being
used to restrain him.

At this time, later informed by PC BOOTH, 3p» the time of arrest,
I became aware of a larger volume of supporters rushing and pushing
in my direction, still others coming off the roof and joining them.
There appeared to be a mass of them running off towards the area
of the North Pen and sscxtxxKX cantilever area NW. In order for this
amount to gain access to the terraces via the middle tunnel, they would
have had to perform a U turn in front of me, travel through the open
large gate in the KXXX8H walling which separates the rear inside
enclosure between GATES B and C. I suddenly encountered fans in
possession of Purple tickets having entered from turnstiles 1 to 8
whilst transferring others with Brown tickets from my turnstiles
9 to 16, jostling and pushing against each other. Shortly after this
the crowd situation appeared to calm down and I was not aware the
Match had started or the actual time.
Later I learned from PC8s RICH, AITKEN and RICHARDSON, that our
GATE B, had been opened from the inside by two Police officers
at the same time PC's BOOTH and BURKE were struggling to arrest their
prisoner. The officers stated they had argued against this action.
The officers and two Gate Stewards had moved to the side of an adjacent
Porta cabin to avoid the stampeded. I had no knowledge of this Gate
having being open but would explain the mad stampede of the large
volume of fans rushing past me, towards the North end of the West Stand.
I was also informed that Gate C had also been opened prior to Gate B.
PC RICH informed me that as soon as the pressure of fans was released
                                           at GATE B, it was immediately
closed again.

Whilst filtering stragglers through the turnstiles, I received Radio
communication from Match Control ' All avilable officers to the
perimeter track.' ^ate B was opened from the inside to let numerous
officers into the ground and then closed. I immediately told all
turnstile operators to close their respective outside sliding doors,
which was complied with without question. Likewise ran round to
Operators manning turnstiles A to G, this also complied with.

As myself and my Serial officers were making our way at the rear of
the West Stand towards the South end, I suddenly was confronted by
a small number of Liverpool fans emerging from the Middle Tunnel of
the West Stand Terraces, in tears requesting help. These males
were sweating profusely, clothing stuck to their bodies and were gasping
for air. They informed me many more of them were in the terraces and
were being crushed and trampelled. These youths were sat down at the
outside of the tunneli.

I immediately ran down into the tunnel towards the rear of the terraces.
Many more youths and adult males were found to be pushing to get past
their fellow supporters, standing at the mouth of the tunnel. These
people iKzat iniiially refused my shouts to move, stating they had paid
their money, had tickets and were not moving for anyone. They were
becoming aggressive and I had to forcibly move them to allow injured
persons through.

The situation on these terraces was one of chaos. I went to the left
side of the middle barrier, where I found large numbers of sweating,
gasping males had to be pulled out of the crowd and assisted into the
tunnel to assist their breathing, The air inside the tunnel was cool.
The air at the rear of the terraces was dense and heavy, strong smell
of stale alcohol. Again having to force my way onto the terrace, I
dragged two teenaged youths under each arm from the terraces, up and
out of the tunnel into the fresh air at the rear. These youths I had
found lying down on the terraces being tramped on by others. They had
been unable to walk of their own accord due to breathing difficulties.
I ensured they would be alright by then nodding their heads, they being
unable to speak and laid them down in the recovery position.

On returning to the terraces many more were found in a collapsed
condition, some three or four yards into the terraces. Other youths
were pushing and standing on them. They would not listen to shouting
of backing off. Numbers of these youths and adults were assisted to
their feet and pushed towards the tunnel exit. This was in the area
to the right of the tunnel looking towards the playing area. Other
officers were lifting and carrying people from the front of the terraces.
I picked up another teenager off the ground who appeared unconscious,
dragged him backwards towards the tunnel. By this time some of the
supporters were actually helping their friends and Police officers
by walking with the injured and others out of the tunnel.

The youth I had dragged into the tunnel, I managed to carry with an
unknown male supporter, out into the open and laid him down beside
two other injured £BK±hs and apparent unconscious youths. I checked
this youths breathing which I found to be shallow. Laying him in the
recovery position seemed to help his breathing although his eyes were
still closed. A further youth was laid beside him by a friend and
this person asked me to help him. This youth was also laid in the
recovery position. His eyes were open and staring, obviously in a
state of shock. His friend was told to keep him quiet by talking to
him.

A young Police woman, number 33^2, suddenly told me a youth to my left
lying face down had gone blue. He was turned on his back, the officer
applied mouth to mouth resusitation whilst I applied Cardiac massage.
His colour resumed with a faint heart beat. He vomited slightly,
frothy and opened his eyes. He was in a deep state of shock, the whites
of his eyes were bloodshot and grey, staring at the ground. He was
spoken to quietly to soothe him. He closed his eyes although his breathing
became more regular. At the same time whilst knelt down with these youths,
I was talking to two others beside me. The one with the friend knelt
down beside him, declined to get up and just wanted to lie in the face
down position. He was left alone and told to get up when he felt
better.

Still kneeling over the youth the female officer and myeelf had
resusitated, in order to relax, I looked up and around me.. I can
only describe the area and situation around me as like a battlefield.
Bodies were littered everywhere, some coloured blue obviously dead.
The scene was carnage, many supporters walking about like zombies,
in shock and tears. Others trying to help their injured friends.
To my left a heavy built woman aged *+0 to 50 was kneeling down beside
an adult male, who had turned dark blue, attempting to revive him
by mouth to mouth. The woman gave up this kji hopeless task and walked
across to myself and police woman. She stated she was an nurse and
asked if the youths beside me were alright. After looking at the youths
faces stated this was a dreadful day and walked slowly away towards
other injured persons. The woman was in total shock. Obviously a Liverpool
fan, being dressed all in red clothing.

Even at this stage supporters and Police were running out of the tunnel
carrying injured and dead. I was being accidentally kicked and trampled
in the panic.

A male suddenly appeared at my side and asked if these youths beside me
were alright. He stated there were Ambulances outside the gates, get
this one to one and leave the others that are beyond help. I picked
the youth we had resusitated under the arms and two males took hold
of his legs, the Police woman at the side. As we had only travelled
about ten yards towards the open outer Gate C, the police woman shouted
he has gone blue again, Sergeant. Placed on his back, the Police woman
applied mouth to mouth and I applied Cardiac massage. He again recovered
colour and I could feel his heart beating. At this stage whilst
applying massage, I was asked by a smartly dressed male if I had any
oxygen or a stretcher. Stated he was a Doctor from Liverpool and was
informed that this was the second time the youth had arrested. He
confirmed a pulse. I believe he was xk wearing a brown suit, aged about
30 years, brown hair and sallow complexion. He appeared agitated to
be a Doctor. ( I believe this is the same person that appeared on
Television at about lunch time, the following day Sunday, stating he was
a Doctor at Liverpool University making profound statements against
Police actions.) However within seconds, I think, whilst still applying
massage, a male and female First Aid officers arrived with oxygen
mask and cylinder which was given, followed by an Ambulance trolley.
The youth was placed on the trolley, wheeled out of GAte C, turned left
and placed in the right hand side of an Ambulanee. I informed the
attendant that this youth had arrested twice.

The only identity of this youth is by description. Hale aged about
18/20 years, white spotty face, blonde/fair hair, thin build and
features. Denim jacket and trousers, dark check shirt.

Returned then to the inner area. Numerous injured persons, leg and
hip injuries were assisted to waiting Ambulances and ambulance buses,
backwards and forward.

I came across one middle aged male with silver coloured hair, stood
alone in the middle of the now partially deserted area, crying loudly.
On his behalf I accepted a plastic cup of water from a ground attendant
walking round with a tray. This was handed to the male and I walked
with him to the side and sitting him down, attempting to console him.
Being requested by female to attend distraught male friend.
At this time I was aware of being in a x x void, a feeling of time
standing still. Spectators were leaving the upper and lower parts
of the West Stand in solemn procession, directed by a cordon of
Police and Specials through the middle gate and out of Gate B, shielded
from a large number of dead outside the ground behind green sheeting.

Finally positioned in   the area behind the West Stand as my Serial
started to rejoin me.    A young family came and stood nearby me, their
young son handed a Mars bar with thanks. Groups of youths were still
leaving from the North Pen and cantilever, many in hatred towards
Police, shouting Bastards. On the other hand, numerous people, youths
and adults walked across and shook hands with words of thanks and sorry.
Heads lowered with tears in their eyes. I was still being requested
to attend youths in distraught condition, consoling them in their
anxiety. Attending to collapsed females, fainting after finding friends
and relatives.

As the rest of my Serial rejoined me at Gate B, I was confronted by a
distraught female, having walked from the direction of the North Stand,
directed to me by PC RICH, The woman explained she was searching for
her missing husband. Had been to the Casualty office and directed by
Police to return to her husbands car in case he was waiting for her,
if not to return to Casualty Room. She pointed to a male being spoken
to by PC RICH and pleaded with me to clear him off. He had been
following her for thelast half hour saying he was a reporter seeking
a story. This male walked towards me complaining. He was told to
clear off and if I saw him near the woman again, I would arrest him
personally. His presence was making the woman more distraught.
Aged about early twenties, pale complexion wearing spectacles. Stated
he was a reporter for Sheffield Star. In his hands, notepaper pad and
pen. He walked away in the opposite direction from the woman, very
downcaste.

Informed to return with Serial to the North Stand for debriefing and
stand down. Serial stood down at 6.30pm and returned to Wombwell.
This was the first time I became aware of time, after 3pm»

To finalise, having worked various Serials and different locations
over a number of years at Hillsborough. Large Cup and League matches.
I have never seen supporters including Liverpool fans, act in such
a disorderly manner and arrive late in such vast numbers. The majority
including teenagers were well behaved and orderly. It was apparent
the minority of large numbers, without tickets, were determined to
gain access into this ground by any means available and no amount of
Police Officers were going to stop them. Numerous were under the
influence of alcohol to the extent they behaved like hooligans and
were uncontrolable.

From what I witnessed inside the terraced end of the West Stand,
I can only visualise as mass hysteria. I am positive that many of
these fans were satsax not aware of being trampled, crushed or killed,
OR if aware did not care. Perhaps on reflexion they became animals,
fighting for survival in the heavy atmosphere being created by body
heat. It is worthy of note that this was the only area of the ground
where the sun was shining into.

Being on duty in the inside of Leppings Lane, seeing and hearing the
mass of the crowd outside, I agree in full with the actions taken
by SUPERINTENDENT MARSHALL. I saw the state and         pleading
of supporters entering the ground. I am certain if these gates
had not been opened, many would have died outside the turnstiles.
I myself became very apprehensive for my safety, shortly after
2.if5pm.

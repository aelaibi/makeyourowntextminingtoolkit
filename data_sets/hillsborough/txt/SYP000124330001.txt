 Q54

 IS    THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU p^EL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE MATCH WAS POORLY ORGANISED POLICEWISE AND/A LOT OF MANPOWER WAS WASTED

 COVERING SIDE ROADS INSTEAD OF THE TURNSTILBB.           ALSO THERE WAS A FILTER LAST

 YEAR TO CHECK TICKETS BUT NOT THIS YEAR.         A   WOULD QUERY THE CLAIM THAT FANS

 WENT WITHOUT TICKETS.      ALSO THE TANNOY SYSTEM COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO

 ANNOUNCE WHAT WAS GOING ON.       THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY WHAT WAS GOING ON.

^jjjHERE WAS SUCH A CRUSH OUTSIDE THAT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO OPEN THE SIDE GATE.

 PEOPLE WERE GETTING HURT OUTSIDE AS IT WAS AND THE SITUATION WAS GETTING WORSE

 I    HAD BEEN ADVISED TO GO TO THE NORTH WEST UPPER TERRACE TO THE LEFT OF WEST

 STAND FOR A GOOD VANTAGE POINT BUT AT THE GROUND I WAS TOTALLY UNABLE TO GET

 TO THIS AREA.    I C O U L D N ’T FIND IT AS THERE ARE NO SIGNS.

 AT ABOUT 2.50PM   (1450)    I NOTICED A CROWD SURGE IN THE CENTRE PEN 4,              i'HE HEADS

 OF PEOPLE WENT FORWARD BUT THE SURGE D I D N ’T GO BACK LIKE IT NORMALLY DOES,                  IT

 J^fr   WENT FORWARD,    I COULD   ONLY SEE THE HANDS OF PEOPLE AT THE FRONT ON THE

 FENCING.    AT ABOUT THAT TIME F NOTICED PEOPLE CLIMBING THE DIVIDING FENCE

 INTO PEN 5 AND 6.

 THE INJURIES   TO ANY PERSON?

 THE SLOWNESS   OF THE POLIOS TO REACT. TEN"MINUTES BEFORE              KICK OFF    IT WAS

 OBVIOUS FROM   WHERE I WAS THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG IN THE CENTRE PENS,                 I
                                                                                      PAGE    8

 COULD SEE ARMS WAVING AND COULD HEAR PEOPLE SCREAMING AMD SHOUTING FOR HELP,

 UNLIKE ANY OTHER MATCH THAT I HAVE BEEN TO.          WHEN THE FIRST PEOPLE STARTED

 GOING OVER THE FENCE AT THE FRONT, ONTO THE PITCH,          THE POLICE AND STEWARDS

 SEEMED MORE INTENT IN GETTING THEM BACK         INTO THE PEN.     I THOUGHT THAT THE IDEA

 OF THE PENS, WAS THAT WHEN THEY FILLED UP, SUPPORTERS WOULD BE DIRECTED TO

 ANOTHER ONE.     CLEARLY THIS WASN'T BEING D O N E .   ALSO AS YOU ENTER THE GROUND

 THROUGH THE TURNS I”ILLS I I LOOKS AS THOUGH 1HE ONLY WAY 10          iHE. SiANDiNG AREA IS

 THROUGH THE TUNNEL,    THERE AREN'T ANY SIGNS.       THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICE AT

 THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE TO CLOSE IT OFF AND REDIRECT THE FANS.              I NOTICED THAT

 PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING THE FENCE TO GET ONTO THE PITCH WITH VERY FEW USING THE

 GOTE.     THE GATES OPENING ONTO THE PITCH SEEM TO ME TO BEJFAR TOO SMALL TO COPE

WITH ANY SERIOUS CROWD PROBLEM.

ANOTHER THING I NOTICED WAS, WHEN THE GAME>*fiS STOPPED AND IT WAS REALISED
                                               •'x'C-'V •
THAT IT HAD GONE WRONG, ONLY TEN OR     EEN POLICE WERE ASSISTING 1HE i-ANS ■

LOTS  OF OTHER POLICE CAME ONTO^-TftE PITCH AND JUST STOOD AROUND UNTIL THE
                                   S'
FOREST FANS STARTED C H A N T I j ^ A N D SOME LIVERPOOL FANS MADE A RUSH TOWARDS THE

SPION HOP.      THEN THESEyf*GLICE AND ABOUT A HUNDRED       OTHERS WHO CAME ONTO THE

PITCH,    FORMED UP IN A LINE, TO KEEP THE FANS APAR i .         Ar TE..R T HE FANS CALMED

 DOWN,    THE POLIjGt, EXCEPT' FOR THOSE ORIGINALLY HELPING, JUST STOOJ/'AROUND IN

 d^UPS,    NOT HELPING AT A L L .   SOME I SAW WERE DRINKING TEA OR >«fOFFEE.        THEY

 JUST D I D N ’T SEEM INTERESTED.    ALTHOUGH,   AT THAT TIME THE ^ N S ,    AND AMBULANCE

 MEN,    WERE RUNNING ABOUT WITH STRETCHERS HELPING THE INJURED AND IT SHOULD HAVE-

 BEEN OBVIOUS THAT THEIR HELP WAS NEEDED.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 BETWEEN 4 . 15 (1615) AND 4.30PM     (1630)


Q18

 051

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFICER,             A STEWARD,   A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?
                                                                                       PAGE    9
                                                                                       QSL1631

 THE LOUD SPEAKER TOLD EVERY BODY TO STAY WHERE THEY WERE. THE NEXT THING THE

 PLACE WAS SLOWLY EMPTYING FROM THE BACK BECAUSE THEY HAD OPENED THE GATES IN

 THE END WE LEFT AND WENT TO A PRE-ARRANGED MEETING POINT.            |
                                                                      _______ | D I D N ’T TURN

 UP FOR AN HOUR, EVENTUALLY WE MET HIM AT THE CAR.

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 T ^   POLICE AND THE SERVICES SEEMED TOTALLY UNC0 -0R f E D         AS I SAID EARLIER.

 AFTER THE INCIDENT I WAS TRYING TO FIND               1   THE POLICEMAN    I APPROACHED

 SEEMED UNCO-OPERATl'VE? I WAS GIVEN THe""EMERGENCY NUMBER BUT THAT WAS JAMMED,

 NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS jBCflNG ON.
                                    S '*
WHEN I LEFT THE GROUND,        TH6&RE WAS NO POLICE OR STEWARD DIRECTIONS,       AND THERE

WAS A CRUSH OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET OUT IN THE AREA OF THE ENTRY TURNSTILES.

 I REMEMBER A FEELING OF REPRESSED,        FRUSTRATED ANGER,    AT TRYING TO FIND A

 FRIEND WHO MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED OR INJURED,         AND NOT HAVING ANYBODY TO

        rn    THE POLICE C O U L D N ’T OR WOULDN'T HELP AND THERE WASN'T ANYBODY ELSE TO

 ^ N    TO.

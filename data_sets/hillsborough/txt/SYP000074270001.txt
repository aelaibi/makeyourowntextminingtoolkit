            Hackenthor p e .   On Saturday 15th ApNJ.     1989 (150489),      I was on duty at

            Hackentli'rode at 8.30am     (0380) and attended at Hillsborough Football

            ground with other Police Officers that morning where we received a

            formal brief i'TKj on our duties for that day for the F .A.          cup semi

            final   between Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest FC.             Myself and

            another officer PC CHtiJDS were deputed to stood outside the players

            entrance to the rear of tftte-South stand to monitor fans,            ensuring

            Forest supporters only were on that side of the ground and to check

            the vehicles in the car park to the rear of that stand.

            As the morning drew on and the groups of supporters grew bigger the

            atmosphere appeared very good humoured and relaxed.               When the players

            coaches arrived the numbers had swelled and there were a large number

         Sergeant 266 JACQUES who was       in charge of our Serisal No. 4, and other

         officers were then informed that the situation in the crowd at the

         Leppings Ln end of the ground had worsened and that there were a

         number of serious    injuries.     I along with officers on Serial 4

         assisted in the safe flow of emergency vehicles form Penistone Rd to

         the Leppings Ln end behind the South Stand.         During this time it

         was announced that the        match was   postponed and I assisted in the flow

         of supporters and vehicles from the ground to Penistone Rd.          I took

         no further    part in this matter.

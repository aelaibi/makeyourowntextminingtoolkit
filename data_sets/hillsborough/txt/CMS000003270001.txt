    RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC        SAFETY   AND   HYGIENE     DURING       LARGE
    GATHERINGS OF PEOPLE

    I am writing to seek you help, along with that of colleagues in
    the Home Office, DoT, DOE and in house, in connection with a
    letter (copy attached) received last week.

    The Committee on Health Promotion of the FPHM pose a range of
    broad questions.     There is no intimation of what may have
    prompted the enquiry, but I foresee the possible rise of on-going
    debate and perhaps a need to agree definition (or scope) of some
    of the terms used.

    DOE have pointed out that whilst some responsibilities in the
    scenarios outlined fall to local authorities, acting on advice
    from other bodies where necessary, the two indents referring to
    public entertainments invite attention from your Department.

    I should be grateful for comments from yourself or Divisional
    colleagues, and for any specific contribution you may like to
    offer to assist me in collating a response to the Faculty.

 Dear Dr Martin

 The Faculty of Public Health Medicine is concerned about the potential for
 harm when there are large gatherings of people if proper precautions are
 not taken. We are concerned, in the first instance, to establish who is
 responsible for public safety and hygiene and for the coordination of
 emergency services in a number of settings. We are especially interested
 in:

         public transport (including the role in both safety and hygiene of
         different local and health authorities through which a train might
         pass);

         stations and termini for any form of public transport; and also

         public entertainments at fixed venues such as football stadia and
         concert halls;

         public entertainments at temporary venues (whether organised or
         informal) such as pop festivals, street carnivals, !raves!, circuses
         and gatherings of new age travellers;

         roads around either of the above where pedestrians are gathered in
         large numbers and where their movement is restricted.

 I should be most grateful for any information you can provide on these
 matters.

 Yours sincerely




John Ashton
Chair, Committee on Health Promotion

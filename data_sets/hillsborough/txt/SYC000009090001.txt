Dear Mr Lowe

H illsborough Inquest
I enclose a copy of a letter received yesterday from Mr Glover, the contents of which are
self-explanatory.

There is obviously some history behind this. I would be grateful if you could just ascertain
the up-to-date position from a police point of view and then make contact with me.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Glover

Ian T h o m as G lo ver (deceased)
Further to my letter of the 7th January 1 9 9 7 ,1 have now received the information that I
needed concerning your enquiry. I am sorry that this has taken a little more than the
fourteen days that I originally hoped.
I am happy to confirm that each of the items listed in your letter is to be sent out to you
shortly. Because we do not have facilities to copy video tapes or photographs here they
will in fact come from the police. Should you not hear from the police within 28 days
please contact me.
In each of the three categories of evidence you include the phrase “and also any other
evidence you may be able to give me”. I am sure you appreciate that the evidence relating
to the Hillsborough Inquests amounts to a huge mass of paper. If you wish to have sight of
any document that was taken in evidence at the inquests I would be very pleased to assist
but it is simply not practicable for me to give you such further assistance unless you are
able to be rather more specific.
Finally, you are quite correct in your understanding that a video record was kept of the
inquest proceedings. This was taken as a back-up of the work of the shorthand writers. It
simply consists of a wide view of the front part of the court from a fixed position. In other
words the camera is never moved.

There are a total of 186 tapes and the cost of copying them would be quite
disproportionate, particularly as they add nothing to the transcript which I assume you
have already had sight of. If there is a particular point that you would like clarifying from
the videos please let me know.

I hope this is of some assistance to you.

Yours sincerely

         Dear Sirs,

         Re:   Ian Glover       (deceased).

         I enclose for your file, a copy of a letter to Mr.          John G l ov er w h i c h I sent
         to h i m direct. I am not clear w h e t h e r you have studied the transcript, but I

         of the queries w h i c h con cer n Mr. Glov er I ac tually dealt with.

         SLP/JT.




         Mr.   J. Glover,




         De ar Mr.   Glover,

         Thank y ou for your letter of the 15th of October.     I am sure that the loss of
         a son or b r o the r must be a very terrible experience and I am very sorry
         indeed to read your descriptions of the pain w h i c h you, your w i f e and your
         three lads are still suffering.

         It is of course impossible to replace yo ur son and in that sense I suppose
         the loss w i l l always be w i t h you, but I do hope that the p s y c ho the ra py and
         perhaps   other help may enable all of          you   to come to terms w i t h       the situation
         and at least to find a meas ure of       peace.

         I a m also sorry to read that you found the format of the Inquest frustrating
         and intimidating.   I and my staff h ad gone to co nsiderable lengths to try and
         avoid this as far as it is possible to do so in the context of a coronal
         Judicial Inquiry.   I am ob vi ously sorry that we a ppear not to have succeeded
         in yo ur case.

         If I n o w turn to the points w h i c h you have raised,     (I wil l use the same
         n u m b e r e d paragraphs as you have):-

                1. W i t h ve ry great respect the transcript of the h e a r i n g does not bear
                      out your description.    I do not      k n o w w h e t h e r you have seen a copy of
                      the transcript, but it mi ght wel l assist if you ha ve a look at it.
                      I a m satisfied that sufficient evidence w as taken at the Inquest and
                      that no further expla nat io n of this point is required.

               2.    The three issues w h i c h you m e n t i o n are clearly outside the
                     parameters of an Inquest w h i c h e v e r w a y one looks at it and
                     in the circumstances, it is not pr actical or pos sib le for me
                     to look into the matters w h i c h you mention.

                     I note w h a t you say regarding the official complaint.        I have no
                     kn ow l e d g e of this and no doubt if you w i s h to pursue it you should
                     do so directly w i t h the South Yorkshire Police, as suming that your
                     complaint was made to them.

               3.

             In the circumstances,   I do not think that I can take this m a t t e r any
             further.

        4.   W i t h ver y great respect your descr ipt io n does not ac cord w i t h the
             transcript of the Inquest.      I also have to point out to you that the
             only evidence w h i c h was put to the court w as w h a t is in the
             transcript.      I think that if you w o u l d study it, you w o u l d see
             that yo ur concer n is not justified.

In the light of w h a t I have said I do not think it appro pr iat e to recall the
p a tho lo gis t nor do I intend to a l l o w evidence to be re-opened in respect of
matters w h i c h have already been adequately dealt with.

W i t h regard to the calli ng of witnesses, I am pre se nt ly consi de rin g this and
Joe is ce rt ainly on the list as a potential witness, though as I have already
indicated, and in order to make it quite clear I w o u l d not be prep ar ed to
listen to evidence w h i c h is not germaine.

I am sending a copy of this letter to your solicitors as they sent me
wh at looks like a p ho to cop y but is not in fact an entirely identical
letter.

Yours    sincerely,




S.L.Popper,

Dr Stefan Popper
The M e d i c o - L e g a l Ce nt re
Wa te r y Street
Sheffield

Dear Dr Popper

I am the father of Ian Glover, one of the 95 vic ti ms of the
H i l l s b o r o u g h D i s as te r and I am wr it in g to you in order to vo ice my
concern re g a r d i n g t h e 'f o r t h c o mi ng inquests.   In particular, I am
concerned that there are s p e ci fi c issues re la ti ng to Ian's d e a t h wh ich
might not be addressed.

I am aware that the inquest held earlier this year was meant to deal
s p e c i f i c a l l y wi t h who Ian was and when and where he met his death.
However, I have to state that I found the limitat ion s of this format
e x t r e m e l y fr u s t r a t i n g and intimidating.  Conseque ntl y, there were a
nu mber of issues re la t i n g to Ian's d e a t h w h ic h I felt were
i n a d e qu at el y addre ss ed yet I felt p o w e r l e ss to pursue answers.    It is
for this reason that I am w r i t i n g to you to ask that you consi der
ca ll in g evidence in an attempt to find the answers my family and
my se lf so d e s p e r a t e l y seek.

I fear that my family has been ir re ve rs ib ly dam ag ed by the
H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster. My wife and I have lost our son Ian,        but we
also have to w at ch our other sons suffer daily.




There are a nu mb er of other          issues that I feel need raising.        These
are as follows:




                                                   continued.
1.   When Ian was lifted onto the pi tc h he was placed in a po si tio n
     close to the goal mouth.                   His brot her Joe was wi th him when a
     po lic e off ic er p r o n o u n c ed him dead and covered his face wi th a
     pullover.             Joe and a g ro up of fans carried Ian on a mak es hi ft
     stret che r to the g y m n a s i u m where he was exami ned by a do c t o r who
     found a pu lse on him and attem pte d res us ci ta ti on (NB this was
     a p p r o x i m a t e l y twenty m i n u t e s after the po li ce officer had
     pr on o u n c e d him dead).         I bel iev e that this issue was in ad equ ate ly
     dea lt wit h at the inquest and request that a de ta il ed ex pl an ati on
     is sought at the soon to be resumed inquests by calling the
     relevant witnesses.

2.   Th ere are three issues r e la ti ng to the n o ti fi ca ti on of Ian's d e a t h
     and his id en ti f i ca t i o n w hi ch I feel need addressing:

     (a)   On the ev en i n g of the di sa ste r I travelled to Ba rn sl ey
           ho spital to see my injured son, Joe (having been informed of
           his w h e r e a b o u t s by my other son John).  The police at this
           stage knew that Ian was dead (Joe had identified him in the
           g y m n a s i u m in the afternoon).    However, an official at the
           hospital checked a computer p r i nt -o ut and informed me that
           Ian was alive bec au se he was not on the list.

     (b)   When I was at the g y m n a s i u m and bef ore I had looked at the
           p h o t og r ap h s of the de ce as ed I was told by a p o l ic em an in the
           r e ce pt io n area that bot h Ian and Joe were dead.

     (c)   Wh il st I was b ei ng given the above information in Y o r ks hi re a
           po l ic e officer vi si t e d my home in L i v er po ol and informed my
           wife that Joe was injured yet made no m e nt io n of Ian even
           though it was some three and a half hours since Joe had
           u n o f f i c i a l l y id entified him in the g y m n a s i u m gi v i n g his name
           and address to a po l i c e officer.

     I request that wit ne ss e s be called to explain how this inaccurate
     informa ti on was dissemin ate d.       Moreover, an official complaint
     made by my se lf re g a r d i n g the acti ons of South Yor ks hi re pol ice
     has, to date, been ignored.




                                                      continued.
                                  - 3 -




4.   At the resumed 'mini' inquests my son Joe poi nte d to a factual
     error in the su mm a r y w hi ch was to be read in the court.         The
     sum ma ry referred to a named police officer ca rr yi ng Ian across the
     p i t c h to the gymnasium.    In actual fact as I have p r e v i o u s l y
     stated, it was Joe and a g ro up of fans who carried Ian across the
     pitch.      When Joe indicated this i n ac cur acy the Summary Off ic er
     altered the sum ma ry so that it read that the officer ma y have
     carried Ian across the pitch.

      I am most conc er ne d that a po li ce of fic er' s state men t could, in
      effect, be altered wi t h such ease and with out the officer being
      consulted, p a r t i c u l a r l y as this ne w information app ar en tl y
      co nt r a d i c t e d the vi su al evidence.

     I request that an ex p l a n a t i o n be given as to how the sum ma ry
     officer could alter the su mmary and further request that my son
     Joe be called as a wi tn e s s in order to give evid enc e re la tin g to
     who carried Ian to the gymnasium.

I would ask that you give ser io us con si de ra ti on to the issues outlined
and to the p o s s i b i l i t y of these being raised at the fo rt hc om in g
inquests.

Yours si n c e r e l y

D ear Dr P o p p e r

I am the fa th er of Ian Glover, one of the 95 v i c t i m s of the
H i l l s b o r o u g h D i s a s t e r and I am w r i t i n g to you in or de r to v o i c e my
co nc e r n r e g a r d i n g the f o r t h c o m i n g inquests.    In par tic ul ar , I am
c o n c e r n e d that there are s p e c i f i c issues re la t i n g to Ian's d e a t h wh ic h
m i g h t not be addressed.

I am aware that the in quest held e a r l i er this year wa s m e a n t to deal
s p e c i f i c a l l y wi t h who Ian was and when and w he re he met his death.
However, I have to s ta te that I found the l i m i ta ti on s of this format
e x t r e m e l y f r u s t r a t i n g and in timidating.         Co ns eq ue nt ly , there were a
nu m b e r of issues r e l a t i n g to Ian's d e a t h wh ic h I felt were
i n a d e q u a t e l y a d d r e s s e d yet I felt p o w e r l e s s to pu rs ue answers.     It is
for this reason that I am w r i t i n g to you to ask that you co ns id er
c a ll i n g e v i d e n c e in an a t t e m p t to find the a n sw er s my fa mi ly and
my s e l f so d e s p e r a t e l y seek.

I fear that my family has been i r r e v e r s i b l y da m a g e d by the
H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster. My wife and I have lost our son Ian,                   but we

Th e r e are a n u m b e r of other       issues   that I feel need raising,              These
are as f o l l o w s :

1.   W he n Ian was lifted onto the p i t c h he W a s pl ac ed in a p os i t i o n
     c lo se to the g oa l mouth.                   His b r o t h e r J o e was w i t h him w he n a
     po l ic e o f f i c e r p r o n o u n c e d him d ead and covered his face w i t h a

     s t r e t c h e r to the g y m n a s i u m where he was e xa mi ne d b y a d o c t o r who

     d e a l t w i t h at the inquest and r e q ue st that a d e t a i l e d e x p l a na ti on
     is s ou g ht at the soon to be resu me d i nq uests by c a l l i n g the

2.   T h e r e are three issues r e l a t i n g to the n o t i f i c a t i o n of Ian's d e a t h              j
     and his i d e n t i f i c a t i o n w h i c h I feel need addressing:

     (a)     On the e v e n i n g of the d i s a s t e r I t r a v e l l e d to B a r n s l e y                 1
             h os p i t a l to see my injured son, Joe (hav in g been informed of                               |
             his w h e r e a b o u t s by my o ther son John).            The p ol i c e at this
             s ta ge knew that Ian was dea d (Joe had ident if ie d him in the
             g y m n a s i u m in the afternoon).         However, an o ff i c i a l at the
             h o sp i t a l c hec ke d a c om pu te r p r i n t - o u t and i nf ormed me that
             Ian w as alive b e c a u s e he was not on the list.

     (b)    When I was at the g y m n a s i u m and b e f o r e I had looked at the
            p h o t o g r a p h s of the d e c e a s e d I was told by a p o l i c e m a n in the
            r e c e p ti o n area that b oth Ian and. Joe were dead.

     (c)    W h i l s t I was b e in g given the a b o v e i n f o r ma ti on in Y o r k s h i r e a           j
            p ol i ce of ficer v i s it ed my home in ’L i v e r p o o l and informed my                       >
            w if e that Joe was injured yet made no m e nt io n of Ian even                                    i
            t ho u gh it was some three and a half hours since Joe had                                         ;

     I r equest that w i t n e s s e s be called to e x p la in how this inaccurate                            j

           e rr or in the s u m m a r y w h i c h was to be read in the court.                 The

           stated, it was Joe and a g r o u p of fans w ho carr ie d Ian ac ro ss the
           pitch.        When Joe in di ca te d this i n a c c u r a c y the S u m m a r y O f f i c e r
           alte re d the s u m m a r y so that it read that the officer m av have
           c a r r i e d Ian a cr o s s the pitch.

           I am most c o n c e r n e d that a police o f f i c e r ' s s t a t em en t could, in
           effect, be altered w i t h such ease and w i t h o u t the offi ce r b ei ng

I
              Dear Sirs

              Re:    R E SUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.



              If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
              of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
              on the 19th of N o v ember 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue w i l l be n o t ified in
              due c o u r s e .

              I do not have to remind you of the fact that a consider able amount of
              evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
              coronal investigation w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not adversarial but
              inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

              Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
              u nder m y control, and in particular, it is m y responsibility to select the
              w i t n e s s e s w h o w i s h to give evidence. I am at prese nt engaged in considering
              this and in determin ing w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

              W i t h o u t prejudice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
              to give you an opportunity to draw to m y attention the names and other
              appropriate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
              c o n s i d e r calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

              M a y I please ask you in considering w h e t h e r you w i s h to draw any names                  to my
              attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

              I also w a n t to make it absolutely clear that the submiss ion of a name or
              names for c o n s ideration is nothing more than that, and that the decis i o n as
              to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

              I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
              h e a r d from you by the end of September I w i l l assume you have no names to
              submit.

Dear
          Sira*
Re:         IAN f. GLOVER (deceased) Ho.37.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

    RE:     IAN GLOVER (DECEASED)


    We refer to the lengthy telephone conversation between Mr. Thompson
    and our Mr. Font.

    We confirm that we are instructed on behalf ofthe next of kin, the
    deceased's father John Glover and family, to representtheir interests
    in relation to Ian's unfortunate death.

    We would be grateful if you would keep us appraised of any developments
    in this matter, particularly with regard to the date of the inquest
    hearing.

    We confirm furthermore that we are instructed to appear at those
    proceedings on behalf of the family.

    In the meantime should you have any desire to communicate with the
    family of the deceased, then could such contact be through ourselves.

    Unfortunately, Mr. Glover is not on the telephone and this may prove to
    be the most expeditious way of making contact with the family.

         inquest.    T h e s e are as follows:

         1.    W he n Ian was lifted onto                    the p i t c h he was p l a c e d in a p o s i t i o n

Dear Mr Glover
I refer to your letter of 18th December 1990 which I received at the
close of business on the 19th. I have now had an opportunity to consider
the names of the people whom you proposed that I should consider.
          We can find no trace of this witness in the system and, in
the circumstances, unless you can produce a statement for me, I do not
see how I can consider the witness.
                 I have already considered this lady’s statement and
I do not think that her evidence will materially assist the Jury in
the light of all the evidence which they have already heard and are
likely to hear.
With regard to
     I we will look into the question of their availability and if it
is practical, I will try and arrange for them to be called. I should
add that I do not think that the evidence which, ju d g in g by their statements,
is so materially different from what we have already heard or are likely
to hear that their non-availability would be significant.
The other two witnesses whom you mention,
       I do not propose to call.
You also refer to Coach Operators, in particular Amber!ine and Home
James. Could you please let me have by return the name or names of
the individual whose evidence you wish me to consider with regard to
these two companies.
Please make sure that I hear from you as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely

                           Dear Mr. Glover,

                           ThartV vnu for your letter c£ the 15th. o£ October,    X am siire that the loss o£
                           a sor nr brother jiust be a very terrible experience and I am very sorry
                           h d p p n -o rpad votir descriptions of the pain which you. your wife and your
                           three lads are still suffering.

                           It is of course impossible to replace your son and in that sense I suppose
                           the '• •:•: will alvays he with you. but I dc hope that the psychotherapy and
                           perhaps, nrhfif help may enable all     of     you to core to terms ‘with the situation
                           and et      least to find, a measure of peace.

                           t an p I s o sorry tn read that you found the format of the Inquest frustrating
                           ann '^r irni rf.-t jr>o ,. j and nrv staff had gone to considerable lengths to try and
                           avoid ? b ‘ :s as far as it is possible to do so in the context of a coronal
                           •Judicial Inquire.         I a® obviously sorry that w e appear not to have succeeded
                           in year case.

                           If r iow turn to the points which you have raised, (T will use the same
                           numbered, paragraphs as yon have)
                                                                                                  \
                                        with rary great respect the transcript of the hearing does not bear
                                        out your description. I do notknow whether you have seen a copy of
                                        the transcript, but it might well assist if you have a look at it.
                                        T a/r. Fat isf led that sufficient evidence was taken at the Inquest and
                                        that no further era janation of this point is required-

                                        The three issues which you sention ire clearly outside the
                                        parameters of an Inquest whichever way one looks at it and
                                        in the circumstances. It is not practical or possible for me
                                        to look into the matters which yon mention.

                                        I note what you say regarding the official complaint,  i have no
                                        Knowledge of this and no doubt if you visa to pursue it you, should
                                        do so directly with the South Yorkshire Police, assuming that your
                                        complaint was made to them*

                        In the circumstancesT X do not think that l can take this matter any
                        further.
2                i.     W ith very great respect your description, does not accord with, the
                        transcript of the Inquest*    I also have to point out to you that the
                        only evidence which was put to the court was what is in the
                        transcript*   I think; that if you would study it, you would see
                        that your concern is not justified.

          In. the light of what I have said I do not think it appropriate to recall the
          pathologist nor do I intend to -allow evidence to be re-opened in respect of
          matters which have already been adequately dealt with.

          With regard to the calling of witnesses* I am presently considering this and
          Joe is certainly on the list as a potential witness, though as I have already
          indicated, and in order to make it quite clear I would not be prepared to
          listen to evidence which is not germaine.

          I am sending a copy of this letter to your solicitors as they sent me
          what looks like a photocopy but Is not ia fact an entirely Identical
          letter.

          Yours sincerely

   Dear Dr Popper

 I T am the father .of. .Iajj- 6-lover, ..one of the., 95- v.iotims -of -the -
  'Hillsborough. Disaster and I am ‘     writing' to you in order to voice my
   concern regarding t h e 1forthcoming inquests.          Ir particular, I am
   concerned that there are specific issues relating to Ian's death which
/ slight not be addressed.

   I am aware that the inquest held earlier this year was meant to deal
   specifically with who Ian was and when and where he met his death.
   However^ I have to state that I found the limitations of this format
   extremely frustrating and intimidating.  Consequently, there were a
   number of issues relating to Ian's death which I felt were
   inadequately addressed yet I felt powerless to pursue answers,   it is
   for this reason that I am writing to you to ask that you consider
   calling evidence in an attempt to find the answers ay family and
   myself so desperately seek.




   There are a number of other issues that I feel need raising.          These
   are as follows:

                                      - 2 -

       When Ian was lifted onto the pitch he was placed in a position
       close to the goal mouth. His brother Joe was with him when a
       police officer pronounced him dead and covered his face with a
       pullover.  Joe and a group of fans carried Ian on a makeshift
       stretcher to the gymnasium where he was examined by a doctor who
       found a pulse on him and attempted resuscitation (NB this was
       approximately twenty minutes after the police officer had
                                                                                            V-*?
       pronounced him dead).  I believe that this issue was inadequately
       dealt with at the inquest and request that a detailed explanation
       is sought at the soon to be resumed inquests by calling the
       relevant witnesses.

       There are three issues relating to the notification of Ian's death
       and his identification which I feel need addressing:

        (a)   On the evening of the disaster I travelled to Barnsley
       —   — hospital -to— see- my -injured scn-^J.oe---<:
                                                         -ha.vin.g been- in-f-o-r-med-^af
             his whereabouts by sty other son John).          The police at this
             stage knew that Ian was dead (Joe had identified him in the
             gymnasium in the afternoon).       However, an official at the
             hospital checked a computer print-out and informed me that
             Ian was alive because he was not on the list.

       (b)     When I was at the gymnasium and before I had looked at the
               photographs of the deceased 1 was told by a policeman In the
               reception area that both Ian and Joe were dead.

       <c)     Whilst 1 was being given the above information in Yorkshire a
               police officer visited ay home in Liverpool and informed my
               wife that Joe was Injured yet made no mention of Ian even
               though it was some three and a half hours since Joe had
               unofficially identified him In the gymnasium giving his name
               and address to a police officer.

       I request that witnesses be called to explain how this inaccurate
       information was disseminated.  Moreover, an official complaint
       made by myself regarding the actions of South Yorkshire police
       has, to date, been Ignored.

4. - At the resumed 'mini' inquests ay son Joe pointed to a factual
     error in the summary which was to be read in the court.    The
     summary referred to a named police officer carrying Ian across the
     pitch to the gymnasium,   In actual fact as I have previously
     stated, it was Joe and a group of fans who carried Ian across the
     pitch.  When Joe indicated this inaccuracy the Summary Officer
     altered the summary so that it read that the officer may have
     carried Ian across the “pitch J " "'       .   -- -   — -- -   —

     I am most concerned that a police officer's statement could, in
     effect; be altered with such ease and without the officer being
     consulted, particularly as this new information apparently
     contradicted the visual evidence,

     1 request that an explanation be given as to how the summary
     officer could alter the summary and further request that my son
     Joe be called as a witness in order to give evidence relating to
     who carried Ian to the gymnasium.

I would ask that you give serious consideration to the issues outlined
and to the p o s s i b i l i t y of these being raised at the forthcoming_
inquests

         Mr.   J. Glover,




         Dear Mr.    Glover,

0        I refer to your letter of the 18th of Dec emb er w h i c h I received at the close
         of business on the 19th.     I have n o w had an o p port uni ty to co nsi der the names
         of the people w h o m you propo sed that I should consider.

         1.                We can find no trace of this witnes s in the s ystem and in the
               circumstances, unless you can produce a statement before me I do not
               see h o w I can c onsider the witness.

         2.                         I have already c ons ide red this l a d y ’s statement and I do
               not think that her evidence will m a t e r i a l l y assist the Jury in the light
               of all the evidence w h i c h they have already h e a r d and are likely to hear.
               W i t h regard to|
                                                           will look into the que sti on of their
               avail abi lity and if it is practical, I will try and arrange for them
               to be called.      I should add that I do not think that the evidence
               w h i c h they give is so m a t e r i a l l y different from what we have already
               h e a r d or are likely to hear that their n o n - a v a i l a b i l i t y w o u l d be
               significant.

0              The other two wit nes ses w h o m y ou mention,                                          and
                             I do not propose to call.

               You also refer to Coach Operators, in particu lar A m b e r line and
               Home James.  Could you please let me have by return the name or names
               of the individual w h o s e evidence you w i s h me to consider w i t h regard
               to these two companies.

               Please ma ke sure that I hea r from you as soon as possible.

         Yours   sincerely,

IAN GLOVER._________________________ .-V                  6 * °*




I consulted H.M. Coroner who told me to ring Mr. Glover
back and say that we could not discuss this over the
phone and that he should consult with his solicitor,
who could in turn write to us or bring this matter
up at the Inquest.    Mr. Glover said that he would
do this and thanked me for my concern.
The name and address of the Funeral Director is

Mr.   J. Glover,




Dear Mr.        Glover,

Thank you for yo ur letter of the 15th of October.        I am sure that the loss of
a son or b r o t h e r mu&t be a ver y terrible experience and I am v er y sorry
indeed to read your descriptions of the pa in w h i c h you, your wife and you r
three lads are still suffering.

It is of course impossible to replace your son and in that sense I suppose
the loss w i l l always be w i t h you, but I do hope that the ps ycho t h e r a p y and
perha ps other help m a y enable all of you to come to terms w i t h the sit uation
and at least to find a measure of peace.

I am also sorry to read that y ou found the format of the Inquest fr ustrating
and intimidating.     I and my staff had gone to considerable lengths to try and
avoid this as far as it is po ssible to do so in the context of a coronal
Ju dic i a l Inquiry. I am obviously sorry that^we appear not to have succeeded
in you r case..

If I n o w turn to the points w h i c h you have raised,                       (I will use the same
n u m b e r e d p aragraphs as you have):-

        1.      W i t h ve ry great respect the transcript of the hear ing does not bear
                out you r description.     I do not k n o w w h e t h e r you have seen a copy of
                the transcript, but it might well assist if you have a look at it.
                I am satisfied that sufficient evidence was taken at the Inquest and
                that no further e x pl anat ion of this point is required.
                                                                    ’•Si
        2.      The three issues w h i c h you m e n t i o n are clearly outside the
                paramet ers of an Inquest w h i c h e v e r w a y one looks at it and
                in the circumstances, it is not p rac tical or possible for me
                to look into the matters w h i c h you mention.

               I note what you say regarding the official complaint.       I have no
               kn owle dge of this and no doubt if you w i s h to pursue it y o u should
               do so dir ectl y w i t h the South Yorkshire Police, assuming that your
               complaint was made to them.
                                                2




             In the circumstances,    I do not think that I can take this m a t t e r any
             further.

        4.   W i t h ve ry great respect your d e scri pti on does not accor d w i t h the
             transcript of the Inquest.      I also have to point out to you that the
             only evidence w h i c h was put to the court was w h a t is in the
             transcript.      I think that if you w o u l d study it, you w o u l d see
             that yo ur concer n is not justified.

In the light of wha t I have said I do not think it appropriate to recall the
pa tho l o g i s t nor do I intend to allow evidence to be re-opened in respect of
matt ers w h i c h have already bee n adequately dealt with.

W i t h regard to the call ing of witnesses, I am presently conside ring this and
Joe is certainly on the list as a potential witness, though as I have already
indicated, and in order to make it quite clear I w o u l d not be p r e p a r e d to
listen to evidence w h i c h is not germaine.

I a m sending a copy of this letter to your solicitors as they sent me
w h a t looks like a photocopy, but is not in fact an entirely identical
letter.

Yours    sincerely,




  M.Corotter.

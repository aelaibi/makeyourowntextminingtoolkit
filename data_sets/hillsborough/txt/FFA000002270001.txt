Dear Sir

re:   Liverpool v Nottingham Forest - 15 April 1989
      F A Cup Semi-Final Tie_______________________

I am in receipt of your letter dated 21 April, in which you refer to the
disastrous tragedy at Hillsborough, and I would confirm that I was in
attendance.

As requested in your letter I would submit my observations on how I saw
the situation from my position in the Directors Box, where I must say it was
iirpossible to ascertain the magnitude of the disaster from where I was
sitting. However, I would say that upon taking my seat soma fifteen
minutes before the caimencement of play, I took particular notice of the
assembly of the crowd in both standing areas occupied by the Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest supporters and whilst it would appear there were no
problems at the Nottingham Forest end or Liverpool at that time, some few
minutes before the kick-off the central section of the standing area provided
for the Liverpool supporters immediately behind the goal posts seated to be
somewhat overcrowded, which I understand was due to the late arrival of a
large contingent of Liverpool supporters. It was noticeable to me at this
particular time the right and left sections of this standing area were not
in my view overcrowded, and I am of the opinion this terrible catastrophe
could have been avoided had adequate marshalling been available, more so
when you consider this was a repeat of last years semi-final when everyone
enjoyed an excellent natch.

In conclusion, I feel I must mention that I have nothing but praise for the
behaviour displayed by spectators from both clubs, many of which assisted
the Police and Doctors in their arduous task at this tragic event.

Yours faithfully

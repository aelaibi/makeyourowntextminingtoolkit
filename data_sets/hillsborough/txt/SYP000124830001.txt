 DO YOU HAVE             ANY VIEWS OR O B S E R V A T I O N S ON T H E WAY T H E              INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 A FTER THE M ATCH WAS STOPPED?

 FIRSTLY        I THINK THAT THE CROWD SHOULD                               BEEN      INFORMED WHAT WAS H A P P E N I N G

 AND TO E V A C U A T E       THE BACK OF T H E P E N S .          /    I T H I N K T H AT THE POLICE DID T H E I R

 BEST     IN    THE      SITU A TIO N     BUT   I DO NOT 1/1 INK THAT T H E R E WERE ENO U G H POLICE

 O F F I C E R S AT THE L E P P I N G S LANE T U R W & T I L E AREA TO HANDL.gr THE L A R G E CROWD,



 IS T H E R E A N Y T H I N G THAT YOU                 TO ADD W H IC H              U FEEL      IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL        INQUIRY?

 I     THINK    T HA T    THE WAY THE C R O W D ARE HAN D E D               AT TURNSTILES           IS POOR B E C A U S E OF

 THE L I M I T E D AM O U N T OF E N T R A N C E S FOR Tj^E L A R G E AMO U N T OF PEOPLE A T T ENDING

 ALS O    I    THINK      THAT   T H E F ANS SHO U L D   B£ E N C O U R A G E D TO E N T E R T H E GR O U N D EARLIER

 SO      THAT    THE      E N T R Y CAN    BE   MADE OVER    A L ONGER            PER I O D OF T I M E .

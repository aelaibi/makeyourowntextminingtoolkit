                  On    reaching             the    gates          we    saw a number                  of    officers             from       other       serials

                  just       millingaround                   just       inside           the       gates        and     we      were       immediately

                  instructed             by D e t e c t i v e           Inspector              C H A R L E S to       go     down       the      tunnel        into

                  At    t his      time            I thought            t hat       there must            be t r o u b l e        between          the     fans      and

                  As    we    went       towards             the    tunnel           I saw m a n y           people          coming          from      tha t

                  injured          and       remember             that       on e    ambulance              was    already            in a t t e n d a n c e

                  outside          the       gro u n d .

                  I then          went       through          the       tunnel           into       the     Leppings            Ln    standing           area     and

                  immediately                saw    down          towards           my    left       a man        I y i n & on the            floor.           I also

                  saw    people          tugging             at    the       wire        mesh       f e n c i n g /permfiter            fence        towards         my

                  to    fight .

                  was    not       wearing          a    shirt.              I would           describe           him      as     being       approximately

                  fifty years                of age,          five       feet        seven          inc h e s ,    very         heavy        build       with a

    at    the L e p p i n g s     L n all       in n e e d         of a m b u l a n c e s .

    Gradually ambulances                     arrived          and       the    injured were               conveyed         to     hospital

    The    dead      bodies       of    fans       were       put       to    one    side        and    eventually           a screen

    ambulance.

    Police       Inspector         SYKES        arr/ved            on    the       scene        and    detailed men             to    go

    with     the     bodies       to the srartuary.

    By    this     ti me    the    crowd        had      left       the       ground        in a v e r y       orderly          fashion

    with    only      the    odd       few    shouting             abuse.

    Once     the     ground       was     cleared          I went            with    other         officers         to    regroup          in

    the    stand      and    eventually walked                      back       to C l a y w h e e l s        Lane    and     went       off

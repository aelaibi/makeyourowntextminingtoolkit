O ddi wrth yr Is-Ysgrifennydd SeneddoI           IAN GRIST MP           From The Parliamentary Undsr-Sscreia:


                CT/4080/89                                             February 1989




                                             /
                Thank you for your letter of 12 January about the Football
                Spectators Bill.

                In his answer to an inspired question from Gwilym Jones on
                17 January, Peter Walker announced that in Wales we intended
                to set up at early date a Working Party to advise on whether
                any particular match should be designated. Whilst it is
                extremely unlikely that we would not designate league and FA
                Cup matches in Wales it will be for the Working Party to
                advise upon this matter in the first instance. We should
                not therefore I believe come to any firm decision on the
                detail of the Orders until later. It will of course be for
                the Secretary of State for Wales to announce which matches
                are to be designated.

                I believe that we should look at the detail of the
                membership of the Football Membership Authority once the
                Working Party have advised on matches played in Wales and we
                have decided which, if any, are to be designated.

                I am copying this letter to         the Prime Minist , Lord .
                Chancellor, Lord President,         Lord Privy Seal, Attorney
                General, Chief Secretary to         the Treasury, Lord Ferrers,
                First Parliamentary Counsel         and to Sir Robin Butler.

p . m . (1420)      this       day and date the          last of the Liverpool           supporters         had

a rri v e d by train.                During my time at the Midl an d S t a t i o n I only saw

one man a r r e s te d and this                incident was a considerable            distance away

from me.           The Liverpool             fans were    quite    orderly and w i l l i n gl y handed

over any          cans of beer or bottles                in their    possession.         We    then

boarded the             last    two    public: service      vehicles       leaving the Midl an d

S t a t i o n with Liverpool              supporters      en route to the football              ground.

Serial       14 had been             instructed to report          to the g y mn as iu m at

H i l l s b o r o u g h for standby duties and to meal at the ground at the half

time     interval.             The    public    service    vehicle    I was on ente re d Leppings

Lane at 2.45             p . m . (1445)      that day and date.           As we   passed Catchbar

Lane     I saw a serial               officers    stood at that       junction.      H un dr ed s      of

s u pporters were              in the area of the ground and these a p p e a r e d to be

b oisterous and             rowdy but generally            good humoured.         As the       bus was

travelling          on past          the Leppings    Lane entrance          to the ground,        I could

see several             spect at or s     sat on the wall         s urrounding    the sta d iu m and

others a t te mp t in g          to    climb the gate.        Beer     cans    littered the       roadway

near the bridge                over    the    roadway.     Other    than the above,           everything

a pp e a r e d    to be under          control    at that side of the stadium.                  As the      bus

travelled along Leppings Lane                      towards P en istone Road,          we      passed a

further          large group of Liverpool                spectators       heading towards        the

Leppings Lane             end.

At 2,55 p.m.             (1455)       that    day and date,       I reported to an         Inspector        in

the gymnasium at                the ground.       At that time my serial           was     incomplete

through t r avelling                 on different    public       service     vehicles.        I was

instructed to get my serial                      together and       report     back to him straight

away.

At 3.03          p.m.    (1503)       that day and date,          I was    instructed      by the

Inspector          to take my serial             inside    the ground to the L ep pi ng s Lane
         end and im po rt      there as spectators were                climbing     the    perimeter       fence

         and     invading    the     playing      pitch.    On entering        the ground     by the Spion

         Kopr e n d a l on gs id e    the North Stand,         the football m at ch was            in progress

         n   then wa lk ed    down the track alo ng si de             the North Stand        to the

     r   Leppings Lane end.               As    I did so I could see spectators at                 the

■J       Leppi n gs Lane      end     climbing over        the s ec ur it y fence onto the           pitch

         area and some        of these entered the North Stand seating area.                              About

         thirty to forty Police Officers were                    on the track at the Leppings

         Lane end and several              s pectators were also         on the track area.              Other

         s pectators were walking               down the    track alo ng si de      the N orth Stand

         towards me.         None     of these      people a pp ea r ed to be       injured    in any way.

         At that time        I was     under the      impression that          it was a public           order

         situation.         Just     past the halfway         line    I stopped |,he spec t a t o r s and

         they compl a i n ed       that    they had    climbed the fence           to prevent       being

         crushed and        injured.           I instructed them all        to sit down       in front of

         the N orth S tand         on the       track area.     From where       I was     I could not see

         anything was wrong at that time.                     My serial     continued to the Leppings

         Lane    end where     I was       instructed by an          Inspector for my        serial       to

         cover the L e pp in gs Lane end near the N orth Stand.                       The    time was now

         3 .06   p.m.    (1506).       Almost      immediately       there was a loud        roar from the

         crowd and s u pporters on the L ep pings Lane                   terrace move        forward,          but

         they did not        go back.          There a pp ea re d to be a large           influx    of fans

         onto the Leppi n g s Lane             terrace.     S p ec ta to rs were    screaming and

         shouting       for help.         The noise was       defeaning.        I went     to the goal

         m outh area and       could see children and adults                   crushed up against              the

         perimeter       fence at      the      back of the goal       mouth.      Police Officers were

         a s s isting    in helping        injured    persons    over    the    perimeter     fence onto

         the track area.             Other Police O ff icers were f r ac ti ca ll y           pul ling at

         the security fencing along w ith s pectators                      on the other       side       of the

         fence,     trying    to break          it down.    I went     towards the access           gate to
                                                                                                                    PAGE           4

                      the terrace        in the security fence but         could not get near            it.     This

                      gate    onto the track suddenly opened,             I do not know how,           and

                      spectators        spilled    out onto the     pitch area.       Many of these           spectators

                      collapsed and had to be helped to safety b y                   officers and myself                onto

                      the/football        pitch area where they were a ss is te d            by Police,        civilian

                      terrace       near the     security fence wall.      The    scene was      one    of horror,

Qr                    upset and anguish.            We   could not get through the gate onto the

                      persons were        passed th rough the gap by spectators.                 T hese were

                      carried onto        the    pitch area by Police Offic er s        for treatment.              Other

                      Police O ff icers and myself           then   cleared the security gate and entered

                      the terraced area           but were faced with a diverting             fence about        six

                      feet    high that       s tr etched from front     to back of the terrace.               Injured

                      parties were        passed over the fence         to us by spectators.            T hese were

                      carried       onto the     football ground area for treatment.              The    spectators

                      at this       time had     realised that we were      de sp er at el y trying      to help

                      them and a s s i st e d us     in an yw ay they    could.      Three    of the     persons         I

                      of these were          dealt wi t h by the eme rg en cy service.           The   third,       a

                      young    boy,     I had    to deal with myself wit h the a ss is ta nc e           of Police

                      onto    the   playing area                                             .   I i mme diately

    mask and        placed     it over the boy's           face     but there was        no    response.         An

    u nknown doctor           then examined the          boy and told me           regret ta bl y that the

    y o u t h was     dead.     I placed my Police anorak                 over    the youth.

    I looked up and everywhere ar o un d me                      in the goal m outh are a there

    were    bodies wit h memb er s          of the eme rg en cy services,              Police and

    civilians         trying    de sp er at el y to revive          them and save        life.     I lost my

    P olice    helmet and gloves at the scene,

    In the may he m         personal      radio   contact was           totally    inaudible.          I could

    not hear a thing            I never     heard any message             passed over the tannoy

    ma keshift        stretchers.         I requested several             Liverpool     youth s    to assist

    me and we         carried     the youth to the          gymnasium.

    On arrival         at 3.4 5    p.m.    (1545)      that day and; date,          the y outh was

    certified dead by Doctor Kirban,                     c/o M i d dl e wo o d Hospital.          I was

    instructed by a senior                officer      to remain with the body.

    I carried ouV^a            cursory examin at io n of the              body and     could find no

    marks     of violence,         other    than a graze           on his forehead and           chin.       I

and the       party       involved was advised.

The deceased y ou th              I dealt with was        later     p ho to graphed an d a l lo ca te d

number 36.

The g ymnasium was             later divided          into three     sections,      Police Officers

involved occupying                the middle     section.        M any of the officers         present

were     clearly d is tr e ss e d by what             they had seen and dealt w ith and,at

the    request          of Chief S u pe ri nt en de nt Mole,        I circulated amo ngst           the

officers and forced                 them to make       conversation.

At    12.50 a.m.          (0050)     on Sunday,       16th April,     1989,    (160489),      I was

prepsent wit h the             b o y ’s father,

                          | a tt en d ed at the gym na si um with members               of his family,

he formally             identified the body of the y outh to me as that                      of his

son,    Kevin TYRRELL,              15 years    (190673),       schoolboy,     of   1                      I

                          |' The sudden death form was              then    completed      in full.

At    1.45 a.m.          (0145)     on Sunday,    16th April,        1989    (160489),      the body

was    conveyed to the              public mortuary,          Wa te ry Street.      I fully examined

the body a gain and there were                   no marks       of violence      other     than the

grazes      on the f or eh e ad and           chin.     The    property and      clothing were        left

with the        body.

I. rang off duty at West Bar at 2.45 a.m.                          (0245)    on Sunday,      16th

April,      1989        (160489).

O B S E R V AT I ON S

(1)      The actions          of many Liverpool          supporters at that time were

         commendable as they tried to assist                      the eme rg en cy services          in

         an y manner         they    could.    There were,       however,     several      flashpoints

         and angry scenes when spectators                      realised their       friends and       loved

         ones were          dead.

(2)      I was      very     impressed by the actions              of Police Con st ab le

         McManus,          ’B ’ D iv is i on and an unknwon man for the assis ta nc e

         they gave me           in trying      to save    the     life of K evin TYRRELL.

                                                                                                       R367

                They d es p er a te l y tried to        revive    the boy and      preserve     his    life.

         (3)    I cannot account             for what   individual      members    of my serial        (14)

                did,    but   I can say that         every officer ar o un d me tried desper at el y

                in the best       traditions        of the Police Force to          preserve     life.

         (4)    In   this day and age with AIDS and H E PI TI TI S                ’B ’ common    in society,

                it may be      considered        prudent   to    issue all    officers     (emergency

                services)      w ith a m outh to m outh          resus ci ta ti on tube.      This     should

                be   issued as s ta ndard equipment and               carried at all       times      on duty.

                This w ould allay the fears              of officers      in catching      some disease

                they do not want.

         (5)    It   caused me great           concern that whilst we were trying               to save

                the young      b o y ’s life,      that this was      being   filmed on camera.

                P h o t og r ap h er s and    cameramen were everywhere.            These are      profess­

                ional    people who          should have a ss is t ed    in preserving      life,      instead

                of being a hindrance.

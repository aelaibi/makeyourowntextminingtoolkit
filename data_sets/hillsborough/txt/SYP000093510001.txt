                 At 3.25pm           (1525)           arr/ved at the ground and entered through the

                 Other persons were sat on the ground,                                    obviously injured.         They were

v   attending to the injured.        Some of the fans,      however,   were extremely

    aggressive.        I noticed that there was a strong small of intoxicants

    and some of the fans smelled of drink - they were directing swear

    words towards us,       blaming us for the injuries.


                                                 /
    I, along with 2 or 3 other o f f i c e r s / w a s   then instructed by a Police

    Inspector to begin removing bodiyS from the courtyard area.                 I began

    by lifting the body of a whiteXinidentified male, whose face was

    Covered in vomit, and also ynelied strongly of intoxicants.                 He was

    carried to waiting ambujlanrces on Leppings L a n e .       H o w e v e r , we were told

    by an unidentified ambiiiBnceman that "ambulances are for the living".

    The m a n ’s body was gently laid against a wall and I returned to the

    courtyard area.        The atmosphere within that area was one of tension,

    caused by the aggression of Liverpool           fans aimed at police officers

    car ryi ng out bodi e s , and at officers caring for the injured.



    At 3.40pm        (1540) a radio message   reported that Liverpool      fans were

    throwing missiles from the/ stand onto police and rescue workers in the

    te rr ac in g.    Along with ysther members of the de partment, we entered

    the Leppings Lane stgmd to attempt to calm the situation.                We were

    greeted by a crowd/of drunken,         very violent     people, who hurled abuse

    and obscenities at us.         We said nothing,      but remained in the stand.

    The majority of the crowd remained calm and we managed to control the

    situation without further        incident.

           HILLSBOROUGH - INTERIM REPORT II

            I have pleasure in enclosing an interim report we have prepared which
            you may find of interest.  It is forwarded to you on a strictly private
            and confidential basis.

            The report, which is a revised copy of one prepared for Lord Justice
            Taylor in June, represents our best understanding at this time, of what
            occurred at Hillsborough.  Consequently it should not be viewed as the
            definitive statement on the incident, but rather as a guide.  It will be
            noted that at present we have been able to position eighty eight of the
            ninety five deceased mainly by video and photographic evidence, but also
            by plan and statement evidence.

            We are still continuing to process the evidence already obtained into
            the HOLMES computer.  This is likely to continue into early December.
            Shortly after that we should be able to draw more definite conclusions
            and subject to advice and direction you give, be ready to identify those
            to be interviewed and the questions to be addressed.

            In forwarding the report may I once again invite you to visit our
            Incident Room at Nechells in Birmingham at any time and see at first
            hand the work being undertaken by our staff.  I am sure you will find it
            most useful.

             In the meantime if there is anything with which you think I can help
             please do not hesitate to contact me.

             I have copied this letter and the accompanying report to the Director of
             Public Prosecutions and Police Complaints Authority.

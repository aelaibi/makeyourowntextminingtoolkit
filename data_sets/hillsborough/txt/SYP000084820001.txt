            I am a married man living at the above address with wife and

            daughter.        I am employed by Sheffield Wednesday FC part time as a

            steward and have held this position for about twenty two years.

           For the last three years             I^/haye been posted to the photographers                      press

            room in the North S t a n d . / f w    & o X y Iinc1udes   handing out bibs and

            programmes to the preffs people and putting bibs away at the end of

            the game.

           On Saturday 15 April          1989 (150489),       I was givin the same post for the

           FA Cup Semi Final between Liverpool and Notts Forest.                              I got to the

            ground about eleven o ’clock my first job usually is to put programmes

            in dressing      rooms and referees       rooms but on this day they weren't

            ready so I went over to the North Stand had a walk                        round then after a

           while      returned and did the programmes              in the South Stnad rooms this
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S290S

was   probably about     I E .30 pm.     By now I'd then returned to the press

room on the North Stand,        where     I stayed until kick off at 3--00 pm.

As usual after kick off time I             made my way to the corner of the pitch

by the Kop end and North Stand             I do this because       I collect the bibs

back from the press as they leave the pitch.

1 had only been there a few minutes when Liverpool                  hit the bar of the

Forest goal and almost        immediately Liverpool Fans started climbing

over the fences at the West Stand which was the opposite side of the

ground to where    I was standing.          My first    reaction was that     it was a

pitch invasion by the Liverpool            fans but after about five minutes            I

realised it must have been something more serious because                   1 saw

injured people being he 1 ped bySt Johns Ambulance             people.       In a very

short space of time I was almost            in   a trance because there were

hundreds of police marching on to the pitch,               there were Police dogs

barking and ambulances were beginning to arrive at the ground it

became a bit much for me when I saw a man in his early 2 0 ’s being

helped by St Johns Ambulance and I saw that his arm was broken badly

at a funny angle, after        I saw this I went back        int

stayed.At about 4.30 pm there was me and a press man in the room,                      he

is a regular at the ground and I knew him as                           he had just come

in to give me his bib back             when about half a dozen Liverpool             fans

burst into the room        and in an aggressive manner they said to

Hey you tell the truth."         They shouted other things at us but I c a n ’t

remember what,    this      lasted for about two or three minutes            in      fact I

grabbed one of them         to put him out then I let him go because                 I just

c o u l d n ’t believe all this was happening.          Anyway they left and __

       left shortly.       Most of the threats were made to                         but I

did feel   threatened as well,          the Liverpool    fans were all aged about

20 years and one had a shaved head, almost bald,               thats all     I can

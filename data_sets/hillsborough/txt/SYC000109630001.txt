          I NQ U E S T INTO THE D E A T H OF A N D R E W MARK BROOKES

     THE CORONER:    Mr. Fraser, just allow me, I want to
sort something out w i t h the Jur 3r.

     I lia e b e e n told b y the Jury Officer that y o u have
got a query about something.       TJhere is the Foreman?
Can you just tell me what it is that is w o r r y i n g you
at the moment w i t h regard to some of the evidence?

     T H E FOR E M A N OF T H E JURY:    We have not had chance to
discuss it yet.

     T H E CORONER:    TJell, in that case, the w a y to do it -
perhaps I should have made that clear — if you do have
a problem discuss it w i t h 3^our F oreman and then at an
opportune moment just stand up and say, "Me have got a
problem.    Tie want to tell y o u wha t it is" and then we
will sort it out.     ¥e will deal w i t h this next case^
and then, w hen y o u have a chance over coffee, sort it
out, decide what y o u want to ask and then I will try
and help you as far as I am able.        01cay?

      Yes, Mr. Fraser?

     MR. FRASER:        Sir, the next evidence you will hear
relates to A n d r e w Brookes.   A n d r e w ’s mum and dad are
in Court wit h tlieir social worker.           I appear in my
usual guise, sir, as a m e m b e r of the Steering Committee
as agent       for their solicitors.     T h e y are a memb e r of
our g r o u p .

         T H E CORONER:      Mr. and Mrs. Brookes, thank you for
b eing here.        Y o u were not here on the first day, I assume,
were you?        No.     Let me just b r i e f l y tell you what is
going to h a p p e n so that y o u can u n d e rstand more-or-less
the format.         First of all, I am going to read the evidence
which was taken on the 18th April, 19&9 and then I am
going to confirm that the facts are correct,                     Then I
am going to tell you what the evidence was of Dr. Forrest
with relation to the blood alcohol as it relates to
your lad.        Tvhen. I have done that, Prof. Jones is going
to come and give evidence and will tell us, as
ajjpi’opriate, of the pathological findings.                 T h e n we
are going to h e a r from the Uest Midlands Police Officers
who w ill summarise the evidence to us.                  There are
u s u a l l y two - one tells us about the visual evidence
and demonstrates on those b i g plans.               Y o u will hear
references to plans and numbers and so on.                   T r y not to
allow them to distract y o u because we need them for the
record.        It is a bit distracting, I know, but we have
got to do it.           Is that clear?

                                  This is the resumed Inquest which was opened on the
                         18th Apz’i.l, 1989.       Neil A n t h o n y Parkin, the Acting
                         C o r o n e r ’s Officer said:

                                    "The foody w h i c h is the subject of this Inquest
                                    has b e e n identified to PC 1779 W i l l iamson of
                                    the South Yorlcshir-e Police as that of Andrew
                                    Hark Brookes b y John Harris, his friend.             He
                     B              was 26 years of age h a v i n g bee n b orn on 10th
                                    December, 1 9 6 2 at E r omsgrove.       He was a single
                                    m a n and he lived at
                                    Bx’omsgrove.      He was a car work e r b y occupation.
                                    He died at Hill s b o r o u g h Football Ground
                                    f ollowing an incident there on S a t u r d a y , 15"fch
                                    April, 1 9 8 9 , PC 1779 Williamson.-caused the
                                    b o d y to be removed to the Medico Legal Centre
                                    and there he identified it to Detective
                                    Constable Simon Weigold who subsequently
                                    identified the same b o d y to Prof. Jones.           It
                                    is the f a m i l y w i s h that the b o d y should be
                                    cremated."

                              Are y o u all right?            Do you want me to pause for a
                         moment?
                     D
                                 M R S . BROOKES:      No .

                              THE CORONER:      Mr. Brookes, you will remember that
                         on the 27tli April y o u signed a form w h i c h I h a d sent
                         you where I asked y o u to check the details and, in fact,
                         you signed it as correct and that is still so what I
                         have read out, is it not?
                     E
                                 MR. BROOKES      (Snr):       Yes.

                              T H E CORONER:     Dr. Forrest did the blood alcohol
                         levels and he gave us the evidence w i t h regard to'these
                         on the first day.      As far as Andx’ew was concerned the
                         alcohol level w h i c h he m e a sured was 8 9 m g / 1 0 0 ml.

                                 Prof.   Jones,     if you w o u l d be good enough to come
                         down?

                                            PROF.     ST]CPJIEN JONES C a l l e d :

                                                     By THE CORONER:

                              THE CORONER:   This is Prof. Stephen Jones from
                         Nottingham and he did the examination in the case of
                         Andrew.

                         Q. Yes, Professor? - A. The b o d y of A n d r e w Brookes,
                            wh i c h was assigned No. 50, was identified to me by
                            Detective Constable Wei g o l d at the Medico Legal
                            Centre.     I carried out an examination of the bod y
                     H      and I found that he was a well-built young man and
                            ho was of average stature.      There was v ery marked
                            cyanosis, w h i c h is a blue discolouration of the
                            skin, of the h e a d and neck and fingertips and there
J. L. H arpham Ltd
                                                              -2-
                                                                            PROP. S. JONES



                              were also extensive little petechial haemorrhages -
                              these are pinpoint haemorrhages - on the skin and
                              on the globes of the eyes.       As far as injuries were
                              concerned, there were some m i n o r bruises and
                              abrasions to the forehead and there were also some
                              abrasions of the skin of b o t h lower legs, probably
                              as a result of contact w i t h other people at the time
                              of the crush.      Further examination revealed
                     B        additional petechial haemorrhages on various organs
                              of the b o d y and these were v e r y characteristic of
                              death b e i n g caused by traumatic asphyxia and so I
                              give as the cause of death traumatic asphyxia.
                              Thex’e was no evidence of any natural disease or
                              other* conditions w h i c h might have caused or
                              contributed to death.

                         Q. P r o f . Jones, it is true, is it not, as we have heard
                              in other cases, but just for the record, although it
                              m a y take three or four minutes before one actually
                              loses o n e ’s life in a traumatic asphyxia situation,
                              unconsciousness supervenes v e r y m uch more quickly? -
                              A. V e r y m u c h more quickly, yes.      The sequence of*
                              events w o u l d be that Andrew w o u l d have become
                              unconscious and the various changes that I have
                     D        described w o u l d all have occurred after that period
                              and he wo u l d not have k n o w n a n y thing about it at all.

                                    T H E CORONER:     Mr. Fraser?

                                   HR. FRASER:       Andre*»s fami l y have no questions,         sir,
                              thank y o u .
                     E                 PROF. J O N E S :     If they w o u l d like it I will speak
                              to them in private afterwards; if there are any
                              questions or doubts that they have in their minds I
                              w o u l d be v e r y h a p p y to try and resolve those.

                                   T H E CORONER:     Did you h e a r that? Mr. Jones has
                              offered if you w o u l d like to see him priv a t e l y when
                              the Inquest finishes.

                         Q. In fact, I t h i n k , Prof. Jones, you have indicated to
                            me that y o u are quite p r e p a r e d to do this for all the
                            cases that we have got this morning? - A. Yes.

                                    THE CORONER:   If that is so perhaps you can alert

                                 T H E WITNESS: Peter Gadsby, Detective Constable of
                            the West Midlands Police.

                         Q. Yes? - A. The circumstances r e l ating to this case are
                     B      that at about 0 9 2 0 hours on Saturday, 15th April, 1 9 8 9
                            Louise Brookes saw h e r brother, Andrew Brookes, leave
                            the family home i ntending to travel to Sheffield.
                            Mr. Brookes was k n o w n to have a ticket for the FA Cup
                            Semi Final football match at Hil l s b o r o u g h Stadium.

                            Mr. Mark Richards travelled b y car w i t h friends,
                            including A n d r e w Brookes, arriving in Sheffield at
                            about 11^5 hours.       T h e y vis i t e d a public house and
                            later w a l k e d to the stadium joining the crowd at the
                            Leppings Lane turnstiles at about 1^20 hours.              Mr.
                            Richards stayed w i t h Andr e w but the rest of their
                            party became separated due to the crowd.

                            E v e n t u a l l y Mr. Richards entered the stadium v i a a
                            turnstile wit h Andrew.          T h e y w a l k e d down the tunnel
                     D      b eneath the West Stand but h a d to stop at the entrance
                            to the Enclosure 3 because of the n u m b e r of people
                            there.          As they first entered the tunnel Mr. Richards
                            looked behi n d h i m and saw a crowd of people enter via
                            a large gate.           Mr. Richards was forced forwards into
                            Enclosure 3 b y a surge of pressure and became
                            sepjirated from Andrew.
                     E
                            F ollowing the severe crushing in the West Stand
                            terracing Mr. Br i a n Johnston, a sjjectator at the
                            match, saw a m a n n o w k n o w n to be Andrew, lying on
                            the pi t c h at the Leppings Lane end.       He assisted
                            another si>cctator, a Joseph Mitchell, and w i t h others,
                            i ncluding Police Constable 2 3 5 ^ Plumridge and Police
                            Constable I7 I8 Howell, carried h i m across the pitch
                            towards the Spion Ivop.        Mr. Johnston and Mr. Mitchell
                            attempted resusc i t a t i o n and they were joined by Police
                            Sergeant 5 3 6 Peter Walton.        In fact, Mr. J o h n s t o n ’s
                            re c o l lection is that this officer joined them earlier
                            but that is not, in fact, the case.

                            A doctor, who has not b een identified, initially
                            checked Mr. Brookes on the pitch and asked that
                            resusc i t a t i o n be continued. A short time later the
                            same d o ctor again checked Mr. Brookes and certified
                            that he was dead.

                            Police Sergeant W a l t o n was assisted b y Mr. Johnston
                            and Mr. Mitchell to carry A n d r e w into the gymnasium
                            where a temporary m o r t u a r y had been set u p . The
                            officer then left to assist other people.
                 H
                            Police Constable 1779 W i l l iamson was in the gymnasium
                            and was given resp o n s i b i l i t y for A n d r e w ’s body.

                               Between 1550 and 16 15 hours Dr. M atthew Bull examined
                               A n d r e w in the t emporary m o r t u a r y and certified that
                               life was extinct.

                               At 2255 hours Mr. John Harris identified the b o d y of
                               A n d r e w to Police Constable W i l l iamson in the temporary
                               mortuary.

                     B         The Officer later escorted the body of Andrew to the
                               Medico Legal Centre and confirmed the identification
                               to Detective Constable T/eigold.

                               On Sunday, 1 6 th April, 1989* f ollowing identification
                               b y Detective Constable Weigold, Prof. Jones carried
                               out an aut o p s y and submitted a report giving cause of
                               death.

                               Evidence is included regarding- the analysis of the
                               blood sample from A n d r e w where the presence of
                               ethanol was detected.       The w itnesses pro v i n g
                               continuity of the b l o o d sample are Philip Rich,
                               Detective Sergeant John T u r n e r and Detective
                               Sergeant James Fletcher.       Dr. Alex a n d e r Forrest
                               carried out the analysis.

                               for the m a t c h w h i c h tends to confirm that he entered
                               via a turnstile wh i c h is the evidence given b y Mr.
                               Richards.

                          Q. Thank you v e r y much.       I want to just turn you back for
                     ]£      a moment to p a r a g r a p h 3    the summary, and I am going
                             to refer you to pages 4— 5*         If you look at page 4,
                             first of all, this is the evidence of Mar k Richards.
                             He sa 3i
                                    rs that they arrived at 1420, nea r the b o t t o m of
                             the page about five lines up, w h i c h is in fact what
                             we have got in the summary, and then I think he says
                             that tho 3r did not a c t u a l ^ make their w a y straight
                             in.   He says:

                                         "At the ground we all w a l k e d completely
                                         around the s t a d i u m . "

                               That is right,    is it not? - A. Yes.

                          Q.    I think they w a l k e d round it because they had done it
                               the previous year and they just w a n t e d to do it again?
                     G         A. Yes.

                          Q. I do not k n o w h o w long it takes to wal k round the
                             stadium but it must have taken a few minutes.        The n

                          Q.   Yes, I am just going to tell you which line - line            14.
                               If you count the lines it will help you? - A. Yes.

                         0. And he says that the group got split up to a certain
                            extent and they decided to meet inside the ground
                            and he says it was about 2.55? ~ A. Yes, 14-55 •

                         Q. And, in fact, at that point he was just inside the
                            ground, was he not, so he had alrca d } ^    A. Yes,
                            they had made an arrangement to meet inside the ground
                            but as it was that late it goes on to say that they
                     B      decided not to wait  ---

                         Q. Yes, the original arrangement was to meet, they got
                            in through the turnstile at 2 . 5 5 and decided to go
                            straight down? — A. Yes, sir.

                         Q. A n d at that point A n d r e w was still w i t h him?   It is
                            the fourth line from the bottom? - A. Yes.

                         Q. The only other point is - I have not spotted this in
                            the summary - in p a r a g r a p h 5 of the summary we see
                            that the’ doctor certified Mr. Brookes' d e a t h . I think
                            what he actua l l y said was that he was dead but it
                            was not certified.         We tend to use the technical terms?
                            A. Yes.      He actually, it is ment i o n e d twice, that he
                            came over and i n itially said to carry on w ith the
                     D      resusc i t a t i o n but then obviousl}?- d ecided that it was
                            not of any use and said they should desist.

                         Qo I think what I will do is read you the little bit out
                            of Peter W a l t o n ’s statement w h i c h deals w ith this so
                            you can h ear e xactly what          happe n e d about that.    I
                            will read it.       It is part of Petei’ Walton's statement
                            of 26.5.89:
                     E
                                      "I then saw a male p e r s o n b e i n g carried over
                                      b y about eight fans and then plac e d to the
                                      ground.   The m a n appeared dead.        Hie face was
                                      purple.   A doctor came over and after feeling
                                      his pulse he indicated that we could, try to
                                      revive him.     One of the Liverpool fans did
                                      chest massage whilst I gave the kiss of life.
                                      We did this for quite a few minutes but I
                                      still considered that we were too late.
                                      The doctor returned and after checking the
                                      man he indicated that he was dead and that
                                      there was n o t h i n g further we cotild do."

                            A n d then he talks about other things but that is the
                     G      important bit.    Mr. Fraser?

                                 MR. FRASER:    The family have no questions, but
                            they etre grateful for that slight expanding of the
                            information.

                                   THE CORONER:    A n y questions? That is clear to
                            you,   is it not?   (No questions from the J u r y )

                            p e n a l t y area of the Leppings Lane end about to carry
                            Andrew on a hoarding.        That, sir, is referenced MAP 7,
                            and it is timed at 1530 s 1 ^ - s 19 • The Officer, together
                            w i t h supporters and PC Howell are shown on a n u m b e r of
                     D      photographs, i ncluding a f urther p h o t ograph SMRl/102
                            and that shows A n d r e w b e i n g carried on a h o a r d i n g
                            across the pitch.

                            B r i a n Johnston has identified h i m s e l f on a photograph,
                            reference D M R 2/7 and at this stage he is giving motith
                            to motith r e s uscitation to Andrew.          Sergeant Walton
                            has identified h i m s e l f on a ph o t o g r a p h wh i c h has been
                     E      given the reference JP3A/22 and at this stage he is
                            also de a l i n g w i t h Andrew.  The Officer has seen a
                            ph o t ograph of A n d r e w and he does identify h i m as the
                            man that he has referred to throughout in his s t a t e m e nts»

                            Sir, there is a slight amendment to the next paragraph
                            on y our summary.           If I can just m e n t i o n Mr. Richards
                            first.      Mr. Richards has identified a pers o n he
                            believes to be A n d r e w on a pho t o g r a p h w h i c h has been
                            given the reference PR1/10A.                   Sir, that is a p h o t ograph
                            of the terraces and is timed at 1 5 0 3 and, at the time
                            we saw Mr. Richards, it was an u n c o n f i r m e d identification.
                            Ve r y r e c ently Mrs. Brookes has k i n d l y agreed to see
                            that p a r t i c u l a r ph o t o g r a p h and, if I can jtist use h e r
                            words, it is a side vie w and it is a little difficult
                            to be sure but, to use h e r words, she is "9 8 ^ sure"
                            that, in fact, it does show Andrew.

                                  T H E CORONERS   Mrs. Brookes, y o u have done v e r y
                            well.     It is so difficult to do it.    Thank y o u ver y

                               wh i c h is 'a p lan of the pitch, there are a series of
                               at least five photographs, sir, w h i c h show basically,
                               as referred to in the svimmary, Andrew's progress, as
                      D        it were, across the pi t c h from the Leppings Lane end
                               to the Spion Itop end.      If I just refer to each
                               individv.ally: the first one, sir, is in this area h e r e ;
                               the second one h e r e ; a ftirther ph o t o g r a p h here and

                      E              T H E CORONER:       Mr. Fraser?

                                     MR. FRASER:         No q u e s t i o n s , sir,    thank you.

                                    T H E CORONER:     A n y questions?    (No questions from
                               the J u r y ) Thank you v e r y much indeed.

                                    That is all the evidence we are going to take at
                               this stage.

                                         Mr. and Mrs. Brookes, it is      v e r y h ard to kno w what
                               to say in a situation like this.             Y o u have sat and
                               he a r d and we have talked about photographs and spots
                               011 the plans and who was who and y o u m a y think, well,
                               what is the point?         To a certain extent y o u are right
                               because the only real point is that y o u have lost
                               y o u r lad and I wo u l d like y o u to   k n o w that although
                               we have to do what we are doing, the truth               of the
                               m a t t e r is that it is a v e r y personal thing and I
                               wo u l d like y o u to k n o w that I realise tliato       Thank
                               yoti for coming.

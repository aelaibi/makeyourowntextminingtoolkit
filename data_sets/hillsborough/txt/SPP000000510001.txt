Further to my letter to you of 19 November, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has asked me to let you
know that we now have a print from the police HOLMES computer system of the statements
by Roger Houldsworth dated 28 April 1989 and 27 May 1989. I attach copies.

2.     My earlier letter said that we have a copy of the HOLMES printout of the statement
by Dr Ed Walker of 20 July 1989. It asked whether there was anything you wished to add to
what you told the Judge at our meeting (transcript page 22 et seq).

3.     Similarly, is there anything else you would like to say about the position in respect of
Houldsworth given that we have now traced these HOLMES versions of his statements (see
especially transcript pages 10 and 26)?

4.     We look forward to hearing from you.

      turnstiles             were       completely               empty,          they         started          to    go    straight             in the

     Ground,         through            the       turnstile.

     While        they were             going          into      the    Ground            I saw a minibus                      pull       up w i t h a

      number       of P o l i c e        Officers               in.     They         got       out       and      one     of    the       Officers

      started        to      shut       all       of    the      turnstiles,                  which       were       then       shut.            .1. d o n ’t

      know    the       exact        t im e       but     there        was       a big         roar       from       the       crowd       in the

     Ground        and       I believe             that         would       hav e        been       for     kick-off.

still         arriving           at    the      g at e s .

As    I stood            talking          to    t ha t     man,      people          started           coming        out       of     the

Ground         and       I heard          them       say     that     something                wa s     w r o n g in the            Ground.

Just      prior          to    that,        I had        seen 3 - 4              people       come       out        of the          Ground,

limping.              They       sat      by    the      external           fencing.              I saw a P o l i c e m a n

carrying            a man        out      to a n a m b u l a n c e          t h at     was     parked outside                     the gate

that      had       been       opened.            I saw       the     Policeman              rushing          ab o u t ,       trying        to

help      the       man.

A    f ir e    engine          arrived          at     the    Ground          and      I realised             that         something          had

happened            in the          Ground.            People        came        out    of    the       Ground           and      I heard

them      sa y      that       people          had     been       killed         in the       Ground.

Small         groups          of L i v e r p o o l       supporters              were    coming          out        of     the      Ground        and

some      were        threatening               Policemen            outside           the    Ground.               They were             saying

things         like,          " T h e r e ’s g o i n g       to    be a       riot".

The      man     I was         with       had. a       radio       and      it    said       n o t h i n g on t h e r e             about     w hat

w a s ha ppeni n g in the                      G ro u n d .

I could          see      that        the      supporters            were        angry       so    I made           my w a y        to m y    car,

and      then       on    to m y m o t h e r ’s w h o              l iv e s      in S h e f f i e l d .         When         I got        there       I

saw      on T.V.          that        people         had      been    k i l l e d at         the G r o u n d .             I decided          to

go    b a ck     to      t ry a n d       find my          f ri e n d s .

I stood          on H o m e s         Lane      for      about       £0 m i n u t e s        waiting          for        them,        but    t he y

never         arrived.              I l a te r       met     them     up      by the           Pump       pub.           I n e v er

stopping            them       or     helping          them.         I would           guess       he was           trying          to    stop

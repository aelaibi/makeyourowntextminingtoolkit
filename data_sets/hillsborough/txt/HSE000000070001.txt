1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Following an incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
    Football Club's (SWFC) Hillsborough Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
    request of Mr M S Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
    Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
    Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the HSE team
    investigating the incident following correspondence between the Court of
    Inquiry and the then Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hammer.

1.2 The HSE's Research and Laboratory Services Division (RLSD) consists of
    3 laboratories, one of which, the Safety Engineering Laboratory (SEL), is
    based in Sheffield. As a Deputy Director in the Sheffield Laboratory, I
    was able to assemble a team of scientists and engineers from various
    specialist sections to tackle the various technical problems which arose.
    I was also assisted by members of HSE's Technology Division in much of the
    on site investigation at the Hillsborough ground. They produced site
    reports, which are reproduced in the Annexe, and which have been utilised
    by HSE staff throughout this investigation.

  In considering collapse load calculations of barrier 124A, Professor
  R A Smith of the University of Sheffield Department of Mechanical and
  Process Engineering, acted as a consultant and in conjunction with RLSD
  staff produced a report on this topic.

1.3 A few days after the incident, the West Midlands Police were appointed to
    assist the Inquiry and all the initial stages of the investigation were
    carried out in close collaboration with ACC M Jones of the West Midlands
    Police. When the Inquiry assessors were appointed, the direction of
    technical aspects of the investigation was then planned with Professor
    L Maunder of the University of Newcastle Department of Mechanical
    Engineering, but still in collaboration with ACC Jones.

1.4 A summary report of HSE's findings "The Hillsborough Incident
    15 April 1989: An Investigation into Various Technical Aspects prepared
    for the Court of Inquiry" by C E Nicholson, Report No n y L/ME/Mty/89/1 was
    written and presented to the Court of Inquiry in June 1989.

1.5 This compendium of reports contains details of examinations performed on
    site and in the laboratory. The work was carried out by me, by other
    staff of HSE and by the consultant Professor Smith, working on my
    instructions and under my general supervision.

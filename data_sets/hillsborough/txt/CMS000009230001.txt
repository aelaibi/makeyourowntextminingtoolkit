#           Dear

            Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which has
            been passed to this department in view of our responsibilities for
            the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay in
            replying to you.

            Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there is
            no single solution to achieve crowd safety and cure all the
            problems of crowd control. However, he was satisfied that seating
            does more to achieve these objectives than any other single
            measure.  He also considered that moving to all seated
            accommodation was consistent with the policies of both FIFA and
            UEFA.

            I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish to
            stand at football matches. However, Lord Justice Taylor said in
            his Final Report:

             I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces is
            wholly lost when fans are seated.... The communal spirit is still
            there and finds ready expression. To such extent as the seating
            limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is surely
            worth paying for the benefits in safety and control."

            This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.

            Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be possible for
            clubs to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to
            the pockets of those presently paying to stand. He pointed to
            Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which he did not
            consider to be a prohibitive price or differential.  Therefore, the
            fears of many spectators that they may no longer be able to afford
            to attend football matches may be unnecessary.

                                                               Yours sincerely


                                                                      ~      5   4    u    L

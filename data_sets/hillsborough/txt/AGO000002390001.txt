ATTORNEY GENERAL
c.c. Solicitor General


You will recall that earlier this year your predecessor met Mr

Gerald Howarth MP and Mr Peter Kilfoyle MP to receive represenÂ­

tations     about     legal   issues      arising   from   the    Hillsborough

disaster.       In particular, there was disquiet about the handling

by the Coroner of the inquest and the verdicts which followed.



We were told that Counsel had been instructed by a Hillsborough

pressure group to prepare a formal application under section 13

of the Coroners Act 1988 for consent to an application to the

High Court for an order directing that a fresh inquest be held.

That application has now been received.                It relates to six of

those who died and the documentation is substantial.                     It will

require     considerable       analysis      and    possibly     some    further

inquiries;      a submission will be put up as soon as possible.



The   purpose    of   this    note   is   simply to    inform you       that   the

application has been received in view of the interest generated

by anything associated with the Hillsborough disaster.                  The line

we propose to take in respect of press inquiries is simply to

confirm that an application has been received and that it is

under consideration.          We do not envisage any further comment at

this stage.

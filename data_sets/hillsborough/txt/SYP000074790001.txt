              On S a t u r d a y    15 April    1989    (150489)     I a t t e n d e d the F A Cup S^rni-Final

              ground,      Sheffield.

              I went      to the m atch w ith my friend                                        . We t ra velled on a

              mini      bus a rr an ge d by friends.         We started/off              for the m atch about

              quarter      to eleven        in the morning        ( 104\^.      We went        via the Snake Pass.

              The      ticket      I had got was       for the L ep pings Ln standing area w h ic h had

              been a l l o c a t e d to Liverpool         fans.

              We a r r i v e d     in S h e f fi el d at about    ten past       one      in the a f t e rn oo n    (1310)

              and      parked the mini         bus and went       for something            to e a t . After      getting

              s omething to eat we wa lk ed towards                  the ground.           On the way we tried to

              find a pub open for a drink                 but all      the   pubs were             either   closed or

              pa c k e d full.

     We bought         some   cans from      an <

     In fact         she gave   us a bin liner to            put our       empties      in,

     At a bout         twenty past      two (1420) j » b w al ke d to the ground and                    got    into

     building         up and the    s t f e / n , was p a c k e d .

     When we were outside              the turnstiles          there was a whole mass                  of people

     and no queues.           W e slowly made        our way towards            thjr terrace          turnstiles,

     I can remember           seeing    three moun te d Police G f ^ c e r s             in the        crowd,         i‘

     seemed that         there was      nowhere      for them t)

     Wh en    I got to the turnstile             entrance,        because       of the     crowd,       my ar m was

     caught by the wall            next to the turnstile                entrance.       Someone        pushed the

     crowd back for me and              I m a n ag ed to pull my arm             in the turnstile.                I

     gave     part of my ticket          in and walked           into the ground.             Whe n    I got      in

     the g round P o l i ce me n were         searching        some     fans,    but    I w a s n ’t s e a r c h e d .I

     could see a tunnel            in the middle          of the       stand.    It seemed        like all            the

     crowd was         going thrjKigh this         tunnel.       I w al k ed w it h the        rest     of the

     crowd t hrough thy€ t u n n e 1. When              I came to the end of the tunnel                        I went

     ,o my     r/ght. TVere        didn't     seem any       problems at this            time and        I took up

     my f i p / i l i o n about half way down the terrace.

     At about        five to three       (1455)      I n o t i c e d a susgj^of         people w hi c h        pushed

     me fo rw ar d about        two feet a way from the fence at the front                             of the

     terrace.

     The     crush then s eemed to get y / f r se and                 I thought    that       I must     get      to

     the side          of the terrace         o/fl of the crush.          I got to the side             really

     w it h the flow of the\yrowd.

     The     crush seemed to get worse and                  I remember        hearj/hg a young           giri

     s houting         for help,       I looked around me             and saw a/young w o m a n ,she had

     jjjond hair,        I think she was           wearing a red tejr shirt and                 red      jacket or

     cardigan.         At this time a man about & ”3, a big fellow just                               cracked up

            and st ar ted -Flailing his arms about.                             He was about         four feet       in front

            of me,             I    remember       one of his arms        hitting    me..      It     was the    back of      his

            hand that               hit me.       It was also about          this time       I saw a        middle a ged man

            with a grey b e a r d . His                   face was     purple and on one             side,    his    tongue was

c<sVN?VlC^ /,"hang i ng out.              I thought       he was dead,, but        because      of the

            crowd he could not                     fall    over.

        CJ* 'ihe pressure                 of the    crowd never        eased off,       I    could hear         people

            * rr,us*' have               been near to some side              railings and somehow             I got over

             h   e   s   e   r a ilings and onto the             pitch.

            E a r l ie r w hen            I had been       in the     crush near to the             front    of the fence          by

            the          pitch someone was             on the      pitch and he was           reaching over the

            fence to                help people       get out.      I remember grabbing               his shirt     sleeve    to

            get          out,       but his     sleeve was         ripped away.

            W he n           I had finally got out of the                 crush and got out onto the                 pitch, I

            was          looking for other             people from the/mini             bus.    After a time         I saw the

            same young woman who was                         in the    crj/sh a sk in g J o r       help.    She was     lying

            on the             pitch and was          o bviously cread, ^        ✓ \jL&

            I remember                  seeing a young P o W e e w o m a n        on the      pitch. She was        sucking

            her          leather         gloves,    she was obv io us ly           in shock.

            I also             remember a P o l i c e m a n with        leather     on who must         have      been a

            traffic Policeman.                     He was     trying    to    put me back       in the terraces            just

            before             I left the ground at about                 ten      to four     (1550)       I saw a man       pick

            a camera up from the floor.                          1 d o n ’t know     whether         it was his     or he was

            just             collecting       stuff    up,    I thought / t       w asn't     right and I don't know

            why          but       I just butted him with my/nead.                 T hen     some Police         came and I
                                    ^
            told them to search him,                         w h \ c h y t h e y did ana he was       put back       in the

            terrace area,                   I d o n ’t think he was          stealing       things,    he was       probably in

            shock,             like      I was.

            I then h elped other                     people    gather     scarves a^d glasses                     clothing a n d
                                                                                                         P AGfc   4
                                                                                                         Si 905

             piling the       stuff    up behind the goal.

             I went     back on the      terrace and was with my group.                We just sat on the

             t erraces      for a while,     about    twenty minutes.       We then went        to the back

             of the stand.       I can remember a large           concertina gate being           closed and

             only a small       gate   open to    let    people o u t . Whe n    I got out of the ground

             most    the houses and shops         had JKrieir doors      open,    so people      could

             use the t elephones        to   ring^Tome.

             D uring    the disaster      I received bruised        ribs.    I did not a tt e n d hospital,

             I can remember that V h e          m id d l e - a g e d man wit h the grey beard was

             w ea ri ng a grey striped s h i r t .

             I d es c ri b ed a man who      tried to      pull me out    of the       crowd,   the man whose

             shirt     sleeve   I ripped off.        This was    just after      the   kick off.    I

             saw this man       put back     into the      crowd by the Police.

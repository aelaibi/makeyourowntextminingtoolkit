KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS (DECEASED)
APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 13(IHB) OF THE CORONERS ACT 1 9 8 8

T his is a n application by Anne Williams, th e m o th er of th e deceased, for your
co n sen t to a n application u n d e r section 13(l)(b) of th e C oroners Act 1988 on
th e gro u n d s of a n insufficiency of inquiry a n d th e discovery of new facts or
evidence.

I RECOMMEND YOU REFUSE THIS APPLICATION.

The letter of application is a t Flag 1 a n d th e M emorial is a t Flag 2. The latter
is su p p o rted by th e docu m en tatio n a t Tabs A - K.

Background

Kevin W illiams w as one of th e 95 people who died a t H illsborough S tad iu m on
15 April 19 8 9 .1 A ttached is a chronology of previous applicatio ns by Mrs
W illiams u n d e r section 13 w ith su c h inform ation a s is now available from LSLO
files ab o u t th o se earlier applications (neither th e F ebru ary 1992 application
n o r th a t in M arch 1996 are on th e designated H illsborough files so I have relied
u p o n su m m aries thereof), together w ith details of th e o th er investigations
arising o u t of th e events of 15 April 1989. M rs W illiams m ade two applications
in 1992 a n d a th ird in 1996, all of w hich have been rejected by your
predecessors.

The A pplication

C entral to th is application is th e com plaint th a t th ere h a s been no in d ep en d en t
public investigation of th e resp o n se of th e em ergency services on 15 April 1989.
The m em orialist believes th a t h e r son could have been saved if he h a d received
em ergency a ssista n c e a t a n earlier stage: th is is n o t borne o u t by th e evidence
given a t th e Inquest, approved in th e Divisional C ourt or th e findings of Lord
J u s tic e S tu a rt-S m ith ’s Scrutiny. The Coroner, su p p o rted by th e Divisional
C ourt in ex p arte Stringer, (R v HM Coroner fo r South Yorkshire e x p a rte Stringer


1 Tony Bland died in April 1992.

 an d Others [1994] COD 176 DC (at Tab I to th is application)) h a d concluded
 th a t all th o se involved were dead, or beyond saving w hen th e em ergency
 services arrived an d it w as th u s in ap p ro priate to investigate th e reactio n s of
 am b u lan ce or m edical services (or th eir d isa ster planning) a s p a rt of th e issu e
 of “h o u f th e v ariou s deceased cam e by th eir d eaths. Similarly, Lord Ju stic e
 S tu a rt-S m ith rejected th e suggestion th a t th e C oroner could be criticised for
 selecting 3.15 pm a s th e cut-off point for h is investigations b e cau se it w as
 wholly u n n e c e ssa ry for th e p u rp o se of answ ering how th e deceased m et th eir
 d eath s, nam ely by c ru sh or trau m atic asphyxiation. An inquiry into the
 respo n se of th e em ergency services w hich arrived a t a b o u t th is point therefore
 w ould ad d nothing. As to a fu rth er investigation of th is aspect, S tu art-S m ith
 LJ concluded th a t it h a d been exhaustively investigated by Lord Taylor a n d it
 w ould be im possible to say w h eth er individuals w ould have survived if more
 sophisticated or com petent aid h a d reach ed him or h e r a t som e unspecified
 earlier m om ent: th e additional b u rd e n s th a t su c h a n inquiry w ould im pose
 u p o n th e police, em ergency services an d th e h o sp ital a n d m edical staff would
 be to no purpose.

 Mrs W illiams now suggests th a t th is failure to investigate a m o u n ts to a b reach
,-o^the p rocedural obligation u n d e r Article 2 of th e ECHR (the Convention).
KSo ,
    far a s th e ordinary principles governing applications u n d e r section 13 are
 concerned, th ere is n o th in g in the m aterial now p resen te d w hich is new or
 additional to th a t w hich h a s been considered an d rejected by y o u r
 p red ecesso rs (see th e a tta c h e d chronology), save for th e letter d ated 15
 November 2002 from Dr Cary a t Tab K.

 The fresh e v id en ce o f Dr Cary

 Dr S later w as th e pathologist who gave evidence a t th e In q u est a b o u t th e cause
 of Kevin W illiam s’ death. His evidence w as th a t w hen Kevin W illiams w as
 found by Mr B ru d er he h a d already suffered irreversible b rain dam age arising
 from asphyxia due to c ru s h injuries to his neck an d c h est an d th a t h e w as
 beyond help. He h a d been u n co n scio u s w hen tak e n from th e p en onto the
 pitch w here Mr B rud er saw him a n d it w as Dr G u m p ert’s view th a t b rain stem
 d eath h a d occurred a t betw een four an d six m in u te s after th e deprivation of
 oxygen a n d th a t it w as inevitable a t th a t stage th a t he w ould die. Dr G um bert
 w as a con su ltin g clinical n eu ro physiologist who gave evidence a t th e Inquest.

 In h is letter Dr Cary refers to th e views expressed by Dr W est a n d Dr B u rn s (at
 Tabs E an d F respectively): th e evidence of Dr W est a n d Dr B u rn s h a s been
 rejected by yo u r pred ecesso rs a s too speculative to w a rra n t a fu rth e r inquest.
 The letter of Dr W est d ated 29 O ctober 1993 w as before th e Divisional C ourt in
 th e jud icial review proceedings in 1993 who found it far too te n u o u s to justify
 th e ordering of a new in qu est. Dr Cary sta te s th a t th e ap p ro p riate cau se of
 d eath for Kevin W illiams should have been given a s “com pression of th e neck ”
»

    ra th e r th a n “tra u m a tic asph y x ia”. Following th e injury to Kevin W illiam s’ neck,
    Dr Cary seem s to accept th a t th ere w ould have been a degree of hypoxic b rain
    dam age a n d th a t th e ch an ces of liis receiving a lifesaving tracheotom y or
    cricothryoidectom y in th e required tim e2 w ould have been slim b u t th a t oth er
    m ea su re s su c h a s th e ad m in istratio n of oxygen an d p a ssin g of a n en dotracheal
    tu b e could have h a d som e u sefu l effect a n d m ight have prevented cardiac
    arrest. This evidence, like th a t of Dr W est a n d Dr B u rn s, is highly speculative
    an d it seem s clear th a t in any event Kevin W illiams w as dead by th e tim e he
    reached th e tem p o rary m o rtu ary in th e gym a t th e H illsborough G round. At
    th is remove you w ould be entitled to conclude th a t th e w eight to be a tta ch e d to
    th is evidence is n o t su c h th a t it w ould outw eigh th e public in te re st
    consid eratio n s a g ain st a new in q u est w hich could serve no u sefu l p u rp o se a t
    th is remove from th e events to w hich it relates a n d after th e exhaustive
    investigations w hich have been conducted. There is no reaso n ab le prospect
    th a t a n application to th e High C ourt on th is ground w ould succeed.

    The evidence of J o h n E dw ards w as considered in M rs W illiam s’ application in
    1996 a n d by Lord Ju s tic e S tu a rt-S m ith in his S cru tiny (see th e a tta ch e d
    chronology): it corroborates th e evidence of Mr B ru der th a t Kevin W illiams w as
    possibly still alive a t 3 . 15pm b u t does n o t alter th e fact th a t he w as dead w hen
    Mr B ru d er left him . This evidence w ould be unlikely to have affected the
    in q u est verdict.

    So far a s th e evidence of Mr Flack an d Mr Howes is concerned (referred to at
    p a ra g ra p h s 56 a n d 57 of th e Memorial - no copies of th e sta te m e n ts have been
    provided), th e im pact of th e em ergency resp o n se w as n o t relevant in th e
    context of “how” th e deceased died: th e evidence is th a t he w as beyond help by
    th e tim e he h a d been ta k e n from th e pen or very shortly thereafter.

Sir M artin N ourse agreed w ith th e ju d g m e n ts of b o th B uxton LJ a n d Sedley LJ.

B uxton L J’s reaso n in g is difficult to follow: w here th e d e ath o ccu rs before th e

The agreem ent of Sir M artin Nourse w ith b o th h is learn ed colleagues would

       D iscu ssio n

N      H urst is a difficult a n d controversial decision b u t for th e re a so n s expanded

 1     in q u est into a pre-HRA d e ath h a s been concluded. In oth er w ords it would be
  1    entirely in co n siste n t w ith th e reaso n ing in th e H ouse of Lords in McKerr to
  1    require th e Law Officers to read section 13 of th e C oroners Act 1988 as
   |   m an d atin g a n application to th e High C ourt w here it c an be show n th a t a n old
   1   investigation w as n o t Article 2 com pliant.

       If section 3 HRA im ports a n obligation retrospectively to give effect to
       in tern atio n al law obligations previously only enforceable in th e ECtHR, th e n
       th e logical consequence so far a s section 13 is concerned w ould be th a t the
       section w ould have to be in terp reted a s im posing a n obligation u p o n th e Law
       Officers to give co n sen t in every case w here a n in q u e st h a s b een held w hich
       w as n o n-com pliant w ith th e p rocedural obligations u n d e r Article 2, w henever it
       h a d been held. This w ould resu lt in th e ano m alou s situ atio n w here th e High
       C ourt on a n application u n d e r section 13 w ould n ecessarily be com pelled to
       reject th e application in th e light of McKern it can n o t be correct th a t you
       w ould be obliged to c o n sen t to a n application on a gro u n d w hich th e High
       C ourt w ould be d u ty b o u n d to reject.

       Even if th is an aly sis is incorrect a n d th ere is a co n tin u in g d u ty to hold an

Background      8s   Chronology

Lord Taylor’s Inquiry

On 17 April 1989 Lord Ju s tic e Taylor w as appointed to c o n d u ct a n inquiry.
W est M idlands Police were in stru cte d to investigate th e d isa ste r for the
p u rp o ses of th a t Inquiry.

In h is interim repo rt p u b lish ed on 4 A ugust 1989, Lord Taylor found th a t the
d isa ster h a d a n u m b e r of cau ses. He did n o t a ttrib u te all th e blam e to a single
cau se or person, b u t in p a ra g ra p h 278 h e m ade clear th at:

       “The m ain reason fo r the d isa ster w a s the failure o f police control?.

Lord Taylor also considered th e resp o n se of th e E m ergency Services an d
concluded th at:

       “No valid criticism can be m ade o f the response by the S t John Am bulance
       Brigade, b y South Yorkshire Metropolitan A m bulance Service or b y the fire
       brigade..." (paragraph 296)

Lord Taylor m ade 43 im m ediate recom m endations. His final rep o rt in J a n u a ry
1990 m ade a fu rth e r 76 recom m endations. The im provem ents w hich have
tak e n place since th e n in safety a t football gro u n d s a n d in th e policing of
football m atc h es have been b ased largely on th ose recom m endations.

W est M idlands P olice In vestig a tio n su pervised by th e P olice C om plaints
A uthority

A fu rth er investigation w as conducted by th e W est M idlands Police, supervised
by th e Police C om plaints A uthority, to estab lish w h eth er th ere were any
g ro u n d s for crim inal proceedings a n d to consider w h eth er any police officer
should be su b ject to disciplinary proceedings.

On 11 Ju ly 1990 th e PCA directed th a t disciplinary ch arg es of neglect of duty
be preferred ag ain st Chief S u p t Duckenfield a n d S u p t M urray, th e form er being
in overall control of police operations on th e day a n d th e la tte r being in control
of o perations a t th e ground. Chief S u p e rin te n d en t D uckenfield retired on the
gro u n d s of ill h e alth a n d th e Police C om plaints A uthority th e n concluded th a t
th e disciplinary proceedings a g ain st th e S u p e rin te n d en t sh o u ld be w ithdraw n
since w hat h a d in effect been a jo in t allegation of neglect of d u ty could n o t be
fairly h e ard in th e ab sen ce of a m ore senior officer. At th e end of th e PCA
supervised investigation th e evidence w as se n t to th e DPP who decided in the
a u tu m n of 1990 th a t no p erso n should be su b ject to crim inal proceedings.



                                               11
The In qu ests

In q u ests on th e deceased were formally opened on or a b o u t 18 April 1989 an d
th e n adjourned. Between 18 April 1989 a n d 4 May 1990 th e C oroner held a
series o f “mini inqu ests” covering th e sta tu to ry q u estio n s a s to who each of the
deceased w as a n d w hen or w here h e or she died. T h at evidence w as h e ard by
th e jury.

D uring th e m ini in q u e sts th e Coroner took evidence from th e pathologist an d
th e balance of th e rem aining evidence in two p arts. First, a su m m ary w as
received from a police officer of th e evidence of eye w itn esses a s to the
m ovem ent of th e deceased on th e day of th e disaster, th e sightings m ade of
th em a t th e tim e of th e fatal cru sh , th e finding of th eir bodies on th e pitch, any
atte m p ts a t resu sc ita tio n m ade, th e tak in g of th eir bodies to th e tem porary
m o rtu ary in th e gym a n d th e certification of d eath. The C oroner took no direct
oral evidence. Second, a police officer took th e ju ry th ro u g h all th e
do cu m en tary evidence relating to th e individual su c h a s sightings of th em on        «
p h o to g raph s a n d videos recovered from th e m edia p lu s positions m ark ed on
p lan s by th e v arious w itnesses.

The In q u ests were th e n ad jou rn ed pending th e decision of th e DPP ab o u t any
crim inal p rosecutions. In Septem ber 1990 th e C oroner w as inform ed th a t th e
DPP h a d concluded th a t th ere should be no crim inal p ro secu tio n s a n d on 19
November 1990 th e In q u ests were resu m ed a n d evidence relating to th e
incident a s a whole w as h e ard to determ ine how each of th e deceased died.

At th e beginning of th e m ain In q u est th e C oroner ru led th a t th ere sh o u ld be a
c u t off tim e of 3.15 pm for th e inquiry b ecau se he considered th a t by th a t tim e
th o se who died h a d received th e injuries w hich c au se d th eir d eath s. There w as
no evidence th a t th o se who died did so from any c au se o th er th a n c ru sh or
trau m atic asphyxia a s a re su lt of being c ru sh ed in th e pens. A lthough th e
deceased were n o t all dead by 3.15 pm , th e injuries from w hich they died h a d
been inflicted by th a t time; th e p ath o lo g ists’ evidence w as th a t irreversible
b rain dam age w ould have occurred a t betw een four a n d six m in u te s after
resp iratio n could no longer tak e place b ecau se th e c h e sts of th e deceased were
in a sta te of p e rm a n e n t fixation a s a resu lt of th e c ru sh .

On 28 M arch 1991 th e ju ry retu rn e d verdicts of accidental d e a th in all 95

Mrs W illiam s’ first se c tio n 13 app lication

Mrs W illiam s’ first application w as refused by th e th e n A ttorney G eneral, Sir

th e door open for reconsideration on th e b a sis of a properly prep ared

IN Q /4 /9 2 , I have been u n a b le to locate th ose p ap ers on th e file.

Mrs W illiam s’ se co n d se c tio n 13 app lication

The application w as renew ed in April 1992: th a t application w as b ased on,
in te r alia, fresh evidence in th e form of sta te m e n ts from PC B ru d er (Tabs B 85
C) an d form er Special C onstable M artin (Tabs A 85 D) an d a letter from th e
d eceased ’s GP, Dr Crosby. T hat application w as refused on 18 A ugust 1992,
by th e th e n Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, in co n su ltatio n w ith th e th en
Solicitor G eneral, Sir D erek Spencer, on th e b asis th a t a n application “would
have no reason able pro sp ect of estab lish in g th a t it w as n e cessary or desirable
in th e in te re sts of ju stic e for a fresh in q u est to be h eld”.

It h a s been accepted, certainly since th e second application in 1992, th a t it
w as arguable th a t th e C oroner’s decision to h e a r evidence otherw ise th a n in

irregularity b u t th a t in th e overall context of th e proceedings w hich h a d tak en

into th e actio n s of th e police on 15 April 1989, th a t no p u rp o se would be
served in gran ting c o n sen t to enable th e ap p lican t to apply to th e High C ourt
for a n o th e r in q uest. This m atter w as considered in th e JR proceedings (see

    So far a s Kevin W illiams w as concerned, th e C ourt found th a t th e C oroner h ad
    m ade a full enquiry a n d th a t th ere w as overwhelm ing evidence th a t the
    deceased w as dead by 3.15 pm on 15 April 1989: th e cru cial point w as th a t
    th e extent of th e dam age cau sed to th e deceased by th e cru sh in g w ould by 3.15
    pm have been su c h on th e m edical evidence th a t d e a th eith er h a d occurred or
    w as by th a t stage inevitable. The C ourt said th a t th e C oroner h a d c u t off th e
    evidence a t a reaso n ab le a n d su sta in ab le point a n d rejected th e gro u n d s
    advanced on b eh alf of th e ap p lican ts th a t th e C oroner h a d wrongly lim ited th e

    calling th e em ergency services sooner or providing b e tte r em ergency care of the
    in ju red on th e b asis th a t th e q uestio ns were n o t relevant to inquiry into how -
    by w h at m ea n s - th e deceased h a d come by th eir d eath s.

    The C ourt h a d in its p o ssessio n th e sta te m e n ts of PC B ru d er a n d form er
    Special C onstable D eborah M artin together w ith a letter from Dr Iain W est
    dated 29 O ctober 1993 (Tab E) w hich criticised th e evidence of Dr Slater th e
    pathologist who gave evidence b o th a t th e m ini in q u est into Kevin W illiam s’

    realistic p rosp ect th a t Kevin Williams w as alive after 3.15 pm a n d th a t he could
    have been saved. A lthough th e Divisional C ourt held th a t Dr W est’s evidence
    could found a n application u n d e r section 13, they were scath in g ab o u t th a t
    evidence a n d m ade it clear th a t it w as far too te n u o u s to w a rra n t th e ordering
    of a fresh in q u est. The C ourt held th a t a verdict of “lack of care” would not
    have been appropriate. The C ourt also sta te d th a t if any of th e g ro u n d s h ad
    been m ade o u t it would n o t have exercised its discretion to order a fresh
    inquest: if th e pu rp o se of a fresh in q u est w as to ob tain a n exam ination of the

    em p h asised th a t four a n d a h a lf y ears h a d p a sse d since 15 April 1989 a n d th a t
    it would be w rong to a s k w itn esses to com e along five y ears la te r a n d to try to

    no appeal from th is decision.

Lord J u stic e S tu art-S m ith ’s S cru tin y

Following a G ran ad a television program m e b ro ad c a st on 5 D ecem ber 1996, the
th e n Home Secretary, th e Rt Hon J a c k Straw MP, a n n o u n ce d in J u n e 1997

w h ether it revealed an y evidence w hich h a d n o t already been considered either
by th e Home Secretary, th e Attorney G eneral or th e DPP in relation to th eir

                                                15
C oroner’s decision no t to have a w ide-ranging enquiry into th e resp o n se of the
em ergency services or a cut-off point into th e inquiry a s to how th e deceased
cam e by th eir d eath (paragraph 68) b ecau se it w as wholly u n n e c e ssa ry for the
pu rp o se of answ ering how th e deceased m et th eir d e ath s, nam ely by c ru s h or
trau m atic asphyxiation.

On th e q u estio n of w h eth er th ere sh o u ld be a fresh ju d icial inquiry into the
respo n se of th e police a n d th e em ergency services, th is too w as rejected by
S tu a rt-S m ith LJ on th e b asis th a t it h a d been extensively in q u ired into by Lord
Taylor (paragraph 77). At p a ra g ra p h 82 he said:

        “Lord Taylor’s Inquiry considered a t length the questions o f w hen
 am bulances w ere sum m oned, w h y th ey w ere not sum m on ed earlier, w h en the
 major accident p la n w a s p u t into effect a n d w h y it w a s not done earlier. This
 involved the evidence o f the police officers w ho had been in the control box and
 SYM AS p ersonnel at H eadquarters. The question o f w h y there w a s no request
fo r doctors a n d n u rses to attend the injured until late on w a s dea lt with, together
w ith the im pact on casualties. ”

Lord Taylor dealt w ith th e rescu e operation in C h ap ter 5 of h is Interim Report.
At p a ra g ra p h 89 he said:

       “Those capable o f survival m ostly cam e round o f their ow n accord.            The
rest w ere m ostly doom ed before th ey could be brought out a nd treated. ”

He found th a t no req u est for help w as b ro ad c a st to doctors a n d n u rs e s in the
crowd u n til a b o u t 3 .29pm w hen it w as too late. Little could be achieved in
m ost cases b u t th ere were m arginal cases w here earlier a tte n tio n m ight have
m ade a difference. Lord Taylor concluded:

       “I fin d th a t all three o f the em ergency services [St Jo h n Am bulance
Brigade, SYM AS a nd the fire brigade] responded prom ptly w h e n alerted, that
th ey brought appropriate equipm ent an d th a t their p ersonnel operated efficiently”
(paragraph 297 of th e Interim Report).

S tu a rt-S m ith LJ concluded th a t no u sefu l p u rp o se w ould be served by having
any fu rth er inquiry into th e rescue o p erations “even if som e am b u lan ce m en,
notably Mr E dw ards, feel th a t they or th e service generally could have done
m ore in spite of th e very difficult conditions” a n d no ted further:

        “It w ould clearly be im possible to sa y about a n y given victim o f the
d isa ster th a t i f more sophisticated or com petent aid had reached him or her at
som e unspecified earlier moment, th ey w ould have su rvived "(paragraph 104)




                                             16
The additional b u rd e n s th a t su c h a n inquiry w ould im pose u p o n th e police,
em ergency services a n d th e hospital an d m edical staff w ould be to no p u rp o se
(paragraph 103).

In p articu lar, in relation to Kevin Williams, h e concluded th a t th ere w as no
im proper a tte m p t by W est M idlands police to affect th e evidence of Mr B ruder
or Miss M artin6 w hich w as a t variance w ith th e evidence given by th e
pathologist Dr S later th a t Kevin W illiams h a d died quickly b ecau se of four

above) a n d a tte m p ts con tin u ed to revive him w itho u t su c ce ss u n til th e St

said th a t Kevin h a d stopped b reath in g w hilst he w as in th e gym nasium b u t
th a t sh e gave him th e k iss of life a n d h e a rt m assag e a n d a doctor helped. Her
evidence w as th a t h e sta rte d b reath in g opened h is eyes a n d said “Mom” an d
th e n died. He w as confirm ed dead a t 4.06 pm. Dr Slater said on 2 May 1990
to th e C oroner d u rin g th e course of th e In q u est in to Kevin’s d e a th th a t he
th o u g h t Mr B rud er w as m istak en in believing he h a d found a pulse. So far as
Miss M artin’s sta te m en t w as concerned th ere w as no way in w hich som eone
w ith su c h a severe in ju ry to h is voice box could h a d said “Mom”. The C oroner
ad jou rn ed th e Inquest.

In a later sta te m e n t Mr B ruder said th a t h e m ight have been m istak e n a b o u t
feeling a pu lse in th e light of th e fu rth er train in g w hich he h a d th e n received.
In h e r later statem en t, Miss M artin described how she w as in a sta te of shock
w hen she tried to resu sc ita te Kevin W illiams a n d h a d n o t really been aw are of

Neurophysiologist agreed. In th e Divisional C ourt proceedings w hen th is issue
w as again raised, no criticism w as m ade of th e C oroner who h a d investigated
Kevin W iliam s’ case w ith great th o ro u gh n ess.




6 Stewart-Sm ith LJ concluded that Debra Martin could not be regarded as a reliable w itness
and that her statem ent that Kevin Williams was alive and said “Mom” could not be relied upon.

                                              17

McKerr (Northern Ireland), Re [2004] UKHL 12 (11 March 2004)                                              Fage'Z or is



  ^(^iV Iy Lords,

  1       This is a test case. It arises out of the absence of adequate public investigations into some fatal
          shootings in Northern I reland over 20 years ago. This particular case relates to the death of Mr
          Gervaise t-M cK e rr^. His son Jonathan seeks an order compelling the Secretary of State for Northern
          Ireland to hold an effective investigation into the circumstances of his father's death He bases his
          claim primarily on the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 even though his father died many years
          before the Act came into force. He also advances a claim based on the common law.

          The deaths

  2       Gervaise *-M cK e rr* died on 11 November 1982. He was driving a Ford Escort car in East Lurgan with
          two passengers, Eugene Toman and Sean Burns. All three men were shot dead by members of a unit
          of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Many of the facts surrounding the deaths are disputed. But it seems
          clear that the men were not armed and that over 100 rounds were fired at the car.

   3.     This was not an isolated incident. Two further fatal shooting incidents occurred soon a fte r w a r d s , both
          involvinq the RUC in County Armagh. On 24 November 1982 Michael Tighe was shot dead and Martin
          McAuley seriously wounded. On 12 December 1982 Peter Grew and Roderick Carroll were shot and
          killed. These six fatal shootings occurred amid allegations that some members of the RUC were
          operating a shoot-to-kill policy against suspected terrorists.

   4      Currently nine cases, including proceedings brought by the next of kin of Eugene Toman and Sean
          Burns are pending in the courts of Northern Ireland awaiting the outcome of this appeal. In addition
          numerous requests have been made to the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions of Northern
          Ireland for new investigations into deaths involving the police or security f o r c e s many years ag°_T™s
          surge of activity has been prompted by four judgments given by the European Court 6f Human Rights
          in May 2001 and the government's response to them.

           The investigations

   5. The issues arising on this appeal before your Lordships are points of law. But I must first summarise
      briefly the protracted history of the steps taken by the United Kingdom authonties to investigate the
      circumstances of the death of Gervaise ^M cK err^-. A fuller record can be found in the judgment of the
      European Court of Human Rights in * McKerf% v United Kingdom (2002) 34 EHRR 20 paras 11 -61
      The history extends over twelve years, from November 1982 to September 1994 and falls essentially
      into three parts. First, criminal proceedings: one police officer was charged with the murder of Eugene
      Toman, a passenger in the car when the shooting occurred, and two other police officers were charged
      with aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring the officer to commit that offence. The trial took.place
      between 29 May 1984 and 5 June 1984. At the end of the trial all three officers were acquitted on the
      direction of the judge.

      6    Second, a police investigation was conducted, initially by John Stalker, then Deputy Chief C o n s o le of
           the Greater Manchester Police Force, and thereafter by Colin Sampson, Chief Constable of the West
           Yorkshire Police. An interim report was followed by a lengthy final report presented in three sections, in
           October 1986 March 1987 and April 1987. On 25 January 1988 the Attorney General made a
           statement in Parliament in which he said that in the public interest no prosecutions would result from
           the Stalker/Sampson reports.

      7    Third at the conclusion of the criminal trial an inquest was opened by the A r m a g h coroner on 4 June
           1984. It was subsequently adjourned to await completion of the Stalker/Sampson investigation and
           because of two sets of judicial review proceedings. Both sets of proceedings came to your Lordships
           House- see *•McKerf% v Armagh Coroner [1990] 1 WLR 649 and R v Attorney General for Northern
           Ireland ex p Devine [1992] 1 WLR 262. The inquest resumed in May 1992 but was adjourned again
           later in’the same month. On 31 January 1994 the inquest was closed and the jury discharged. The
           inquest was re-opened on 22 March 1994. The coroner said the public had a proper interest in knowing
           whether any further relevant evidence had come to light. On 5 May 1994 the Secretary of State issued
           a public interest immunity certificate stating that disclosure of the Stalker/Sampson report would cause
           serious damage to the public interest. On 8 September 1994 the coroner abandoned the re-opened
           inquest. He could no longer hope to achieve his purpose in re-opening the inquest.

            The application to Strasbourg

McKerr (Northern Ireland), Re [2004] UKHL 12 (11 March 2004)                                             fage 3 o i i s



       ►Meanwhile on 7 March 1993 Gervaise t , McK errV s widow lodged an application w rth th e E u ro p ^n
        Court of Human Rights. After her death the application was continued by Mr Jonathan M cK ernk The
        applicant invoked article 2 of the Convention. He alleged that his father had beeni unjustif ab^y kilted
        and that there had been no effective investigation into the circumstances of his death This>application
        proceeded simultaneously with three others, two of which concerned deaths at the hands of the
        security forces and the third an allegation of police complicity in a murder by paramilitaries.

  9.     The court gave its judgment in all four cases on 4 May 2001. In the ^ M c K e r^ c a s e the court made no
         finding on the lawfulness or proportionality of the use of lethal force whfch kiHed G ^ i s e ^ M             .
         Nor did the court reach any conclusions on the circumstances, including G ervaisetM cK e n^s^ow n
         activities which led up to the killing. But the court found tha tjh e various investigatory proceedings
         disdosed a number of s h o rtc o m in ^T h e s e included: lack of independence of the investigation carried
         out bv the RUC’ lack of public scrutiny and information to the victim s family concerning the
         independent^{siler/S am pson) investigation, including lack of reasons for the failure to prosecute any
          police officer for perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice; the inquest procedure did not
          allow v e r d ic ts or findings which might play an effective role in securing prosecutions in respect of any
          criminal which might be disclosed; no advance disclosure of witness statements a t h e ^ u e s U h e P
          certificate had the effect of preventing the inquest examining matters relevant to outstanding issues,
          the D o lic e officers who shot Gervaise t-M c K e rr^ could not be compelled to attend the inquest as
          wrtnesses;^!?e!nques° proceedings did not start promptly, and neither they nor the Stalker/Sampson
          investigation proceeded with reasonable expedition.

  10     The court held unanimously that article 2 of the Convention had been violated by failure to comply-with
         the obligation implicit in artic e 2, to hold an effective official investigation when an individual has been
         IdHed by the^i'secrf force: see (2602) 34 EHRR 20, paras 157-161. The: court awardedMr J o rd a n
         'M flc K e rrl' £10^000 as just satisfaction in respect of the frustration, distress and anxiety he must have
         suffered. A finding of violation was not sufficient compensation.

  11      The government duly paid the sum awarded. In response to the judgment the United Kingdom also
          presented a package of proposals to the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe. Under article
          46(2) of the Convention the committee of ministers has responsibility for s u p e rv |S|n g execution of
          judgment of the court. This includes considering what are the practicable steps a state should be
           required to take in order to make good the violations found by the court: see Fmucane v United

       ■^payment of compensation automatically brought the article 2 obligation to an end. Counsel contended
         that once just satisfaction had been awarded and paid, Mr Jonathan t-NlcKerr** was no longer a Victim
         within section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and accordingly he could not complain of any breach of
         the continuing obligation. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument. The court made a decoration
         that the government has failed to carry out an investigation complying with article 2. The court
         considered it inappropriate to grant any other relief because the committee of ministers had not yet
         ruled on the proposals made to them by the United Kingdom government. From that decision the
         Secretary of State appealed to your Lordships' House.

         Retrospectivity

  15     The primary contention advanced by the Attorney General on behalf of the Secretary of State was not
         advanced in the courts below. In short, the Attorney General submitted to your Lordships House that
         section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is not applicable to deaths occurring before the Act came into
         force on 2 October 2 0 0 0 .1shall consider this submission first.

  16     It is now settled, as a general proposition, that the Human Rights Act is not retrospective. The Act itself
         treats section 22(4) as an exception. This general proposition, however, raises almost as many
         questions as it answers. Past events have continuing effects. For in s ta n c e , agreements made before
         the Human Rights Act came into force will often generate obligations requiring performance after 2
         October 2000. Some of the problems to which this gives rise were considered by your Lorosnjps
         House, in the context of sections 3 and 4 of the Act, in Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No 2) J20031
          UKHL 40. [20031 3 WLR 568.

  17     In the present case the question of retrospectivity arises in the context of section 6 of the Act and
         article 2 of the Convention. It arises in this way. Section 6 of the Act creates a new cause of action by
         rendering certain conduct by public authorities unlawful. Section 7(1)(a) provides a remedy for this new
         cause of action. A person who claims a public authority is acting in a way made unlawful by section 6
         (1) may bring proceedings against the authority if he is a victim of the unlawful act. Thus, if the
         Secretary of State's failure to arrange for a further investigation into the death of Gervaise *M c K e rr> is
         unlawful within the meaning of section 6(1), these proceedings brought by his son fell squarely within
         section 7; if not, not.

  18     So the key question is whether the government's failure to hbld a further investigation in this case is
         conduct which is prohibited by section 6(1). Section 6(1) makes it unlawful fo ra public authority to act
         in a way which is incompatible with a 'Convention right' as defined in the statute. An act includes a
         failure to act. The relevant Convention right is article 2. Article 2 of the Convention c o n c e r n s the most
         fundamental right of all: the right to life. The sanctity of life is a principle which finds expression in all
         civilised societies throughout the world. Article 2 provides:

                '(1) Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. No on? shall be deprived of his life
                intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a
                crime for which this penalty is provided by law.

                 (2) Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article
                 when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:

                 (a)in defence of any person from unlawful violence;

                 (b)in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained,

                 (c)in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling riot or insurrection.'

   19.    This article expressly imposes a positive obligation on the state to protect everyone's life The state
          must take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its bounds. But the state s obligation
          does not stop there. The European Court of Human Rights has held that by implication article 2 also
          requires there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed
          as a result of the use of force: see McCann v United Kingdom (1996) 21 EHRR 97 (the death on the
          Rock' case), and *M cK e ri% v United Kingdom (2002) 34 EHRR 20, para 111 The European Court of
          Human Rights has described this as a 'procedural' obligation imposed by article 2. The purpose of the
          investigation is to secure that domestic laws protecting the right to life are effectively implemented and,
          in cases involving state agencies, to ensure those responsible for deaths are made properly

 BP     accountable: see Jordan v United Kingdom (2003) 37 EHRR 2, para 105. The requisites of an
        investigation, if it is to fulfil this procedural obligation inherent in article 2, were considered recently by
        your Lordships' House in R (Amin) v Secretary o f State for the Home Department {2003] UKHL 51,
        f20031 3 WLR 1169.

 20.    Thus article 2 may be violated by an unlawful killing. The application of section 6(1) of the Human
        Rights Act to a case of an unlawful killing is straightforward. Section 6(1) applies if the act, namely, the
        killing, occurred after the Act came into force. Section 6(1) does not apply if the unlawful killing took
        place before 2 October 2000. So much is dear.


        into a violent death. Obviously there is no difficulty if the death in question occurred post-Act. The
        position is more difficult if the death occurred, say, shortly before the Act came into force and the
        necessary investigation would fall to be held in the ordinary course after the Act came into force. On
        which side of the retrospectivity line is a post-Act failure to investigate a pre-Act death?

 22.    In my view the answer lies in appreciating that the obligation to hold an investigation is an obligation
        triggered by the occurrence of a violent death. The obligation to hold an investigation does not exist in
        the absence of such a death. The obligation is consequential upon the death. If the death itself is not
        within the reach of section 6, because it occurred before the Act came into force, it would be surprising
        if section 6 applied to an obligation consequential upon the death. Rather, one would expect to find
        that, for section 6 to apply, the death which is the subject of investigation must itself be a death to
        which section 6 applies. The event giving rise to the article 2 obligation to investigate must have
        occurred post-Act.

 23.    I think this is the preferable interpretation of section 6 in the context of article 2. This interpretation has
        the effect, for the transitional purpose now under consideration, of treating all the obligations arising
        under article 2 as parts of a single whole. Parliament cannot be taken to have intended that the Act
        should apply differently to the primary obligation (to protect life) and a consequential obligation (to
        investigate a death). For this reason I consider these judicial review proceedings are misconceived so
        far as they are sought to be founded on the enabling power in section 7 of the Human Rights Act.

  24.   I refer briefly to the court decisions on this point. There have been several cases where everyone
        concerned appears to have assumed that section 6 of the Human Rights Act could apply to a failure to
        investigate a death which took place before the Act came into force. These include two decisions of
        your Lordships' House: R (Amin) v Secretary o f State for the Home Department [2003T 3 WLR 1169
        and R (Middleton) v Coroner for the Western District o f Somerset [20041 UKHL 10. In none of these
        cases, so it seems, was this point the subject of argument. So they do not assist.

  25.   In other cases, where the point has arisen for decision, differences in judicial view have emerged. In R
        (Wright) v Secretary o f State for the Home Department [2001] LLR (Med) 478, a case concerning a
        death in prison in 1996, Jackson J held the claimants were entitled to a remedy under the Act in
        respect of the Secretary of State's 'continuing breach of the procedural obligations under articles 2 and
        3' of the Convention: see paragraph 67. In R (Khan) v Secretary o f State for Health [20031 EWHC 1414
        (Admin) Silber J reached a contrary conclusion. He regarded the time of death as the governing factor.
        There the death occurred in October 1999. In Hurst v Coroner for the Northern District o f London
        [20031 EWHC 1721 (Admin), which concerned a death in May 2000, the Divisional Court disagreed
        with Silber J. The relevant time was when the decision was made in relation to the article 2 duty. At that
        time 'article 2 was part of English law': paragraph 20. This decision of the Divisional Court was followed
        by the Court of Appeal when the Khan case reached that court: see [20031 EWCA Civ 1129. The
        Human Rights Act had been in force for nearly two years when, in July 2002, the Secretary of State
        first denied the parents of the dead child the relief they were seeking: paragraph 85.

  26.   Having had the advantage of much fuller arguments I respectfully consider that some of these courts,
        including the Divisional Court in the Hurst case and the Court of Appeal in the Khan case, fell into error
        by failing to keep clearly in mind the distinction between (1) rights arising under the Convention and (2)
        rights created by the Human Rights Act by reference to the Convention. These two sets of rights now
        exist side by side. But there are significant differences between them. The former existed before the
        enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998 and they continue to exist. They are not as such part of this
        country's law because the Convention does not form part of this countiy's law. That is still the position.
        These rights, arising under the Convention, are to be contrasted with rights created by the Human
        Rights Act. The latter came into existence for the first time on 2 October 2000. They are part of this
        country's law. The extent of these rights, created as they were by the Human Rights Act, depends upon

        f f l S              C o n d o n in respect of an act occurring before the Human Righte A tf came into
        force will be mirrored by a corresponding right created by the Human R'?h*s A c t
         reflection in this way in the Human Rights Act depends upon the proper interpretation of the Human
            Rights Act

            The "victim'point

            Had I reached the contrary conclusion I would not have accepted the Secretary of S ta te 's argument
            that Mr Jonathan ^M c K e rr> had no standing to bring these proceedings

            monev awarded by the European Court of Human Rights as just satisfaction. M r^ M c K e rr* was
            awarded this amount for his frustration, distress and anxiety over the years. All 1too obviously he is still
            not in the position intended to be achieved by fulfilment of the obligation to hold an effective
            investigation into his father's death. Crucial questions remain unanswered. A s n o t e d , the
            European Court o f Human Rights did not itself decide whether Geiva'se t-M c K e ir^ had ^ n ^ l e d by
            the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force. Nor did the court decide w hether Gervaise M cKerr
            % had been the victim of a shoot-to-kill policy operated by some members of the Royal Ulster
            Constabulary.

            An overriding common law right?

  28        before your Lordships' House Mr Treacy advanced a further basis for Mr t.M c K e rrV s judicial review
            proceedings He submitted that the right to an effective official investigation is as much a feature
            common law as it is of the European Convention. The rationale which underlies the procedural
            obligation under article 2 must also underpin the common law. He relied heavily upon a n lo te ^ a to
            made by Lord Bingham of Comhill in R (Amin) v Secretary o f State for the Home Department J2003I3
             WLR 1169, 1185, para 30:

                    ■A profound respect for the sanctity of human life underpins the common law as it
                    underpins the jurisprudence under articles 1 and 2 of the Convention. This means that a
                    state must not unlawfully take life and must take appropriate legislative and administrative
                    steps to protect it.'

  29         This submission I note in passing, is not being used as a foundation for a challenge to the lawfulness
             I f T h e S u r f Sf the coroner inquiring into Gervaise W Ic K e rrV s death. For many certunes g o n e rs
             inauests with their inquisitorial process, have been a primary means employed in Northern Ireland as
             well as England and Wales for investigating violent or unnatural deaths or other deaths requiring
             S L a S o n The law provides, in the form of judicial review, a means whereby the lawfulness of
             coroners decisions can be challenged. In an appropriate case a court may review a coroners
             premature closure of an inquest.

   30        That is not the route being followed in this case. In these proceedings M r tM c K e rrV is ^ challenging
             any decision of the Armagh coroner. This is perhaps hardly surprising, giveni the years which have
             elapsed since the coroner closed his inquest into Gervaise t,M e K e rr^s death. Nor is Mr McKerr1^
             asking the House to interpret the statutory provisions relating to coroners in a way which would make
             them compliant with the investigative requirements of article 2.

   31        Instead counsel propounded a separate overriding common law right corresponding to the procedural
        '    ngh tT m p S n n article 2 o f the Convention. He submitted that the Secretary of State is, or should te
             subject to a common law obligation to arrange for an effective investigation into Getvaise *M c K e rr» s
             death This obliqation would be satisfied by holding a coroner's inquest which complies with the
             requirements of article 2. In the absence of such a right the common law would afford less protection to
             the riqht of life than the Convention. Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act the court, as a public
             authority, is obliged to develop the common law in a manner consistent with Convention rights and
             Strasbourg jurisprudence.

   32         I have grave reservations about the appropriateness of the common law now fashioning a free* s ta g in g
              positive obligation o f this far reaching character. Such a development would be far removed from the
              normal way the common law proceeds. But I need not pursue this wider question The submiss on fails
              for more straightforward, orthodox reasons. The effect of counsel’s submission, if accepted, would be
              that the court would create an overriding common law obligation on the state, corresponding to article 2
              of the C o S o n in an area of the law for which Parliament has long legislated. The courts have

          always been slow to develop the common law by entering, or re-entering, a field regulated by
          legislation. Rightly so, because otherwise there would inevitably be the prospect of the common law
          shaping powers and duties and provisions inconsistent with those prescribed by Parliament. R v Lyons
          [20021 UKHL 44. f20031 1 AC 976 is a recent instance where the House rejected a submission having
          this effect.

  33.     The argument in the present case suffers from the same flaw. The suggested new common law right is
          sought as a means of supplementing, or overriding, the statutory provisions relating to the holding of
          coroners' inquests. That is not an appropriate role for the common law.

 -3 3 :   | his view is confirmecTby anothei feature of the case. As already emphasised, by e n a c tin g the Human
          Rights A ct 1998 Parliament created domestic law rights corresponding to rights arising under the
          Convention. When doing so Parliament chose not to give the legislation retroactive effect. In relation to
          article 2 the intention of Parliament, as interpreted above, was not to create an investigative right in
          respect of deaths occurring before the Act came into force. The common law right urged on behalf of
          Mr tiM c K e rr^ would accord ill with this legislative intention. The effect of the propounded right would
          be to impose positive human rights obligations on the state as a matter o f domestic law in advance of
          the date on which a corresponding positive obligation arose under the Human Rights Act,

  35.     These considerations point ineluctably to the conclusion that the suggested common law right cannot
          properly be fashioned by the courts. I would allow this appeal and dismiss these proceedings.

          LORD STEYN

          My Lords,

   36.    The deliberate killing o f individuals under suspicion o f subversive activities by agents of the state is
          something that one associates with lawless totalitarian regimes. That is not to say that in liberal
          democracies such events cannot occur. The difference between totalitarian states and democracies lie
          in their response to a serious allegation that such targeted killings took place. It would be antithetical to
          the nature of a totalitarian state to permit such killings to be investigated. On the other hand, in modern
          times liberal democracies have progressively become ready to undertake investigations in such cases.
          In the domain of the European Convention on Human Rights Article 2 spells out a fundamental right to
          life and by the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, a fundamental right of the family
          of a person killed by agents of the state to demand that the state must promptly and effectively
          investigate the circumstances in which the death occurred.

   37.    In a period of about a month between November and December 1982, in three separate incidents, six
          men were shot and killed by police officers of a special mobile support unit of the Royal Ulster
          Constabulary. The killings took place in Armagh. None of the men killed were armed. One mail was
          shot in the back. There were two trials but none of the police officers were convicted. The present case
          relates to Gervaise t-M cK e rr^ who was shot and killed, with others, on 11 November 1982. A criminal
          trial o f three police officers resulted in their acquittal. Gervaise ‘& M cK errTs family wanted a proper and
          effective inquest into the circumstances of his death. The government strongly resisted an
          investigation.

   38.     On 7 March 1993 an application was lodged with the E.Ct.H.R. alleging various breaches of the
           E.C.H.R. On 4 May 2001 the E.Ct.H.R. unanimously found that there had been a failure to comply with
           the procedural obligation implied in Article 2 to investigate promptly and effectively a case where an
           individual had been killed as a result of the use of force: ‘M ffcK erA- v United Kingdom (2002) 34 EHRR
           20 .

   39.     The E. Ct. H.R. identified the following concerns in its decision:

                  "136 . . . the scope of the criminal trial was restricted to the criminal responsibility of the
                  three officers. The applicant, relying inter alia on the Minnesota Protocol, argued that the
                  trial was not capable of addressing wider concerns about other aspects of official
                  involvement in the killings. One of these aspects was the deliberate instructions of a

                  raised doubts as to what other information or obstruction might have occurred. Another
                  was the fact that there had been two other incidents in Armagh within a month in which
                  police officers from the special mobile support units had used lethal force, killing Michael

 W            Tighe on 24 November 1992 and Seamus Grew and Roddy Carroll on 12 December
              1992, all of whom had been unarmed. A prosecution had occurred concerning the latter
              incident and had also resulted in an acquittal. It was alleged that police officers involved
              in these incidents had similarly been instructed to conceal evidence.

                  137 The Court considers that there may be circumstances where issues arise that have
                  not, or cannot, be addressed in a criminal trial and that Article 2 may require a wider
                  examination. Serious concerns arose from these three incidents as to whether police
                  counter-terrorism procedures involved an excessive use o f force, whether deliberately or
                  as an inevitable by-product of the tactics that were used. The deliberate concealment of
  ----------------evide nce alse-east doubts on the-effectiveness of investigations in uncovering what had-------------
                  occurred. In other words, the aims of reassuring the public and the members of the family
                  as to the lawfulness of the killings had not been met adequately by the criminal trial. In
                  this case therefore, the Court finds that Article 2 required a procedure whereby these
                  elements could be examined and doubts confirmed, or laid to rest. It considers below
                  whether the authorities adequately addressed these concerns."

        The court concluded that the concerns had not been adequately addressed and listed the
        shortcomings of the procedures adopted: para 157. The question whether there had been a policy to
        kill individuals suspected of subversion activities was unresolved. The court concluded that there had
        been a violation of the procedural obligation. The court made an award of £10,000 by way of
        compensation. This sum has been paid.

  40.   The supervision of the judgment in the present case is being conducted by the Committee of Ministers
        pursuant to Article 46 of the E.C.H.R. The outcome is not yet Known.

  41.   Reinforced by the judgment in Strasbourg, and twenty-one years after the death of his father, Mr
        Jonathan t-M cKenrT wants an effective investigation of the circumstances in which his father died.
        Despite the judgment of the E.Ct.H.R., the Secretary of State refuses to permit such an investigation.
        The Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland found in favour of the son. The court concluded (para 13):

               "We accordingly consider that the appellant's claim is well founded, that there is
               continuing breach of Article 2(1) which requires to be addressed by the respondent
               Government. Since, however, the Committee of Ministers has not yet ruled on the
               proposals made to them by the Government in respect of the four cases heard by the
               E.Ct.H.R., we would not regard it as appropriate to do more than make a declaration. In
               these circumstances we propose to allow the appeal and make a declaration that the
               respondent Government has failed to carry out an investigation which complies with the
               requirements of Article 2 of the Convention, but not to grant any other relief."

        Still resisting any investigation the Government challenges the decision of the Court of Appeal.

  42.   Mr ^M cK e rrV s case is crucially dependent on the applicability o f section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act
        1998. It provides:

               "It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a
               Convention right."

        The relevant Convention right is Article 2. It provides expressly that everyone's right to life shall be
         protected by law. By necessary implication it places an independent procedural obligation on the state
        to investigate promptly and effectively cases where agents of the state cause death by the use of force.
        The existence of this implied obligation under Article 2 was first spelt out by the E.Ct.H.R. in McCann
         and Others v The United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 97: for a review of the subsequent European
        jurisprudence see Lester and Pannick, Human Rights Law and Practice, 2nd ed, 2004, 4.2.31-4.2.39
        and Mowbray, The Development o f Positive Obligations under the European Convention on Human
         Rights by the European Court o f Human Rights, 2004, 27-40. In order to have a cause of action under
        the 1998 Act, Mr t-M cK err1* must however have the status of being a "victim" within the meaning of
         section 7(1).

  43.   On the facts of the present case, and because Mr t>McKerr> has received compensation, the
        Government argues that he lacks the standing of being a victim. On this simple ground it is said that
        the door of the court is closed to him. In my view this argument is wrong. But for the receipt of


 http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/12.html&queiy-...                          04/01/06

 W      compensation Mr t-N lcK e rr* was unquestionably a victim. After all, he is a son questioning why his
        father was killed by agents of the state. The E.Ct.H.R. made the award of compensation on the basis
        that due to the violation of the procedural obligation, the son "suffered feelings of frustration, distress
        and’anxiety"- para 181. In other words, the failure to carry out an investigation promptly and effectively
        caused the son mental suffering and for that an award of compensation was made. The procedural
        obligation remains unfulfilled. The state has never conducted a proper investigation into the death of Mr
        t.R/lcKerrVs father. The compensation was plainly not intended by the E.Ct.H.R. to be the price which,
         if paid, relieved the Government of its unfulfilled procedural obligation even in circumstances where
         such an obligation was still capable of being fulfilled. Nothing in the judgment of the E.Ct.H.R. supports
         such an implausible idea. I would reject this argument.

 44.    It is now necessary to turn to the principal issues. They are formulated in the Agreed Statement of
        Facts and Issues as follows:

               "(1 )... has the Secretary of State acted orfailed to act on or after 2 October 2000 in a
               way which is incompatible with the Respondent's Article 2 Convention rights contrary to
               Section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the retrospectivity issue)?"

               "(2) Does the common law now impose an obligation upon the United Kingdom
               Government to hold an effective official investigation into the circumstances of the
               Respondent's father's death irrespective of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the common law
               issue)?"

        Before I consider these legal issues it is necessary to consider a separate and anterior point which, if
        meritorious, makes it unnecessary to consider these important points of law.

  45    On behalf of the Government the Attorney-General placed before the House in written and oral
        submissions an argument that an effective enquiry is as a m atter of fact no longer possible. He referred
        the House to the decision of the E.CtH.R. in Finucane v United Kingdom (2003) 37 EHRR 29, and in
        particular to paragraph 89 of the decision of the court which reads as follows:

                "As regards the applicant's views concerning provision of an effective investigation, the
                Court has not previously given any indication that a Government should, as a response to
                such a finding of a breach of Article 2, hold a fresh investigation into the death concerned
                and has on occasion expressly declined to do so. Nor does it consider it appropriate to do
                so in the present case. It cannot be assumed in such cases that a future investigation can
                usefully be carried out or provide any redress, either to the victim's family or by way of
                providing transparency and accountability to the wider public. The lapse of time, the effect
                on evidence and the availability of witnesses, may inevitably render such an investigation
                an unsatisfactory or inconclusive exercise, which fails to establish important facts or put
                to rest doubts and suspicions. Even in disappearance cases, where it might be argued
                that more is at stake since the relatives suffer from the ongoing uncertainty about the
                exact fate of the victim or the location of the body, the Court has refused to issue any
                declaration that a new investigation should be launched. It rather falls to the Committee of
                Ministers acting under Article 46 of the Convention to address the issues as to what may
                practicably be required by way of compliance in each case."

         The Attorney-General submitted that in this case an effective enquiry is no longer possible. He
         submitted that there cannot be a continuing duty to do something when it is impossible to do it. If this
         premise is right, I would accept that it would be the end of the matter under domestic law. The
         domestic court, in this case the House of Lords, would not make an order designed to ensure that a
         plainly useless enquiry is embarked on. This would be a sufficient basis for allowing the appeal of the
         Government. The question is whether this submission is right. It having been advanced I must deal
         with it.

  46.    One would have expected an affidavit from the state explaining why an investigation is impossible. To
         such an affidavit I would have paid the closest attention. There is no affidavit. The strategy has been to
         steer clear of the facts. The observations of the Attorney-General that an enquiry is no longer possible,
         unsupported by evidence, have no more weight before the House than that of any other advocate or
         litigant in this ease who is parti pris. In any event, counsel for Mr t-M cK e rr'* pointed out that the fruits
         of police investigations are still in existence; the transcripts of the criminal trials are available; and there
         is available the Stalker/Sampson report consisting of 3609 pages in twenty separate volumes including
         one album of maps and photographs. If an inquest were to be held, it would be up to the coroner to

        read the latter report and consider whether it should be put in evidence. So far neither the coroner in
        Northern Ireland nor any judge considering the matter has read the report. In Northern Ireland judicial
        review proceedings it was held that the report is irrelevant. How one can say, in advance of studying it,
        that it is not relevant I do not understand. The E.Ct.H.R. was clearly sceptical. So am I.

        N.I.

 48.    I am not persuaded that on the basis of materials available an effective investigation of sensible scope
        is impossible.

 49. The critical question in this case is, however, whether the court has jurisdiction to make an order
     designed to lead to the investigation of a death which occurred before the 1998 Act came into force.

  50    The retrospectivity issue now arises. Mr 'NMcKerr'Vs case is founded on section 6 of the 1998 Act.
        Leaving aside proceedings taken at the instigation of a public authority, which are not under
        consideration, it is now settled law that section 6 is not retrospective: section 22(4) o fth e 1 9 ^ A c t,K v
        Lambert f20021 2 AC 545; R v Kansal (No. 2) [20021 2 AC 69; Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No. 2)
         F2Q031 3 WLR 568 (HL). Mr t-M cK errT's father was killed in 1982. The 1998 Act came into force on 2
         October 2000. The Court of Appeal held that there is a continuing breach of Article 2 which requires to
         be addressed by the Government: para 13. In my view the Attorney-General has demonstrated that
        this reasoning cannot be sustained. The Government may have been in breach of its obligations under
         international law before 2 October 2000 to set up a prompt and effective investigation. But those treaty
         obligations created no rights under domestic law, not even after the right to petition to Strasbourg was
         created by the United Kingdom Government in 1966. The very purpose of the 1998 A ct was *to bring
         home rights" which were previously justiciable only in Strasbourg: The Government White Paper,
         October 1997 (Cm 3782). That appears, in any event, to be the consequence of the rule enunciated by
         the House of Lords in the International Tin Council case that an unincorporated treaty can create no
         rights or obligations in domestic law: J. H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Limited v Department o f Trade and
         Industry 1^990] 2 AC 418. As Lord Hoffmann has pointed out this rule has been affirmed by the House
          in R v Secretary o f State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind [1991 ] 1 AC 696 and in R v Lyons
          f2 Q0 3 1 1 AC 976. and in particular in the leading judgment of Lord Hoffmann in the latter case: para 27.
         The later decisions rest, however, on the pivot of the International Tin Council decision.

  51.    Since the International Tin Council decision is regularly cited in our courts, a brief reference to its
         reception in subsequent jurisprudential analysis may not be out of place. In doing so I acknowledge
         that the point has not been the subject of argument. A comprehensive re-examination must await
         another day. But distinguished commentators have criticised what has been caljed the narrowness of
         the decision in the House of Lords: see the criticism of Sir Robert Jennings in his 1989 F A Mann
         Lecture ((1990) 39 ICLQ 513, at 524-526); and of Dame Rosalyn Higgins, 'The Relationship between
         International and Regional Human Rights Norms and Domestic Law", in Developing Human Rights
         Jurisprudence, 1993, Vol. 5, 16-23. The latter writer observed (at 20):

                " ... international law is part of the law of the land. Some rights contained in international
                human rights treaties are not the produce of inter-State contract, but antedate any such
                multilateral agreement. The treaty is merely the instrument in which a rule of general
                international law is repeated. It bears repetition in an international instrument, partly
                because relatively 'new' rights may also be included, and partly because the treaty may
                involve procedural undertaking for the States Parties. But none of that changes the
                character of a given right as an obligation of general international law. Freedom from
                torture, freedom of religion, free speech, the prohibition of arbitrary detention, should all
                fall in that category. As such - and even were these rights not already secure through a
                separate domestic historic provenance - they would be part of the common law by virtue
                of being rules of general international law."

         There is also growing support for the view that human rights treaties enjoy a special status: Murray
         Hunt Using Human Rights Law in English Courts, 1998, pp 26-28. Commenting on Lewis v Attorney
         General o f Jamaica [2001] 2 AC 50 Mr Justice Collins commented that "it may be a sign that one day

 http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc-/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/12.html&queiy ...                             04/01/06

       the courts will come to the view that it will not infringe the constitutional principle to create an estoppel
       aqainst the Crown in favour of individuals in human rights cases": Foreign Relations and the Judiciary
       2002 51 ICLQ 485, at 497. That is not to say that the actual decision in the International Tin Council
       case was wrong. On the contrary, the critics would accept the principled analysis of Kerr LJ in the
       Court of Appeal that the issue of the liability of member states under international law is justiciable in
       the national court, and that under international law the member states were not liable for the debts of
       the international organisation: see Mr Justice Lawrence Collins, op cit, at 497.

 52.   The rationale of the dualist theory, which underpins the International Tin Council case, is that any
       inroad on it would risk abuses by the executive to the detriment of citizens. It is, however, difficult to
       see w hat rolovancc thic has to international human righ*R tmatips which create fundamental rights for
       individuals against the state and its agencies. A critical re-examination of this branch of the law may
       become necessary in the future.

 53.   That brings me to the common law issue. In a careful and helpful argument Mr Treacy Q.C. invited the
       House to hold that the common law should be developed to recognise a substantive right to life,
       coupled with a procedural right co-extensive with that enunciated in 1995 in McCann. He pointed out
       that unlike cases such as Lyons where there was what he called a legislative "block” in play, there is
       none in the present case. This argument has considerable force. The fact that there is no authority for
       such a development is not in itself fatal. In R v Chief Constable R.U.C. ex parte Begley [1997] 1 WLR.
       1 4 7 5 , Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in giving the unanimous opinion of the House, observed (at 1480):


               "It is true that the House has a power to develop the law. But it is a limited power. And it
               can be exercised only in the gaps left by Parliament. It is impermissible for the House to
               develop the law in a direction which is contrary to the expressed will of Parliament."

        Before embarking on such a course the House would have to take into account that, by and large, the
        law regarding inquests has been developed in Northern Ireland by statute, see Leckey and Greer,
        Coroner’s Law and Practice in Northern Ireland, 1998, passim. Moreover, the House would have to
        confront another difficulty. It must be sound principle for a supreme court to develop the law only when
        it has been demonstrated that the just disposal of cases compellingly requires it. Given that the right to
        life is comprehensively protected under Article 2 of the Convention as incorporated in our law by the
        1998 Act, why is there now a need to create a parallel right to life under the common law? Given that
        the procedural obligation under Article 2 is comprehensively protected under our law, as held by the
        House of Lords in R (Amin) v Secretary o f State o f the Home Department [20Q3]_3_WLR .1169. why is
        there now a need to create a parallel right under the common law?

  54    A t a late stage of the appeal before the House I did wonder whether customary international law may
        have a direct role to play in the argument about the development of the common law. The idea was
        suggested to me by a valuable article: Andrew J Cunningham, The European Convention on Human
        Rights, Customary International Law and the Constitution, 1994, 43 ICLQ 537. The writer stated the
        following propositions [538]:

               "First, that treaties may generate rules of customary international law: the accepted view
               that unenacted treaties 'cannot be a source of rights and obligations' in England is thus
               effectively sidestepped, since it is not the treaty itself which is the source of rights.
               Second, that the numerous human rights treaties and other instruments, of which the
               European Convention is but one, have given or, at least, may give rise to rules of
               customary international human rights law. Third, that customary international law forms
               part of the common law of England. If these three be accepted, it follows that, to the
               extent that the content of any right encompassed in the European Convention is the
               same as its content in customary international law, the right in question will be recognised
               in English law as a part thereof."

        Along these lines there may be an argument that the right to life has long been recognised in
        customary international law, which in the absence of a contrary statute has been part of English law
        since before the 1998 Act came into force. One has to remember, however, that the procedural
        obligation recognised in McCann only dates from 1995, i.e. thirteen years after the deceased was shot
        and after the inquest in Northern Ireland was closed. It may be unrealistic to suggest that the
        procedural obligation was already part of customary international law at a time material to these
        proceedings. The point has not been in issue in the present case. It has not been researched, and it
        was not the subject of adversarial argument. It may have to be considered in a future case. The impact
        of evolving customary international law on our domestic legal system is a subject of increasing

        importance.

 55.    I conclude that the common law development has not been made out.

 56.    I would allow the appeal and dismiss the application for judicial review.

        LORD HOFFMANN

        My Lords,

 57.    On 11th November 1982 a member or members of a unit of the Royal Ulster Constabulary shot and
        killed Gervaise t-N lcK eiT * while he was driving a car in East Lurgan. They also killed his two
        passengers. The ensuing investigation into the deaths was protracted and unsatisfactory. Three
        policemen were tried for murder in 1984 but the judge ruled that the evidence adduced by the
        prosecution did not raise a case to answer. There was a suspicion that important evidence had been
        suppressed The coroner opened an inquest but adjourned it while officers from English police forces
        conducted further investigations. In 1986-87 they delivered reports to the DPP. In 1988; the Attorney-
        General announced that he had considered all the available material and decided that it would not be
        in the public interest to initiate further criminal proceedings. The inquest resumed but the coroner was
        unable to obtain access to much of the evidence he required. Finally in 1994 the Secretary of State
        issued a public interest immunity certificate preventing disclosure of the reports of the independent
        police investigations. At that point the coroner abandoned the inquest, saying that the reasons for
        which it had been held were no longer achievable.

  58    Mr t.M cK err'V s mother (and after her death, his son) petitioned the European Commission of Human
        Rights in 1993, alleging that the United Kingdom was in breach of Article 2 ° f the^ ° ^ ention:
        "Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law". In McCann v United Kingdom (1996) 21 EHRR 97
        the Strasbourg court held (at paragraph 161) that this requires the State to provide?

               "some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result
               of the use offeree by, inter alios, agents of the State."

  59.    In Mr tM c K e rrT s case, the Strasbourg court decided on 4 May 2001 that the United Kingdom had not
         complied with this obligation: McKen% v United Kingdom (2002) 34 EHRR 20. The shortcomings
         were summarised in paragraph 157 of the judgment: the police officers who investigated were not
         independent from the officers implicated; there was no public scrutiny or involvement of the victim s
         family in the investigation or the decision of the DPP not to prosecute; the abandonment of the inquest
         prevented any findings which could have played an effective role in securing a prosecution for any
         criminal offence disclosed; statements by witnesses who appeared at the inquest were not disclosed in
         advance to the family; the Pll certificate deprived the inquest o f relevant evidence; the police officers
         who shot Mr ^M cK err^- were not compellable witnesses; the police investigation was too slow; the
         inquest did not commence promptly and then went on too long.

  60.    The Court accordingly found a violation of article 2 and awarded the applicant non-pecuniary damages
         of £10,000 for "feelings of frustration, distress and anxiety" caused by the inadequacy of the
         investigation. This sum has been paid. Pursuant to article 46(2) of the Convention, the judgment was
         sent to the Committee of Ministers which is charged with supervision of its execution. It has, in
         accordance with its rules, invited the United Kingdom government to inform the Committee of the
         measures which it has taken in consequence of the judgment. The government has supplied
         information about legal and administrative changes which have been made but does not propose to
         hold a fresh investigation into Mr t-N lcK err^'s killing. The Committee has not yet decided whether the
         measures notified by the government amount to compliance with the judgment and with the States
         duty under article 52 to satisfy the Committee that its internal law enables the rights under the
         Convention to be effectively implemented.

  61     Mr feM cKerrVs son was dissatisfied with this outcome and on 30 January 2002 commenced judicial
         review proceedings against the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland seeking a declaration that "in
         breach of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and article 2 of the European Convention", he had
         failed to provide an "article 2 compliant" investigation and an order of mandamus to compel him to
         provide such an investigation. The principal ground was stated to be that as the Strasbourg court had
         found a breach of article 2, it was a breach of section 6 of the 1998 Act for the Secretary of State not to
         hold an investigation which complied with that article.

w f     Section 6 says that it is unlawful for a public authority (such as the Secretary of State) to act in a way
        which is incompatible with a Convention right". Section 1(1) defines "Convention rights" as "the rights
        and fundamental freedoms set out in" certain articles of the Convention which section 1(3) says are set
        out in Schedule 1.

 63     So Mr ^ M c K e rr'* says (1) the Convention gives him the right to an effective investigation (2) the
        Strasbourg court has decided that the United Kingdom has not provided him with one (3) he therefore
        has a continuing right to such an investigation and (4) the Secretary of State, in refusing to provide
        one, is acting in breach of his Convention rights. Campbell LJ did not accept stage (3) of this reasoning
        because he said that the obligation to provide an investigation was discharged by the declaration and
        ordor for payment of compensation m adei)y the Strasbourg court. The Court of Appeal, in a judgment
        given by Carswell LJ, accepted all four stages of the reasoning and made a declaration that the          (
        Government had "failed to carry out an investigation which complies with the requirements of article I .

 64.    In my opinion the reasoning which the Court of Appeal accepted does not sufficiently distinguish
        between the obligations under international law which the United Kingdom (as a State) accepted by
        accession to the Convention and the duties under domestic law which were imposed upon public
        authorities in the United Kingdom by section 6 of the 1998 Act, These obligations belong to different
        legal systems; they have different sources, are owed by different parties, have different contents and
        different mechanisms for enforcement.

  65.   It should no longer be necessary to cite authority for the proposition that the Convention, as an
        international treaty, is not part of English domestic law. R v Secretary o f State for the Home
        Department, ex parte Brind [1991 ] 1 AC 696 and R v Lyons [200-311 AC 9.76 are two instances of its
        affirmation in your Lordships' House. That proposition has been in no way altered or amended by the
         1998 Act. Although people sometimes speak of the Convention having been incorporated into domestic
        law, that is a misleading metaphor. What the Act has done is to create domestic rights expressed in the
        same terms as those contained in the Convention. But they are domestic rights, not international rights.
        Their source is the statute, not the Convention. They are available against specific public authorities,
         not the United Kingdom as a state. And their meaning and application is a matter for domestic courts,
         not the court in Strasbourg.

  66.   This last point is demonstrated by the provision in section 2(1) that a court determining a question
        which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must "take into account any judgment of the
        Strasbourg court. Under the Convention, the United Kingdom is bound to accept a judgment of the
        Strasbourg court as binding: Article 46(1). But a court adjudicating in litigation in the United Kingdom
        about a domestic "Convention right" is not bound by a decision of the Strasbourg court. It must take it
        into account.

  67.    If one keeps the distinction between international and domestic obligations firmly in mind, the fallacy in
         the respondent's reasoning becomes apparent. It can be illustrated by reference to a passage in the
         judgment of Jackson J in R (Wright) v Secretary o f State for the Home Department [2001] Lloyd s Rep
         (Med) 478. Mr Wright was a prisoner who died after an asthma attack in 1996. The judge found that the
         investigation into his death did not comply with articles 2 and 3. He then considered whether this gave
         rise to any rights enforceable in judicial review proceedings:

                "The [Home Secretary] came under an obligation pursuant to articles 2 and 3 of the
                Convention to set up an effective official investigation. [He] never discharged that
                obligation. [His] breach of that obligation was not actionable in the English courts before 2
                October 2000... Can the claimants now claim any remedy pursuant to sections 6, 7 and 8
                of the Act for the continuing breach of articles 2 and 3 since 2 October 2000?”

  68.    After rejecting a floodgates argument, the judge decided that he could. But the fallacy of the reasoning
         lies in the notion of a "continuing breach" of articles 2 and 3. The judge was concerned with the rights
         of the claimants in domestic law. Before 2 October 2000, there could not have been any breach of a
         human rights provision in domestic law because the Act had not come into force. So there could be no
         continuing breach. There may have been a breach of article 2 as a matter of international law and this
         may have "continued" after 1 October 2000, although, for the reasons given by my noble and learned
         friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, I think it unlikely. But that is irrelevant to whether the
         claimants had rights in domestic law, for which there can be no source other than the 1998 Act. The
         Act did not transmute international law obligations into domestic ones. It created new domestic human
         rights. The simple question is whether as a matter of construction, those rights applied to deaths which
         occurred before the Act came into force.

        Your Lordships' House have decided on a number of occasions that the A ct was not retrospective. So
        the primary right to life conferred by article 2 can have had no application to a person who died before
        the Act came into force. His killing may have been a crime, a tort, a breach of international law but it
        could not have been a breach of section 6 of the Act. Why then should the ancillary right to an
        investigation of the death apply to a person who died before the Act came into force? In my opinion it
        does not Otherwise there can in principle be no limit to the time one could have to go back into history
        and carry out investigations. In R (Wright) v Secretary o f State for the Home Department Jackson J.
        was prepared to accept the possibility of investigations into breaches of article 2 "during the 50-year
         period between the UK's accession to the Convention and the coming into force of the [1998 A c t]'. But
         that was because he regarded an international law right under the Convention as a necessary (and
         siiffjp.ifint) springboard for a domestic claim on the basis of a "continuing breach . In my opinion,
         however, the international law obligation is irrelevant. Either the Act applies to deaths before 2 October
         2000 or it does not. If it does, there is no reason why the date of accession to the Convention should
         matter. It would in principle be necessary to investigate the deaths by state action of the Princes in the
         Tower.

 70.    I therefore agree with the opinion of Silber J in R (Khan) v Secretary o f State for Health [2003] EWHC
        1414 f Admin) that the duty to investigate under article 2 did not arise in domestic law in respect of
        deaths before 2 October 2002. In the Court of Appeal in that case ([2003] EWCA Civ 1129), Brooke LJ,
        giving the judgment of the Court, disagreed. He said "we do not believe the court at Strasbourg would
        look at the matter in this way." I daresay it would not. But that is because the court would be concerned
        with the international obligations of the United Kingdom and not with the extent to which the 1998 Act
        was retrospective.

  71.   Mr Treacy QC, who appeared for the respondent, said that courts could deal with applications for
        investigations into past deaths in a pragmatic way. If an inquiry would no longer serve any purpose,
        they would refuse one. That was a question of remedy rather than the existence of the right. Likewise
        in the Khan case, Brooke LJ said "If this decision causes practical difficulties in other cases, the
        solution to those difficulties will have to be worked out on a case by case basis." I do not think it
        appropriate for human rights to be reduced to a matter of broad judicial discretion in this way. In my
        opinion Parliament intended section 6 of the 1998 Act to be enforced, but enforced only in respect of
        breaches occurring after it came into force.

  72.    Mr Treacy submitted in the alternative that, independently of the 1998 Act, the common law had
         created a right to an investigation which made it unlawful for the Secretary of State to refuse to order
         one In my opinion this is an impossible contention. It is true that in R (Amin) v Secretary o f State for
         the Home Department f?003] 3 WLR 1169 Lord Bingham of Cornhill said (at p. 1185) that "a profound
         respect for the sanctity of human life underpins the common law as it underpins the jurisprudence
         under articles 1 and 2 of the Convention." It is perfectly true that the sanctity of life is a value which has
         directed the development of the common law and the enactment of many statutes which are intended
         to protect life, provide for the investigation o f unnatural deaths and secure the detection and
         punishment of those who unlawfully kill. A number of statutes concerned with inquests into deaths in
         England and Wales are mentioned by Lord Bingham in paragraphs 16 and 17 of his judgment and
         there are sim ilar statutes applicable to Northern Ireland. Some of the grounds upon which the
         Strasbourg court found that the investigative procedures in Mr t-M cK errV s case did not satisfy article
         2 (for example, the rule by which a person suspected of causing the death was not a compellable
         witness and the limited nature of the verdicts which could be returned by the coroner's jury) were
         deficiencies in these statutory provisions. But no successful challenge to the legality of the various
         investigative procedures (the criminal trial, the police inquiries, the inquest) was made at the time and it
          is far too late to make such a challenge now. Nor is any attempt being made to invoke domestic law
         procedures to quash the decision of the coroner to abandon the inquest or require another to be held.

  73.    Instead, the respondent, in this part of the argument, asserts a broad common law principle equivalent
         to article 2 against which the whole of the complex set of rules which governed the earlier
         investigations can be tested and by which they can be found wanting and be ordered to be rerun under
         different rules. My Lords, in my opinion there is no such overarching principle and I venture to suggest
         that the very notion of such a principle, capable of overriding detailed statutory and common law rules,
         is alien to the traditions of the common law. The common iaw develops from case to case in harmony
         with statute. Its principles are generalisations from detailed rules, not abstract propositions from which
         those rules are deduced. Still less does it provide a solvent for any difficulties which may exist in the
         rules enacted by Parliament. It is in this respect quite different from the general statements which have
         now been enacted by the 1998 A ct and to which the House gave effect in R (Amin) v Secretary of State
         for the Home Department [20031 3 VWLR 1169.

        I would allow the appeal and dismiss the application fo r judicial review.

        LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY

        My Lords,

 75.    My Lords, I too would allow the appeal, for the reasons given by my noble and learned friends, Lord
        Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood. I merely wish to add
        a short comment on the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("the Act") in relation to the death of
        Gervaise ^ M c K e rr*.

 76.    Ever since the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms came into effect in
        international law, the United Kingdom has been bound by its terms. The position under international
        law did not change in any way on 2 October 2000: that was a significant day in terms of the domestic
        legal systems of the United Kingdom, but not in terms of international law. Both before and after that
        date, the obligation on the United Kingdom under article 1 of the Convention was to secure to everyone
        within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I o f the Convention. Similarly, both
        before and after that date, the United Kingdom aimed to secure the enjoyment of those rights and
        freedoms by means of a raft of common law and statutory provisions in its domestic law. If the rights
        and remedies available in our domestic law proved to be insufficient for this purpose in any given case,
        then the European Court of Human Rights would find that the United Kingdom had failed to secure the
        right or freedom and so was in violation of its international law obligation under the Convention. The
        only difference that the commencement of the Act made - and it was, of course, a significant difference
        -w a s to increase the range of provisions available in our domestic law to ensure that people within the
        jurisdiction enjoyed those rights and freedoms. On the international plane this meant that the United
         Kingdom should be better placed to fulfil its obligation under article 1 o f the Convention.

 77.    Over the years, Parliament has passed many Acts, and public authorities have taken many steps, to
        secure that, under our domestic law, people should enjoy the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the
        Convention. The legislation dealt with particular situations, whether or not brought to light by a ruling
        from Strasbourg. In 1998 Parliament adopted a more elegant and comprehensive solution. The Act
        reproduces as rights in our domestic law the rights that are to be found in certain specified articles in
        the Convention and in two of the Protocols: section 1(1) - (3). It then makes it unlawful for public
        authorities to act or to fail to act in a way which is incompatible with those rights: section 6(1) and (6).
        Those affected by a breach can rely on these rights; courts and tribunals can grant the relief, remedy or
        order that they consider just and appropriate if a public authority is found to have acted unlawfully by
        violating one of them: sections 7 and 8. In any given situation, therefore, a person may rely not only on
        all the pre-existing rights and remedies afforded by the common law and statute, but also on the
        relevant new domestic rights set out in schedule 1 to the A c t And, correspondingly, the courts can
        grant not only the remedies that would have been available to give effect to the pre-existing common
        law and statutory rights, but also the just and appropriate remedy to give effect to the relevant rights
        under the Act.

  78.   In the present case the respondent relies on his rights under the domestic law of Northern Ireland. In
        particular, he says that, by reason of the Convention right under article 2 as set out in schedule 1 to the
        Act ("article 2 Convention right"), he has the right to a prompt and effective investigation of his father's
        death. By refusing to carry out such an investigation, he says, the Secretary of State has acted, and
        continues to act, incompatibly with that right and so unlawfully in terms of section 6(1).

 79.    The respondent's father, Gervaise ^M c K e rr*, was shot by an RUC officer or officers in 1982. Your
        Lordships' House has established that, subject to section 22(4), which does not apply in the present
        case, the Act does not have retroactive effect. So none of its provisions applies to the position in 1982.
        This means that, in the domestic law of Northern Ireland, the legal rights and duties of the people
        involved in the events of 1982 are not altered by the Act. In particular, Gervaise t>M cKerr> did not
        enjoy, and is not now to be regarded as having enjoyed, any article 2 Convention right to life under the
        A c t It follows that his killing, however it may have come about, is not to be regarded as having been
        incompatible with that Convention right or as unlawful by reason of section 6(1).

  80.   The respondent accepts this, but he fastens on another aspect of article 2. Where the article applies, it
        is interpreted as requiring the relevant public authority to carry out an effective official investigation of
        any death which may have resulted from the use of force by agents of the state: McCann v United
        Kingdom (1996) 21 EHRR 97, 163, para 161. This obligation is variously described as procedural or
        adjectival, but its purpose is to ensure that the lawfulness of the use o f force by state agents resulting

http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi7doc—/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/12.html&query=...                         04/01/06
McKerr (Northern Ireland), Re [2004] UKHL 12(11 March 2004)                                          Page 16 of 18



        in death is reviewed. W ithout such a procedure the guarantee in article 2 would be ineffective. The
        Secretary of State does not dispute that interpretation of the article 2 Convention right. It follows, of
        course, that deaths will have to be investigated even though, as it turns out, the killing was lawful and
        not in breach of that right. To that extent the right to an investigation can properly be regarded as
        freestanding.

 81.    What the respondent claims, however, is an article 2 Convention right under the Act to have his father's
        death investigated even though, as he accepts, the killing did not violate, and is not to be regarded as
        having violated, any article 2 Convention right under the Act. Such a claim is fatally flawed and must be
        rejected.

 82.    Like Lord Brown I am doubtful whether, even in international law terms, there was by October 2000 any
        continuing breach of the relatives' right to an effective investigation of Gervaise *M cK errV s death
        under article 2 of the Convention. But, even supposing that there was, that continuing breach of an
        international obligation was not turned into a continuing breach of an article 2 Convention right in
        domestic law when the Act came into force. Any breach that there was remained a breach in
        international law and nothing more. The respondent relies on the Act as part of the domestic law of
        Northern Ireland. Under the Act the right to an investigation, deriving from an article 2 Convention right,
        presupposes that the killing could have been in violation of that selfsame Convention right. So, when
        the respondent's father was killed in 1982, his relatives had no right to an investigation under the Act.
        Moreover, since the Act is not retroactive, they are not now to be regarded as having had such a right
        in 1982 or at any time after that. Conversely, the Secretary of State is not to be regarded as having
        been in breach, or continuing breach, of such a right either in 1982 or at any time after that.

 83.    What the respondent is really saying, therefore, is that, when the Act came into force, it conferred on
        him a right under article 2 to have his father's death investigated even though his killing was not, and is
        not to be regarded as having been, in breach of any article 2 Convention right under the A c t Therefore,
        the respondent is not asking the courts to apply the A ct according to its terms, but to amend them so
        as to fit this case. That cannot be done. If Parliament had intended the rights under article 2 to be split
        up, with the Act applying differently to the different aspects, then it would have provided for this
        expressly. The potential objections are obvious. It would be curious to give a right, under the Act, to an
        investigation of a killing to which the Act did not apply. If there were to be such a right to an
        investigation, how far back would it go? Speculation is fruitless: what matters is that Parliament could
        have made, but did not make, any such transitional provision. The obvious conclusion is that the right
        to an investigation under the Act is confined to deaths which, having occurred after the commencement
        of the Act, may be found to be unlawful under the Act. The respondent seeks to contradict the policy of
        Parliament.

        LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD

        My Lords,

  84.   The respondent's father was one of three men shot dead in Armagh by RUC police officers from a
        special mobile support unit on 11 November 1982. Within a month three other men had been killed in
        two similar incidents. The police, it came to be alleged, were operating a shoot to kill policy.

 85.    Try as they might, those like the respondent concerned by these deaths have never managed to
        secure a fully satisfactory investigation into them.

  86.   The investigations in fact undertaken and the respondent's efforts to improve upon them have already
        been charted in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls. He has summarised too the
        judgment of the ECtHR (which became final on 4 August 2001) upon the application made by the
        respondent's mother on 7 March 1993 and continued by him after her death. Put shortly, the ECtHR
        found that the various investigations carried out, culminating in the final abandonment of the inquest on
        8 September 1994, failed in a number of respects to comply with the procedural obligation implied by
        Article 2 of the Convention. Awarding the respondent damages of £10,000, the Court said in para 181
        of its judgment:

               "[Tjhe Court has found that the national authorities failed in their obligation to carry out a
               prompt and effective investigation into the circumstances of the death. The applicant
               must thereby have suffered feelings of frustration, distress and anxiety. The Court
               considers that the applicant sustained some non-pecuniary damage which is not
               sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation as a result o f the Convention."

       The central question before your Lordships is whether following that judgment the Secretary of State
       for Northern Ireland (the appellant) is now under an obligation enforceable in domestic law to
       undertake a further investigation into this killing. By letter dated 5 September 2001 the respondent's
       solicitors contended that such further investigation is now required "to comply with [the ECtHR's]
       ruling". The appellant disputes this.

 88.   Campbell LJ at first instance concluded that the obligation to conduct an Article 2 compliant
       investigation "remained unfulfilled until such an investigation was carried out or a competent court
       vindicated the right in some other way", but that, the respondent having received a declaration and an
       order for just satisfaction from the ECtHR, the obligation then came to an end. The Court of Appeal
       allowed the respondent'^ qpp^ql T^py agrp^H with Campbell I .I that "there is a continuing breach of
       Article 2" but, unlike him, concluded that it had not come to an end and that the respondent would
       remain a victim so long as "no domestic remedy has been afforded to [him]".

 89.   It was not suggested to either court below that, whatever continuing obligation there might be on the
       international plane to conduct some further investigation, no such duty could arise under domestic law
       because the Human Rights Act 1998 (the 1998 Act) is not retrospective. That now is the principal
       argument advanced by the Attorney General on behalf of the appellant.

 90.   The argument essentially comes to this. Under domestic law it only became unlawful for a public
       authority to act incompatibly with a Convention right on 2 October 2000. Whatever the circumstances
       o f Mr t-M cK e itV s death, therefore, Article 2 o f the Convention was not engaged by it. On the domestic
       plane the appellant could not be said to have breached the substantive obligations arising under Article
       2. Nor, moreover, could he be said to have breached the procedural obligation to hold a sufficient
       inquiry into the death— an obligation which the ECtHR first found to be implicit in Article 2 in McCann v
        United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 97 (the Death on the Rock case) and has developed in subsequent
       case law to the point now reached in this very case, *-McKerf% v United Kingdom (2001) 34 EHRR 20
        (and the other three Northern Ireland cases determined in parallel with it). Plainly no Article 2 obligation
       to investigate ‘M /lcKerr'Vs death could arise under domestic law prior to 2 October 2000. But no more
       could it arise after that date. It is a procedural obligation properly to be regarded as secondary or
       ancillary or adjectival to the substantive obligation to protect life, an obligation arising directly out of the
        loss of a life. True it is that in McCann, where this procedural duty was first articulated, the ECtHR said
        that "where a victim dies in circumstances which are unclear. . . the lack of any effective procedure to
        investigate the cause of the deprivation of life could by itself raise an issue under Article 2 of the
       Convention" (para 193 of the Court's judgment), and true it is too that in the subsequent Strasbourg
       jurisprudence it has been described as a "freestanding" obligation. That, however, means no more than
       that the procedural duty arises independently of any demonstrable breach of the substantive
        obligations arising under Article 2. As slated in paragraph 111 o f McKen% itself:

              "The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of
              the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents
              or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility."

 91.   The duty to investigate is, in short, necessarily linked to the death itself and cannot arise under
       domestic law save in respect of a death occurring at a time when Article 2 rights were enforceable
       under domestic law, i.e. on and after 2 October 2000.

 92.   Such is the argument and to my mind it is irresistible. To say, as Mr Treacy QC for the respondent
       does, that the procedural obligation, once engaged, is a continuing one, regarded by the ECtHR here
       as still continuing at the date of their decision in 2001, is nothing to the point. Even were it so (and, as I
       shall shortly come to explain, for my part I doubt it is), that would be the position only on the
       international plane. It would say nothing as to whether, on the true interpretation and application of the
       1998 Act, a pre-2 October 2000 death could give rise to a procedural obligation to hold an Article 2
       compliant investigation enforceable under domestic law on and after 2 October 2000.

 93. As for Mr Treacy's alternative contention that, irrespective of whether a right to an Article 2 compliant
     investigation now arises under section 6 o f the 1998 Act, a duty to hold such an investigation in any
     event arises at common law, and indeed has remained unfulfilled ever since Mr ^M cK e rry's death,
     this in my opinion fails both on authority and principle. By the same token that this House in R v Lyons
     [2003] 1 AC 976. declined, by reference to a subsequent ECtHR ruling, to hold a pre-1998 Act trial,
     conducted in accordance with the domestic laws and standards then applicable, unsafe, so too here it
     would be wrong for your Lordships to condemn as contrary to the common law a series of procedures
     long since properly concluded in accordance with well-established domestic laws and never challenged

http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/12.html&query=...                          04/01/06
McKerr (Northern Ireland), Re [2004] UKHL 12 (11 March 2004)                                      Page 18 of 18



        save by reference to a substantially later ECHR decision. Nor would it be right to impute to the
        common law a requirement for the same form of investigation of fatalities as the ECtHR has now found
        implicit in Article 2. Such a fiction would be unwarranted however profound one's desire to interpret
        domestic law down the years consistently with our international obligations.

 94.    I return, as promised, to indicate why for my part I would question Mr Treacy's assertion that the
        ECtHR's judgment should be understood as a finding that the United Kingdom remains under an
        international law obligation to hold a further investigation into Mr ^MMcKerrVs death. Immaterial though,
        for reasons already explained, the correctness of this assertion is to the determination of the appeal, it
        would be unfortunate if the impression were gained that it was necessarily accepted by your Lordships.
        The following points should h ° mgde Fir^t. that the FC.tHR hy reference to a number of identified
        shortcomings in the various investigative processes long since concluded in this case, found "that there
        has been a failure to comply with the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 of the Convention and
        that there has been, in this respect, a violation of that provision." (para 161). There is nothing in the
        judgment to suggest that this violation is to be regarded as a continuing one.

 95.    Secondly, it is plain that, 20 years on from Mr *.M cKen-*'s death, no fresh inquiry could possibly
        comply fully with the now established requirements of an Article 2 investigation. Perhaps most
        obviously, the opportunity for a prompt independent investigation has been irretrievably lost; this
        element o f a compliant inquiry would necessarily be missing.

 96.    Thirdly, it has now been left by the Court to the Committee of Ministers to supervise the execution of its
        judgment pursuant to Article 46 (2) o f the Convention. That Committee may or may not sanction the
        United Kingdom's present proposal, which is to hold no further inquiry into Mr “kM cK errV s death. But
         even if it does not, such further inquiry as may be stipulated could only be by way of partial redress or
         remedy for past failures. Merely because the Committee o f Ministers may judge some further inquiry
        "effective” does not mean that it would be compliant.

  97.   In short, the most that is achievable now on the international plane is further redress for past non-
        compliance. It accordingly follows th a t even were the domestic court, despite the non-retrospectivity of
        the 1998 Act, able to entertain Article 2 complaints in respect of pre-October 2000 deaths, the
        respondent would in any event be unable to establish ttia t an Article 2 procedural obligation in respect
        of M r‘M flcK err's death arose after October 2000. The complaint would not be of a proposed post-
        October 2000 unlawful act (the refusal to comply with the implied procedural obligation to investigate)
        but rather o f a pre-October 2000 breach and manifestly the respondent could have no right in domestic
        law to complain about that.

  98.   This conclusion, however, as I have already acknowledged, is not essential to the disposal o f the
        present appeal. It is for the reasons earlier given, which accord with those given in the speech of my
        noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann, that I too would allow the appeal and dismiss the
        respondent's application for judicial review.

       Lord Justice Maurice Kay :

  1.   This case raises a short but important point. Where a coroner is conducting an inquest into a death
       which occurred before the coming into force of the Human Rights A ct 1998 on 2 October 2000, is the
       approach to the question how the deceased came by his or her death, which is posed by section 11 (5)

http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/833.html...                 04/01/06

        (b)(ii) of the Coroners A ct 1988, to be considered by reference to the pre-Human Rights Act test as
        adumbrated in Regina v. North Humberside Coroner, ex parte Jamieson [1995] QB 1 or by reference to
        the more recent test developed by reference to the Human Rights Act in Regina (Middleton) v. West
        Somerset Coroner r20041 2 WLR 800, f20041 UKHL 10, and Regina (Sacker) v. West Yorkshire
        Coroner r20Q411 WLR 796, f2Q041 UKHL 11? Jamieson decided that "how" in section 11(5)(b)(ii)
        meant "by what means" and not "in what broad circumstances". Revisiting the statute with the
        additional interpretative technique provided by section 3 of the Human Rights Act in the context of the
        Convention right enshrined in Article 2, the House of Lords in Middleton and Sacker concluded that
        "how" should now be given the wider meaning of "by what means and in what circumstances"


        took place on 25 April 2002. As it happens, both Middleton and Sacker also concerned deaths which
        had occurred before 2 October 2002 and inquests which took place after that date but no one in those
        cases took the point of retrospectivity. In the event, the House of Lords left the point as an open one. In
        Middleton, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said (at paragraph 50):

               "In this appeal no question was raised on the retrospective application of the Human
               Rights Act 1998 and the Convention. They were assumed to be applicable. Nothing in
               this opinion should be understood to throw doubt on the conclusion of the House in In re
               *» M cK e n *."

        In Sacker, he said (at paragraph 29):

               'The respondent's contention     that this was a case of an ongoing breach of Article 2
               has not been challenged at any stage of these proceedings. But there has been no
               decision on the point, and nothing that has been said in this opinion should be taken as
               having had that effect."

        The plot thickens. Middleton and Sac/cerwere heard together by the same Appellate Committee on 2,3
        and 4 February 2004 and the decisions were handed down on 11 March 2004. On 2 and 3 February
        2004, just along the corridor, a differently constituted Appellate Committee was hearing In re t*M cK err
           [20041 1 WLR 807. [2004] UKHL 12. Its decision was also handed down on 11 March 2004 This
        curious chronology has resulted in rival submissions in the present case, with Mr Hoskins on behalf of
        the Coroner relying on ^ M c K e m , which Mr Cragg says is irrelevant to the issue before us! Before
        turning to these submissions, it is appropriate to say a little more about the tragic death of Kelly
        Pearson.

   3.   Kelly was born on 30 August 1969. She was a troubled young woman who had mental health problems
        associated with or compounded by substance misuse. Between May and July 1999 some five warrants
        for her arrest were issued by three different magistrates courts in London. She was arrested on 9
        August and on 7 September her case was considered in Bow Street Magistrates Court. The outcome
        of that hearing was that sentence upon her was deferred until 6 January 2000. It is not entirely clear
        whether that was in relation to one or more prosecutions but it is common ground that by 7 September
        the five warrants for her arrest had ceased to be live. Nevertheless, in October her details were still
        being circulated on the Police National Computer for failure to surrender in connection with the matter
        for which sentence had been deferred on 7 September 1999. Kelly was bailed on 7 September and
        returned to her family home in West Yorkshire. On 5 November 1999 she was arrested there. Initially
        she was detained at Eccleshill Police Station until 8 November when, a PNC search having wrongly
        revealed an outstanding warrant, she was transported to Belgravia Police Station in London. She was
        detained overnight there and produced before the Horseferry Road Magistrates Court on 9 November.
        By about 10.15.a.m. the error over the warrant was discovered and Kelly was released from custody.
        She remained in the court building for some time after that whilst various individuals and agencies
        considered the cost and logistics of her return to Yorkshire. In the event she did not return to Yorkshire.
        She remained in London overnight. She had lunch in a hostel on 10 November and visited a drop in
        clinic for homeless people at about 4.00.p.m.. At about 6.30.p.m. she was discovered by a police
        officer in Wardour Street. She was clearly in a bad way and, less than an hour later, she was
        pronounced dead at University College Hospital. An inquest was opened and adjourned by Her
        Majesty's Coroner for Greater London (Inner North District) on 15 November 1999. It was resumed on
        25 April 2002. The cause of death was found to be methadone, diazepam and alcohol poisoning. The
        jury returned a verdict of misadventure. The present proceedings are brought under section 13 of the
        Coroners' Act 1988. The fiat of the Attorney General was given on 20 May 2004.

   4.   The material parts of section 13 provide as follows:

http://w ww .bailii.org/cgi-bin/m arkup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EW HC/Admin/2005/833 .htm l...                 04/01/06
Pearson v HM Coroner for Inner London North [2005] EWHC 833 (Admin) (Hearing ... Page 3 of 8



  W             "(1) This section applies, where, on an application by or under the authority of the
                Attorney General, the High Court is satisfied as respects a Coroner ('the Coroner
                concerned') either -

                               (a) ....or

                              (b) where an inquest has been held by him, that (whether by
                              reason of fraud, rejection of evidence, irregularity of
                              proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry, the discovery of new
                              facts or evidence or otherwise) it is necessary or desirable in
  ------------------          the interes t o f justice ihat another i nquest should be held."-----------------------------------

       The claimant is the mother of Kelly Pearson. Understandably, she expected that the inquest would
       provide her with answers as to how a vulnerable young woman came to be arrested on a warrant that
       was no longer live, how this remained undiscovered until the hearing in Horseferry Road Magistrates
       Court on 9 November and how, notwithstanding the involvement of various agencies, Kelly was left to
       wander the streets of London until her collapse in Wardour Street on the evening of 10 November. She
       complains that the inquest did not provide her with the answers to which she is entitled because of
       "insufficiency of inquiry" within the meaning of section 13(1 )(b). Her challenge to the inquest is put on
       alternative bases. Fjret, it is said that the Coroner erred in law by giving the words "how... .the
       deceased came by (her) death" their pre-Human Rights Act meaning as adumbrated in Jamieson when
       they should have been given the wider meaning now required by Article 2 in accordance with the
       decisions of the House of Lords in Middleton and Sacker. It is common ground that the Coroner
       considered it appropriate to conduct a Jamieson style inquest rather than one conditioned by Article 2.
       Perhaps this is most evident from his words:

                 "I'm into enquiries into matters that directly caused the death, really..."

       Thus, the first issue is whether a post-Human Rights Act Inquest into a death which occurred before
       the coming into force of the Human Rights Act must be Article 2 compliant. Secondly, it is said that,
       even if the law required no more than a Jamieson style inquest, what occurred fell short of the
       Jamieson requirements. I therefore turn to these two issues.

        Issue 1: Article 2

   5. This is an issue of pure law. On behalf of the Coroner, Mr. Hoskins does not suggest that the inquest
      was Article 2 compliant. His case is that, by reason of the chronology, Article 2 was not engaged. In
      view of the common ground I shall be brief in describing the Article 2 approach. Section 11 (5)(b)(ii)
      requires that an inquisition

                 "shall set out so far as such particulars have been proved... how...the deceased came by
                 his death"

        There is resort to the same wording in Rule 36 of the Coroners Rules 1984. The metamorphosis in the
        approach to the "how" question as a result of the coming into force of the Human Rights Act was
        described by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in Middleton (at paras 34-35):

                 "It is correct that the scheme enacted by and under the authority of Parliament should be
                 respected save to the extent that a change of interpretation (authorised by section 3 of
                 the Human Rights Act 1998) is required to honour the international obligations of the
                 United Kingdom expressed in the Convention.

                 Only one change is in our opinion needed: to interpret 'how' in section 11 (5)(b)(ii) of the
                 Act and rule 36(1)(b) of the Rules in the broader sense previously rejected, namely as
                 meaning not simply 'by what means' but 'by what means and in what circumstances'."

        He then went on to describe how, depending on a particular case, it is for the Coroner, in the exercise
        of his discretion, to decide how best to elicit the jury's conclusion on the central issue or issues. This
        may be done in a number of ways including, for example:

                 " by inviting the jury's answer to factual questions put by the Coroner....it would be open
                 to parties appearing or represented at the inquest to make submissions to the Coroner on

Pearson v HM Coroner for Inner London North [2005] EWHC 833 (Admin) (Hearing ... Page 4 of 8



  w              the means of eliciting the jury's factual conclusions and on any questions to be put, but
                 the choice must be that of the Coroner and his decision should not be disturbed by the
                 Courts unless strong grounds are shown." (paragraph 36)

       In Sacker he observed (at paragraph 28):

                  'The inquest was not able to identify the cause or causes of (the deceased's) suicide, the
                  steps (if any) that could have been taken and were not taken to prevent it and the
                  precautions (if any) that ought to be taken to avoid or reduce the risk to other prisoners.
                  The most convenient and appropriate way to make good this deficiency is... to order a
  ----------------new inquest " -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       That is precisely the kind of approach which Mr Cragg submits would be necessary to render an
       inquest in the present case Article 2 compliant.

  6.   As I indicated at the outset of this judgment, in Middleton and Sacker no point was taken about the
       possible non-application of Article 2 to deaths which occurred before 2 October 2000. The matter was
       expressly left open by the House o f Lords on both occasions. Before examining the rival submissions
       in the present case, it is necessary to refer to In re ^McKerr%.

  7.    The matrix of In re ^M cK eri% was not the operation of section 11 (5) of the Coroners Act. The case
        concerned men who had been shot dead by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1982. An
        inquest had been opened in 1984 but, following adjournments, a re-opened inquest was abandoned in
        1994. On an international level, the Strasbourg Court held in May 2001 that there had been a violation
        of Article 2 because of a failure to comply with the obligation implicit in that Article to hold an effective
        official investigation when a person has been killed by the use of force. The Strasbourg Court did not
        carry out such an investigation. Accordingly, the family of the deceased made a domestic application
        for judicial review claiming relief in the form of declarations that the continuing failure of the Secretary
        of State for Northern Ireland to provide an Article 2 complaint investigation was unlawful and in breach
        of section 6 of the Human Rights A ct 1998 and Article 2, together with a mandatory order compelling
        him to conduct such an investigation. In other words, the case was not about a statutory inquest but
        about an alleged free standing right to an investigation by reference to Article 2. At he heart of the case
        was the issue of retrospectivity: could the family rely upon section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act to
        enforce Article 2 rights in relation to a death which occurred in 1982? The House of Lords held that it
        could not. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said (at paragraphs 21-22):

                 "In my view the answer lies in appreciating that the obligation to hold an investigation is
                 an obligation triggered by the occurrence o f a violent death. The obligation to hold an
                 investigation does not exist in the absence of such a death. The obligation is
                 consequential upon the death. If the death itself is not within the reach of section 6,
                 because it occurred before the Act came into force, it would be surprising if section 6
                 applied to an obligation consequential upon the death. Rather, one would expect to find
                 that, for section 6 to apply, the death which is the subject of investigation must itself be a
                 death to which section 6 applies. The event giving rise to the Article 2 obligation to
                 investigate must have occurred post Act.

                 I think this is the preferable interpretation of section 6 in the context of Article 2. This
                 interpretation has the effect, for the transitional purpose now under consideration, of
                 treating all the obligations arising under Article 2 as parts of a single whole. Parliament
                 cannot be taken to have intended that the Act should apply differently, to the primary
                 obligation (to protect life) and a consequential obligation (to investigate a death)."

        Lord Hoffman referred to a number of other occasions upon which the House of Lords has held that the
        Human Rights Act is not retrospective, adding (at paragraph 67):

                 "So the primary right to life conferred by Article 2 can have had no application to a person
                 who died before the Act came into force. His killing may have been a crime, a tort, a
                 breach of international law but it could not have been a breach of section 6 of the Act.
                 Why then should the ancillary right to an investigation of the death apply to a person who
                 died before the Act came into force? In my opinion it does not... .1 therefore agree with the
                 opinion of Silber J in R (Khan) v. Secretary o f State fo r Health [2003] EWHC 1414
                 fAdmin) that the duty to investigate under Article 2 did not arise in domestic law in respect
                 of deaths before 2 October 2002."

Pearson v HM Coroner for Inner London North [2005] EWHC 833 (Admin) (Hearing ... Page 5 of 8



       Lord Rodger of Earlsferry said (at paragraph 81):

               "If Parliament had intended the rights under Article 2 to be split up, with the Act applying
               differently to the different aspects, then it would have provided for this expressly. The
               potential objections are obvious. It would be curious to give a right under the Act to an
               investigation of a killing to which the Act did not apply... .the obvious conclusion is that the
               right to an investigation under the Act is confined to deaths which, having occurred after
               the commencement of the Act, may be found to be unlawful under that Act."

       Finally, in the speech of Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood the following passages appeared
       (paragraph s 88-89):----------------------------------- ----------------------------- ;----- -----------------------------------------------

                "Plainly no Article 2 obligation to investigate ^-McKerrVs death could arise under
                domestic law prior to 2 October 2000. But no more could it arrive after that date. It is a
                procedural obligation properly to be regarded as secondary or ancillary or adjectival to
                the substantive obligation to protect life, an obligation arising directly out of the loss of a
                life   the duty to investigate is, in short, necessarily linked to the death itself and cannot
                arise under domestic law save in respect of a death occurring at a time when Article 2
                rights were enforceable under domestic law, i.e. on and after 2 October 2000."

  8.   The submission of Mr Hoskins is that the point expressly left open by one Committee of the House of
       Lords in Middleton and Sacker was in effect resolved on the very same day by a different Committee in
       *-McKerr%. Mr Cragg's response is that this is to misunderstand the different contexts of the cases.
       ^M cKeri% is about an alleged breach of Article 2 by a public authority (the Secretary of State for
       Northern Ireland) in refusing to establish a non-statutory inquiry. Its context is section 6 of the Human
       Rights Act. Middleton, Sacker and the present case, on the other hand, are about the statutory duties
       of a Coroner under the 1988 Act and how the relevant provisions should be interpreted by reference to
       section 3 of the Human Rights Act.

  9.    I do not feel able to accept Mr Cragg's submission. One does not reach the stage of resort to section 3
       as a tool for interpretation unless and until it is established that the Human Rights Act applies. In
       Middleton and Sacker it was simply assumed, without demur, that it applies on a retrospective basis
       but with the point expressly left open. However, the point was very clearly decided in “M 9cKm%. It
       comes to this. When Article 2 provides that ''everyone's right to life shall be protected by law", it
       embraces both a positive obligation on the state to protect everyone's life and a procedural requirement
       that there should be some form of effective official investigation when an individual has been killed. The
       present case is concerned with that procedural obligation. It is not the primary obligation imposed by
       Article 2 but, in the words of Lords Nicholls, "a consequential obligation". Or in the words of Lord
       Brown, a "secondary or ancillary or adjectival'' obligation. The logic o f *~McKerr% is inexorable. If the
       positive obligation did not arise in domestic law prior to 2 October 2000, the consequential, secondary,
       ancillary or adjectival obligation cannot now give rise to a domestic obligation because it is
       consequential upon and secondary, ancillary and adjectival to the substantive obligation to protect life. I
       am driven to the conclusion that if the Appellate Committee in Middleton and Sacker had been required
       to address this question, it would have yielded to the same inexorable logic. Mr Cragg seeks to avoid it
       by characterising the breach of Article 2 as a continuing one which straddles the coming into force of
       the Human Rights Act. However, I am not persuaded by that analysis which, it seems to me, was
       rejected in McKeri% (see the speech of Lord Brown at paragraph 92). Alternatively, Mr Cragg
       submits that the Human Rights Act can operate retrospectively where no injustice would arise (see
       Wilson v First County Trust Limited (No 2)) [2004] 1 AC 816, per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at
       paragraphs 17-22, citing with approval the judgment of Staughton LJ in Secretary o f State for Social
       Security v Tunnicliffe [1991] 2 All ER 712-724). However, whilst acknowledging that there is scope for
       such retrospectivity, I cannot find it in the present context in view of the subsequent and very
       compelling speeches in *-McKert%. The present context is quite different from that in Wilson (which
       concerned the application of section 6 to a court order made after October 2000 in relation to a hire
       purchase agreement made before that date).

 10.   On the first issue, I therefore conclude that the Human Rights Act does not require a Coroner now
       investigating a death which occurred before the coming into force o f the Act to conduct an inquest in an
       Article 2 compliant manner. It may be that his failure to do so may be actionable in international
       proceedings in Strasbourg, just as the failure of the Secretary of State resulted in a successful
       application to Strasbourg in ^McKerr. However, that does not assist the claimant in the domestic
       context. Before leaving this issue, I observe that in Regina (on the application o f Challender) v Legal
       Services Commission [2002] EWHC 925 (Admin), Richards J expressed a similar view, albeit obiter,
       observing that he would have reached the same conclusion whether the matter were being considered

http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bm/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/833.html...                                                    04/01/06
Pearson v HM Coroner for Inner London North [2005] EWHC 833 (Admin) (Hearing ... Page 6 of 8



       by reference to section 6 or section 3. Moreover, the conclusion I have reached is also reflected in the
       decision of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland in Police Service o f Northern Ireland v. McCaughey
       [2005] N IC A 1 (which differed from the earlier conclusion of another constitution of the Court of Appeal
       in Northern Ireland in Jordan [20041 NICA 29).

       Issue 2: Was the Inquest Jamieson compliant?

 11.   The fallback submission on behalf of the claimant is that there was "insufficiency of inquiry" even by
       reference to the pre-Human Rights Act requirements set out in Jamieson. In that case the Court of
       Appeal considered the provisions of section 11 of the Coroners Act and rule 36 of the Coroners Rules

       deceased came by his death" Rule 36 is in the following terms:

              "(1) The proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be directed solely to ascertaining
              the following matters namely -

                            (a) who the deceased was;

                            (b) how, when and where the deceased came by his death;

                            (c) the particulars for the time being required by the
                            Registration Acts to be registered concerning the death.

                     (2) Neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on any other
                     matters."

       Giving the judgment of the Court in Jamieson, Sir Thomas Bingham MR said (at pages 23-25):

              "(1) An inquest is a fact-finding enquiry conducted by a coroner with or without a jury to
              establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual questions   the fourth
              question, and that to which evidence and enquiry are most often and most closely
              directed, relates to how the deceased came by his death. Rule 36 requires that the
              proceedings and evidence shall be directed solely to ascertaining these matters and
              forbids any expression of opinion on any other matter.

              (2) Both in section 11 (5)(b)(ii) of the Act of 1988 and in rule 36(1 )(b) of the Rules of 1984,
              'how' is to be understood as meaning 'by what means'. It is noteworthy that the task is not
              to ascertain how the deceased died, which might raise general and far-reaching issues,
              but 'how...the deceased came by his death', a more limited question directed to the
              means by which the deceased came by his death....

              (6) There can be no objection to a verdict which incorporated a brief, neutral, factual
              statement; 'the deceased was drowned when his sailing dingy capsized in heavy s e a s ','
              the deceased was killed when he was run down by an express train on a level crossing',
              'the deceased died from crush injuries sustained when gates were opened at
              Hillsborough Stadium'. But such verdict must be factual, expressing no judgment or
              opinion, and it is not the jury's function to prepare detailed factual statements.....

              (14) It is the duty of the coroner as the public official responsible for the conduct of
              inquests, whether he is sitting with a jury or without to ensure that the relevant facts are
              fully, fairly and fearlessly investigated. He is bound to recognise the acute public concern
              rightly aroused where deaths occur in custody. He must ensure that the relevant facts are
              exposed to public scrutiny, particularly if there is evidence of foul play, abuse or
              inhumanity. He fails in his duty if his investigation is superficial, slipshod or perfunctory.
              But the responsibility is his. He must set the bounds o f the inquiry. He must rule on the
              procedure to be followed. His decisions, like those of any other judicial officer, must be
              respected unless and until they are varied or overruled."

       In Regina v. Inner West London Coroner ex parte Dallaglio [1994] 4 All ER 139, Sir Thomas Bingham
       MR expressly agreed with the lead judgment given by Simon Brown LJ who, considering Jamieson
       said (at page 154):


http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/833.html...                        04/01/06
Pearson v HM Coroner for Inner London North [2005] EWHC 833 (Admin) (Hearing ... Page 7 of 8



 W           'The inquiry is almost bound to stretch wider than strictly required for the purposes of a
             verdict. How much wider is pre-eminently a matter for the Coroner whose rulings upon
             the question will only exceptionally be susceptible to Judicial Review."

       Sir Thomas Bingham MR added (at page 164):

             "It is for the Coroner conducting an inquest to decide, on the facts of a given case, at
             what point the chain of causation becomes too remote to form a proper part of his
             investigation. That question, potentially a very difficult question, is for h im ."

        Finally, it is appropriate to refer to an earlier judgment of Simon Brown LJ which was to inform the
       judgment of the Court of Appeal in Jamieson. In Regina v Her Majesty's Coroner fo r Western District o f
       East Sussex ex parte Homberg, Roberts and Manners (unreported 26 January 1994) he said
       (transcript pages 19-20):

             "In short the inquiry must focus on matters directly causative o f death and must, indeed,
             be confined to these matters alone (save only for ascertainment of the other specific
             details mentioned in rule 36(1)). The recent, eleventh edition of Jervis on Coroners puts it
             thus:

                            T he question of how the deceased came by his death is of
                            course wider than merely finding the medical cause of death,
                            and it is therefore right and proper that the coroner should
                            enquire into acts or omissions which are directly responsible
                            for the death'."

 12.   There is no doubt that the Coroner in the present case had these principles well in mind. For example,
       the transcript discloses one exchange with counsel then representing the family in which the Coroner
       said:

              "It is my role, it is within my remit to determine matters that are directly causative to death
              but not to enquire into every underlying circumstances which may be thought of, however
              remotely, which may have responsibility for the death."

       It simply cannot be said that the Coroner misdirected himself as to the Jamieson requirements. The
       issue is whether he properly applied them. Mr Cragg submits that there should have been a fuller
       investigation into how Kelly came to be arrested on a warrant which had already been executed, how
       she came to be detained for as long as she was and how she came to be released to fend for herself
       following her appearance at Horseferry Road. He further submits that there was an inadequate
       investigation into Kelly's mental health at the time.

 13. Having regard to the principles set out in Jamieson and the other authorities to which I have referred, I
     am entirely satisfied that the Coroner was entitled to proceed as he did. He received a considerable
     amount of evidence relating to Kelly’s background and to the events of the last two days of her life.
     Several witnesses gave evidence about 9 and 10 November. They included the custody officer at
     Belgravia Police Station, the solicitor who had dealt with Kelly at Horseferry Road Magistrates Court, a
     probation officer who also saw her there, a doctor who acted as Force Medical Examiner at Belgravia
     Police Station, a mental health project worker who had seen Kelly at the Day Centre which she visited
     on 10 November and a doctor who had dealt with her at the Drop In Centre very shortly before her
     collapse in Wardour Street. The Coroner was undoubtedly entitled to conclude that, under the pre-
     Human Rights Act law, it was unnecessary for there to be a detailed investigation into how the warrant
     came to be executed erroneously.

 14. After the verdict of misadventure had been returned, the coroner closed the inquest with these words:

             "From the evidence we heard, Kelly certainly needed help but there is no evidence to
             suggest that all the professionals, or indeed the health care professionals, had done
             anything other than acted in good faith, professionally and tried to help her within quite
             difficult circumstances. Kelly died as a result of a drug overdose, by her own volition,
             which is very sad and tragic indeed. Clearly, no one who had any knowledge of this tragic
             death could not but have the deepest sympathy for Kelly's mother who clearly was at the
             end of her tether trying to do the best for her. Her frustration was compounded by the

http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/833.html...                        04/01/06
Pearson v HM Coroner for Inner London North [2005] EWHC 833 (Admin) (Hearing ... Page 8 of 8



                 unfortunate 'cock up' of the inappropriate warrant which then -brought Kelly to London
                 where she died. Kelly's mother's distress and, indeed, palpable anger, was entirely
                 understandable, and the Court Services at the very least, owe her a big apology indeed.
                 No doubt there will be an inquiry into this matter, which is entirely outside of the remit of
                 my court and I shall comment no more and         I wish them luck in their quest in seeking
                 answers to address her concern."

        There are two things to be said about this passage. The first is that M r Cragg seeks to rely upon the
        final part - "no doubt there will be an enquiry into this matter1' - as being an ironical admission of the
        inadequacy of the investigation that had taken place at the inquest. In the light of what I have said

         applied them to this case, Mr Cragg can gain no mileage from the passage. Secondly, and most
         importantly, I wish to associate myself with the deep sympathy expressed by the Coroner. I well
         appreciate that the claimant, as a loving parent, will continue to feel aggrieved by the scope of the
         inquest. It will be no consolation to her that if Kelly had died after 2 October 2000, different
         considerations would have applied to the parameters of the inquest. Sadly, however, the less generous
         law which applies to the inquest in the present case fails to provide her with all the answers to which
         she, understandably, feels entitled. I am sorry to say that her appeal must be dismissed.

         Mr Justice Moses:

  15.    I agree.

JUDICIAL REVIEW

                                     AND

     IN THE MATTER OF A DECISION TAKEN BY THE CORONER


GIRVAN T

[1]    In order to understand the issues raised in these appeals it is necessary
to briefly state the background to and content of the judicial review
proceedings w hich led to the coroner's decision and to the rulings by Kerr J
(as he then was) in respect of those judicial review applications. The legal
landscape w ithin w hich the coroner m ade his decision and w ithin which
Kerr J gave his ruling has changed as a result of decisions reached by the
courts in the intervening period, m ost im portantly the decisions of the House
of Lords in three separate appeals in w hich the H ouse sought to give
guidance on the vexed question of the relationship betw een dom estic inquests
and the European Convention on H um an Rights ("the Convention").

[2]     Kerr J in his judgm ents delivered on 29 January 2002 and 8 M arch 2002
set out som ething of the legal and factual background to the m atters. The
inquest arose out of the death of Pearse Jordan w ho died on 25 November
1992 in the course of an incident involving m em bers of the RUC w ho caused
the death of the deceased in controversial circumstances w hich are hotly
contested. An inquest commenced as long ago as 4 January 1995. That
inquest has been adjourned on a num ber of occasions. Prior to the
comm encement of the inquest the applicant, the father of the deceased,
lodged an application before the European C ourt of H um an rights ("the
European Court") alleging a breach of article 2 of the Convention
(Application No 24746 - 94). The European C ourt in its decision reported in
[2003] 37 EHRR 52 concluded that the article 2 obligation to protect life
required by implication that there should be some form of effective official
investigation w hen individuals have been killed as a result of the use of lethal
force by agents of the state. The essential purpose of such investigations is to
secure the effective im plem entation of the domestic laws w hich protect the
right to life and in those cases involving state agents or bodies to ensure their
accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility.              The
investigation m ust be capable of leading to a determ ination as to w hether the
force used in such cases was or w as not justified in the circumstances and to
the detection and punishm ent of those responsible. The European Court
concluded that the proceedings in that case for investigating the use of lethal
force by the police officers had been shqw n to disclose a num ber of
shortcomings. There was a lack of independence in the investigation and a
lack of public scrutiny and inform ation to the victim 's family of the reasons
for the decision not to prosecute any police officers. The police officer who
shot the deceased could not be required to attend the inquest as a witness.
The inquest procedure did not allow any verdict or findings w hich could play
an effective role in securing a prosecution in respect of any crim inal defence
w hich m ight be disclosed.       The inquest proceedings did not commence
prom ptly and were not pursued w ith reasonable expedition. The absence of
legal aid for the representation of the next of kin and the non-disclosure of
witness statem ents prior to their appearance prejudiced the ability of the
applicants to participate in the inquest.

[3]    Following a num ber of adjournm ents sought by the Lord Chancellor
w ho w anted tim e to consider the implications of the European C ourt's ruling
the coroner fixed a prelim inary hearing oh 9 and 10 October 2001. He
adjourned the issue of the compellability of the participants in the alleged
shooting and the issue of the nature of the verdict until the Lord Chancellor's
intentions had been clarified. He proceeded to hear the intended parties on
the question of the scope of the inquest, the issue of access to docum entation,
screening, arrangem ents and public interest immunity. O n the issue of the



                                       2
scope or rem it of the inquest he decided he could not reach a decision on that
issue until he had sight of all relevant m aterial and decided to w rite to the
public authorities to ask them to m ake available docum entation to him and
having considered the docum entation w ould m ake a decision on the scope of
the inquest. He adjourned the other applications for consideration to another
prelim inary hearing on 9 and 10 January 2002. By then it had become clear
that the Lord Chancellor intended to am end Rule 9(2) of the Coroners' Rules
so as to rem ove the exem ption from compellability of those persons suspected
of causing the death of the deceased. Those am endm ents w ere to be
introduced expeditiously once proper consultation on the draft had taken
place. Those rules have in fact since been changed. In relation to the other
issues under consideration the coroner was referred to a num ber of decisions
in the English courts including ex parte W right (2001), Am in (2001) and ex
parte M iddleton (2001) Am in and M iddleton subsequently w ent to the House
of Lords. The coroner on 29 January 2002, the issue of access to the
docum entation and inform ation still being unresolved, adjourned the inquest
until M arch 2002. He considered that w ith the attendance of the participants
in the shooting as witnesses the inquest should be able to effectively enquire
into the facts which were relevant to the lawfulness of the force that caused
the death of the deceased. Although the inquest will be a fact finding exercise
as opposed to a m ethod of apportioning guilt it could, in his view,
nevertheless investigate the lawfulness of the force w hich caused the death of
Mr Jordan. According to his affidavit sw orn on 18 February 2002 the coroner
was not persuaded by the argum ents advanced on behalf of the next of kin of
the deceased to the effect in order for the inquest to be article 2 compatible,
the jury should have expressly m ade available to them the pow er to bring in a
verdict of unlaw ful killing or an open verdict.

[4]    In the application 2002 No 10 the applicant challenged the decision of
the coroner on 9 January 2002 on a num ber of issues. In essence so far as is
relevant to this appeal this challenge was directed to the decision of the
coroner to proceed on the basis of the existing coroners' law and practice in
N orthern Ireland and not to make available to the jury the possibility of
bringing in a verdict such as unlaw ful killing or an open verdict. The
applicant sought an order that the coroner be directed to hold an inquest
complying w ith the article 2 requirem ents of the Convention which, it was
alleged, required such a verdict.

[5]    In a separate application 2001 No 188 the applicant challenged the
failure of the Lord Chancellor to introduce the necessary legislation to ensure
that the inquest system in N orthern Ireland complied w ith article 2 of the
Convention and sought an order of m andam us against the Lord Chancellor to
oblige him to comply w ith the article 2.

[6]    In relation to the case against the Lord Chancellor Kerr J held that the
im plem entation of the European C ourt's ruling in Tordan clearly called for the



                                       3
•   rem oval of the exception in Rule 9(2) so that a person w ho was suspected of
    and causing the death of the deceased should norm ally be required to give
    evidence at an inquest into the death w here an assessm ent of his reliability or
    credibility w as required. He concluded that the response of the UK
    governm ent to the judgm ent in the Tordan case was appropriate. There had
    not been undue delay in m aking the proposal to am end Rule 9(2). W hen he
    heard the case the abolition of the rule in respect of the compellability of
    witnesses such as Sergeant A (who was involved in the alleged shooting) was
    im m inent and w ould be in place before the inquest was held. In his view it
    was inappropriate to make any declaration against the Lord Chancellor in the
    circumstances. Kerr J accepted that in the absence of any proposal by the
    Police O m budsm an to conduct an enquiry into the death of the deceased the
    inquest was the obvious forum in w hich the investigation into his death
    should take place. It did not follow that an order to establish the facts
    relevant to the lawfulness of the force that caused the death of the deceased a
    verdict of unlaw ful killing m ust be available to the jury. O n his interpretation
    of Tordan the European Court accepted that a procedure w hich did not
    include a m ethod of apportioning guilt is not, on that account alone,
    incompatible w ith article 2. Provided the inquest investigated the lawfulness
    of the force that caused the death of the deceased it is not necessary that the
    jury should express any view as to the guilt of any individual w ho m ay have
    been responsible for the death. W hat was vital was that the inquest should be
    able to play its p art in the identification of criminal offences and to contribute
    to any prosecution of the offender by bringing the offences to the attention of
    those w ho w ere responsible for directing prosecutions. The prosecuting
    authority should be required to give reasons which are amenable to challenge
    in the courts. In N orthern Ireland there is lacking any direct nexus between
    the investigation carried out by a properly conducted inquest and the
    decision to be taken by the DPP in relation to the prosecution of a criminal
    offence identified in the course of the inquest. By a properly conducted
    inquest Kerr J m eant one that w ould investigate the facts that w ere relevant to
    the lawfulness of the force that caused the death of the deceased. He
    concluded that such an investigation was possible w ithin the existing rules.
    Giving the jury the right to return a verdict of unlaw ful killing did not fill the
    gap that existed. That gap was filled by ensuring that the DPP was required
    to consider the possibility of launching a prosecution in respect of criminal
    offences identified in the course of the inquest or to explain the reason for a
    decision not to prosecute.         He concluded, accordingly, that the Lord
    Chancellor w as not under an obligation to introduce subordinate legislation
    to allow inquest juries pow er to return a verdict of unlaw ful killing.

    [7]    Since Kerr J gave his ruling in the m atter the law relating to coroners'
    duties in relation to inquests has fallen for consideration by the House of
    Lords which in a trilogy of cases enunciated guiding principles applicable in
    the content of inquests where article 2 issues arise. These decisions are Re
    McKerr [2004] 1WLR 807 (on appeal from N orthern Ireland), and R (Sacker) v



                                            4
the W est Yorkshire Coroner [2004] 1WLR 794 and R (M iddleton) v W est
Somerset Coroner [2004] 2WLR 796. (I shall refer to these cases as McKerr,
Sacker and M iddleton.’)

[8]     Re: McKerr related to the question w hether a proper investigation
complying w ith article 2 of the Convention had been carried out in relation to
the death of Gervaise McKerr w ho died in Novem ber 1982 (i.e. before the
H um an Rights Act 1998 came into effect in October 2000). He was shot by a
m em ber of a unit of the RUC in controversial circumstances raising issues of
w hether the state was applying a so called "shoot to kill" policy in relation to
certain alleged suspected terrorists. In that case an inquest into the death was
opened in 1984 but following adjournm ents was abandoned in 1994. The
applicant alleged that article 2 of the Convention had been breached in that
the applicant's son had been unlaw fully killed and there had been no effective
investigation into the circumstances of the death. The European C ourt had
found that there had been a num ber of shortcomings in the various
investigations. It aw arded the applicant £10,000.00 as just satisfaction in
respect of frustration, distress and anxiety. The United Kingdom Governm ent
paid the com pensation and did not propose to undertake any further
investigation. O n a judicial review challenging the state's failure to conduct a
proper investigation the Court of Appeal granted a declaration that the
Governm ent had failed to carry out a proper investigation compatible w ith
article 2.

[9]    In the House of Lords the state, through the A ttorney General,
contended for the first time that section 6 of the H um an Rights Act 1998 was
not applicable to deaths occurring before the Act came into force on 2 October
2000. The House held that the Convention w as not part of the domestic law
save insofar as incorporated by the provisions of the 1998 Act. The Act was
not generally retrospective in respect of the obligations under section 6(1) and
the duty under article 2 of the Convention to carry out a proper investigation
into a violent death had not applied to the deceased before 2 October 2000.
Since there had been no breach of the obligations before that date there could
be no continuing breach thereafter. The H ouse also rejected the argum ent
that the comm on law could be developed to impose a duty on the state
corresponding to that in article 2 of the Convention. As to the first point the
position w as distinctly stated by Lord Rodger thus at paragraph 80:

             "The applicant relies on the H um an Rights Act as
             part of the domestic law of N orthern Ireland.
             U nder the Act the right to an investigation
             deriving from an article 2 Convention right pre­
             supposes that the killing could have been in
             violation of that self same Convention right. So
             w hen the (deceased) died in 1982 his relatives had
             no right to an investigation under the Act.



                                       5
             M oreover since the Act was not retrospective they
             are not now to be regarded as having had such a
             right in 1982 or at any time thereafter. Conversely
             the Secretary of State is not to be regarded as
             having been in breach or in continuing breach of
             such a right either in 1982 or at any tim e after
             that."

[10] M iddleton and Sacker were heard by a differently constituted chamber
of the House of Lords at the same time as the argum ent was proceeding in
McKerr. Both cases related to inquests of persons w ho had died in suspicious
circumstances before the H um an Rights Act came into force. In neither case
did the state seek to take the point argued by the A ttorney General before the
House in McKerr. In both cases the House proceeded on the basis that the
H um an Rights Act and the Convention applied. No question was raised as to
the retrospective application of the H um an Rights Act 1998 and Convention.
The House stated that those cases were not to be understood to throw doubt
on the conclusion of the House in McKerr.

[11] We received no real explanation how it came about that the state
authorities were taking opposite views on the applicability of the Convention
in the English cases and the N orthern Ireland case. M r M organ QC argued
that M iddleton had been seen as a vehicle by which the House of Lords could
take the opportunity to clarify the law for future inquests. In that case the
inquest was over and done w ith and nothing in the case detracted from its
effect.   Mr M organ argued that the case was in the nature of a moot.
W hether that be so or not, in the case of Sacker (which proceeded before the
same chamber as heard the case in M iddleton1) the m atter was not academic.
Lord Hope held that the inquest in that case had not been able to identify the
cause or causes of the deceased suicide, the steps (if any) that could have been
taken and were not taken to prevent it and the precautions (if any) that ought
to have been taken to avoid or reduce the risk to other prisoners. The House
then w ent on to hold that the m ost convenient and appropriate course to take
was to direct a new inquest. It m ust be presum ed that the intention was that
the coroner in that case w ould follow the approach expressed by the House of
Lords. The necessary implication is that the coroner was being directed to
conduct an article 2 compliant inquest in respect of a pre-H um an Rights Act
death unless the H ouse's directions were m eaningless in the light of McKerr.
McKerr and Sacker are in apparent conflict unless they can be reconciled in
som ew ay.

[12] In an earlier decision of the House in R: (Amin) v Secretary of State
[2003] 4 All ER 1264 the House also was dealing w ith the case of a pre-
H um an Rights Act death. In that case the H ouse of Lords concluded that the
investigations conducted had neither singly nor together m et the m inim um
standards required to satisfy article 2. The House of Lords proceeded on the



                                       6
basis that the H um an Rights Act and article 2 were engaged. The state in that
case was represented by the Secretary of State w ho took no point on
retrospectivity.

[13] From the speeches in McKerr we m ust conclude that the H ouse has
definitively ruled that the obligation to carry out an article 2 compliant
investigation did not apply w here the death had occurred before the Act
came into force. That case, however, w as not dealing w ith a situation which
applies in the present case w here there was an ongoing and incomplete
inquest in respect of the deceased w hich falls to be com pleted subsequent to
the comm encement of the H um an Rights Act. The ongoing inquest falls to
be conducted in accordance w ith domestic law but the question w hich arise
are how is the domestic law to be interpreted and applied and w hether
section 3 of the H um an Rights Act 1998 has the effect of leading to a re­
interpretation of the Coroners Act (N orthern Ireland) 1959 in relation to the
nature of the inquest to be conducted.

[14] U nder section 31(1) of the Coroners Act (N orthern Ireland) 1959 as
am ended it is provided:

              "W here all m embers of the jury at an inquest are
              agreed they shall give, in the form prescribed by
              rules under section 36, their verdict setting forth,
              so far as such particulars have been proved to
              them , w ho the deceased person was and how,
              w hen and w here he came to his death."

The rules m ade under section 36 and in form 22 set out the requirem ents in
respect of the inquest verdict.      Paragraph 10 (11) of the form of verdict
contains space for the recording of the "findings" of the jury. Mr Treacy QC
argued that in approaching the proper interpretation of the w ord "how " in
Section 31(1), even in cases falling outside the am bit of the H um an Rights Act
the w ord should be interpreted in the light of the Strasbourg authorities
(applying the approach of the courts in Brind and applying M iddleton).

[15] In ex parte Jamieson [1995] QB 1, a pre-H um an Rights Act decision of
the C ourt of Appeal in England given in April 1994 the court interpreted
"how" in section ll(5)(b) (ii) of the English Act and Rule 36 (l)(b) of the
English Rules narrow ly as m eaning "by w hat means" and not "in w hat broad
circumstances". It was not the function of a coroner or an inquest jury to
determ ine or appear to determ ine any question of criminal and civil liability,
apportioning guilt or attributing blame. A verdict could properly incorporate
a brief neutral factual statem ent but should express no judgm ent or opinion
and it w as not for the jury to provide detailed factual statem ents. This
approach was followed in this jurisdiction (see Re M inistry of Defence [1994]
N I 279).



                                       7
[16] In M iddleton the House referred to Re Jamieson as a "som ew hat
uncritical sum m ation of judicial authority" and Lord Bingham pointed out
that; "Remarkably, as it now seems the C ourt of Appeal m ade no reference to
the European Convention." H ad the retrospectivity issue been raised in
M iddleton the H ouse w ould have had to rule on w hether Re Tamieson should
be developed in the light of Convention case law. The House, however,
proceeded on the assum ption that it rem ained a correct statem ent of domestic
law. It appears that the next of kin in McKerr argued for a w ider "com m on
law" form of inquest, an argum ent rejected by the House. No question,
however, arose as to the proper application of section 3 to the interpretation
of the statutory concept of "how" in the relevant dom estic legislation and no
questions arose as to the reinterpretation of those provisions, apart from
section 3 , in the light of the Strasbourg authorities.

[17] Two separate points arise. Firstly apart from the H um an Rights Act
itself, w ould it be open to this court to depart from the approach adopted by
the English C ourt of Appeal in Ex parte Tamieson and the N orthern Ireland
C ourt of Appeal in Re M inistry of Defence on the basis that the Strasbourg
case law under article 2 now shows that an inquest should be m ore wide-
ranging than the narrow er scope of inquiry established by Ex parte Tamieson
and Re M inistry of Defence. Lord Hoffm an in R v Lyons [2003] 1 AC 976 at
922 stated that:

              "There is a strong presum ption in favour of
              interpreting English law (whether com m on law or
              statute) in a w ay which does not place the United
              Kingdom in breach of an international obligation.
              As Lord Goff of Chievely said in A ttorney General
              v G uardian N ew spapers lim ite d (No 2) [1990] 1
              AC 109 at 203:

                     'I conceive it to be m y duty, w hen I
                     am free to do so, to interpret the law
                     in accordance w ith the obligation of
                     the C row n under the Convention'."

The question arises as to w hether this court is free to do so in the light of the
earlier and binding authority. Secondly, does section 3 of the H um an Rights
Act come into play so as to require the Coroners Act (N orthern Ireland) 1959
section 31(1) and the rules under that Act to be read and given effect in a way
w hich is compatible w ith the Convention rights in relation to the inquest in
this case.

[18] The principles of stare decisis in civil m atters continue to apply other
than in cases now governed by the statutory requirem ents under section 3 of



                                        8
the H um an Rights Act to read legislation in a w ay w hich is compatible w ith
the Convention rights and obligations. Re M inistry of Defence stated and
applied the principles enunciated in Ex parte Tamieson w hich adopted the
m ore restrictive interpretation of "how". Following traditional principles of
stare decisis the decision in Re M inistry of Defence w ould appear to bind this
court unless the effect of that decision has been overruled by the House of
Lords in M iddleton and Sacker or unless there is some other grounds
justifying this court in treating it as no longer binding. In Trendtex Trading
Corporation v Central Bank of Nigeria (1977) 1 All ER 881 the Court of
Appeal concluded that the principles of stare decisis had no application to
rules of international law. The rules of international law w hich form part of
English law are the existing and prevailing rules agreed am ong nations, as
defined by reference to the decisions of foreign courts, the w ritings of jurists,
treaties and conventions and justice and they are not confined to those rules
w hich have been adopted as part of English law by decisions of English
courts or by Act of Parliam ent. A previous decision of an English court on the
basis of the then prevailing view of a part of international law w ould not bind
a later court in international law had changed or developed at a later stage.
Until the enactm ent of the H um an Rights Act and the incorporation of the
Convention into domestic law it w as never held by the courts in the United
Kingdom that Convention law represented part of the domestic law as being
an aspect of public international law. In any event it could not be said the
Convention law represented generally accepted the principles of public
international law. It represented principles agreed by the signatories of the
Convention. The H um an Rights Act was enacted to bring Convention rights
home. The route offered by Trendtex Trading Corporation to treat M inister of
Defence as no longer binding on this court cannot be used. The decision can
only be treated as overruled if the effect of the H ouse of Lords decisions in
M iddleton and Sacker have held that the reasoning in Ex parte Tamieson as
wrong. Those cases in the House of Lords proceeded on the apparently
incorrect concession that the H um an Rights Act applied to the deaths in those
cases. Accordingly, it w as not necessary for the House of Lords to consider
w hether, apart from the H um an Rights Act, the decision in Ex parte Tamieson
could be treated as w rongly decided. It m ay be im plied in the reasoning and
in the w ording of the decisions in M iddleton and Sacker that in an
appropriate case the House of Lords may treat the decision in Ex parte
Tamieson as incorrect but since the point was not a live one and was not
necessary for the decision of the House of Lords I cannot read the House of
Lords decisions as having effectively overruled Ex parte Tamieson. It is thus
necessary to tu rn to consider w hat impact the H um an Rights Act has in the
present context.

[19] Section 3 of the H um an Rights Act obliges the court, so far as it is
possible to do so, to read and give effect to prim ary and subordinate
legislation in a way which is compatible w ith the Convention rights. The
1959 Act and the rules m ade thereunder are both subordinate legislation.



                                        9
Mr M organ argued that section 3 is not relevant in this context because the
applicant can point to no breach of any Convention right in the light of the
decision in McKerr. McKerr he argues, establishes that article 2 is not
engaged. Mr Treacy QC on the other hand argues that section 3 is of general
application. Inquests frequently involve on occasions the investigation of
deaths engaging or potentially engaging article 2 and the conduct of such
inquests involves the requirem ent for an article 2 com pliant investigation.
"H ow " accordingly falls to be interpreted in a way w hich is article 2
com pliant to ensure that those deaths are properly investigated. This has the
effect, he argues, of establishing a principle of construction that m ust apply in
all cases w here the term "how " falls to be interpreted. Once an interpretation
is arrived at in relation to a statutory provision to ensure that it is Convention
com pliant the im plications of that is that the statutory provision falls to be
interpreted in that way in all situations.

[20] In W ilson v First County Trust Limited [2003] 3 WLR 568 the House of
Lords had to consider the question of the compatibility of section 127(3) of the
Consum er Credit Act 1974 w ith article 1 protocol 1 of the Convention. The
claimant had rights acquired before the Act and the House concluded that
section 3 of the H um an Rights Act was not available as an interpretative rule
since section 3 could not have been intended to alter the existing rights and
obligations of the parties to the agreement. The H ouse w ent on, however, to
consider the question w hether in any event the provision was incompatible
w ith the Convention and held that it was not. W hat is notew orthy in the
present context is that if the House on that latter point had concluded that it
was incom patible (even though the claim ant's vested rights w ould have
rem ained intact) the House w ould have arrived at a decision of general
application. W hile the point in issue in the present case as argued by counsel
was not before the House, there are dicta by their Lordships w hich are of
some relevance. For example Lord Nichols stated:

              "O n its face section 3 is of general application. So
              far as possible legislation m ust be read and given
              effect in a way compatible w ith the Convention
              rights. Section 3 is retrospective in the sense that,
              expressly, it applies to legislation w henever
              enacted. Thus section 3 m ay have the effect of
              changing the interpretation and effect of
              legislation already in force. An interpretation
              appropriate before the Act came into force may
              have to be considered and revised in post Act
              proceedings. This effect of section 3(1) is implicit
              in section 3(2)(c)."

Lord Rodger referred to the Act w orking "as a catalyst across the board".




                                       10
[21] Taking Mr M organ's point to its logical conclusion the effect of section
3 w ould be that a statutory provision could have tw o interpretations and
effects after the H um an Rights Act came into effect, depending on particular
circumstances. A party in the applicant's position could only dem and an
article 2 com pliant investigation if the deceased died after the H um an Rights
Act came into force. W hen a death clearly does not engage article 2 then the
form of the inquest and the pow ers of the coroner and jury w ould be
different, according to this argum ent. But there w ould, of course, be m any
grey areas w ith the coroner being left in a state of uncertainty as to how he
should conduct the inquest. Examples that come to m ind are w hether the
date of the deceased is unknow n, w here two people could have died as the
result of one incident on different dates one dying before and one after the
Act; w here there is uncertainty as to w hether a person died by accident, by
suicide or by criminal act. An inquest may at a later stage throw up issues
that could at some stage engage article 2 indirectly. For example in a m otor
accident case an issue m ight arise as to the public authority's failure in respect
of road design and signage. It seems clear that a consistent interpretation of
the statutory duties of the coroner and the coroner's jury is desirable.
Furtherm ore the Convention jurisprudence points to a w idening concept of
w hat is required in relation to death investigations under article 2. In
McCann v United Kingdom [1996] 21 EHRR 96 the Com m ission considered
that:

              "The nature and degree of scrutiny w hich satisfies
              the m inim um threshold must, in the Com m ission's
              view, depend on the circumstances of the
              particular case. There m ay be other cases, w here a
              victim dies in circumstances which are unclear, in
              which even the lack of any effective procedure to
              investigate the cause of the deprivation of life
              could by itself raise an issue under article 2 of the
              Convention."

Article 2 appeared to have been engaged in M enson v UK (App No 47916-99 a
decision of 6 May 2003) (where the deceased died as the result of an
unprovoked arson attack, w hich the police incorrectly attributed to suicide)
and in R (Hurst) v HM Coroner for N orthern District of London [2003] EWHC
1721 (the failure of police and housing authorities to prevent a neighbour
dispute ended in a killing).

[22] W hat W ilson and the other cases on retrospectivity indicate is that
w here actions were taken before the Act came into force and where vested or
contractual rights were acquired on the basis of the pre-existing law it w ould
be unfair for those rights or the consequences of the actions to be upset by
retrospective application of section 3. Lord Rodger in his speech in Wilson
noted a distinction betw een enactments dealing w ith procedure and



                                        11
enactm ents conferring vested rights. As pointed out in Republic of Costa v
Erlanger [1876] 3 Chan 62 at 69 Mellish LJ stated:

              "N o suitor has any vested interest in the course of
              procedure nor any right to complain, if during the
              litigation the procedure is changed, provided, of
              course, that no injustice is done."

Applying section 3 to the conduct of inquests so as to w iden the am bit of the
inquiry in line w ith the law set out in M iddleton w ould not interfere w ith any
vested rights and w ould m erely affect the procedure of an inquest which has
only really started. Accordingly, in my view there is no reason w hy section 3
should not apply in the context of the present case to lead to a reinterpretation
of the w ord "how " in the statutory provision.

[23] I do not read McKerr as precluding this approach. In McKerr there
w as no question of an ongoing incomplete inquest. Lord Rodger stated that
the next of kin in that case had no right to an investigation deriving from an
article 2 Convention right. W hat the next of kin in the present case have is a
right to an inquest under the Coroners Act (N orthern Ireland) 1959. The
coroner m ust conduct that inquest in accordance w ith domestic law but the
domestic law duties of the coroner and the jury fall to be interpreted in a
m anner w hich is consistent w ith the Convention. This conclusion is in
accordance w ith the decisions in M iddleton and Sacker though the point was
not argued in those terms.

[24] M iddleton gives guidance as to how the coroner should conduct
inquests in England and Wales. The statutory provisions and rules in that
jurisdiction have some significant differences from N orthern Ireland
legislation. In England and Wales a coroner's jury m ay bring in a more
specifically w orded verdict than in N orthern Ireland including a verdict of
unlaw ful death. It is not open to a coroner's jury in N orthern Ireland to bring
in such a verdict. Rule 16 prohibits a coroner or jury expressing "any opinion
on questions of criminal or civil liability or on any m atter other than those
referred to in rule 15". U nder rule 15 the proceedings and evidence at the
inquest shall be directed solely to ascertaining w ho the deceased was, how,
w hen and w here the deceased came by his death and the registerable
particulars under the Births and Deaths (Registration) (N orthern Ireland)
O rder 1976. In England and Wales the jury is precluded from finding
criminal liability on the part of a nam ed person nor m ust the verdict appear to
determ ine any question of civil liability.

[25] W hat the N orthern Ireland rules do provide is a form of verdict in
which the jury can and should set out their findings on the contested relevant
facts that m ust be determ ined to establish the circumstances of the death. In
M iddleton Lord Bingham stated that the jury could express its conclusions in



                                       12
a short and sim ple verdict or it could be done in the form of a narrative
verdict or a verdict given in answer to questions posed by the coroner. By one
m eans or another the jury should m eet the procedural obligation under article
2 and be perm itted to express their conclusions on the central facts explored
before them. At paragraph 110 of the judgm ent of the European C ourt in
Tordan the court identified key factual issues w hich w ould need to be
addressed at the inquest in this case. In paragraph 111 the court stated that it
did not consider that there are any elements established w hich w ould have
deprived the civil courts (by which it appears to include the coroner's court)
of the ability to establish the facts and determ ine the lawfulness or otherwise
of the deceased's death.

[26] Kerr J in his judgm ent (which as noted pre-dated M iddleton)
considered that a proper investigation into the facts relevant to the lawfulness
of the force that caused the death of the deceased was possible w ithin the
existing rules. The unavailability of a verdict of unlaw ful killing did not
underm ine the proposition. I agree w ith his conclusions although the law
requires to be analysed in a som ew hat different way in the light of M iddleton.
The obligation of the coroner's jury to fully investigate the circumstances of
the death and to reach facts or conclusions in relation thereto is an overriding
duty arising out of the duty to investigation "how" the deceased died
(interpreting "how " in the w ider M iddleton sense). The provisions of rule 16
m ust be read subject to that overriding obligation. Rule 16 m ust be read in a
w ay w hich is consistent w ith the overriding duty to reach determ inations of
fact on the central disputed issues of fact surrounding the circumstances of
the death.

[27] Kerr J concluded that the Lord Chancellor was not under an obligation
to introduce subordinate legislation to allow inquest juries to return a verdict
of unlaw ful killing. For the reasons set out in this judgm ent I agree w ith the
conclusions w hich he reached on that topic. The position is now governed by
the principles in M iddleton w hich for the reasons stated apply in the present
context. Accordingly I w ould dismiss both appeals.

                                    Before Kerr LCJ, Campbell LJ and Weir J


      KERR LCJ

      Introduction

     [1]    This is an appeal from the judgment of Weatherup J in which he held that the Chief Constable of
     the Police Service of Northern Ireland was under a continuing duty by virtue of section 8 of the
     Coroner's Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 and article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights to
     furnish to the coroner conducting an inquest into the deaths of Martin McCaughey and Desmond Grew
     certain documents generated by the police investigation into their deaths.

      Background

     [2]     Martin McCaughey and Desmond Grew were killed by soldiers on 9 October 1990. To date no
     inquest has been held into their deaths. There have been various reasons for the delay in the holding
     of this inquest, the latest of which is the issue of provision of information by the police to the coroner.
     That is the central issue arising in this appeal.

     [3]    In October 2002 the fathers of the deceased applied for judicial review of decisions of the Chief
     Constable and the coroner concerning the disclosure of documents for the inquests into the death of
     the deceased. The judicial review centred on the disclosure to the coroner of three sets of documents
     in the possession of the police. The first of these was a copy of the police report prepared for the



file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\lindag.AG\Local%20Settings\Temporary%2... 13/01/2006
Police Service of Northern Ireland v McCaughey & Anor [2005] NICA 1 (14 January ... Page 2 of 11


     Director of Public Prosecutions. The second was the direction given by the DPP that there was to be
     no prosecution. The third set of documents sought was unredacted copies of intelligence reports
     gathered by the police. The coroner had already received redacted copies of these statements from the
     police.

     [4]     In his judgment of 20 January 2004 Weatherup J held that the first document should be provided
     to the coroner. He concluded that section 8 of the 1959 Act and article 2 of ECHR required that it be
     disclosed as there was no confidentiality attaching to it and it was potentially relevant to the inquest.
     The learned judge considered that disclosure of such a document would not deter a police officer from
     being frank in the report or a member of the public from assisting police investigations. The judge
     refused the application in relation to the direction of no prosecution on the basis that this amounted to
     an attempt to discover the reasons that no prosecution had been directed. Since, p er the decision of
     this court in Re Jordan's Application [2003] NICA 54, the DPP did not have to give reasons for a
     decision not to prosecute where the decision was taken before the coming into force of the Human
     Rights Act 1998, and the decision not to prosecute in this case was made in 1993, this document did
     not require to be disclosed. In relation to the third document, Weatherup J held that, as with the police
     report, there was a duty to disclose the unredacted copies of intelligence reports under section 8 and
     Article 2. He was influenced to this conclusion by the consideration that the coroner believed that the
     unredacted reports were potentially relevant.

     [5]    In the course of the hearing before Weatherup J, as before this court, one of the principal
     contentions of the Chief Constable was that the duty on the police under section 8 was confined to the
     provision to the coroner of such information as was available in the immediate aftermath of the death
     and that there was no continuing duty under section 8 to furnish information obtained subsequently.
     The judge rejected that argument in paragraph 13 of his judgment in the following terms:-

                   "I am unable to accept such a limited interpretation of section 8. It relates to
                   such information as the police are "able to obtain ... concerning the death".
                   There is no reason for that support not to extend to documents generated in
                   the later stages of a police investigation. This is clearly intended to require
                   the police to support the Coroner’s investigation with relevant material. The
                   contents of the police report to the prosecuting authority are potentially
                   relevant."

     [6]The judge rejected the argument made on behalf of the next of kin that the police had a      duty at
     commonlaw to furnish the coroner with material generated in the later stages of a police investigation.
     He held that the common law duty recognised in Peach v Commissioner o f Police o f the Metropolis
     [1986] 2ALL ER 129 was restricted to the duty to report the death to the coroner and to give
     information relevant to the decision to hold an inquest.

     [7]    Finally, the judge held that the failure to hold an article 2 compliant investigation into the deaths
     of the deceased from the time that the Human Rights Act came into force constituted a violation of the
     procedural requirement of that article that a state sponsored effective inquiry into the deaths be
     undertaken promptly.

      The Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959

     [8]    Coroners in Northern Ireland are appointed under section 2(1) of the 1959 Act which provides:-

                   ”2. — (1) [The Lord Chancellor may appoint] one, or more than one,
                   coroner and deputy coroner for such district or districts and on such
                   conditions as to numbers, remuneration, superannuation or otherwise as
                   [the Lord Chancellor, after consultation with'the Treasury may determine
                   and may also, in exercise of his powers under section 69 of the Judicature
                   (Northern Ireland) Act 1978, appoint coroner’s officers and other officers to
                   assist such coroners]. ...”

     [9]   Section 8 requires the police to give to the coroner notice in writing of a death in suspicious
     circumstances, together with information concerning the finding of the body or the death:-

                   "8. Whenever a dead body is found, or an unexpected or unexplained
                   death, or a death attended by suspicious cir'cumstances, occurs, the

                   superintendent within whose district the body is found, or the death occurs,
                   shall give or cause to be given immediate notice in writing thereof to the
                   coroner within whose district the body is found or the death occurs, together
                   with such information also in writing as he is able to obtain concerning the
                   finding of the body or concerning the death."
                                                                i



      [10]     Section 7 requires certain other persons to provide the coroner with facts and circumstances
      relating to the death:-

                   "7. Every medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker and
                   every occupier o f a house or mobile dwelling and every person in charge of
                   any institution or premises in which a deceased person was residing, who
                   has reason to believe that the deceased person died, either directly or
                   indirectly, as a result of violence or misadventure or by unfair means, or as
                   a result of negligence or misconduct or malpractice on the part of others, or
                   from any cause other than natural illness or disease for which he had been
                   seen and treated by a registered medical practitioner within twenty-eight
                   days prior to his death, or in such circumstances as may require
                   investigation (including death as the result of the administration of an
                   anaesthetic), shall immediately notify the coroner within whose district the
                   body of such deceased person is of the facts and circumstances relating to
                   the death."

      [11]   Section 11 deals with the steps that the coroner rpust take in order to allow him to determine
      whether an inquest is necessary:-

                   "11. — (1) Where a coroner is informed that there is within his district the
                   body of a deceased person and that there is reason to believe that the
                   deceased person died in any of the circumstances mentioned in section
                   seven or section eight he shall instruct a constable to take possession of
                   the body and shall make such investigation as may be required to enable
                   him to determine whether or not an inquest is necessary.
                                                                t
                   (2) For the purposes of an investigation under sub-section (1) the coroner
                   may view the body but shall not be obliged to do so.

                   (3) The coroner may, with the consent of the [Lord Chancellor], employ
                   such persons as he considers necessary to assist him in such investigation.

                   (4) For the purposes of exercising his powers under this section, a coroner
                   may direct the exhumation of any body which has been buried within his
                   district and the consent of any other authority or person to any exhumation
                   so directed shall not be required by any [. .!] regulations under section one
                   hundred and eighty-one of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878."

     [12]     Section 12 provides that where the coroner considers it necessary to hold an inquest or a post­
     mortem he may direct that the body shall be brought to a mortuary. In practice the coroner directs that
     the police assume responsibility for transporting the body and ensuring safe deposit at the mortuary.

      [13]   By section 13 the coroner is empowered to hold an inquest:-
                                                               *

                   "13. — (1) Subject to sub-section (2) a coroner within whose district—

                          (a) a dead body is found; or

                          (b) an unexpected or unexplained death, or a death in
                          suspicious circumstances or in any of the circumstances
                          mentioned in section seven, occurs;

                   may hold an inquest either with a jury or, except in the cases in which a jury
                   is required by sub-section (1) of section eighteen, without a jury.

         [14]    Section 17 provides for witness summonses:-

                       "17. — (1) Where a coroner proceeds to hold an inquest, whether with or
                       without a jury, he may issue a summons for any witness whom he thinks
                       necessary to attend such inquest at the time and place specified in the
                       summons, for the purpose of giving evidence relative to such dead body
                       and shall deliver or cause to be delivered all such summonses to a
                       constable who shall forthwith proceed to serve the same.

                       (2) Nothing in this section shall prevent a person who has not been
                       summoned from giving evidence at an inquest."

          The Human Rights Act 1998

          [15]   Section 3 (1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides: -

                        "3. - (1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate
                       legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with
                       the Convention rights.

         Section 3 (2) (a) of the Act provides that section 3 applies to primary and subordinate legislation
         whenever enacted.

          [16]  Section 6(1) of the 1998 Act makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is
          incompatible with a Convention right; there are two prescribed exceptions to this general rule:-

                       "6. - (1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is
                       incompatible with a Convention right.

                       (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if -

                                      (a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary
                                      legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or

                                      (b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under,

         [17]    Section 7 of the 1998 Act makes provision for the procedure whereby a person can make a
         claim that a public authority has acted unlawfully:-

                       "7. - (1) A person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes
                       to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may -

                                      (a) bring proceedings against the authority under this Act in
                                      the appropriate court or tribunal, or

                                      (b) rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any

         [18]   Section 7 (6) of the 1998 Act provides that "legal proceedings" in section 7 (1) (b) includes (a)
         proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority and (b) an appeal against the decision

     of a court or tribunal.

     [19]     Section 22(4) of the 1959 Act provides that paragraph (b) of section 7(1) applies to proceedings
     brought by or at the instigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place; but
     otherwise that subsection does not apply to an act taking place before the coming into force of that
     section.

      The appeal

     [20]   As originally conceived this appeal was confined to the interpretation, following ordinary rules of
     construction, of section 8 of the Coroners Act. An amended notice of appeal was filed which raised, the
     appellant said, the more important issues of whether section 6 and/or section 3 of the Human Rights
     Act and article 2 of the convention apply to the deaths of Mr Grew and Mr McCaughey, given that the
     deaths occurred before the 1998 Act came into force on 2 October 2000.

      The appellant's arguments

     Section 8

     [21]    For the appellant Mr McCloskey QC suggested that the two obligations imposed on the police
     superintendent by section 8 were interlinked. The first of these was to give immediate written notice of
     the death to the coroner. The second was to provide (together with the notice of the death) such
     information in writing "... as he is able to obtain concerning the finding of the body or concerning the
     death". Mr McCloskey argued that the use of the expressions 'immediate' and 'together with' clearly
     indicated that both duties required to be fulfilled simultaneously and at a time proximate to the death of
     the deceased or the discovery of the body.

     [22]     Counsel accepted that much of the investigation into the death of a deceased person would
     normally occur after the notifications under sections 7 and 8 had been given. He also accepted that
     statements subsequently taken by police in the course of their investigation into the death are provided
     to the coroner as a matter of course but he submitted that this arrangement was not on foot of any
     statutory obligation to supply them. Mr McCloskey argued that the correct textual construction of
     section 8, giving its words their ordinary and natural meaning, does no more than oblige the police to
     provide the coroner with such information as they have concerning the death at the time that they give
     written notice of the death. In support of this contention he pointed out that immediacy is also the
     central theme of other sections of the 1959 Act. The provision of information on foot of the legislation
     was geared, he said, to enabling the coroner to decide whether an inquest was necessary, not to
     provide him with the material necessary to conduct a full blown inquiry into the deceased's death.

     [23]    Although he asserted that there was no statutory duty on the police to furnish information to the
     coroner other than that imposed by section 8, Mr McCloskey accepted that, were the police to withhold
     from the coroner relevant material relating to a death, this would frustrate the coroner's power to
     conduct an effective inquest. The police as a public authority had a responsibility to cooperate with the
     coroner. This was fulfilled in practice by the police providing material and information necessary to
     allow the inquest to take place. It was not the subject of a statutory regime, however.

     Article 2                                                 *




     [24]     The judgment of Weatherup J was delivered before the decision of the House of Lords in Re
     McKerr [20041 Nl 212. It was submitted that the effect of this decision is that the procedural dimension
     of article 2 of the convention does not, within the regime of HRA 1998, apply to deaths which occurred
     before 2 October 2000. The learned judge's conclusion that there was a violation of article 2 could not
     survive this decision, Mr McCloskey argued.

     [25]    On the matter of non-retrospectivity of the 1998 Act generally, Mr McCloskey submitted that
     this could not be circumvented by the device of engaging public authorities in correspondence
     subsequent to 2 October 2000 in relation to conduct and events that had occurred before that date. In
     such cases it is essential to examine the reality of the situation: (Lord Slynn in Regina - v - Lambert
     [20011 3 All ER 577 and Lord Woolf CJ in Wainwright -v- Home Office [2003] 3 All ER 943). Substance
     must prevail over form. The relevant act for the purpose of the 1998 Act was the death of the
     deceased, not a decision taken in response to a request that the death be investigated.

      The respondent's arguments

     Section 8

     [26]     For the respondent, Mr Treacy QC argued that the clear object of section 8 was to ensure that
     the coroner was provided with all relevant information by the police. 'Relevant information' in this
     context meant such information as was necessary in order to conduct an effective inquiry into the
     circumstances of the death. If the appellant's interpretation of the section were accepted it would be
     impossible, Mr Treacy contended, for the coroner to determine which witnesses were necessary, much
     less to carry out an effective inquiry. He submitted that, properly interpreted, section 8 imposed a
     continuing duty on the police and that the word "immediate" in the section was not intended as a word
     of limitation. Its purpose was to ensure a prompt investigation.

     [27]     Mr Treacy did not accept Mr McCloskey’s assertion that in practice the police provided
     coroners with the information that they required to carry out their statutory duty. This case, he
     suggested, exemplified the true position. The coroner had still not been provided with the unredacted
     intelligence reports even though both the coroner and Weatherup J had concluded that these were
     necessary for a proper inquiry into the deaths of the deceased.

     Article 2

     [28]       Mr Treacy submitted that the decision of the House of Lords in McKerr could be distinguished
     on the basis that it was concerned with the duty of the Secretary of State to conduct an article 2
     compliant investigation where an inquest had already taken place, whereas in the present case no
     inquest has been held. He relied on the decision of this court in Jordan v The Lord Chancellor and the
     Coroner \2004\ NICA 30 which, he said, recognised that section 3 of the Human Rights Act obliges the
     court to interpret section 8 of the 1959 Act compatibly with convention rights. If, contrary to his primary
     submission, section 8 did not, on conventional construction, impose a continuing duty on the police to
     supply relevant information to the coroner, Mr Treacy argued that section 8 was capable of such an
     interpretation and, applying section 3 of the Human Rights Act, should be interpreted in that way so as
     to fulfil the procedural requirements of article 2.

     Interpretation o f section 8 - ordinary rules o f construction

     [29]   The language of section 8 is derived (for the most part) from earlier legislation. Section 22 of
     the Coroners (Ireland) Act 1846 is in the following terms:-

                   "XXII. And be it enacted, that when any dead body shall be found, or any
                   case of sudden death, or of death attended with suspicious circumstances,
                   shall occur in any district, the sub-inspector of the constabulary of such
                   district, or the constable or sub-constables acting in and for the place where
                   such dead body shall be found or such death happen, shall give or cause to
                   be given immediate notice thereof to the coroner of such district, together
                   with such information as he or they shall have been able to obtain touching
                   the finding of such dead body or such death; and the said coroner shall, if
                   upon the receipt of such or other sufficient notice and information heshall
                   deem it necessary to hold an inquest upon such dead body, issue his
                   precept to the sub-inspector of such district, or in his absence to the head or
                   other constable acting for him, to summon a sufficient number of persons to
                   attend and be sworn as jurors upon such inquest at the time and place
                   specified in such precept; and the said coroner shall issue a summons for
                   every witness whom he shall deem necessary to attend such inquest at the
                   time and place therein specified, for the purpose of giving evidence relative
                   to such dead body; and he shall deliver or cause to be delivered all such
                   summonses to the constable or some one of the sub-constables acting in or
                   for the place where such inquest is to be held, who shall forthwith proceed
                   to serve the same."

     [30]    This provision is largely replicated in sections 8 and 17 of the 1959 Act. One change to the
     wording of the two Acts should be noted. Whereas the duty to provide the coroner with information
     provided for in the 1846 Act is such as the police "have been able to obtain", in the 1959 Act the
     superintendent must supply such information as "he is able to obtain”. On one view, this might suggest
     that the 1846 Act required that only information already obtained before notification of the death be



file ://C :\Documents%20and%20S ettingsUindag.AG\Local%20Settings\Temporary%2... 13/01/2006
Police Service of Northern Ireland v McCaughey & Anor [2005] NICA 1 (14 January ... Page 7 of 11


     supplied, whereas the 1959 Act called for the provision of information that had been obtained after
     notification. We do not consider that such an interpretation would reflect the legislative intention,
     however. We believe that the more instructive guide to interpretation is to be found in the juxtaposition
     of the obligation to give notice in writing of the finding of the body etc. with the duty to give information
     on what the police superintendent had discovered about the death. The use of the phrase 'together
     with' appears to us to contemplate the simultaneous supply of the notification and the information.

     [31]    That conclusion is reinforced by the consideration that the purpose of section 8 and other
     provisions such as sections 7 and 11 is to allow the coroner to receive without delay information that
     will enable him to decide whether to hold an inquest rather than to provide him with the material on
     which any inquest will be conducted. That the information should be restricted in this way may appear
     strange in light of the nature of a modern inquest but one must remember that before the Human
     Rights Act came into force, the scope of an inquest was circumscribed. In R v HM Coroner for North
     Humberside ex parte Jamieson [1995] QB 1 it was held that an inquest was a fact-finding inquiry
     directed solely to ascertaining the identity of the deceased, the time and place of death and how, in the
     sense of 'by what means', the deceased met his death. This approach to the capacity of pre HRA
     inquests has been followed consistently in this jurisdiction also. Given this somewhat limited scope, it is
     perhaps unsurprising that the major question was not what the inquest would disclose, but whether one
     should be held at all.

     [32]      Having said that, it is important to recognise how vital is the material supplied by police to the
     proper functioning of the coroner's court. Even within the limited scope of a pre HRA inquest the
     repository of much of the information about deaths that require the holding of an inquest will usually be
     the police. It cannot be satisfactory that information beyond that provided immediately after the death is
     supplied to the coroner on the basis of an understanding or an informal arrangement. It appears to us
     that if the coroner is to carry out his statutory function effectively he must have the power to require the
     production of relevant information from those who have it. But we cannot accept that section 8 of the
     1959 Act is effective to achieve this. The interpretation of the provision advanced by Mr McCloskey
     appears to us to be inescapable, however unsatisfactory we find that to be.

     [33]     It is a basic principle of legal policy that law should serve the public interest. We consider that
     urgent consideration should therefore be given to the need to provide coroners with statutory power to
     require the police to provide information necessary for the proper conduct of an inquest. It is likely that
     the police will be legally obliged to provide information in relation to deaths occurring after 2 October
     2000 because the inquest will normally be the means by which the state complies with its obligation
     under article 2 of ECHR. In relation to deaths that have occurred before that date, however, there is, in
     our opinion, a real danger that, if the coroner is unable to require the police to supply relevant
     information, the efficacy and integrity of the inquest system will be imperilled.

     [34]     It was suggested that the coroner could obtain the information by judicious use of his section
     17 powers but we do not believe that this would be an effective or efficient way to collect the
     information that a coroner would require in order to ensure that an effective inquest into the death took
     place. It would be necessary for the coroner to issue a subpoena to secure the attendance of the police
     and the production of relevant material and then to adjourn the inquest while that material was
     considered. Even greater delays than already exist in the inquest system would ensue if the first time a
     coroner was to be provided with information was at the inquest hearing itself.

     [35]     The Lord Chancellor has powers under section 2 (1) of the 1959 Act to appoint coroner's
     officers to assist in investigations. No such officer has been appointed in recent years. Leckey and
     Greer in Coroners' Law and Practice in Northern Ireland deal with this situation in paragraph 2-31
     where they observe

                   "In Northern Ireland only police officers are empowered to investigate
                   deaths reported to coroners, and this is the position even when no criminal
                   offence is suspected. The particular officer assigned to the investigation
                   acts, in effect, as a coroner's officer for the particular case.”

     [36]    These arrangements are predicated on the mutual understanding that the police will provide
     information to the coroner relevant to a death which may be the subject of an inquest. There is no
     expectation on either side that the coroner should conduct a parallel investigation, for example, by
     questioning witnesses whom the police have interviewed. That the police had hitherto considered
     themselves under an obligation to provide relevant information to the coroner was not disputed by Mr
     McCloskey. This is in itself a valuable indicator of the practical requirements of an effective inquest

     system.

     [37]    We are reinforced in our view as to the need for legislation to correct the current anomalous
     position by our conclusion that no duty to supply information arises at common law. We agree with
     Weatherup J's observation that the reference in the judgment of Fox LJ in Peach v Commissioner o f
     Police o f the Metropolis to the duty of the police to convey all material "touching the cause and
     circumstances of the death" should be construed as his understanding of the position under the
     statutory provisions to supply information for the purposes of the inquest. We were not referred to any
     authority that would support the claim that the police are under a common law duty to supply
     information for the purpose of the inquest.

      The Human Rights Act

     [38]     The issue of retrospectivity in relation to the conduct of inquests where the death had occurred
     before the coming into force of HRA on 2 October 2000 was dealt with by the House of Lords in Re
     McKerr. In that case Jonathan McKerr sought an order compelling the Secretary of State for Northern
     Ireland to hold an effective investigation into the circumstances of his father's death. Gervaise McKerr
     had been shot dead on 11 November 1982 by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Between
     1982 and 1994, criminal proceedings were brought against the police officers, which led to their
     acquittal; a police investigation was conducted by two different police forces in England; and an inquest
     was opened but later abandoned. An application was made to ECtHR invoking article 2. That court
     found that there had been a violation and awarded the applicant compensation in respect of frustration,
     distress and anxiety. The government paid the sum awarded but stated that it did not propose to take
     any steps to hold a further investigation into the death. The applicant sought judicial review on the
     ground, inter alia, that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's continuing failure to provide an
     article 2 compliant investigation was unlawful and in breach of s 6 of the 1998 Act. That application was
     dismissed on the basis that the 1998 Act did not have retrospective effect. The claimant appealed to
     the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal holding that the obligation to hold an investigation, which
     complied with the requirements of article 2, was a continuing one. The Secretary of State appealed. He
     submitted that s 6 of the 1998 Act was not applicable to deaths occurring before HRA came into force.

     [39]    The House of Lords held that there was no obligation to hold an article 2 compliant
     investigation into a killing which occurred before the 1998 Act came into force since that obligation was
     triggered by the occurrence of a violent death and did not exist in the absence of such a death. This
     central conclusion is encapsulated in the following passage from the opinion of Lord Nicholls:-

                  "[17] In the present case the question of retrospectivity arises in the context
                  of section 6 of the 1998 Act and article 2 of the convention. It arises in this
                  way. Section 6 of the Act creates a new cause of action by rendering certain
                  conduct by public authorities unlawful. Section 7 (1) (a) provides a remedy
                  for this new cause of action. A person who claims a public authority is
                  acting in a way made unlawful by section 6(1) may bring proceedings
                  against the authority if he is a victim of the unlawful act. Thus, if the
                  Secretary of State's failure to arrange for a further investigation into the
                  death of Gervaise McKerr is unlawful within the meaning of section 6(1),
                  these proceedings brought by his son fall squarely within s 7; if not, not.

                  [20] ... article 2 may be violated by an unlawful killing. The application of
                  section 6 (1) of the 1998 Act to a case of an unlawful killing is
                  straightforward. Section 6(1) applies if the act, namely, the killing, occurred
                  after the Act came into force. Section 6(1) does not apply if the unlawful
                  killing took place before 2 October 2000. So much is clear.

                  [21] The position is not so clear where the violation comprises a failure to
                  carry out a proper investigation into a violent death. Obviously there is no
                  difficulty if the death in question occurred post-Act. The position is more
                  difficult if the death occurred, say, shortly before the Act came into force
                  and the necessary investigation would fall to be held in the ordinary course
                  after the Act came into force. On which side of the retrospectivity line is a
                  post-Act failure to investigate a pre-Act death?

                                                               4

                  [22] In my view the answer lies in appreciating that the obligation to hold an



file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\lindag.AG\Local%20Settings\Temporary%2... 13/01/2006
Police Service of Northern Ireland v McCaughey & Anor [2005] NICA 1 (14 January ... Page 9 of 11


                   investigation is an obligation triggered by the occurrence of a violent death.
                   The obligation to hold an investigation does not exist in the absence of such
                   a death. The obligation is consequential upon the death. If the death itself is
                   not within the reach of section 6, because it occurred before the Act came
                   into force, it would be surprising if section 6,applied to an obligation
                   consequential upon the death. Rather, one would expect to find that, for
                   section 6 to apply, the death which is the subject of investigation must itself
                   be a death to which section 6 applies. The event giving rise to the article 2
                   obligation to investigate must have occurred post-Act."

      [40]     The McKerr decision was considered by this court (Nicholson LJ, McCollum LJ andGirvan J) in
      Re Jordan’s application f20041 NICA 30. That case involved two appeals against the dismissal of
      applications by the next of kin of Pearse Jordan for judicial review of the decision of the coroner to
      conduct the inquest into his death on the basis of the existing coroners' law and practice in Northern
      Ireland and of the failure of the Lord Chancellor to introduce the necessary legislation to ensure that
      the inquest system in Northern Ireland complied with article 2 of the Convention. In an obiter passage
      Girvan J distinguished McKerr on the basis that it dealt with a case where an inquest had not
      commenced. In Jordan the inquest had started but had been adjourned a number of times, principally
      to await the outcome of judicial review applications. On this subject Girvan J said:-

                   "[13] From the speeches in McKerr we must conclude that the House has
                   definitively ruled that the obligation to carry out an article 2 compliant
                   investigation did not apply where the death had occurred before the Act
                   came into force. That case, however, was not dealing with a situation which
                   applies in the present case where there was an ongoing and incomplete
                   inquest in respect of the deceased which falls to be completed subsequent
                   to the commencement of the Human Rights Act. The ongoing inquest falls
                   to be conducted in accordance with domestic law but the questions] which
                   arise are how is the domestic law to be interpreted and applied and whether
                   section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 has the effect of leading to a re­
                   interpretation of the Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 in relation to the
                   nature of the inquest to be conducted."

      [41]     One might observe that whether an inquest has been begun or not, it must be conducted
      according to the domestic law that applies at the time either of its commencement or resumption.
      Girvan J, however, concluded that the fact that the inquest was to be resumed after the coming into
      force of HRA meant that the relevant sections of the Coroners Act should be interpreted in a way that
      complied with the convention. He referred to the decisions of the House of Lords in R (Sacker) vthe
       West Yorkshire Coroner [2004] 1WLR 794 and R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner [2004] 2WLR
      796. These cases were heard by a differently constituted chamber of the House of Lords at the same
      time as the argument was proceeding in McKerr. Both cases related to inquests into the deaths of
      persons who had died in suspicious circumstances before the HRA came into force. In neither case
      was the question raised as to the retrospective application of the Human Rights Act 1998 and
      Convention. In Middleton the House of Lords held that an inquest, being the means by which the state
      ordinarily discharged its procedural obligation to investigate under article 2 of the convention, ought
      generally to culminate in an expression of the jury's conclusion on the disputed factual issues at the
      heart of the case.

      [42]   Girvan J set out the competing arguments as to the possible impact of section 3 of HRA on the
      conduct of a resumed inquest into the death of someone killed before the coming into force of the Act:-

                   "[19] Section 3 of the Human Rights Act obliges the court, so far as it is
                   possible to do so, to read and give effect to primary and subordinate
                   legislation in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights. The
                   1959 Act and the rules made thereunder are both subordinate legislation.
                   Mr Morgan argued that section 3 is not relevant in this context because the
                   applicant can point to no breach of any Convention right in the light of the
                   decision in McKerr. McKerr he argues, establishes that article 2 is not
                   engaged. Mr Treacy QC on the other hand argues that section 3 is of
                   general application. Inquests frequently involve on occasions the
                   investigation of deaths engaging or potentially engaging article 2 and the
                   conduct of such inquests involves the requirement for an article 2 compliant
                   investigation. "How" accordingly falls to be interpreted in a way which is
                   article 2 compliant to ensure that those deaths are properly investigated.

                   This has the effect, he argues, of establishing a principle of construction
                   that must apply in all cases where the term "how” falls to be interpreted.
                   Once an interpretation is arrived at in relation to a statutory provision to
                   ensure that it is Convention compliant the implication of that is that the
                   statutory provision falls to be interpreted in that way in all situations.”

      [43]    The learned judge then considered a number of decisions in which the question of
      retrospectivity either arose or was potentially in issue and continued:-

                   ”[22] What Wilson and the other cases on retrospectivity indicate is that
                   where actions were taken before the Act came into force and where vested
                   or contractual rights were acquired on the basis of the pre-existing law it
                   would be unfair for those rights or the consequences of the actions to be
                   upset by retrospective application of section 3. Lord Rodger in his speech in
                   Wilson noted a distinction between enactments dealing with procedure and
                   enactments conferring vested rights. As pointed out in Republic o f Costa v
                   Erlanger [1876] 3 Chan 62 at 69 Mellish LJ stated:

                          "No suitor has any vested interest in the course of procedure
                          nor any right to complain, if during the litigation the procedure
                          is changed, provided, of course, that no injustice is done."

                   Applying section 3 to the conduct of inquests so as to widen the ambit of the
                   inquiry in line with the law set out in Middleton would not interfere with any
                   vested rights and would merely affect the procedure of an inquest which
                   has only really started. Accordingly, in my view there is no reason why
                   section 3 should not apply in the context of the present case to lead to a
                   reinterpretation of the word "how" in the statutory provision.

                  [23] I do not read McKerr as precluding this approach. In McKerr there was
                  no question of an ongoing incomplete inquest. Lord Rodger stated that the
                  next of kin in that case had no right to an investigation deriving from an
                  article 2 Convention right. What the next of kin in the present case have is a
                  right to an inquest under the Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959. The
                  coroner must conduct that inquest in accordance with domestic law but the
                  domestic law duties of the coroner and the jury fall to be interpreted in a
                  manner which is consistent with the Convention. This conclusion is in
                  accordance with the decisions in Middleton and Sacker though the point
                  was not argued in those terms."

     [44]     The effect of Girvan J's judgment was to declare that Mr Jordan was entitled to have the
     inquest into the death of his son conducted in compliance with article 2, notwithstanding that the death
     occurred before 2 October 2000. This was to be achieved by requiring the Coroners Act to be
     interpreted in a manner that complied with the convention. The flaw in this approach, in our opinion, is
     that section 3 only applies where convention rights are in play. Neither the appellant in Jordan nor the
     respondents in the present appeal have access to convention rights in the domestic setting because of
     the non-retrospective effect of HRA. Section 3 is not triggered unless compatibility with convention
     rights is in issue. It was not in issue here, nor was it in Jordan, because the deaths involved occurred
     before the Act came into force. This much is clear not only from the passage from the opinion of Lord
     Nicholls in McKerr quoted above but also from the opinions of other members of the Appellate
     Committee. Lord Hoffmann put in bluntly, "Either the Act applies to deaths before 2 October 2000 or it
     does not". He held that it did not. But if Girvan J's approach was followed, the Act would be applied to
     deaths occurring before that date. Lord Rodger of Earlsferry put it thus:-

                  "... the right to an investigation under the Act is confined to deaths which,
                  having occurred after the commencement of the Act, may be found to be
                  unlawful under the Act."

     Finally Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood expressed tfie same concept in this way: -

                  "[91] The duty to investigate is, in short, necessarily linked to the death itself
                  and cannot arise under domestic law save in respect of a death occurring at
                  a time when article 2 rights were enforceable under domestic law, i.e. on

                           and after 2 October 2000."

        [45]   We are satisfied that section 3 of the 1998 Act does not apply in the present circumstances.
        There was therefore no obrigation to hold an article 2 compliant investigation into the deaths of the
        deceased. It follows that the appeal must be allowed and the application for judicial review must be
        dismissed.

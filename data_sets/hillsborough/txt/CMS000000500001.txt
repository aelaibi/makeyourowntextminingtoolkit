                     TAYLOR REPORT : DISABLED



1.   I refer to Marie-Louise de Villiers' note on the attached
press cutting about the possibility of encouraging football clubs
to improve their provision for the disabled as part of the
implementation of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations.

2.   You will see from the attached extract from his report that
Lord justice Taylor gave a very strong endorsement to the needs
of the disabled at sports grounds. These views did not, however,
form part of a recommendation.

3.   I have spoken to David Mould at the Home Office who are
responsible for the follow up work to the report. As part of the
revision of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, (Green Guide)
consequent upon the Taylor report, they plan to include a chapter
on provision for the disabled.   A first draft of the chapter is
attached and David would welcome any comments we may have by 19
June. Although it falls short of positive encouragement to clubs
to provide facilities where there are none I think this is an
encouraging step (the current guide does not include anything
about the disabled).

4.   David appeared to be quite relaxed about my suggestion that
we might wish to strengthen the opening paragraph to make it more
of an encouragement to clubs.    However, on reflection, I do not
think that the Guide is really the right vehicle to put such a
message across.   It is essentially a guide which gives practical
advice on how to make sports grounds safe. There is also the
point acknowledged by Marie-Louise, that clubs are already under
pressure to implement Taylor's recommendations as a whole.     The
football authorities have accepted the report and there are some
signs that clubs are giving more thought to the needs of the
disabled.   I know that Coventry City are planing to improve their
existing disabled provision and that West Ham United are to
introduce such facilities at their ground during the close
season.    The Football Trust, of course, pay grant for such
facilities.
5.   All in all therefore, things do not seem to be gbing too
badly.   In addition the Minister could perhaps re-inforce the
Taylor message on the disabled in speeches where this is
appropriate.

6.   If Marie-Louise has any comments on the draft Green Guide
paragraphs perhaps she could let us see them and we will pass
them on to the Home Office.

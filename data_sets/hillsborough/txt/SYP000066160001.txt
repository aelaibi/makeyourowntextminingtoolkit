The     pub was shut          so we went             to a >pie shop and           had something          to      eat

there.         We went       back    to the          pub at    11am.       The    pub was      nearly      e mpty and

By    1 . 0 0 pm the     pub was    full.           There were four        different         rooms and           each

one was        full.      I t ’s a popular           stop off     point     for Liverpool            s uppo rt er s

because        its on the m ai n         road,       the A61 6 and the         pub has a full            size

snooker        table.         There were       no    problems     in the     pub,       e v er yb od y was

My g ro u p      left    the    pub at a bout 2 . 00pm,           we   t ra v el l ed    back to

to try and         control       people     but you       could see the         f r u s t ra t io n on their

faces,       it was      obvious    they       c o u l d n ’t do nothing,       because         they were

s u r r o u n d e d by people.

We a s k e d     near    the gate       if a n yb o d y   had a spare        ticket       for                but

nobody had.             We all    joined the mass           of    people at the turnstil e.                      My

t u rnstile was          the one    on the extreme             right as you faced the                 block.           we

did see some            of the others          who had been at          the F r i e n d s h i p Hotel

earlier.         The     crush s t ar te d almost          immediately.           I've      never-

experienced         such a severe           crush before an d this was                   outside      the

turnstiles.             1 saw    people     on top of a brick wall                near the        turnstiles,

they were        shouting        to their       friends     iij/'the crowd.             I did see about               two

           had to move with the                 crowd,       I found        it impossible             to get my ticket

           out    from my shirt             pocket.        I could hear            people at the          front        shouting

           for space           but   people at the          back     kept     pushing        forward.        We e ve nt u al l y

           got near        the turnstile,            there was a metal                barrier      blue     tubular        steel

           about 3 - 3           and a half         ft high.         My wife        kept     being     s qu as h ed     right        up

           against        it,    there was         nothing       X could do nothing               because      two      people

           had come        between us         in the       crowd.

                could see                    over    by the       railings         by the      river,     because he

           hadn't        got a ticket.             About a yar d from the t urnstile                      1 m a na g e d      to get

           my ticket           out from my pocket.                I gave                   her ticket        over       the heads

           of a    couple        of people,         although       I had to         pass     it to                to give          to

           her    'cause        I couldn't         reach her.         It was        very hot       in the      crowd,         lots

           of    people were           compla in in g      but    I didn't         see a n y b o d y a c t u a l l y    faint        or

           pass    out.

           I was        right    outside      the    t ur nstile w h e n 1 heard ayftoliceman                      (who       l''d

           to              , “Get       under      the barrier         pet,   we're        going      to open the          side

           I was        pleased      because       I realised my wife was                  getting      squashed.             1 got

because         of    previous      visits         I ’ve always        used the          tunnel    but    because

the    pitch       itself.         By this time            the top        of the fence was a mass              of

people        climbing         over,    onto    the    pitch.        I saw some St.            John's A mb u la n ce

pitch      invasion           (that    .is both sides).            The    police     on the      pitch seemed

unsure as          to what        to do.       They were        looking      round at each other,

a l t h o u g h they were          letting      people       over the fence          now.       I then saw a

man    lying on his             back    behind       the    goal   net.      He was      being     given

By the        time      the    teams were       off    the field,         people were          near    the    penalty

a r ea and        collapsing.           My wife and                                      and    1 r em ained        in

the    terraces          sitting       down    in d is be li e f/ a t     what was       hap pe ni ng    until
                                      -TA W K / Q p
just after K en ny D A L G L I S H made a py^Yic a n n o u n c em e nt                      at about 3 . 5 0 p m .

That was          the    first announcemenj/'made a bout                   the whole        incident.          We all

left at about             3 .5 5p m to     return to         the   car.

I was wearing a white                   cotton       long    sleeve      casual shirt and         blue       jeans

on the day.              I did not assist any                dead or      injured because             I was    too

far away.            I did not a t t e nd the same m a t c h               last year        or the Heysel

S ta d iu m    in Brussels.             I w ould      describe       e v er yb od y' s   beh av io ur    g e n e r a ll y

as good and             looking       f o rw ar d to a good match.              I d i d n ’t see any

fighting          or d ru nk en behaviour.                 I w ou ld a dd that       I did see         lots of

police        patrols         betw ee n J u n c t i o n 36 of the Ml a nd t hr ou gh to W a ds l ey

Bri dg e      (the A 6 1 ).        There      did seem to be          rela ti ve ly      few    police a c t u a l l y

a r o u n d the      ground through.              I only saw the 3 m o un t ed a nd a no t he r                 two

nearby,        plus      the one w it h the           flat    cap,    that was all          I saw.

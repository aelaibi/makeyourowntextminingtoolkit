    My dear Sir,

                              RE:   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


         I have today received a copy of the papers for the Working Party to
    be held on the 28th of June, 1989..

         Item 3 on the Agenda is an application for funding a place of research.
    I have not had chance to study this in any detail or to discuss it with
    the writer.

         As work on service developments to respond to Hillsborough have been
    developed, the issue of research has been considered. The participating
    Local Authorities who have worked together have agreed to co-ordinate research
    through Professor Howard Parker at Manchester University who has given
    us valuable assistance. I know there has already been preliminary discussions
    with Department of Health, and I understand some contact has been made
    with research institutes.

         I am not able to comment in more detail at this stage, but would urge
    you to allow time for this proposal to be discussed with Professor Parker
    prior to any agreement or commitment of resources.




                                    Yours faithfully,




                             DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES.

            I am a Liverpool football       club fan and attend as many of their games

            as possible.



            On Saturday 15 April       1989 (150489)    I attended the Hillsborough

            football stadium in Sheffield to watch Liverpool          play Nottingham

            Forest   in the FA Cup semi-final.          I got my ticket through my dad who

            is a season ticket holder at Anfield and also a share holder at the

            club.     The ticket I got was for the Leppings Ln standing area and I

            pa i d £6.00 for it.



            I travelled to Hillsborough in my car together with some friends of

            mine.    We left Liverpool at about 9.00am (0900) and travelled down

            the M62 and across the Pennines,       and arrived in Sheffield about one pm

              We w a l k ed down to a              chip shop near             to where         r\parked the          car,    and then

              walked      down to the             gr ou nd and got there at about 2 .1 5p m                         (1415)    and    I

              cannot      recall          seeing an y one d ri nking and                  I d i d n ’t see an y        pubs       open.

              The    crowd were            in good spirits and were                     not    fighting      or     causing

              trouble.             On     route    to the       ground      I saw a number of               police     officers

              s ta nd in g a r o u nd       but they were            not dir ec ti ng          us towards          the g round or

              telling        us to get        down to the ground.



S.O .£        When    I got down to t h eH ^ e p p in g s Ln entrance,                          there was a mass             of

u ( i__       people      gathered          around       the    Turnstiles,            which    led    to   this    terracing,

              couple      of    pol ic em en on horse back,                   but      they did not seem to be able                      to

       \T     control        the     crowd.         I can recall            seeing a couple             of police       officers

              on foot        on the o pp osite            side of L ep pi n gs Ln but they weren't                          doing

              any th in g .          As    I got    towards         the t ur ns ti le s        the    crowd got       tighter       and

               I. could see a head           of me was a tunnel                w it h other      s pectators       going       down

               it.      So    1' thought      this was             the only entra nc e         on to the terracing.                   I

               made    my way on to the             ter ra ci ng w it h two           of my friends.              B et we en

               joining       the queue       for    the turns ti le s and             going     down the        tunnel       I saw

               no other       gates     open,      nor       did    I see anyone       drinking        or fighting.

               As    I e n te r ed the tunnel            I cchjJld manage         to walk       quite     easily a l t ho u gh

               it was       tight wit h      quite a fe<*( people              going    down     it.       As    I got onto

               the    ter ra ci ng     it was my         intent^i^K^to make my way to the                       front    d i r ectly

               be hi n d the       goals.     As    I had entered the              tunnel       I cannot        recall       seeing

               any    police       officers* or stewards at the m ou th of                       it.



    Pe n   3   As    I star te d to make my way down the                       te rr ac in g    the    crowd was        swaying

               and    it was       slowly getting             tighter and tighter and                 I had no     real

               control       over where        I was         going.       I was    just      been dragged along with

               the    crowd.         The    nearer\I^pt              to the    front    of the        crowd the      tighter

               the    crush Naot,       until      I endecf'-'up right          close       up to the front          fence,

               only about          o n e S^ e rs o n a wa y from       it.      The    crush just kept            getting

               w or s e a n d worse and         I star te d to fear             for my own        life.          Just after

               the    players       had kicked off             it was    still     getting worse and              I could not

               move    any    part of my        body.              I c o u l d ’hear an old man to my             left scream
i

               for help but           could not      do a ny thing           to help him,        as    1 could not even

               move    my head.



               I could see a pol ic em an Pha other                      side     of the       front    fence and        I was

               asking       him to open the s'ecurity gates                     but he just           d i d n ’t react,       and

               was    telling       us to stand          back and did not seem to                 realise        how bad       it

               was    but    the    crush was      still           getting worse.

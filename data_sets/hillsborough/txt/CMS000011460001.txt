              Mr. Pendry: T o ask the Secretary of State for N ational
          H eritag e w hether he is ready to announce the conclusions
          o f his reconsideration o f the all-seating requirem ents at
          F o o tb a ll League clubs.
              Mr. Mellor: I am grateful to all those who have so
          p ro m p tly let me have their views following my
          announcem ent on 4 June th at I was reconsidering certain
          aspects o f the all-seating requirements. I have been struck
          b y the consistency o f the views which have emerged.
               I said on 4 Ju n e that I was not prepared to review either
          th e principle o f o r the timetable for all-seating at first
          division grounds in the Football League, the new premier
          league. This view has been confirmed by the responses I
          h av e received an d I have decided furtherm ore in the light
          o f consultation, to continue o ur existing policy for
          all-seating for clubs in the present second division. M any
          o f these clubs have recently played in the higher division.
          All of them should aspire to do so. I have no d o u b t that
          they will w an t to prepare themselves to p u t those
          aspirations into practice by pressing ahead vigorously with
          a n d all-seating policy.
               Having considered the submissions m ade to me, I can
          confirm th a t I am prepared to allow some standing
          accom m odation to be retained at grounds in the third and
          fourth divisions providing terracing is safe. Clubs in these
          divisions should n ot see this as an easy option. They will
          need to ensure th a t such accom m odation fully accords
          with the high stand ard s o f safety which all spectators have
          a right to expect. Clubs moving from the third to the
          second division will continue to have three seasons to
          convert to all-seater.
               I continue to expect th at the vast majority o f clubs
          throughout the league will see as their ultim ate goal the

          achievement o f substantially seated grounds as p art o f
          their com mitment to the principles o f im proved spectator
          safety and com fort defined by L ord Taylor.           """

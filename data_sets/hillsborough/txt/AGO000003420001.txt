           The Hon. M r Justice Hooper
           Royal Courts of Justice



           R v DUCKENFDELD AND MURRAY



           I am instructed to write to you on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service. The South

           Yorkshire Police have sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service about the disclosure

           o f a document in their possession which relates to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster and

           which may therefore have a bearing on the current prosecution of Messrs Duckenfield and

           Murray brought by the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“the prosecutor”).          Messrs

           Duckenfield and Murray have been committed to stand trial at the Crown Court at Leeds. 1

           understand that the matter is listed for a hearing before you on 3 September 1999, for issues

           o f disclosure to be considered.



           The prosecutor has sought disclosure from the South Yorkshire Police o f all documents in

           their possession which are relevant to the prosecution. The document about which the South

           Yorkshire Police have sought advice is a report dated 12 April 1990, signed by

           I enclose a copy o f that report.



           The report was drawn to the attention o f the then Director o f Public Prosecutions in 1990,

           who subsequently sought the advice of leading counsel as to the effect of its content. The

           advice was given by you, then a member o f the Bar, in an Opinion dated 27 July 1990. I

           enclose a copy of your Opinion.

          The Crown Prosecution Service has considered the report by                    and intends to advise

          the South Yorkshire Police that it should be disclosed to the pro sec u to rr^ oliowing the usual

          practice of the Crown Prosecution Service, they also intend to advise the South Yorkshire

          Police that the report should be disclosed to both the prosecutor and the defendants at the

           same time. This advice will extend to the report alone. There is no suggestion by the Crown

          Prosecution Service that either your Opinion, or any o f the associated correspondence, should

           be disclosed to either the prosecutor or the defendants.



           I have been instructed to write to both the prosecutor and the defendants, informing them of

           the existence oi                   report and enclosing a copy. The Crown Prosecution Service also

           wishes me to draw to the attention o f both the prosecutor and the defendants that I have

           written to you in the terms of this letter; and preferably, to send to those concerned a copy of

           this letter.



           I would be pleased to instruct counsel to appear before you on 3 September to provide such

           assistance as you would wish. I have not yet instructed counsel in that capacity and would be

           grateful to know your reaction to the proposal before doing so.           The Crown Prosecution

           Service is anxious that I should write to both the prosecutor and the defendants as soon as

           possible, and certainly before 3 September, but did not want to do so without first drawing the

           matter to your attention.



           I should welcome any comments that you might care to make on the suggestion that I should

           instruct counsel to appear before you on 3 September, and on the letter that I intend to write to

           the prosecutor and the defendants in advance o f that date.

          Herewith a draft letter, with various alternatives in square brackets, depending on whether
          the letter goes from me or the Treasury Solicitor. I have assumed that the next letter - i.e.
          to the prosecution and defence - would go from T.Sols. in any event,

          I have not made any reference to Sir Geoffrey Dear in the letter.

          Can we discuss?

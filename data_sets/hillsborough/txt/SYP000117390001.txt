Superintendent                 Brougham              advised           Police          Constable           Leake       no t    to     use      the

horn     any       more      t h an    necessary                 and       Police       Constable             Leake      responded             to

this.         We    stopped           outside              the       Leppings          Lane       entrance        where        there          were

a large        number          of L i v e r p o o l             supporters             still       trying        to    enter        the

g r ou n d.        I could        see       an d          hear       a P.A.       operating             from     a Police           Land

R ov e r ,    requesting              the       crowd           to    stop      pushing.               I spoke        briefly         wi t h

Police        Constable           Treck         an d           whilst       doing       so       I was     watching           the

supporters.               I sensed              a resentful                 attitude             towards        the    presence           of

our    vehicle,           many        of    the           supporters            appeared           the     worse       for     drink.           It

did    no t    appear          that        we    could           be    of    an y      further          assistance.

Superintendent                 Brougham             asked            Police       Constable             Leake     to     leave.           I

agreed        th a t    this      was       the           best       thing      to     do    as    ou r    presence           seemed

detrimental             to     the     situation.                     We    drove       slowly          forwards         and    turned

left     into       Catchbar           Lane          and        then       travelled             via    Penistone          Road       and

Rutland        Road       to    Firvale , intending                          to      return        to     the    Driving        School.

At    Firvale,          Operations              Room            began       requesting             the     attendance           of     Dog

Handlers           at   the     ground.                   As    we    entered          Upwell          Street , Operation

Support        was      implemented.                       We    made       haste       to       Driving        School        where       all

personnel           turned        out.          All            Personnel          Carriers             were     directed        to     the

ground,        with       Police           Sergeant              Lightfoot             escorting           them       with     a Range
                                                 . - ,y

Rover.         The      Motorcycle              Wing            was    s e nt     to    Claywheels              Lane.         After       a

short        liaison         with C h i e f               Inspector          Wall,          we    also     went       to C l a y w h e e l s

Lane.         On    arrival           Police              Constable          Leake          was    instructed            to    a ct    as

communications                 vehicle.                   Police       Constable             Somerset           was    deployed

Taunts          were       coming       from    the    Nottingham             Forest       crowd which

were       obviously             intimidating          the     Liverpool            fans who          were

now     flooding            onto       the    pitch.




Afj>er s e v e r a l           minutes        I received          reports          from    f a ns     and

    ther    officers;            to    the    effect     that       people         were    being

seriously             hurt       in t h e L i v e r p o o l    Stand.           I then         left      the

cordon          and       went    to    the    area around           the      goal       mouth      where       I

assisted             fans      and     other    officers          who     were      ripping         apart

the     the      advertising             boards       for     use    as    s t ret che rs. -        •I

could       see       a number          of    people     lying       on the         ground        being

tended          to    by o t h e r      officers,        ambulancemen               and    firemen.

It w a s        apparant          at    this    time     t h at     some      of    the    pe o p l e

being       put       on    to    the    makeshift          stretchers             were    dead.

Liverpool             f an s     on    the    pitch were          becoming          increasingly

agitated             at    the    chants       coming       from     the      Nottingham Forest

end     and a         l a r ge    number       began     to    run      towards          th at    e nd/

many       of    them       shouting          and    screaming          hysterically.                 I ran

back       towards          the       Nottingham       Forest        end      of    the    pitch,         all

Nottingham                Forest       end    and    together        began         to w a l k     back

towards          the       Liverpool          end,    sweeping          the     angered          fans

towards          the       West       Stand.        After     this      I o nc e        again     went

towards          the W e s t          Stand    goal    area,        to a s s i s t       regarding

At    the    time     I left        the     ground         I had     no       idea       of    the

     i refer        to my          letter       of 24 April         1989       regarding      the      ret e n t i o n of

     cer tain areas                of     the    ground    for     Che    purpose       of Lord J u s t i c e      '!a y i o r ’s

     Enquiry,            Now       f o llowing      examination           oy    his a p p o i n t s a assessor,,

     Professor           i        Maunder,        indication        has    been given         that      this    preserved

     a rea     could be amended..                   I have       taken     the o p p o r t u n i t y    of a t t a c h i n g a

     f urther       ground          plan        indicating       the a rea that            is still      desired to

     retain        for       the    contin u a n c e      of e x a m i n a t i o n   by the     enquiry        team.        This

     a re a    includes            cne gates        in L e p pinqs        Lane,      but   omits       gates    numbers       1

     to 8 w hich             serve a w a l k w a y        to the      north       stand and the          em e r g e n c y exit

     gate     A.      The         othe r faoundar y 1 ine           is f r om Leppi n g s        L a n e , a 1ong      the

  the    track    immediate iy .i n front               of the west          end   te r r a c e s .

  However,       I •w o u l d    indicate     that      various       areas appear          to be unsafe which

  are    now being        released and before                the    resum p t i o n   of football             is

  advisable       that       these areas are            thoroughly         checked.         Tne       b o u ndary wall

  on the     south      side      from and     including           gate C is the are a                of    particular

  concern.        L ord Just i c e        Taylor       has   indicated, that          the ;wall            on the

  s outh west       side        can.be    repaired at a time               convenient         to yourselves,

  he has also         directed        that    the areas         within       the   shaded       part        on the map

  attached       can be         swept and     cleansed wit h            aisinfectant„             whe n we have

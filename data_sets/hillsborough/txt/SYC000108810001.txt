                   Bv THE CORONER:

It is Stuart Edward Hamilton, is it not? - A. Yes.

Do you still live at                 ? - A. I have
changed addresses since tnen.

Can you tell me what your present address is? - A.


That is Liverpool, is it not? - A. Yes.

At the time you were a schoolboy I think.    Are you
still at school? - A. Yes.

You and your stepdad went to the match? - A. Yes.

Both of you are keen Liverpool supporters? - A. We
are, yes.

Did you travel by coach or car? - A. By coach.

Was it an organised party? Do you know which company
it was? - A. Fureys Coaches.

Do you know what time you left? - A. 9.30, 9.45.

Have you any idea what time you got to Sheffield? -
A. Two o'clock.

When you say two o'clock at the ground or
Sheffield? - A. About when we left the actual coach.

Were you held up on the way at all? - A. Yes, a
couple of times.

When you left the motorway I think the coach pulled
up and had a pause, did it not? - A. Yes.

How near to Sheffield were you when that was? - A. We
came off the Ml and so it must have been quite close.

Do you know what time that was when you came off the
Ml and pulled into this pub? - A. Twelve o'clock.

How long did you stay at the pub would you say? - A.
Perhaps an hour.

Having left the pub the coach then proceeded towards
the ground, is that right? - A. Yes.
                                           S. E. HAMILTON


Was it in fact intercepted by the Police as we pulled
off the motorway? - A. Yes, as we pulled off the
motorway.

What happened? Did they come on to the coach? - A.
Yes, they searched the coach.

What were they looking for? - A. Drink and to check
they all had tickets.

They did check for tickets? - A. Yes.

Can you remember by chance whether everybody did have
tickets? - A. Everyone had one, yes.

I take it they did not find any drink either? - A.
N o , they didn't .

I think your dad   initially had a stand ticket, is
that right? - A.   Yes, that is right. No, he
originally had a   terrace ticket.Sorry, he
originally had a   stand ticket, that is right, yes.

Then I think he swapped it for a terrace ticket? - A.
A terrace ticket.

Then he swapped it again? - A. I have no idea.

Did he just retain it? - A. I have no idea.    That was
after I had left him.

So when you left him he still had a stand ticket? -
A. That is right, yes.

But he preferred the terraces, did he not? - A. Yes.

Now having got off the coach, you got off with dad at
that point? - A. Yes.

Both of you walked towards Leppings Lane, would that
be right? - A. That is right, yes.

Did you get to the entrance together? - A. We stopped
just before the entrance together where we had to
split up.

I am sorry? - A. Just before the entrance where we
had to split up.

How close to the entrance were you? - A. A couple of
hundred yards.

Do you know which way you approached it? - A. We came
along Leppings Lane alongside the river.
                                                              3



                                                  S. E. HAMILTON


    Q. Did you cross a little bridge? When you turned into
       the entrance did you turn right or left? - A. It was
       left I think to the entrance.

    Q. If you look at the model, does that help you to
B      orientate yourself? - A. Yes.

    Q. Walk over to it? - A. We walked along here, Leppings
       Lane.

    Q. He is indicating from the Penistone Road roundabout.
       Did you walk downhill that you came before you got to
       Leppings Lane? - A. Before we got to Leppings Lane we
       went down a big hill, yes.

    Q. Did you go round a big roundabout or at least did you
       see a big roundabout? - A. I can't remember.

    Q. You have already told me that the Police got on the
       coach and had a check for tickets and drink? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. As you walked to the ground you were again approached
D       by a group of Policemen, is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q.    What happened then? - A. Just a line of about five or
         six Policemen and if people were drinking they were
         just saying, "No drink, lads, past here. Drink it up
         and then carry on going".

    Q.   How were they lined up, across the road or the
         length? - A. It is like across the road and pavement.

    Q.   You had to go through them? - A. Yes.

    Q.    Did you as a matter of interest people who were still
         drinking at that point? - A. There was one or two but
         not many.

    Q. I think the ones you did see all drank up? - A. Yes,
       they were standing by the Policemen finishing their
       drink.

    Q.    They were finishing off and    then they went.Can you
         recollect where that was? - A. It was on the hill on
         the way down, near the end of the hill I remember.

    Q.   Near the bottom of the hill? - A. Yes.

    Q. You then came along and you reached the entrance with
       dad at about what time would you say having
       circumnavigated all these obstacles and so on? - A.
       About quarter to three, maybe a bit before.

    Q.    Are you sure it was aslate as that? I do not really
         mind what time it was. I just want to be sure.

A                                                 S. E. HAMILTON


         Before you answer that question I will ask you one or
         two others because you might come back to that. You
         then split up from dad, is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q. That is because he had a stand ticket and you had a
B      terrace ticket? - A. No, we both had stand tickets
       when we split up but for different stands.

    Q.   Which stand was yours? - A. I was in the West Stand.

    Q.   Your dad, where was he supposed to be? - A. He was
         above in Leppings Lane. That is when I left him. He
         had tickets for there in the stand.

        0. That is the one above in Leppings Lane, that is what I
           am asking you.  Show me vmich. one you were in? - A. I
           was in the North Stand.

        Q.    So you sulit up? - A. Yes.
    B
        0. Did you get through the turnstiles without any
           difficulty? - A. No problem.

        0. iiow many people were tnere? - A. There was a lot but no
           more than usual.

        0. And you had no difficulty getting through? - A. No, I
           was straight through.

             ..ere you searched at all? - A. No.  Tnere as a
             I'oiicewoman on tae gate but she didn't search me.

             .>ut sne searcned others, did sue? - A. Yes.

             nt tnat point you were not in any crusn or anything
             iiKe that? - A. No.

    D        m e reason why I ask this is because of the timing.    I
             tniin; you said quarter-to.  In your statement you said,
             “1 reacned the entrance to my part of tne ground at 2 v J -
             past-2".   Now it doesn't matter very mucn to me what
             time it is, but what time on reflection do you think is
             correct? - A. Probably tne earlier of the two.

             iou having got througn I think you actually askea the
             steward where to go because you had a gangway number,
             is tnat right? - A. Tnat's right, yes.

             .jo v o u know by cnance wnicn turnstile number you went
             tnrouan? - A. No. The gangway queue was where I had to
                 out ....

             : , nut you aon't remember the turnstile.   Having got
             to the gangway I tnink there were some stewards tnere,
             but you just went up, and you took your seat, is that
             n .   it?   -   A.   Yes.

             In fact, you last saw dad at these turnstiles when /ou
             saia goodbye to him? - A. Yes.

             Can you remember wnat tine you got to your seat? - A.
             It was probably about quarter-to-3, 15 minutes before
             tne K i c k - o f f .

        U. Having sat down I take it you just waited for tne match
           to start, is that right? - A. Yes.

        0. Did you see tne players come onto tne pitch? - A. Yes.

    0. Did you see

    0. Did you see

    0. Did you see
B      remember that? - A. Yes.

    0. You definitely saw that? - A. Yes.

    Q. So would it be rignt to say that your attention was
       concentrated on tne game? - A. Yes.

    0. At what point did you first notice that anything was
       wrong? - A. Ivnen a fan came onto the pitch and the
       referee stopped the play.

    0. Tnat was the first alert? - A. That was the first I
       knew, yes.

    0. You then looked presumably to find out why this was
       happening.  Perhaps I ought to ask you, did you see a
       Police Officer go up to the referee as well? - A. Yes.

D   0. Was that before or after the fan, or more or less the
       same time, or don't you know? - A. I don't know.

    (). Having seen tnat the match had stopped, did you then
        look towards Leppings Lane to see what was going on? -
        A. Yes.

    0. What did you see then? - A. People climbing over the
       spikes at the top of the railings, onto the pitch.

    0. You didn't know why they were going over? - A. No, not
       at first.

    0. At what point did you realise that there was a serious
       crisis on? - A. When so many came on, and where I was
       sat it looked like what was bodies were appearing, laid
       on tne pitch and covered up in front of us.

    0. It was only then tnat you ...? - A. It was only tnen.

    0. You weren't really close enougn, were you, to see tne
       detail of what was going on? - A. No, I wasn't.

    0. Did you see the Police come onto tne field? - A. Yes.

    0. When did you see that, after the match was stopped or
       before?  Can you remember? - A. I saw tne Police come
       on after tne match was stopped.

    0. You mentioned tnat you saw some Police dogs in your
       statement.  It is not terribly important but it is the
                                                           7


                                               S.   E.   HAMILTON




   first reference to it, and I am just interested in what
   you actually saw? - A. Where we were sitting there was
   an entrance onto the pitch, below us on the left I
   tnink, wide enough for things like cars and that to get
   through.

0. I can't hear you? - A. Where we were sat there was an
   entrance onto the pitch wide enough for things like
   cars and that, and I seem to remember a Policeman
   coming in witn dogs, not actually on the pitch itself
   but along the track that was around it.

Q. Apart from the fact that you knew that dad enjoyed the
   terraces more than the stands, you nave no idea whether
   he swapped a ticket or what he did? - A. I tnink in the
   articles he had tnat we picked up after it all, he did
   have a stub for a Leppings Lane ticket standing up, so
   I assume he swapped it.

0. For a terrace ticket? - A. Yes,   he did.

0. So tnat makes you feel more confident that he did
   manage to swap it? - A. Yes.

0. I am very, very sorry that you lost your dad.         Is your
   mum nere? - A. Yes.

0. Which is mum?  I am very sorry, Mrs. Hamilton.  It is
   very good of your lad to come along and tell us what
   his experiences were.  Tnank you very much indeed.
   Defore you go, I want you to snow me on a plan where
   you were sitting.
   (The witness marked his position on Exhibit C373)

0. I am just going to ask you one more question.  Wnen you
   first looked down, having seen tnat the match had
   stopped, wnat did you think had happened?  - A. Just
   some reason, for a pitch invasion or something along
   those lines.

0. That was your first tnought? - A. Yes.

0. It was wnen you saw people were injured tnat you
   realised it couldn't be, is that rignt? - A. Yes.

        THE CORONER:   Does anybody want to ask anything
   arising out of those two questions?  (No response)

                     GERARD MARTIN BARON Sworn

                           By THE CORONER:

    Q. You are Gerard Martin Baron? - A. Yes.
B   Q. It is still                      - A. No, it has changed.
       It is now                            Preston.

    Q. In fact you are a bus driver? - A. That is correct.

    Q. Ribble Motor Services, I think? - A. That's right.

    0. You weren't driving any buses to Sheffield that day? - A.
       No.

    Q. You were a passenger? - A. No, I was in my own vehicle.

    Q. What I meant was that you weren't on duty? - A. No.

    Q. In fact you didn't come by coach.     How did you come? -
       A. I came by my own car.

    0. You were with dad? - A. That's right.

    Q. Both of you had tickets? - A. That's right.

    Q. I think you bought them in Liverpool? - A. No, I bought
       them from a friend at work.

       In fact you had to pay a bit over the odds but you didn't
       care because you were happy to get the tickets? - A.
       That's right.

    Q. The point is you had them before you set off? - A. That's
       right.

    0. You set off in your car.   Can   I just double check the
       spelling.   Your first name is   Gerard,with one "R"? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. Dad's first name was Gerard as well? - A. That's right.

    0. He spells it with a double "R"? - A. No, it is spelled
       the same as mine.

    Q. With just one "R"? - A. Yes.

    Q. So it is Gerard Bernard Patrick? - A. Yes.

    Q. And Baron, of course, like yours? - A. Yes.
            THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, these names we
       have trouble with them.   I know from bitter experience

       that if we get the name wrong it is very upsetting for
       the family when they come to register and that is why I
       fuss so:

    Q. What time did you leave? - A. We left Preston at about
       10.30 in the morning.
B
    Q. What time did you get to Sheffield? - A. Roughly about
       12.30.

    Q. There was a little bit of delay but nothing much on the
       journey down? - A. That's right.   There was an accident
       on the motorway with a motor cyclist, but there wasn t a
       long delay.
      Having got to Sheffield did you park somewhere? - A. Yes,
      on driving down to Sheffield my fan belt snapped on the
      car so I knew if I stopped it on the motorway I wouldn't
      be able to start it again so we just carried on into
      Sheffield.   There was a Halfordts store.   I thought I
      would be able to get a fan belt but I couldn't so we just
      left it parked there and then walked to the ground.

    Q. You in fact were not stopped by the Police in the vehicle
       to have any checks made by you? - A. No.

    Q. Did you see any Police presence? - A. Only like on the
       approach to the ground.

    Q. You did? - A. Yes.

    Q. So you parked near the Halford's store,    That wasn't
       very far from the ground? - A. No.

      There is a Gateway supermarket there as well? - A. I
      think so, yes.

    Q- That was around 12.30? - A. Yes.

    Q- Straight to the ground you went? - A.   Yes.

    Q. Were you in fact intercepted by any Policemen on the way
       and checked for tickets or alcohol? - A. None whatsoever.

       You got to the ground and the entrance would be
       relatively clear? - A. The odd one or two people around
       but fairly clear.

       What time would you say you actually arrived at the
       ground? - A. We arrived at the ground roughlyabout one
       o'clock. 1.00 pm.

       Everything was nice and friendly, you were quite happy
       with the situation? - A. Very relaxed.

Q. You entered through a turnstile? - A. That is correct.

Q. Both of you, of course.    Were either of you searched? -
   A. I was searched but my father wasn't.    In fact I was
   upset.    One Police Officer said, "We won't search you,
   Grandad."

Q. That upset you? - A. It did, yes.

Q. Was that because he was describing him as an older person
   or because you felt he shouldn't have searched you
   either? - A. Well, not that.   I just think they
   shouldn't say things like that anyway.

Q. Were you searched on the inside as well? - A. Yes.

Q. So you were searched twice? - A. No.   I'm sorry, I was
   searched as I was going through the turnstile.

Q. Not on the inside? - A. No.

Q. You actually parked at Halford's? - A. That is correct.

Q. There is a big grassy area, isn't there? - A. On the way,
   yes.

Q. Were there lots of fans on that grass? - A. About ten,
   just sat down.

Q. Not very many? - A. No.

Q. They were mixed, Nottingham and Liverpool? - A. It was a
   mixture of Nottingham Forest supporters and Liverpool.

0. So there were very few people there altogether? - A. That
   is right.

Q.   At the time when you were there? - A. That's right.

Q.    I will come back now to the ground.   You got through the
     turnstile.    Had you been to the ground before? - A. I
     had never been to Hillsborough before.

Q. How did you enter on to the terracing? - A. We walked
   through the turnstiles and then proceeded down the tunnel
   into pen 3.

Q. The tunnel was empty I take it?   No problem getting
   through. - A. There was nobody there, no.

Q.   You got on to the terracing.    What time did you exit on
     to the terracing? - A. About 1.15/1.20, something like
     that.
                                              G. M. BARON


What was the terracing like at that time? - A. It was
just normal, like, not packed, not empty, just a mixture
of people.

You had plenty of space I take it at that point? -
A. Plenty of space at that time, yes.

Did you go straight down to the front initially? - A.
Yes, we proceeded down to the bottom of pen 3, a couple
of steps away from the fencing.

In fact you would have been quite happy to stay there? -
A. Yes.

Dad was next to you? - A. Yes.




      Q. In fact I think you
                                  G.M. BARON



In fact I think you saw various other people, in fact a
couple of girls you saw as well who you later recognised
in various photographs? - A. Yes.

And they were near the front with you as well? - A. They
had gone past me.

More to the front? - A. Yes.

Right, then tell me then there you are quite early on
standing. What happened. What was the next significant
event? - A. It just started to get more and more people
in. We then proceeded to the front where I thought my
dad could get a better view.  It just started to get normal
like a normal steady crowd and it started to get worse
and after that it happened so, well I would not say fast
like, it just got unbearable.  I got separated from my
father because I was sort of like protecting him.     I
sort of got pushed back and it just piled on to me. A
lad's head went into my chest which then I could not
breathe or anything like that. Everybody was screaming
and that and then I just blacked out and I woke up in
hospital.

I want to just take you back a little bit over that.
I wanted you to tell me in your own words so we could
get the feel of your evidence.

      Are you able to remember for instance the teams,
I know you can remember the teams coming out for a kick
around at 2 o'clock or fairly early on but it was very
early at that point, wasn't it? - A. I believe so, yes.

And I would be right in thinking at that point you were
not particularly distressed, or was that wrong? - A.
Not at that time, no.
Can you remember the teams actually being announced? -
A. No.
Can you remember the teams coming on to the field? - A.
No.

Can you remember kick-off? - A. No, I did not know the
game had started till the day after.

So your recollection of events, which I am not blaming
you in any way because if you went to hospital and
lost consciousness it is quite possible that it just
wiped it from your mind, but you can't relate what you
are telling me to events on the field.  Is that right?
- A. That is right.
                                                            13


                                       G.M. BARON




Q. And I take it that it is difficult for you to relate it
   to times, or can you? - A. I could not give exact times
   as regards match starting or anything like that.

Q. Did you look at your watch at all? - A. No, I didn't
   have time to.

Q. What period of time do you think - and if you can't
   answer this I don't want you to answer it - what time did
   you say, about quarter—to—2 you said you were on the
   terracing.  Is that right? - A. We got on the terraces
   about quarter-past-1, 20-past-l.

Q. I beg your pardon. Can you say how long you stood in
   your first position before you moved forward right up
   against the fence with dad? - A. I would say about 20
   minutes, something like that.

Q. So that would take you to about 20-to-2 or so? - A.
   Roughly, yes.

Q. How long after that do you remember the players coming
   out and kicking the ball around? - A. To be honest with
   you I could not say.

Q. Can you say and if you don't know please just say so,
   can you say how long it was before the crush came to
   such a state that you found it unbearable? - A. I
   could say when it started to get a bit uncomfortable
   was roughly about quarter-past-2ish, 10-past-2, some­
   thing like that.

Q. Was it at that point so uncomfortable that you had
   never experienced that degree of discomfort before? -
   A. Sorry?

Q.   Do you go to big matches? - A. Oh yes.

Q.    Had you experienced that level of discomfortbefore?
     - A. No, never.

Q. So you are saying at about quarter-past-2 you were so
   uncomfortable ... A. I would say by that, yes.

Q. Did you make any attempt to leave? - A. Did I make any
   attempt to leave. No.

Q.   Why not? - A. Well at that stage, when itstarted to
     get uncomfortable for me there was nowhere to go. You
     could not leave or anything. You were fixed.

Q. So you are saying at quarter-past-2 you were fixed? -
   A. Roughly.
                                                              14


                                         G.M. BARON



Q. How long was it between that time and the point when you
   were trying to assist your dad by protecting him? - A.
   Sorry?

Q. I think you said you were trying to protect your dad?
   - A. That is right, yes.

Q. What time was that? - A. I have not a clue.

Q. How long was the time gap, can you say, from when you say
   you were fixed? - A. If I were giving you a time I would
   be lying to you.

Q.    Okay, fair enough. It is the last thing I want you to
     do. Did you hear people shouting? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you relate those shouts to the quarter-past-2 time?
   - A. Sorry?

Q. You said at quarter-past-2 you were fixed.         I am accepting
   that for a moment? - A. Yes.

Q.    Can you relate the shouts.   You said you heardpeople
     shouting? - A. I can, yes.

Q. Was it at that same time that people were shouting or
   later? - A. Sorry?

Q. Was it at that time that people were shouting or later?
   - A. Well that time and onwards, I would say that yes.

Q.   Did you see the gate open at all? - A. I never saw the
     gate open but what I did see was a young lad sort of
     like to the right of me being lifted out obviously through
     the gate and he was pushed back.

Q.   Just one boy was it? - A. Just one young   lad, yes.

Q.   Who pushed him back? - A. It was a Police Officer.

Q. Did you see the gate shut after that? - A. I believe so,
   yes.

Q. Did you notice   whether there were any people outside
   already on the   wrong, I say the wrong side of the pens,
   the pitch side   of the fence when that happened? - A. The
   people outside   the fence?

Q. Yes? - A. The only people I saw outside is when I turned
   my head there was photographers and a Policeman. He
   was directly behind me at the fence.

Q. How many Police Officers were there? - A. I only saw
   one which was directly behind me.

                                       G.M. BARON



Q.   In front of you you mean or behind you? -A. Sorry?

Q.    You say there was a Police Officer behind you? - A.Yes,
     I am on the terrace, the Police Officer is behind me.

Q.   On the terrace? - A. No, beyond the fence.

Q.   Oh I see, ahead of you in fact? - A. Right.

Q.    Was he looking in or away from you? - A. He wasjuststood
     with his arms folded looking in.

Q.    That was not the Officer who pushed the boy back then was
     it? - A. No.

Q. It must have been another one? - A. Yes.

Q.   So you saw two Policemen? - A. Yes.

Q.    That is what I am trying to find out how many because it
     might help us with timings you see. That is what all this
     is about to try and piece together as best as we can when
     it happened. - A. Okay.

Q. So we have got two Police Officers you saw? - A. I saw
   two Police Officers.

Q. Did    you see any more Police Officers? - A. No.

Q. But    you did see some photographers? - A. Yes.

Q. Which way were they pointing their cameras, towards the
   Stand or away from it? - A. They were pointing it into
   the Stand.

Q. Were you still screaming at that point?    - A. Iwas asking
   for help, yes, screaming for help.

Q. In relation to when you said you felt fixed so that you
   could not move, how many minutes before or after did
   you become fixed from this event? - A. I have not a clue.
   I have not a clue, honest.

Q. Can  you say whether you were already in a fixedposition
   at that point? - A. I was unable to move freely, yes.

Q. You don't remember the gate opening again because you
   lost consciousness.  Is that correct? - A. I don't remember
   the gate opening on the perimeter fence you mean?

Q.   Yes? - A. I didn't see it open, no.

Q.   No, you saw it   open and this boy, yourrecollection is
     that the boy went out and was pushed back, it was then
     closed. That is what you told me? - A. That is right.

                                                      G. M. BARON


Q.   Did you see it open again? - A. No.

Q.   Did you see any Officers on the pitch, on the
     perimeter fence, either shouting or signalling into
     the terraces? - A. No.

Q. Can you just show us on a little plan where you were?
   - A. Yes.

      MR. BEECHEY:   C.374, sir.

      MR. KING:   Did he say he was in     two positions?

     THE CORONER:     I understood his evidence to be thathe
was stood a couple  of rows back from the fence when  he
first entered and then after about twenty minutes, at about
quarter to two, he  moved right up to the fence.

     MR. KING: Is   that position the second position?That
is all I am asking, sir.

Q.        THE CORONER:   That cross you have put on, is
     that your first position or your second position? -
     A. That was my second position.

Q.   That is not quite on the fence.   That is the   reason I
     ask you? - A. Right.

Q. Were you just a little bit back? - A. Yes, not
   directly at the fence.

Q. I want you to have a look at your statement.   If you
   give him pages four and five. This not intended as a
   trap or anything.  It is very hard, particularly when
   you lose consciousness, and it makes it very
   difficult particularly when you have lost your dad.
   This the statement you gave on the 4th May 1989 and I
   want you to have a look at page four.   Read it to
   yourself first of all so that you absorb it. Start
   in the middle of page four where it begins, "The
   stand began to fill up " . Can you see that paragraph?
   - A. Right. Do you wish me to read it?

Q.   Have   you found the place? - A. I have found it, yes.

Q.   I want you to read to the end of that page and then
     on the next page I think we need to read the next ten
     lines.  In fact, read to the end of the second page
     of your statement? - A. Yes.

Q. Have you read to the end? - A. Yes.

Q. Having read that, would you say that that agrees with
   the facts as you believed them to be at the time? -
   A. At the time, yes.
Would you stand by those facts or would you say you
do not stand by them any more? - A. On this
statement, I would stand by these facts, yes.

In that case I think it would be easiest if you just
read us that part of the statement. Just read it out
aloud, would you? - A. Okay. Read it aloud?

Yes, and begin at "The stand began to fill up"? - A.
It says:

      "The crowd steadily built up over the
      next 30 minutes or 40 minutes or so until
      the pressure of bodies...."

No, no, you have started a little bit further down.
Start two paragraphs higher up where it says, "The
stand began to fill up". Can you see? - A. Right.
It says:

      "The stand began to fill up as normal and
      when the players came out about 2 pm for
      a kick about the stand appeared to be
      nearly full. The players stayed out on
      the pitch for about ten minutes and by
      the time they left the pitch it was
      beginning to get uncomfortable in the
      stand.  I would say at this stage I was
      still just about manageable although
      uncomfortable. The crowd steadily built
      up over the next 30 minutes or 40 minutes
      or so until the pressure of bodies became
      absolutely unbearable. By this stage my
      father was now standing directly in front
      of me by the fence and I was holding on
      to the fence with my arms outstretched
      shielding him.  I could see that he was
      beginning to panic. At this point there
      was a sudden crowd surge from the back
      and the pressure was immense and I was
      carried away to my right hand side and I
      lost sight of my father against this mass
      of bodies as they suddenly surged forward
      at this point.  I was totally unaware
      whether the match had started or kicked
      off."

"Whether or not the match had kicked off" I think? -
A. Right.  It says:

     "Having been forced to the right I found
     myself pinned against a fence with my
     back to it. There was a lot of people
     pushed up against me and I found it
     difficult to breathe.  I heard people
     shout to the Police who were standing by
                                                             18

                                                       G. M. BARON


             the fence, 'Open the gates. There's
             people dying here'. I was shouting for
             them to open the gates as well and at one
             point I did see the gate open and a young
             lad of about ten or eleven years of age
B            got out through it only to be pushed back
             into the crowd by a Police Officer who
             then closed the gate. This Officer I
             believe was a Police Constable. The
             crowd again began to plead with the
             Police, 'Open the gates. There's people
             dying'. I couldn't move and there was a
             lad's head pressing against my chest.   I
             couldn't breathe and I can remember
             stretching my arms out whilst looking
             back at the crowd desperately trying to
             grab for help. Everything then went
             black and I passed out."

    Q. You might as well finish it. Wait a minute. Yes,
       read the next sentence and then stop. "I cannot say
       how long..."? - A. It says:

D            "I cannot say how long I was subjected to
             the crushing prior to passing out.  I can
             only say it seemed like a very long time
             and when the surge came, it came
             completely without warning."

    Q. You would now say that you would be happy with this
       as a reasonably realistic account of what you can
       remember, is that right? - A. That is right, yes.

    Q. I forgot to ask you about the surge. Can you
       remember anything at all about it? - A. Can I
       remember anything about it?

    Q. You cannot, did you say? - A. All I can remember is
       that there was a surge and that was it.

                   Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

    Q. On the point about your estimates of time, you have
       been asked a lot of questions about that and no one
       is criticising you for not being able to remember
       exactly when things happened. Have you been told for
       how long you were unconscious? - A. No.   I have not
       been told how long I was unconscious for.

    Q. This may help for the Jury to assess your evidence
       about the sequence of times before that. You blacked
       out in the pen? - A. That is right, yes.

    Q. You recovered in the hospital? - A. I believe so,
       yes.

                                                 G. M. BARON


Which hospital was that? - A.The Royal   Hallamshire.

Do you know how you were taken there? - A. No.

Have you been told about that I mean? - A. I haven't
been told directly but I just assumed I was taken by
an ambulance or something.

You must have been unconscious when you were taken
out of the pen? - A. I believe so, yes.

You must have been in the field for a while because
we know the first ambulance did not come until about
quarter past? - A. I am sorry?

I am just trying to work out how long you were
unconscious for, do you see? - A. Okay.

We know the ambulance came at about quarter past
three and we know from other witnesses that the
really serious crush was round about three o'clock? -
A. Right.

Then you would have to be put into the ambulance and
driven to the hospital. Do you know whereabouts you
were in the hospital when you recovered
consciousness? - A. No.

You do not know? - A. No.

Had you been taken up to a ward or were you still in
the emergency reception? - A. The only thing I can
remember is waking up in a hospital bed.

In bed? - A. That is the only thing I can recollect.

Did you stay in that bed or were you moved to another
one? - A. As far as I know I just stayed in that bed
until my relative came later that night.

I have asked you a lot about it to give you a chance
to think, to try and help. You may not be able to
remember yourself? - A. No.

But somebody may have told you what time they came
and found you there? - A. I can't remember myself.

It sounds as if you must have been unconscious for at
least quarter of an hour until you were put into the
ambulance and then at least another quarter of an
hour to get to hospital? - A. I wouldn't know.

Then some time after that? - A. I wouldn't know.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:

Q. This is terribly difficult for you because, of
   course, it is not only what happened to you but what
   happened to others as well. What I am feeling, and
   help me if this is correct or not, is that really
   what you told the Coroner - forget the 2.15 time - up
   to you reading your statement aloud, that is pretty
   much all you can definitely say you remember? - A.
   That is right.

Q. Although that statement has been put to you and you
   have read it out and said, "Yes, that is there",
   really today to come and give evidence you cannot
   tell us very much more than you told us verbally? -
   A. All I can tell you is that when I was giving this
   statement the Police interviewing me asked for times
   and I did actually say to them, "They are only
   assuming times" and he said, "That is fair enough".
   When I was giving my statement I told the Police that
   they were only assuming times and they said that that
   was fair enough.

Q. It is a question of that blur between what you
   specifically remember, what you have learned from
   other people as you read about it, spoken about it,
   and what the Police Officers who were interviewing
   you obviously knew about it as well? - A. Yes.

Q. Please understand that nobody in any way is
   criticising you. What you can say definitely is what
   you said to start with regardless of what is your
   statement? That is what you remember as at today? -
   A. Well, yes.  I would say that this statement I have
   made is as near to the truth as possible.

     MR. KING: Sir, might I just    borrow his statement, not
to go beyond the passages he read   out, just to check it.
My note, because it was read out,   I did not quite take it
all in and I would be grateful to   have a look at just the
passages he read out, sir.

     THE CORONER:  I will pass you a copy.  It is pages

          0. Mr. Baron, all I want to see if we have right is not so
             much the exact timings, but the sequence of events, and
             it looks as if tnat wnich you said in your statement
      B      and that which you told us today isn't very different
             to this extent, tnat when the players came out for the
             warm-up, at that stage, which we know was relatively
             early on, your impression at that stage was you were
             beginning to get uncomfortable? - A. That's right.

          Q. At that stage, though you say it was manageable, and
             then it built up to a stage when you were fixed? - A.
             That's right.

          0. Tne impression I get therefore is tnat you were in a
             state of being fixed for quite a considerable amount of
             time before you blacked out, would that be right? - A.
             That's right, yes.

          0.    Whatever that time was.  I was  going to ask you before
               your statement was read out what you could hear the
               people shouting, because you told us that you neard
      D        people shouting but you weren't asked exactly what they
               were shouting.   We know from what you have now read out
               from your statement, which you say is accurate, that
               you could hear people shouting, "Open the gates,
               tnere's people dying here"? - A. Tnat's correct.

          0. At that time, this is what I wanted to find out about,
             at that time this was before you saw the gate of pen 3
             opened, a lad lifted out and put back in again, that
             was before then by the look of  it? - A. Yes.

          0.    At that time, before that gate 3 was opened and then
               shut again, and people were shouting in that way, you
               yourself were pinned against the front of the fence? -
               A. I believe it to be the front of the fence, yes.

          0. with your back to it, and tnere were people pusned
             against you? - A. Yes.

          0. So they were pushed against the fence too? - A. Tnat's
             ngnt.

          0. So the picture at the front of that perimeter fence
             before you saw that gate 3 being opened and then snut
             again, was that picture of people pushed against the
             perimeter fence.   You were in distress, clearly those
             around you were in distress? - A. That s right, yes.

          0. After tnat gate 3 had been opened and shut you
             continued to hear the crowd around you pleading with
             tne Police Officers? - A. Tnat's right.

    Q. What were they pleading? - A. Pleading for help, to
       open tne gate.

    o. You spoke about a Police Officer with nis arms folded?
       - A. Yes.
B
    o. How close to the fence did he appear to be from where
       you were? - A. He would be a couple of feet away from
       the fence.

    o. Your impression was he was looking in ? - A. He was
       looking in, yes.

    0. I have no further questions.     Thank you.

    o. As I understand your evidence, Mr. Baron, when you were
       at the front of the pen and in difficulty --- - A.
       Could you speak up, please.  I can't hear.

    n . I am sorry.  i><hen you were in difficulty, standing at
        tne front of the pen, people were pushed against you,
D       is that correct? - A. Well, yes.    They were not
        pushing, tney was fixed against me.

    0, Fixed against you? - A. Yes.

    0,   And your back was to the pitcn? - A.    Yes.

    0. Do you know how long you were in that position before
       you lost consciousness? - A. I have not a clue with the
       time, no.

         So it could be a matter of seconds, minutes, you simply
         nave no idea? - A. I have not, no.

         ;;o you recall a lot of noise around   you? -A.Yes.

         iou mentioned that the gate opened, someone was pushed
         bad; and the gate was closed.  Can I asK you this, how
         were you able to see that the gate was closed? - A. I
         was looking to my right and I saw a young lad, ne was
         being raisea out.  All I could see was two nanris
         holding a young lad, and the gate must have been open
         because a Policeman came and pushed him back, and I
         presume taat the gate shut then.

    0. So you are assuming that the gate was open. You saw a
       Constable's arm? - A. I saw a Constable, not an arm, a
       Constable push the young lad back.

    0. And at tnat time do you know how long you had been in
       tne position you have described? - A. I have no exact




H
time, how long I was in tnat position.  It would be an
estimated time and I am not going to do that.

tfere you able to see waat was at the front of tne gate,
above and beyond that wnich you have already described?
- A. I could not see anything in front of the gate
because I was not directly in front of the gate, I was
side on to the gate, but I saw a young lad being pushed
to the gate and a Policeman leant in and pushed him
back.   I am only telling you what I saw and that is the
truth.

So you do not know, clearly, what was below your eye
level at that gate? - A. Do I remember ...?

You do not know what was below your eye level at that
gate? - A. Ho.

    Q. You have been a Liverpool supporter for many years? -
       A. Yes.

    o. And I think you went to the match with three of your
       friends? - A. That is right.
B
    0. That is the 15t'n April 1989 match? - A. Yes.

    o. How did you travel? - A. By train.

    o. From Liverpool I think, was it? - A. Yes, well I live
       in Southport so we started off from Southport.

    0. You got to Sheffield, I think you said 12.15, would
       that be about right? - A. Yes.

    Q< That was at the main station, was it, in Sneffield? -
       A. Tne main station, not the local station.

    Q. In fact, you had a ticket because you got it from your
       brother, I think? - A. That is right, yes.

    0. I think the Police did actually searcn you but they did
       not check whether you had a ticket at that point, is
       tnat right? - A. No.  I think I was searched
       approximately four or five times before the game and
       not once did I have my ticket checked.

    0. Did you walk from the station or did you go by bus? -
       A. No, we were met at the main station by a number of
       Policemen who searched us, put us on a special bus ana
       took us to the stadium.

    o, I think the bus dropped you off at Leppings Lane about
       12.30 or so? - A. Yes.

    0. It is rignt, isn't it, that when you got there the
       Police said go in or clear off, don't hang around the
       gates, or words to that effect? - A. That is right.   I
       actually attended the same game the year before and we
       had been, well not forced to go in but told to go in.
       We couldn't walk around.  I found that a hit strange at
       tne time.

    0. What did you do? - A. Elected to walk round the ground
       because as I put in my statement, one of my friends was
       living in Nottingham at the time, he had a ticket for
       the Nottingham Forest end, and ne was meant to be
       meeting one of his friends, so we escorted him round
       the ground.

    Q. That is where you were met by the Police Officers on
       several occasions, I think? - A. Yes, because I was

                                                               25

         carrying a large carrier bag, so they searched me on a
         number of occasions.

    0. I see, so you had something which attracted their
       attention? - A. Yes.
B
    0 . But despite   the fact that they did not look at your
        ticket you,   in fact, found them quite friendly at that
        point, would that be right or wrong? - A. Tnat is
        right, yes.They were joking with us.

    0. The atmospnere was good as far as you were concerned,
       both in relation to tne fans and everybody else at that
       point? - A. Yes, everything was fine.

    0. Unat time did you eventually head for the Leppings Lane
       entrances? - A. To actually go in, we entered the
       ground at approximately 2 o'clock.

    Q. Was that wnen you somebody being arrested? - A. That is
       right, yes.

    0. Because you actually saw somebody being arrested,
       didn't you? - A. Yes, there was a man and a lady in
       front of us, and when the Policeman challenged him to
       be searched as we walked in he seemed to drop something
       behind him, and another Police Officer saw it, came
       over and told the first Police Officer, and they then
       picked it up and took him away with the other lady.

    0. With whatever it was? - A. Yes.

    0. So those two Officers disappeared with these two
       people? - A. Yes.

    0. This was about 2 o'clock I think you said, that you
       entered? - A. Yes.

    0.   And I taKe it that, in fact, you had not particular
         difficulties getting through, apart from all tne
         searching which you were subjected to again I taKe it,
         with your bag? - A. We were not searched outsiae tne
         around because tne two Police Officers nad gone away,
         Dut I tnink inside we might nave been.  By tnis time I
         had got rid of the carrier bag so I was not as much a
         target for searching.

    0. But there was some more searching going on inside, as
       far as you remember? - A. There was more searching
       going on.  I can't actually recollect whether I was
       searched.

    0. Having got in, did you then make your way onto the
       terraces? - A. Yes.

        Q. You said you had been there the previous year? - A.
           That is rignt.

        Q. Did you go to tne terraces tne previous year as well? -
           A. Yes.
    B
        0. How did you enter the previous year - again through the
           tunnel? - A. Yes.

        0. Just to dispose of that, what time did you get there
           tne previous year? - A. The previous year, I would have
           to say approximately tne same time at the stadium, to
           enter tne stadium, but we actually arriving in
           Sneffield, we had arrived later.
    c
        0. ;Sut at the stadium about 2 o'clock? - A. Yes, about the
           sarue time.

        0. I think you entered into pen 3? - A. Yes, tnat is
           rignt.

        0. In your statement you have said 1.45.   It does not
\          really make very much difference whether it is 1.45 or
    D      2 o'clock but whicn of tne times ...? - A. Sorry, I
           would like to correct what I have said.   It was
           actually 2 o'clock by the time we had taken our
           position, 1.45 when we started to enter tne ground.

                                                W. DUCKWORTH


Q. Did you take up your final match viewing position
   straight away? - A. Yes, we walked straight to the
   terrace.

Q. So you went on to the terrace and on to the front, is
   that right? - A. Yes.   We walked through the tunnel.
   Stood at the top of the tunnel for quite a time trying to
   choose which was the best spec and then just moved into
   place straight away.

Q. I take it from that there was plenty of space for you to
   choose? - A. Yes.

Q. What impression did you have of the crowd in the terrace
   when you got there at two o'clock? - A. It still seemed
   too quiet, certainly not full.

Q. You were with your two friends? - A. That's right.

Q. I think I am right in saying that you say until 2.30
   things were quiet? - A. Yes.

0. At 2.30 what happened then? - A. Well, nothing happened,
   but it just seemed to fill up slightly.   I didn't become
   concerned because it is usual - well, it is usual for any
   match, never mind a big match, to have a bit of pushing
   and shoving.   The beach ball that has been mentioned,
   the people playing with the beach ball.   Normally I
   would join in and bat the ball about if it came your way,
   but I was a bit concerned because there were a couple of
   kids in front of me and I thought if I did lunge for the
   ball they would go flying.

Q. If what? - A. If I did lunge for the ball, if anyone was
   pushing around, they would get knocked over so I was a
   bit wary to start with.    It began to fill up even more
   and my friend lost his shoe and I think he got his arm
   caught at one point.    We just laughed it off.   It
   didn't worry us.

Q. That was normal as far as you were concerned.    What
   concerned you was if you were jumping around with the
   beach ball you might fall against these kids? -A. Yes, it
   didn't worry me for myself but for the children.

Q. Now the beach ball incident either carried on, or ceased,
   I'm not sure.   Now what happened after that?    Do you
   remember the players coming on to the pitch? - A. No, I
   don't believe I saw the players come on to the pitch, but
   I believe I remember the players coming  on tothe pitch
   from the reaction of the crowd.

Q. Between the beach ball and when you remember the players
   on the pitch, what was the situation like? - A. The

                                                W. DUCKWORTH


   terrace seemed to get gradually more and more full.     It
   would have been about five to three I became separated
   from my friends.   There was a surge in the crowd, which
   was not unusual.   Instead of fighting the surge, you go
   with the surge.   I just trotted down the steps with the
   surge and went close to the front of the terrace.    When
   we got to the bottom - normally with surges you go up and
   down the steps, so you go down.    I hoped to regain my
   position but I realised I wouldn't be able to go
   backwards for whatever reason, but I decided I would have
   to watch the match from there and find my friends later
   because I still thought it was just a surge.

Q. At that point you interpreted it as a surge which for
   some reason hadn't gone back and you just accepted it as.
   a fact? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you then at that point right against the perimeter
   fence? - A. No, I was perhaps a few steps off, certainly,
   not within reaching distance.

Q. Not within reaching distance? - A. Not at the time, no.

Q. So your first match viewing position was fairly far back?
   - A. We were half way down the terrace.

Q. Was this then the time when the players were already on
   the pitch? - A. Yes, by then certainly.

Q. So what was the position as far as you were concerned
   about that? - A. Well, I have mentioned the initial surge
   but it seemed to carry on getting gradually more and more
   tight.   I can remember thinking - I was talking to a lad
   behind me saying, "They'll have to move back because it
   is getting a bit tight."   I found I couldn't see the
   pitch just because everyone was being forced forward.
   People started to complain it was tight and a few people
   started to climb up and out over the railings.    The
   first couple I saw trying to get over the railings were
   knocked by Policemen on the railings who had climbed up.
   I think the crowd started to shout to the Policemen
   because there were two girls...   This is as it was
   getting tighter and tighter because there were two girls
   crying to the right of me.   They wantedto be lifted
   out.   I think they were actually lifted out by
   Policemen.   Once other people had started trying to get
   out they pushed them back.

  After a while I saw a gate being opened and a further
  surge of people obviously wanting to get out.    I was
  forced to the right in that surged and forced down, which
  forced me close to the perimeter fence.    I found I had
  somebody wedged to the right of me and slightly down and
  somebody wedge in front of me and I was probably now
                                              W. DUCKWORTH


within reaching distance of the perimeter fence.    People
started complaining that their breathing was tight.    The
man on the fence didn't look well.   He didn't appear to
be conscious at all.

Was this an older person? - A. Yes.   I began to become
aware of people on the other side of the fence, Police
Officers and people on the fence.   There was a
St. John's Ambulanceman the other side.   He was shouting
and talking to us.   He was obviously very upset.   He
was upset about the man in front of me.   Just generally
people were just shouting and screaming.   People were
trying to get out.

Did you see the match kick-off? - A. No.

You saw the players but after that because of the crowds
and the crush and what have you you couldn't really see
beyond it? - A. No, I didn't see a single kick.

Your recollection is that there were a couple of girls
who were crying and who were lifted up and lifted over,
is that right? - A. Yes.   I would say that was before
the kick-off of the game.

I thought you said this was at the point in time after
the players were on the pitch? - A. Yes, after they were
on the pitch.

Your recollection is they were helped out? - A. Yes.

Then a couple of other people tried to get out? - A. Yes.

And they were not. - A. They were knocked back.

They were dropped back.  It was after that, sometime
after that, that this St. John's Ambulanceman turned up
and tried to help the older gentleman? - A. Yes.

In our statement   you were pretty specific about the
number of people   whom you thought were knocked back. Can
you say how many   people you actually saw? - A. I would
say possibly two   or three actually knocked back.

Did you at any point become concerned for yourself? - A.
Well, I did at some point.   I would have said by this
point.

When was that?   Can you say which point "this point" is?
- A. After the initial surge it was becoming tighter and
tighter and I was becoming concerned to get out because
it was uncomfortable.   When the gate was opened and a
few people got out there was a surge towards that gate -
                                                        30


                                                 W. DUCKWORTH


   a small surge - I was forced down to the right and that
   is when I became more concerned about myself.

Q. Are you saying that when the gate opened there was a
   movement of the crowd towards that gate? - A. Yes.

Q. A perceptible movement? - A. Certainly to me, yes.

Q. I can't remember what you said. Did you say the gate
   stayed open or closed again? - A. I really couldn t say.
   As a few people   tried to forcethemselves forward I was
   forced to the side.

Q. Away from it in effect? - A. Yes.

Q. The gentleman you saw ahead of you, you identified later
   on?   You know who it was? -  A. Well, I said in my
   statement that I thought I knew who it was.

Q. Was it Mr. Baron? - A. Yes.

Q. Had you noticed his son there?    We have just had his son
   to give evidence. - A. I hadn't seen his son at the game,
   but I recognised his friend who was sitting with him just
   before.    I recognised him before Mr. Baron got up to
   give evidence.Whether that      is from the    day. I don't
   know if he went   therebut it could well befrom the game
   because you get to know faces.

Q. I assume that at some point,   excluding these two girls,
   the Police did start helping   people over the fence? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Did you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. Would you be able to say, and if you can't you must say
   so, what the time interval was between the two or three
   people you say were pushed back off the fencing, and the
   point in time when the Police in fact started taking them
   out? - A. I would think a very short time, a relatively
   short time.   It was quite quick.   They knocked back the
   first few but I think they realised after that they would
   have to take some people out.   Whether they had to let
   them out because there were so many trying to climb over
   and they couldn't knock them all back or whether it was
   the fact they needed to get out, I don't know.

Q. In fact the time interval between people being knocked
   back and being allowed out, for whatever reason, was a
   short one? - A. Quite short, yes.  I would say that most
   of the people I saw climbing out were actually climbing
   out and not assisted out.   Therefore it was just a
   matter of the Police allowing them out rather than...
                                                      31

                                                W. DUCKWORTH


Q. So the initial exiting, the people were able to do it
   under their own steam? - A. Yes.   What was happening was
   that people like myself - I couldn't possibly get out
   anyway, so we were just putting our heads down so that
   people could stand on our heads and shoulders and they
   could quite easily climb over the railings.

Q. Were these people coming from behind you? - A. Yes. They
   must have been from behind me because we couldn't get out
   because of the overhang of the railings.   We would have
   to go backwards to get over.

Q. You were just too far forward to make the climb? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Somebody behind you was in a better position? - A. Yes.

Q. At what point did you realise there were helpless people,
   apart from Mr. Baron, who needed to be got out as opposed
   to climbing out? - A. Very quickly after Mr. Baron,
   because I mentioned the gentleman who was wedged down
   below me.   He began to complain that he couldn't breathe
   and began to splutter.   He couldn't breathe and then I
   could hear people all round me shouting, soit was a
   pretty short time after Mr. Baron.

Q. Did you get the impression that the pressure increased
   after people were heading towards the gate? - A. Yes.   I
   would say it did because all the time the pressure seemed
   to get heavier and heavier for quite a while.   I think
   the thing was people were trying to get outand going
   forward was the most obvious way I suppose.

Q. You very sensibly didn't do much...   Well, you didn't
   shout because you were deciding to breathe and conserve
   your energy from your point of view? - A. We did shout to
   start with but it seemed a waste of time.   When I was
   free and wasn't distressed we were just shouting people
   to go back.




           Q. You have already told me

                                       W.M. DUCKWORTH



Q. You have already told me you heard people shouting.
   Could you distinguish what they were saying? - A. Well
   at first people were shouting to go back and then people
   just generally shouting. A lot shouting names and things.
   I was shouting out for friends to stop and things.

Q. I see, so you were actually calling individual names
   and things? - A. Yes, and some people were just generally
   shouting, just calling to people to be lifted out.

Q. Whatever was appropriate to that person at the time? -
   A. Yes, anything.

Q. At one point that you were going because you say somebody
   pinched your ear. Can you remember that? - A. The
   St. John Ambulance guy who was over the railings he was
   telling people if anyone near them was passing out and
   you had a free hand then you were to pinch their earlobe
   it was likely to ...

Q. Revive them? - A. Hopefully, yes.

Q. So that happened to you after the St. John Ambulanceman
   was already at the perimeter track? - A. Yes.

Q. And of course you saw quite a bit of the rest of the
   rescue as well but that occurred subsequently, didn't it,
   to these events which we have discussed? - A. Yes.

Q. That is right? - A. Sorry, I don't understand the question.

Q. I think you saw some Police Officers trying to help
   youngsters and things happening on the pitch but all
   this happened later on, didn't it? - A. Yes.

         THE CORONER: It is very interesting but I think
   it is past what we need to know.

         Let's stop and have coffee. Mr. Duckworth, we
   are going to have coffee because you need a break. Please
   remember that you are on oath and you must not discuss the
   evidence during this interregnum, so to speak, but you
   can have a cup of coffee as well and you can talk about
   anything else you like.

                      (Short adjournment)

Q. Mr. Duckworth, before you sit down and before Mr. Payne
   starts I forgot the acetate again as usual. I want you
   to make a plan. Could you please put a '1' in the position
   where you were initially and then a '2' where you were
   when the players were on the pitch. Do you remember you
   described that situation? - A. I could put a '1' where
                                                            33


                                          W.M. DUCKWORTH



     I was initially; '2' before the gate was opened and '3'
     where I was at the end if that would be clearer ?

Q.    Okay. Yes, do that then. Is that third position the one
     where you were near Mr. Baron? - A. Yes.

           MR. BEECHEY:   C375 sir.

Q.         THE CORONER:  So just to get that right, the first
     position 2.40 was where you were when the beach ball was
     being thrown around? - A. Yes.

Q.   Then there was a big surge I think you said and you finished
     up in position '2'. That was about 5-to-3 when the players
     were on the pitch and then that is where you finally finish?
     - A. Yes, after the gate was open that is where I was, the
     small surge pushed me to.

Q. And when you noticed the crowd movement? - A. Yes.

           THE CORONER:   Okay.   Mr. Payne?


                    Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Q. I wonder if Sergeant Griffiths would be kind enough to
   put up 277 and if you look in that folder in front of
   you you will find 277 please? - A. Right.

Q. Now you have given a sequence of events and I want to
   just have a look at this schedule that we have been given
   because it certainly appears to me that it confirms what
   you have said but I want you to go through it to see
   whether you can confirm that this sequence of events is
   the same as you remember. Do you understand? - A. Right,
   yes.

Q. Look down, at the top of the left hand column you have
   got "EXTERNAL" and "INTERNAL". Do you see that? - A. Yes.

Q.   Now run your eye down the "INTERNAL" column until we
     get to 1454.08.  "Liverpool team onto the pitch"? - A.      Yes.

Q. And     the next one     "1455.22. Nottingham Forest team onto
   the pitch"? - A. Yes.

Q. Now this is 5-minutes-to-3? - A. Yes.

Q. Next thing:  "1455.49", so that is a few seconds later,
   still just about 5-to-3, "Strong surge from tunnel into
   Enclosure 3"? - A. Yes.

Q. Then next one:     "1459" is Gate 4.    That is not your pen?
   - A. No.
          V ■■■                                                               34

                      Q. Then next one:   "1459", that is 1-minute-to-3, "Gate 3
                         open"? - A. Yes.

                      Q. Now the reason that is there is because we have got a
                         photograph which shows that at that time it was actually
                  B      open. Right? - A. Right.

                      Q. But we have not got any evidence exactly as to when it
s                        was opened. Do you understand that? — A. Yes.

                      Q. But on the information that we have here, just going
                         back over that list then, at 6-minutes and 5-minutes-to-3
                         the two teams are out on to the pitch and just about when
                         the second team comes out there is the strong surge? -
                         A. Yes.
                      Q. Do you confirm that that is right? - A. Yes, I would confirm
                         that the 1455.49 time is correct, approximately speaking.

                      Q. Yes approximately, nobody is holding you exactly but it
                         certainly bears out what you have said? - A. For the
                         strong surge, yes.

                      Q. And it is the strong surge that took you right down to
                         the front? - A. Yes.
                      Q. As you have marked on your plan just now? - A. Yes, the
                         strong surge would have pushed me to position '2', not
                         right to the front but yes to position '2' on the plan.

                      Q. Shall we put that up again then. Can we put up 375 again
                         please, Mr. Griffiths? So that strong surge to position '2'
                         is at about 5-to-3 just when the players have come out on
                         to the pitch? - A. It could well be when the players came
                         out on to the pitch but as I said before I did not see that
                         but it would be about 5-to-3.

                      Q. You saw them when they were on the pitch? - A. I saw them
                         on the pitch, yes.
                      Q. And it was after that that another surge took you down
                         to the fence? - A. Yes. The other surge arose from the
                         fact that I saw Gate 3 opened.

                      Q. So that then was some time between 5-to-3 and 1-minute-to-3?
                         - A. Yes. You have got down in the event timings here
                         1459 for Gate 3 being opened. That could well be true
                         but it could have been opened more than once, I don't
                         know. I only saw it opened once and I could not say
                         whether it was at that time. I would have thought it was
                         earlier.

                      Q. You think it is earlier than l-minute-to-3? - A. I would
                         have thought so, yes.

            Q. So it is just about in this time bracket between 5-to-3
               and 1-minute-to-3 that you first saw a Policeman pushing
               people back or making them go back off the fence? - A. Yes.

       jj   Q. Now you don't know what they were thinking so I am not
               asking you that, but from your point of view, thinking
               about it now as to what you remember happening, did it
               seem that they did not realise then how serious the crush
               was? - A. I take it by "they" you mean the Police Officers?

            Q. The Police I mean? - A. Well yes they certainly did not
               realise what would happen. I mean they could not realise.

            Q. But also in this time bracket here that we are looking at,
               about 5-to and about l-minute-to-3, the Police did then
               realise how serious it was? - A. No, I could not say that.
               What I would say is that the Police realised that they
               could no longer knock people back into the crowd. Now
               whether that was because there was too many people trying
               to get over the railings; whether it was because they
               realised that there would be trouble I don't know, but you
               just told me to say not what they thought, so I am saying
               what I think and I think they could have let them over
               for one of two reasons.

            Q. I see, quite. But anyway they did start letting them over
               or stand back and stop preventing them from coming over?
               - A. Yes.
            Q. And it is also at about that time that the gate was opened?
               - A. Between 5-to and 1-minute-to, yes, that is right,
               that is correct.

                     MR. PAYNE:   Thank you very much.


                            Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

            Q. In talking about the beach ball you I think made it clear
               that you would have taken a part in the batting let us
               call it or the pinging of the beach ball around the
               people, but that your concern wasn't that you could not
               have done that but in doing so there is a natural tendency
               to over balance as one stretches or leans for it? - A.
               Well it was not so much a fact about over balancing.

            Q. But you had a couple of young people in front of you and
               you were concerned that if you reached forward ....
               A. Oh yes but they would lose their balance in the toing
               and froing of the crowd.

            Q. But you would agree, and I think you said, it is something
               which is perfectly natural and often happens in that
               sort of a situation, it is that sort of a crowd, the beach
               ball? - A. Yes, balls quite often appear at the match, yes.

                                       W.M. DUCKWORTH



Q. The next   point I just want to clarify was you thought
   when you   were cascaded down, when you came down the steps
   that the   backward sway would then take place and you
   would go   back up to your position? - A. Yes.

Q. It didn't happen then but you still thought that a time
   would come when the   crowd would ease and you    would be
   able to get back to   your position? - A. Yes.

Q. And again in the normal situation that is something which
   you expect in a sort of densely packed crowd behind the
   goal? - A. I didn't   expect for there to be a    pausebetween,
   I would not expect for there to be a pause in between
   times.




                           Q. At that time
Hi
                                                                  37



                                                     W. M. DUCKWORTH


         Q. At that time, and it was five to three, it was not
            unusual to be cascaded down the steps. The unusual
            thing was that you did not immediately go back up the
            stairs again? - A. Yes.

     B   Q* Even then, although you had not gone back up the
            stairs, you thought there would be an easing and
            there would be a time when you would be able to go
            back up the stairs? - A. Well, yes.

         Q. The last point I just want to deal with, because you
            are the first person we have heard this from which is
            very helpful, is the various shouts of various
            different people that were going on in the crowd.
            For example, you tell us that you remember shouting
            to people behind you to go back, to get back? - A.
            Well, everyone from the Policemen on the other side
            of the railings to the fans standing next to me
            initially were telling people to go back.

         Q. Was that whilst you were at position three? - A. Yes.

         Q. Then you did not do any more shouting of the "go
     D      back" or "push back" kind. You did not do any
            shouting of, "Let us out" or "People are being
            crushed here" but you did call out your friends'
            names to try and ascertain whether they were
            around? - A. I called out just on two occasions.
            That was a lot later, that.  It must have been twenty
            past three.

         Q. You also heard other people calling out names as
            well, shouting to people? - A. Yes.

         Q. In a total situation we have a crowd, some, of whom
            have been shouting, "Get back" a lot around you, and
            you can only speak for those around you, a number of
            whom are shouting for help, some of whom then calling
            names of people and we have heard evidence from a
            number of witnesses from the middle to the back of
            the crowd they had no idea at all of the problems at
            the front and they were calling out, watching the
            ordinary football match? - A. Yes. All I can comment
            is on what was happening round me.  I can't comment
            on other people at the back of the terrace.

         Q. You were not aware of the people at the back of the
            terraces shouting or cheering or anything like
            that? - A. No.

         Q. I know you remarked on having been aware that the
            teams had come out from the cheers of the crowd? - A.
            Yes, that would have been while I was at position
            two.

                                              W. M. DUCKWORTH


Q. That is right and we know what time that was. That
   was 2.54 and so all this is fitting very well into
   position.  I wondered whether you were aware at all
   from the cheers of the crowd or perhaps the groans of
   the crowd, I don't know, when Beardsley hit the
   crossbar. Were you aware of that one? - A. There was
   so much noise going on around me that I wouldn't like
   to say.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:

Q. Mr. Duckworth, I get the impression that you have
   been to quite a few football matches in your time? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Perhaps you can help us those of who do not have that
   experience. Surges at football matches you say are
   quite normal? - A. Yes.

Q. When you are in a crowd on a terrace when a surge
   comes I want to investigate what it is that happens
   in a normal situation. Can you just describe what it
   is like on a terrace when a normal surge happens? -
   A. When a normal surge happens it might be due to
   something that has happened on the pitch. Usually if
   something close to the goal has happened people will
   lean forward which will put pressure on the people in
   front. There is no real package of people.   It is
   just that those people in front will slightly lose
   balance. They will not be literally pushed down but
   they might lose their balance somewhat and you just
   might trot down a few stairs with people slightly
   pushing you down. You will trot down a few stairs,
   perhaps get your balance back, the crowd then simply
   surges back again straight away.

Q. We have heard from a number of witnesses that you can
   be in a position where you are shoulder to shoulder
   and you can be chest to the man in front and that
   would be the position you would be in. You would
   regard that as a normal football crowd. Would you
   agree with that? - A. Yes.

Q. Again just trying to find out for those who are not
   necessarily aware of what goes on at football
   grounds.  So you can be in a position in the crowd
   when you, you would say, would be quite normal but
   you would nonetheless have very little room between
   you and the man in front and you would regard that as
   quite normal? - A. Yes.   I dare say if anyone had
   been at a football match in the same position, you
   get used to these things.

Q. Yes, indeed.  I am sure one tolerates things over the
   years or gets used to them and might like them. The
   impression I get is that a surge would not work, any
                                                                      39

               sort of surge, unless you were relatively closely
               packed to the people around you because you would
               need that close contact in order for the movement to
               take you forwards and backwards. Would you agree
               with me? - A. Yes, it is just the momentum of the
        ]J     people in close contact.

             Q. Can we go back to C.277, which is the chart of the
                times, this is a chart of events which we have been
                handed? - A. Yes.

             Q. Just so that you can see what I am concentrating on
                and the timings, do you see externally there is an
                event which says "14.48 Gate C" which will not mean
                anything to you at all. Do you see that? - A. Yes, I
                can see it.

             Q. I want to go behind that event because you were on
                the terraces before 14.48 and we know that. Do you
                see how at 14.38 there is a reference to a strong
                surge along the dividing fence of Enclosures 3 and 4?
                Do you see that? - A. Yes.

             Q. If we could go back to the plan of the ground, C.374,
                one can see the dividing line between Enclosures 3
                and 4. You were not, in fact, that far from it? - A.
                Yes.

             Q. Do you remember - and this may tally with your
                recollection and this is before your recollection of
                the teams coming out - there was a strong surge along
                that dividing fence? - A. It is certainly not
                something I remember and I suppose the reason for
                that is that it was probably just an ordinary surge
                and we went back up again because I was still with my
                friends. From that I can only assume that it was an
                ordinary surge and something you would expect.

             Q. It may be an ordinary surge and something you expect
                but it must follow from that that you were still, to
                have a surge of that sort, relatively packed in on
                the terrace at that stage? - A. Yes, yes.

             Q. It is difficult I know but at that stage would you
                have said to yourself that that terrace where you
                were could take another couple of thousand people? -
                A. No, I would have said it was full.

             Q. You would have said it was full at that stage? - A.
                Full for a big game.

             Q. So your impression was that the terrace where you
                were, your pen, was full and this is before you have
                told us about your recollection of when the team came
                out? - A. Yes.




        H
                                         W. M. DUCKWORTH


Of course, if we go back again to C.277, if I may, we
see at 14.40 there is a reference to a further surge
in Enclosures 3 and 4. Again it may well have been
what you regard as a normal surge but had surges been
going on which you had experienced prior to the surge
which took you down to near the front? - A. Oh yes,
yes.

I have got the picture right, have I, that for those
surges to go on you have really got to be in a
position where the crowd is full around you? - A.
Yes.

Then, of course, you tell us that you do not remember
- and I do not blame you for this - the team coming
out but you remember the cheers of the crowd? - A.
Yes.

I just want to investigate that slightly if I may.
You would be looking on to the pitch presumably? - A.
Well, yes, facing the pitch.

Can you think of a reason why you might not have been
able to see the team coming out? - A. The only thing
I can think of is at that time actually moving down
the terrace.

What, in a surge or something? - A. Yes, that is the
only thing I can think of unless I was just obscured
by the pitch but I didn't see them actually come on
to the pitch.

Might it be at the time of the great roar that was
the time when you were actually being carried down
the terrace? - A. That is what I thought because I
can remember, before the teams come out or certainly
a few minutes before the game, the Liverpool crowd
normally sing, "You'll never walk alone" but that
stopped as soon as the teams came out and that is
what made me think the teams had come out. Although
I didn't see it I knew they had come out.

     THE CORONER:   I did not hear.   You said before
they came out you said the Liverpool? - A. They all
sing the same song. Although we do not know when
they are coming out obviously, I mean you can sing it
and finish it and the teams do not come out, but they
stopped singing it and so the team must have come
out, you see.

It looks as if, from your recollection, that you are
being carried down in this big surge to a point where
you cannot get back round about the very time that
the team are coming out. That is what it looks like?
- A. Yes, I would think so.
                                                             41



                                                 W. M. DUCKWORTH


     Q. That, on any view, was an unusual surge, was it
        not? - A. Yes.

     Q. The distance you were carried by the surge, and we
        can see that if we go back to C.375 - and so that
jj      everyone knows I am not complaining but I do not have
        a copy of that actual plan in my folder - from
        position one to position two. You could not move
        back, you have told us? - A. No, I could not move
        back, no.

     Q. So at that position you must have been very tight.
        It must follow from that? - A. Oh yes, yes.

     Q. You say that very matter of factly, and I do not
        blame you for that, but none of us were there. Could
        you describe how tight you were in terms of your
        shoulders, in terms of your legs, in terns of your
        arms? - A. Yes, at that point I could still move at
        this point. The pressure wasn't that great on me.    I
        mean I was definitely touching all the people around
        me.  I couldn't have stood there on the spot and not
        touch anyone because it is unavoidable.

     Q. You heard people complaining that they had difficulty
        in breathing when you were in that position? - A.
        Yes, as I said, whilst I was in that position
        initially after the surge I was quite free to move
        but gradually the pressure got greater and greater
        and then people began to complain.

     Q. My learned friend, Mr. Payne, tells us he can
        identify when Gate 3 was opened so that we can work
        backwards as to the time gap here but the people who
        were complaining that they were having difficulty
        breathing, could you see them around you? - A. Yes.
        In fact, the man I was directly against here
        complained to me. Yes, I could see them.

     Q. Was he in obvious distress? - A. Yes.

     Q. Were the people around you in obvious distress? - A.
        Yes.

     Q. Was it at that stage when the people around you were
        in obvious distress that you saw these two or three
        people trying to get over the fencing and being
        knocked back? - A. Yes.

     Q. You yourself had no difficulty in understanding why
        those two or three people were trying to get out, did
        you? - A. Oh no, no.  I wanted to get out myself.

     Q. It was put to you that the Police did not realise
        what the position was. You realised what the
        position was, did you not? - A. Yes.

                                                              42


                                                W. M. DUCKWORTH



    Q. You cannot speak for the Police Officer because you
       were not the Police Officer, were you? - A. No.

    Q. All you can say is that you saw the Police Officer
B      push those individuals back into the crowd? - A. Yes.

    Q. On what do you base the view that those Officers did
       not realise what was happening? - A. Perhaps they are
       just used to people trying to get over on to the
       pitch, I don't know, but then again perhaps not
       experienced at football matches.  I obviously can't
       comment on them.

    Q. You were asked your opinion on what the Officers
       thought? - A. Yes.

    Q. I am not being unfair to you but you could not
       actually know what the Officers were thinking, could
       you? - A. No.

    Q. What you can tell us is the facts of what was
       happening around you. That is what I want to
       investigate, the visible facts and the visible facts
       were that the people around you were in obvious
       distress to your eyes? - A. Definitely.




                         /Q. To your ears, people were.




H
And   to   your    ears   p eop le   were   com p lain in g?   -   A.   Oh y e s .

Can I ask you also this, you saw the gate being opened
and people trying to get out, and you were forced
downwards further because of the pressure behind you,
clearly of people trying to get out? - A. Yes.

And the pressure was clearly corning from behind, wasn't
it? - A. Yes.

That pressure was making it more and more difficult for
people to get out of the gate, wasn't it? - A. Yes.  It
was creating a bottleneck at the gate.

Yes, an absolute bottleneck.  Wnat was obvious
therefore was that it wasn't at the front anything
could be done to relieve the pressure, the pressure had
to be relieved from the back.  You could tell that,
couldn't you? - A. Yes, definitely, because we had the
question before - I was told, I didn't realise this -
but that people apparently from the middle to the back
of tne terracing didn't realise what was going on at
the front, but I know that is not the case because I
Know people who did know what was going on at the
front, and I know people who actually did go out tae
back quite safely, and that is what should have
happened, yes.

what needed to be happening was for somehow to get the
people at the back out of the tunnel from the back? -
A. Yes.

Just concentrating on the front, and that narrow little
gate, was not going to solve the situation, was it?  It
was obvious and that was obvious to you as a fan in the
terraces? - A. Oh yes.

 ir. Duckworth, when iir. King asked you about tne
earlier surges in the pen, do you think they could nave
been Decause tae beach ball was being passed about at
tnat time, that people were just moving forward in tnat
way? - A. Yes, it is notning*that you would not expect
at any match.   It could have been a beach ball - I
don't know - it could have been someone walking along
the front of the pen.    It is just what you expect at a
match.   It is just a normal event at a match.

would you say that at that time there was room to move
about, to knock the beach ball? - A. Yes.

Did you see any Police Officer come into the pen to
confiscate the beach ball? - A. No.

    Q. Do you know what happened to it? - A. No.  I did not
       see it disappear.  It would have got knocked along the
       terrace, I don't know.  I really don't know.

    0. I asked you that because I thought it would ensure, you
B      know if the Police would have coine into tne pen, tnat
       it would have ensured that there was no danger,
       possible danger or trouble in the pen.   If they saw a
       beach ball being passed I thought they   would react. So
       you did not see anybody? - A. I didn't   see anybody. I
       don't think I have ever seen a ball being confiscated
       anyway.  I have seen Policemen pat them back into the
       crowd.  I think it was just what the crowd is.   It is
       as part of the match as singing sometimes.

    Q. But you were saying earlier when you were carrying - it
       was you who was carrying a carrier bag in, wasn't it? -
       A. Yes.

    0. And you were stopped because it looked a suspicious
       package.  I was just wondering how the beach ball,
       which would be quite large, would be taken into tne pen
       to start with, because it could be dangerous, couldn't
D      it? - A. Thinking back it is quite strange because if
       you read my statement, I tnink I was searched as soon
       as we got off tne train at the station.  We asked them
       wnat they were searching us for and they said
       straightaway inflatables, because inflatables were
       quite popular at the time, and we thought, well what's
       the harm in them? Man. City take a few bananas in, so
       it seemed ridiculous to search for those because they
       don't do any harm really.  The beach ball did not seem
       to cause anyone any obvious harm.  I nave never seen it
       cause mucn distress at the game.

    0. But it was an inflatanle? - A. Yes, it was inflatable,
       which was wnat the Police were looking for.

       So it was not confiscated before you got into your
       position or wnen you were in tne pen?

               COROiiER:
            i i : i:      I don't think we can speculate.    He
      nas told you ne saw it; he nas told you tie played  with
      it; ne tolc you, he does not know where it went; and he
      told he did not think, in his experience, it does any
      harm, but he can't possibly tell you who brought it in,
      why they brought it in, wnether it was smuggled,
      whether it was handed in by a Police Officer.   vmo
      knows - and it doesn't matter.

           MRS. u c M I E N : Thank you. I just thought there
      would have been some reaction when it was being passed

    0. You were asked some questions about Police Officers by
       my learned friend Mr. Payne, sitting at the end.   You
       said in answer to a question to tnat gentleman that the
       Police Officers certainly did not realise what nad
       happened.  Later on you were questioned about that
       reply by the gentleman in the middle here, Mr. King -
       do you remember? — A. Yes.

    0. Wnat all that is about really is the Officers'
       reactions.  I appreciate that you do not know what was
       in the Officers heads, that is quite obvious, but
       would you agree with this, that what you said to my
       learned friend Mr. Payne appeared to be the case^to you
       from what you could actually see of the Officers'
       reactions, namely they did not appear to realise? - A.
       In the context of Mr. Payne's question, I think he was
D      asking it in reference to the Police Officers who nad
       knocked people back into the crowd, which was fairly
       early on, am I not right in that?

    Q. Yes. - A. And in that instance, yes,^the Police
       Officers did not realise what was going on or they
       would not have knocked them back, obviously, but then
       it is a matter of seconds.

    0. Yes, that is the point. - A. But, yes, of course tney
       did not realise what was going on or they would not
       nave knocked them back in surely.   I would say that I
       was slightly dumbfounded by the fact that tney could
       not see wnat was going on, when the St. John's
       Ambulance guy in front of me was screaming, "Tnere's a
       guv nere turning blue*', so it did seam rather strange.

    0. Forgive me, but wasn't that a little later on when the
       nan from the St. Jonn's Ambulance came to the front of
       tne fence, and by that time you had moved to your
       position 3 from position 21 - A. It was actually tne
       man from St. John's Ambulance who called over some of
       tne Police to act on the terraces, so obviously some of
       tne Policemen still had not realised at that time there
       was something going on, although the St. John's
       Ambulance man obviously had.

    0. So others were being told, it appears to you? - A. Yes.
       Even tnough they were standing a matter of feet away
       tney needed someone to tell them what was going on.

0. By that time you had moved to position 3? - A. Yes.

Q. You were asked some questions about the bottleneck that
   was created at gate 3 and it is right to say, of
   course, that peoole fell at tnat gate? - A. Tnat people
   fell?

0. That people fell down? - A. I really couldn't say.

0. You couldn't say.  You weren't able to see that? - A.
   Ho, because I couldn't see below head height,
   obviously, so if someone fell it would be below me.

Q. It was obvious to you that really the evacuation should
   have taken place from the back? - A. Yes, that is what
   I was saying, if everyone pushed back - I mean, it
   seemed the most obvious thing to do.

0. At the time, I appreciate this is a difficult question
   because you have to think back to that dreadful time,
   but at trie time would you have felt better, do you
   think, had the gate remained closed? - A. At that time
   I personally would have felt better and would not nave
   encountered such difficulties had the gate remained
   closed.   I don't know if it is the same for other
   people.   I am sure the fact that the gate was opened
   save some people's lives, and saved some people's lives
   wno perhaps did not get out of the gate, by releasing
   other tensions in the crowd.   It just so happens that I
   was caught in the tension that was created by the gate
   being opened.

0. Mr. Duckworth, after you had marked your three
   positions on the plan, you agreed with a three point
   summary from t.ne Coroner as to time.  Position 1 was
   where you were while the beach ball was being played
   with, and you were watching that, and it   wasat about
   2.55 wnen the players were on the pitch tnatyou were
   propelled or moved to position 2.   I have got tnat
   piece of evidence rignt, have I? - A. Yes,
   approximately.

0. Yes, approximately.    That is the event tnat sticks in
   your mind that times   that particular move from position
   one to position 2? -   A. I recall while I   wasin
   position 2 the teams   taking the pitch.

Q. w'e can see from tne chronology - 277, if you have still
   got it open in front of you? - A. Right.

0. Tnat the second internal time, 14.40.09, shows tne
   beacn ball in enclosure 3.  Now tnat time, of course,

           is only one-hundredth of a second.  According to your
           recollection, do you remember whether the beach ball
           was played with for a matter of seconds, a matter of
           minutes, or what? - A. A matter of minutes.

    B   Q. Tnere is video evidence that tne beach ball was still
           being played with at about quarter-to-3.  Would that
           make sense and fit in witn your recollection? - A. Yes.
           As I say, the beach ball was played with for several
           minutes, by my recollection.

        0. But tne point I am seeking to establish is does it
           surprise you, tnat five minutes after the time given on
           this chronology were those minutes during which the
           oeacn ball was being played? - A. Sorry, could you
           repeat the question, please?

        0. Does it surprise you that there is video evidence of
           tne beacn ball being played some five minutes after the
           ti.:ie given in this chronology, namely five minutes
           between 20-to and quarter-to-3? - A. No, it does not
           surprise me at all.    I saw it played with for several
           Minutes.

        0. And as far as you were concerned on the inside, that
           was an entirely normal thing to happen at that time?
           It was a fashion? - A. Yes.

        0. I think you have canvassed your experience at big
           matcnes with my learned friend Mr. King, and you have
           experience of being on terraces at big matcnes, is tnat
           correct? - A. Yes.

        u. Is i t fair to expect, was it fair to expect at tne
           t i m e , on terraces at big matches tnat there will be
           surg es in the last 20 minutes, 25 minutes before kick-
           of f , while fans are still arriving on those terraces? ■
           A . i as surges tnat I experienced until five minutes
           ne f o re tae game, ten minutes before the game, were no
             iff erent to any otner surges tnat I would expect at
           aav big game.      As I have already said, the one surge
           tnat     left me down into position 2 was not a surge tnat
           i . v U uId nave expected at any big game.

        0. ^es, the surges that my learned friend Mr. King was
           discussing, going back to 277, were first of all those
           occurring at 14.33 and 14.40, and those you are
           describing and identifying as being normal in the
           build-up to a big match? - A. Yes.   I really wouldn t
           remember tnem so I presume they must nave been normal
           because I would have remembered tnem otherwise.

         O. It is your recollection tnat some people in pen 3 were
            in more difficulty than others, is that correct? - A.
            Yes.

         0. And some were more able to help themselves and some
     B      were less able to help themselves? - A. Yes.

         Q. Some you have described were able to make their way
            forward on the heads and shoulders of people in the
            pen? - A. Yes.

         Q. And others could not move? - A. Yes.

         0. Others at the front of the pen had to negotiate the
            steps up to the gate, in order to get out? - A. The
            steps down to the gate you mean?

         0 . Well, there were steps up to the gate - perhaps you
             don't know that? - A. I didn't get that far down, but
             if you are telling me that I will have to take your
             word for it.  I really would not know anything about
             that.  As far as I was concerned the only way out was
             over the fence, because I was nowhere near any gate,
             and as you say some people could get out over the fence
             by climbing on people, but other people like myself
             could not get out because they were trapped.

You were trapped at the front.   People towards the back,
or behind you on the terrace were, as far as you could
discern, able bodied people able to move over the tops of
people at the front? - A. I think that some people had
actually been passed out by people at the back, but I
wouldn't like to say the physical condition of the people
going over the fence. As I say, at the time most people
were climbing over the fence I had my head down so that
people could stand on my head and my shoulders.   I
couldn't comment on the physical condition of the people
going over the fence because I didn't see most of them.

Can I clarify one thing.   You felt the most obvious
thing to do was to get people to move back? - A. Yes.

That is what you were calling for people to do and as I
understand it what you recall Police Officers were
calling for people to do? - A. Yes.   Whilst I was in
position 2 that seemed the most obvious.

               Further by THE CORONER:

I have two questions from the jury. The first one is
about the ambulanceman.    He is coming so we won't ask
that one.   The second one from the jury is when you were
describing people calling and so on, did you hear any
verbal response from the Police Officers? - A. The only
words I ever heard from the Police were, ''Move back.
Just move back."    That was the only response.   That was
all they ever said.

The other thing is you made almost a throw-away remark
and I was interested in it, to Mr. King.   You were
talking about the people at the back, when you were being
asked about exiting from the back and you said you knew
that the people at the back knew what was happening at
the front. - A. Yes.

And that they had no difficulty getting out.   I take it
you are saying you have spoken to people who were at the
back? - A. My two friends I went to the match with, I
became separated from.   They managed to get out through
the tunnel.

If you yourself had not been wedged or fixed or whatever
word you care to use, and if you had been further back
say in position 2 and you had seen what was going on in
front, would you have moved forward or would you have
moved back?   I know it is a hypothetical question. - A.
It's not really, because whilst in position 2 if I wanted
to move back, and that is what we were calling for so
obviously I would have moved back if I could in position
2.   In position 3, right on the fence, the most obvious
thing to do is to go forward and go over.

                                                  W. DUCKWORTH


Q. Your friends who did move out of the tunnel, did they do
   it on their own volition or did they do it because they
   were told? - A. On their own volition.   They remained in
   approximately position 1, I believe, and they just
   decided to go for themselves.   They weren't told at all.

Q. They didn't have to wait to be told to go back once they
   realised that something was happening in the front? - A.
   No.   Once they realised...   Nobody told them to go
   back, they just...   From what I can gather anyway.
   They just wanted to get out.

Q. You can't, of course, say what other people either
   thought or did? - A. No.

            Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. Mr. Duckworth, we have heard from a number of witnesses
   that one of the explanations for the Police perhaps not
   realising what was happening in front of them, not
   realising what the shouts were of help, was because of
   the noise?   Do you understand that?   Would you accept
   it was noisy or not? - A. It was noisy, but I wouldn't
   have thought that that would have stopped them from
   hearing the one voice.   If I was three feet away from
   somebody...   I mean, I had a conversation from somebody
   behind me. We were chatting.    I was telling him that we
   could move back.   The noise wasn't totally oppressive.

Q. If you are close enough to somebody therefore you can
   hear what they are saying? - A. Yes.

Q. If you are a distance away and it is noisy the more
   difficult it is, obviously? - A. Yes.

Q. When you were pressed again as to why you believed the
   Police did not realise what was happening, you offered
   the explanation - I am not critical of it at all - that
   you assumed that because they didn't react and you
   couldn't believe that if they had seen they would have
   reacted in the way they did?   That is basically what you
   were saying? - A. Yes.

Q. You were linking the fact there was no reaction to
   something with the conclusion that that person who didn't
   react hadn't realised what was happening?   All right? -
   A. Yes.

Q. You indicated earlier as regards the people at the back
   that they may not have realised what was happening at the
   front?   All right? - A. Yes, they may not have done. I
   can't say.

                                                 W. DUCKWORTH


Q. Because they clearly did not react, did they? - A. The
   crowd at the back, no.

Q. Just as it is said that because the Police didn't react
   at the front, albeit they were only a few feet away they
   didn't realise what was happening at the front, you can
   understand how it can be said that the people at the back
   didn't react, who were more than a few feet away from
   what was happening at the front, they didn't realise.
   Do you understand that? - A. Yes.

Q. When I was asking you questions about what was obvious, I
   was asking you questions about not the method of
   achieving the result but what needed to be done.   What
   needed to be done was to release the pressure from the
   back?   That is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. Clearly the people at the front shouting to the back,
   "Move back," was not having the reaction which you wanted
   it to have?   That is right? - A. Yes.

Q. The people at the back were not reacting? - A. Yes.

Q. You are dealing with a crowd which is screaming for help?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Shouts?   Great noise? - A. Yes.

Q. You of course say if you are close enough like a Police
   Officer just two or three feet away, that is no excuse,
   that is what you would say? - A. Yes.

Q. But we are dealing with people at the very back.    Now
   would you agree with me that the people at the back who
   weren't reacting to the shouts of "Push back" could
   easily be in the position that they just didn't realise
   what was happening? - A. Yes.

Q. You agree with that? - A. Yes.

                   Further by THE CORONER:

Q« I think I have to clarify this.    You have just agreed
   with Mr. King about what was happening at the back.
   However, you told me, and I want to be quite clear about
   this, that you from your personal knowledge knew that at
   least a proportion of the people knew what was happening?
   - A. Yes.   My friends were worried for their own safety
   and that is why they left through the tunnel.    Now
   whether everyone else was worried for their own safety...
   They didn't realise the situation.    They were probably
   hoping by going out they could relieve the pressure.     My
   friends were in trouble before the kick-off so they were
   worried anyway way before I was worried and I was way

  down the terrace, so it is a matter of what worries you
  at a football match, I suppose.

            Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. I didn't hear the answer.    Did you say that from you
   have heard from your friends they were worried before
   kick-off? - A. Yes.   Well, there were a number of
   incidents.   It must have been about twenty-five to
   three, just stupid incidents like my friend losing his
   shoe and he accidentally got his arm caught between some
   people and couldn't free it.    Those are things you might
   half expect.

Q. That caused him worry? - A. Yes, it did.   If somebody
   has never been to a match before and that happens to
   them, just in their instance it happened to worry them
   because perhaps it had never happened before.

Q. So there was something in the crowd which was worrying
   them as early as twenty-five to three? - A. Yes.

           Further Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

Q. Are you saying that your friends, who were at position 1,
   left the crowd because they were worried? - A. I can't
   comment on what they were feeling, but I would think from
   what they have said, they left through exit 1 because
   they were worried for their own safety, also because we
   had become separated and we had arranged to meet outside
   the ground should we become separated.

Q. It was just that I was beginning to get an impression
   that they left the crowd because they were worried about
   what else was happening? - A. No.

Q. You are saying they left because they were worried about
   themselves? - A. Yes.   They had no idea what was going
   on down the terrace until much later on.

Q. I think that was the point we were all wanting to know.

Q. You are a steel processor? - A. Yes.

Q. You are also a St. John's Ambulance trained first aider?
   - A. I was.    I am not a member of St. John's now, but I
   was at the time but only as a first aider.    I joined the
   St. John's later.

Q.   Would you say that again? - A. I was a first aider at
     work under the Health and Safety Act.I used to attend
     St. John's...

Q. To be trained? - A. Yes, to receive further training for
   my own benefit really.   As a result of that, knowing I
   was a football fan and Liverpool was my second team after
   Sheffield United, I was given the opportunity to attend
   as a first aider and to benefit by seeing Liverpool as
   well.

Q. You were killing two birds with one stone, performing a
   useful function and you were also getting the benefit of
   seeing a match? - A. Yes.

Q.   In fact that is exactly what you did do.   You attended
     as a first aider and as part and parcel of the St. John's
     organisation at that time? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you wear an arm band? - A. Yes.

Q.   That is because you didn't have a proper St. John's
     uniform? - A. That's right.

Q. I think you arrived at the ground at about quarter to
   two, or thereabouts? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it you who parked the ambulance? - A. I didn't, but
   the ambulance was parked at that time at the back of the
   South Stand, on the river side.

Q.    Having got our arm band and said hello to all and sundry,
     so to speak, you presumably went on to the pitch and took
     up your position? - A. The normal procedure is to sign in
     in the register, which is situated at the gymnasium in
     the first aid room there, whereupon you are delegated to
     areas with other people.

Q. Am I right in saying your position was on the pitch
   between the Spion Kop and the South Stand? - A. Yes.

Q. On the corner there? - A. On the corner.

Q. You were with Pete and Kathy Wells? - A. Yes.

Q. And two or three other girls? - A. Yes.

    Q. That was a St. John's Ambulance communication radio? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. It wasn't a Police radio as far as you knew? - A. No.
B
    Q. You took up your position at about quarter past two? - A,
       Yes, something like that.

    Q. At that time I think you noticed that the Spion Kop and
       the South Stand were pretty full? - A. Yes.

    Q. You then looked round, as one does, I suppose, and you
       noticed by comparison, what, with regard to the North
       West and Leppings Lane terraced? - A. I noticed...?

    Q. By comparison to the Spion Kop and the South Stand, what
       did you notice? - A. That there were relatively few
       people in those two areas designated for Liverpool fans.

Q. I think I am right in saying that at the time the terracing
   did not particularly attract your attention, there was
   nothing that you noticed? - A. No.

q   .   presumably your job at that point was merely to be there?
        - a . Yes.
Q. Stand around; be ready for action if needed? - A. Yes.

Q. The normal sort of thing I suppose that happens is minor
   injuries, people feeling faint, there might be somebody
   with a heart attack? - A. Cuts and bruises.

Q. And you respond if you see it or if you are called. Is
   that right? - A. Yes. I am answering these questions
   with hindsight because this is what has happened since
   becoming a member and that is exactly what does happen.
   You know, you sit there ....
Q. Well what were you expecting to do on the day? - A. Basically
   nothing. I had been to semi-finals as a spectator myself
   and you don't, I don't know you tend not to notice unless
   there are stretcher cases, tend not to notice the sort of
   minor injuries.
Q. But what I am trying to say is what were you anticipating
   your activity to be on that day, never mind about what
   you have learnt since? - A. Paints probably.  It was a
   lovely day. It was a gorgeous day.

Q. As it happens you were initially not called upon to do
        anything on that day.   Is that right? — A. That is correct.

Q. Now I am taking you forward now to about quarter-to-3.
   Okay. Did you then happen to look across to the Leppings
   Lane terrace? - A. Yes.
Q. And what did you see then? - A. It was gradually filling
   but by no means full.
Q. Did you notice any disparity? - A. Yes, the sort of centre
   areas, you know the tunnel comes down, were full but the
   outer wings there was quite a lot of room there.

    Q. Were you able to see —• I don't mean in detail — but were
       you able to observe any movements or anything within that
       terracing at that time? - A. Not particularly, no. I
       was not concentrating on any particular ....

    Q. But nothing alerted you to say: "My goodness I have to
       go there" or "I have to tell Mr. Wells" or something?
       - A. No.

Q. At some point you did notice, I think, supporters climbing
   fences between various pens. Now the first question is
   which pens were they crossing to and from when you first
   noticed them? - A. The first notice would be Pen 4 into 5.
   I think that is right. From the centre of the tunnel into
   the, as though they were heading north.

Q. In that case let's put the little plan up, the usual
   acetate. - A. In the West Stand, the goalmouth, so come
   further down, yes climbing from this side over to the other
   side.

Q. Do you mean they were climbing in the central pen area?
   - A. Yes, in the central pen and climbing over that part.

Q. Because that is in fact what you said in your statement,
   you said between Pens 4 and 3. Now do you mean that? -
   A. Well that is what I mean.

Q. Are you satisfied that you can recognise that correctly
   from that plan? - A. Yes.

Q. And did you notice any movement within the crowd in these
   pens? - A. Merely it was a strange phenomenon to experience
   at that time. Nothing was happening other than that.

Q. What time was that time? - A. I would have thought probably
   around, that is minutes, but round about 10-to, 5-to-3,
   something like that.

Q. Can you remember whether that was happening when the
   players were already on the pitch or had the players
   not yet got on or can you not relate it? - A. The players
   were definitely not on the pitch.

Q. Defintely not on the pitch? - A. No, I would say definitely
   not.

Q. Did you see at that time anybody climbing into the Stands?
   - A. Into the Stands above being dragged up.

Q. You did see that? - A. Yes.

Q. Was this also before the players were on the pitch? - A.
   I would think so, yes.

Q. Well you were pretty sure about ....   A. I am pretty sure
   it would be at the same time anyway.

Q. Did you see anybody coming over the front fence at that
   point? - A. Not particularly, no.

     Q. Did you see any surging within the pens? Do you know what
        I mean by surging? - A. The first surge that I noticed
        was about 5-to-3 a big surge, a lot of people surging.
        Normally as a football supporter the surging that I have
11      experienced is when an attack is taking place and you are
        obstructed through a pole or something like that and you
        reach round to try to get a better view, something of that
        nature, but this was a big surge and really nothing was
        happening on the pitch anyway to suggest it was anything
        other than someone falling down, but it would have meant
        a lot of people falling at the same time. It would not
        have been one person tripping and putting his arm on the
        fellow in front and creating a mini sort of surge.

     Q. Which of the pens did you see that surge in? - A. That
        was to the left-hand side of the goal so that would be,
        I am not familiar with the pen numbers.

     Q. Can you put that plan up again? Left-hand side? - A.
        That would be almost to the left-hand side of the goal­
        post.

     Q. The one which Sergeant Griffiths is pointing to at the
        moment? - A. Yes.

     Q. That is what we call Pen 3. Left-hand side looking at it
        from your end, isn't it? - A. Yes.

     Q. We are used to looking at it the other way round. We
        call that the right-hand side, but never mind I understand
        you? - A. Well you see I was sat down there.

     Q. Yes, that is right, it is left as far as you are concerned?
        - A. Yes.

     Q. Did you see where that surge originated from or did you
        not see? - A. No.

     Q. You say it was a big surge, in other words you saw a big
        crowd movement at that point? - A. Yes.

     Q. Was there anything else apart from that noticeable about
        it as far as you could see? - A. No, they seemed to go
        back. We commented, we carry stretchers obviously and the
        girls were sat down, I was stood up. The girls commented
        at that point, or we commented as a group, that it was
        unusual and the crowd sort of seemed to go back.

     Q. You said that was at 5-to-3? - A. About that, yes.

     Q. What   makes you say that? - A. Because round about this
        time   Peter Wells came to our corner and said there would
        be a   delay in the kick-off and consequently you look at
        your   watch.

Q. I see, so you actually looked at your watch? - A. I am
   almost certain it was about 5-to-3.

Q. And then I think, you say Peter Wells came and said there
   was going to be a delay in kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q. You just accepted that as a fact? - A. Yes.

^Q. What happened shortly after that? - A. Shortly after that
    Peter Wells came back. He walked away to that end, to
    the Leppings Lane end.

Q. Did players come on to the pitch after that or before that
   or what? - A. Almost simultaneously that Peter Wells had
   said there would be a delay in the kick-off the players
   came on to the pitch.
 Q. I see, you actually saw them come on to the pitch? — A. Yes.

 Q. Would I then be right in saying that this surge which you
    have described definitely occurred before the players
    came on to the pitch? - A. Yes, I would say so, yes.

 Q. Perhaps not by much? - A. Only seconds probably, yes.

 Q. I think your friend, I don't know whether he is your friend
    or boss but anyway in St. John's .... A. He is theleading
    Officer.
 Q. I think he made a comment that he must have made a mistake?
    - A. Yes, or been misinformed.

 Q       Now the players came on to the pitch.   You say Peter Wells
         left you ? - A. Yes.

 Q. What did you do then? Did you watch the Leppings Lane or
    did you watch the players? - A. Watched the play.

 Q. The play or the players? - A. The players.

 Q. And did you see the match kick off? - A. Yes.

 Q. Did anything else out of the ordinary happen after kick-off
    or what as far as you are concerned? - A. Almost immediately
    Liverpool attacked Nottingham Forest's goal which they were
    defending at Spion Kop and a corner took place, someone
    hit the cross bar, I think it was Beardsley, I am not sure,
    someone hit the cross bar and there was another massive
    surge, I wanted Liverpool to win anyway, and a deafening
    roar.
 q   .   From the far side? - A. From the far side, and at that point
         there was well what seemed like mayhem and also at that
         point one of the Liverpool players was beckoning to the
                                                           59

      referee.  I only assumed that would be because of the
      incident at the Leppings Lane end. Simultaneously
      Peter Wells came to me and said:  "Will you come with
      me and fetch the oxygen bottle, there are people dead
      and dying up there".
B
    Q. I see, so until that point your attention had been dis­
       tracted from the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes.

    Q. So your next real recollection of it is Beardsley hit
       the cross bar, you heard the roar, you looked, Peter Wells
       came said:  "There is terrible trouble, people dying, get
       the oxygen bottle" and that is when you then looked back
       to Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.
C
    Q. Now does that mean then, and I don't want to put any words
       in your mouth, that between the players coming out and
       Peter Wells coming back, you are not able to say anything
       about what you saw at the Leppings Lane end? - A. That
       is correct.

    Q. That is correct, is it? - A. Yes.
D            THE CORONER: Okay we will stop for lunch at that
       point and then we will take you from there what you did
       with the oxygen bottles.

             Please remember you are on oath so you must not
       discuss the evidence you are giving in this period and
       then be back for 2, if you would.

    Q.    Mr. Gillatt, I just want to clarify little bits about
         your observations before we move on to the   oxygen
         bottle. You mentioned somebody hitting the crossbar,
         do you remember that? - A. Yes.

B   Q.   You    saw that? - A. Yes.

    Q.   You    also mentioned that you   heard a   tremendous roar
         at that point? - A. Yes.

    Q. You can recollect telling me that? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you at that point look across towards Leppings
       Lane and observe anything on the terraces? - A. At
       that point there were people this side of the fence
       that would not normally have expected to be there.

    Q. Did you see any activity within the terrace itself? -
       A. Not noticeably, no, other than the people trying
       to climb over the fences that w a s ...

    Q. Let me just remind you what you said in your
       statement because it may refresh your memory? - A.
D      Yes.

    Q. What you said was, and I think I will read it to you
       because it is not very controversial, in fact it is
       not:

               "I heard a tremendous roar from the
               Liverpool supporters at the Leppings Lane
               end.  I looked in that direction and
               saw..."

         Perhaps I ought to start earlier:

               "I then continued watching the game.
               Liverpool players were on the attack
               towards the Spion Kop end. One of the
               Liverpool players hit the crossbar with a
               shot and I heard a tremendous roar from
               the Liverpool supporters at the Leppings
               Lane end.  I looked in that direction and
               saw a surge of such a degree that was far
               fiercer than anything I had ever
               witnessed before and I attend football
               matches as a supporter on a regular
               basis. Again the supporters appeared to
               return to their original position as like
               a wave."

         Do you remember that now having had that read to you?
         - A. Yes.

    Q. You have mentioned one surge earlier? - A. Earlier,
       yes.

Q. Do you remember actually seeing a second surge? - A.
   Yes.

Q. In which pen was that second surge in now that I have
   reminded you of it? - A. In the same area.

Q. Did you see... - A. Can I just say that from a
   spectator point of view the pens aren't noticeably
   that obvious other than the main one coming from down
   the centre of the tunnel. The others are sort of
   segregated in tiny barriers and that type of thing
   but the main pen, sort of coming straight down the
   tunnel to the left hand side in that area

Q. That is where you saw it? - A. Yes.

Q. When you looked across and saw that was that the
   point in time when you could see people in front of
   the fencing as well? - A. Yes.

Q. You could also see at that point people climbing
   over? - A. Climbing over the fences.

Q. Could you at that point see people going up into the
   stands? - A. Into the stands as well, yes.

Q. Was it Kathy Wells, Mr. Wells' wife I presume,
   suggested you go over and have a look at what was
   going on? - A. Yes.

Q. Mr. Wells was not with you at that time? - A. He was
   not with us, no.

Q. Had   you noticed him leaving you? - A. No.

Q. Was  the match still in play when Kathy said this to
   you? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened then?   Did you see the match stop? - A.
   No,   I didn't see itstop. We proceeded to go to the
   Leppings Lane end and as we started to go to the
   Leppings Lane end Peter Wells was coming back and
   probably at round about the players' tunnel. He then
   said to me, "Come with me and we will go to the
   ambulance and get the oxygen bottle".

Q. That is when he told you that people were dying? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Until that point you had not noticed anything to that
   effect? - A. Not untoward obviously.

Q. Did you then with him go to the ambulance? - A. Yes.

Q. That was behind the South Stand? - A. Yes.
                                                                62

    Q. So you were actually in the right side of the ground
       for it? - A. Correct.

    Q. How do you get to it? Is there a tunnel or
B      something? - A. Probably - I think they have altered
       the ground since but there were about six or seven
       steps up into a sort of area separate from the South
       Stand and Kop so that you get a sort of triangular
       area that leads through gates on to the riverside.

    Q.    I just want to check, before you set off to fetch the
         oxygen bottle, are you quite satisfied that the match
         had been stopped? - A. At that point, yes.

    Q.   You then set off to get your oxygen bottle? - A. Yes.

    Q.   With Mr. Wells or alone? - A.   Yes, with Mr. Wells.

    Q. Having got it you returned on to the field by the
       same route I suppose? - A. No, just Peter Wells and
       myself.

D   Q. By the same method as you had gone out? - A. Yes, by
       the same route, sorry.

    Q. You then headed towards the Leppings Lane
       terracing? - A. Yes.

    Q. The ambulance was still standing outside obviously
       when you got there? - A. Yes.

    Q. There was only one St. John's Ambulance so far as you
       know? - A. To the best of my ability, yes, I think
       so.

    Q. You were not the driver of it, were you? - A. No.

    Q. Was the driver there by the time you    got there or
       were you the first ones to it so far    as you know? -
       A. No, usually the ambulance drivers    take up
       positions near the ambulance but not    necessarily stay
       with the ambulance.

    Q. Did you see him, that is really what I am trying to
       find out? - A. Not when we went back for the bottle,
       no.

    Q. You went and got the bottle, came back on to the
       pitch, and went towards Leppings Lane. How long did
       all that take from the time that you met Mr. Wells
       who said that people were dying and to get the
       bottle, out and then back, and towards Leppings Lane?
       - A. Three or four minutes, something like that.

    Q. As you went towards the stand I think you could see
       people on the ground, could you? - A. Yes.

    Q. Is it right that people you passed, never mind about
       anybody else, all seemed to be attended to by various
B      people? - A. Yes.

    Q. You then went right up to the fence, is that right? -
       A. Yes.

    Q. You looked in? - A. Yes.

    Q. Who attracted your attention? - A. One particular
       man. Peter Wells obviously directed me.
       Incidentally I carried the bottle because Peter Wells
       had breathing difficulties.  I carried the bottle to
       the fence end and from then on Peter Wells did
       everything that he would do as an officer. That
       would be to administer gas. One particular person
       was in seemingly a worse condition than the others
       around him.

    Q. Was this an older person? - A. An older person, yes.
D
    Q. I think you tried initially to put a mask over his
       face? - A. Yes, that is right.

    Q. But that would not work because you could not get it
       in, is that right? - A. That is right, yes.

    Q. You took the mask off, is that right? - A. That is
       right.

    Q. What did you try to do then? - A. Put the pipe sort
       of through the fence end into the man's mouth.

    Q. You turned the bottle on? - A. The bottle was on.     It
       is on before you do that.

    Q. The idea was to blow some oxygen in? - A. Yes, into
       the man's mouth, yes.

    Q. Did you get any response in fact? - A. None at all.

    Q. How long did you try that for? - A. A minute
       probably, something like that.

    Q. Did you notice your ambulance - and when I say your
       ambulance I mean the St. John's Ambulance - appear on
       the pitch at any point? - A. Not at that point.

    Q. When did it arrive? - A. Minutes after that.

    Q. Minutes after? - A. Minutes after that, yes.

Q. How long did you try the blowing of the oxygen into
   this gentleman? - A. How did?

Q. How long would you say you tried this? - A. Probably
   a minute.

    Q. Then when you saw there was no response what did you
       do, did you move to somebody else? - A. I think at that
       point Peter and myself, that is Peter Wells, were
       separated temporarily, came back together, and
       indicated at this point there were obviously other
B      people in serious stress, and showing signs of
       cyanosis, and at this point one particular fellow was
       reasonably calm, in the circumstances, and we tried to
       ask or get him to get some response out of a fellow
       ttiat was in front of him. Seemingly they should have
       both been in the same situation, but this taller
       fellow, we asked him to bite or pinch the other
       fellow s ear in front of him, and he couldn't. He
       couldn't move, so we said, "Bite his ear, do anything".

    0.   How many rows back was he, would you say? - A. From me?

    Q.   From the front of the fence? - A. To that lady there
         perhaps.

    Q. And he said he couldn't move so you said to bite him
       with his teeth? - A. Yes.
D   0. And he tried to do that I think, didn't he? - A. That
       is right. Sorry, did you say ...?

    Q.   Did iie try and do it? - A. He tried, yes.

    Q.   Did he get any response? - A. The fellow sort of limped
         in an unconscious state as though he wanted to do but
         couldn't.

    0. So what you are saying is that you had these two people
       next to each other, and it struck you that one of them
       appeared to be fine .... - A. In a worse situation.

    0. Well, not fine, but capable of responding, and the
       other one .... - A. Was not.

    0. Was in a desperate state? - A. Yes.

    0. Did you look higner up then? Did you look furtner back
       into tne pen? - A. Yes. About that point there was a
       distinct gap between the ones we will call the front,
       from here to the Jury, a distinct gap appeared or was
       there, and it was about this time that there was only
       one incident, and we were trying to get the people then
       to take the ones that had fallen and couldn't get
       themselves up, for whatever reason, and to pull them
       away from the ones at the front, and it was as though
       they were in trauma, just no response at all at that
       time. You can imagine. I was probably looking at three
       Jurors there. You can t address everybody and this
       particular fellow then started throwing stones.

    Q. He was, in fact, spoken to by his friends, wasn't he? -
       A. Yes, by most people near me anyway.

    0. Tell me whether there were any Police around at the
       point when you arrived with you oxygen bottle?- A. Yes.
B
    Q. Wnere were they, can you remember? - A. All around the
       back of the goal and in front of the crushed
       supporters.

    Q. Were they communicating in any way as far as you could
       hear or see? - A. At that point I would not say in a
       helpful manner.

    Q. What do you mean by that? - A. My initial reaction was
       that there had been an attempt to invade the pitch but
       I don't know, I didn't understand what had happened,
       and I just imagined or assumed that the Police also
       thought that and were trying to send them back, get
       calm.

    Q. In what way were they responding which you say was not
       helpful, at that point when you arrived with your
D      oxygen bottle, which you worked out as being at least
       10-past-3. - A. Yes, probably.

    Q. It may even have been a bit later, because you said it
       took three or four minutes to get it, the match had
       started, and we know what time that was.  In what way
       were they not responding in a helpful way? - A. One
       would have thought with the obvious signs that we saw
       they would have been trying more urgently to get them
       out, and it was not that noticeable at that point,
       until it all seemed to change together and then there
       were frantic efforts on everybody's part.

    0.   Did you see the gate open by chance? - A. Yes.

    0.   Were people coming out of that gate at tnat point? - A.
         Ho.

       was there anybody trying to get anybody out that you

       last few moments really that at this time people were
       in a state of shock? - A. Yes, I think that is probably
       true of everyone.

    Q. That is a fair way of putting it, is it? - A. Yes, very
       fair.

    Q. That is certainly the impression one got, and one is
       talking here about the people who were inside the pen?
       - A. Yes.

    Q. Who were shocked and unable to move back when you were
B      asking them to? - A. Yes.

    Q.   And    the Police as well? - A. And   the Policeaswell.

    Q.   Who    were shocked? - A. Yes.

    0. At the dreadful sight? - A. At the enormity, yes, I
       think that is exactly fair.

    0. Then when they came out of that shock a few moments
       later they all tried as hard as they could to get
       people out quickly? - A. My own feelings were a
       magnificent effort.

    0.    The   way we have just put it is a quite fair
         description, is it? - A. Yes, that is my sentiments.

D
    0. It must follow from that, Mr. Gillatt, that when you
       arrived at 10-past-3 or a little later, you clearly saw
       no immediate signs of organisation of tne Police
       effort. There was no one there organising them into
       wnat they should be doing? That is obvious from your
       evidence? - A. That is true.

    0. Can I go back in time in your evidence, please? You
       knew this was an all ticket game, I assume? - A. Yes.

    0. A capacity crowd? - A. Yes.

    0. You had been to a capacity game before, I suspect? - A.
       Yes.

    0. Had you been to the 1988 final? - A. Is that the one
       with Liverpool and Arsenal?

    0. !io, sorry, the 1988 semi-final between Liverpool and
       Nottingham Forest? - A. No.

    0. So be it. You said that at 2.15 from your position,
       between the Spion Kop and the South Stand, you noticed
       that although the Spion Kop, South Stand were pretty
       full, that of course was the Nottingham Forest fans
       area, wasn't it? - A. Correct.

    0. You noticed that there were relatively few in the two
       areas which had been designated for the Liverpool fans?
       - A. Yes.

    Q. That of course being the West Stand seated and standing
         area and the North Stand? - A. Yes.

    Q. Do I take it from that that it was obvious to you at
         2.15 that the vast majority of Liverpool fans, for
B        whatever reason, apparently had not arrived yet in the
         ground? - A. Yes.

         Let me move on. At quarter-to-3 when you viewed again
         that area where we know the Liverpool fans were
         designated, that is the West Stand area, and we are
         talking about the terraces now, your evidence is that
         the centre area looked full, correct? - A. That is the
         Leppings Lane end?

    Q- Yes. - A. Yes.
    Q. And we are talking about the two pens immediately
         outside the tunnel? - A. Yes.

    0 . But there was quite a lot of room on the outer pens? -
        A. Yes.

    Q. So that contrast between the fullness of the centre
         pens and the relative emptiness of the side pens was
         obvious to you at quarter-to-3? - A. Yes.

         I have no further questions.     Thank you.

    Q. Mr. Gillatt, you said you noticed that the two centre
         pens were full at about 2.15, and .... - A. Fuller than
         the other two.

    Q< Fuller than the other parts, sorry, yes, and you said
         you saw fans going over the radial fence which divided
         pens 3 and 4? - A. Yes.

    0 . But botn of those looked quite full? - A. Yes, but
         obviously they were just trying to get away from that
         particular area, for whatever reason.

    0 . Do you icnow that there is a very narrow pen next to pen
        4? - A. No, I don't.

    Q.   You don't.

              MRS. McBRIEN:     Could we have the plan up, please,
         again?

    Q.        THE CORONER:     Yes.   Point to pen 3? - A. Yes.

    Q- Pen 4. - A. Yes.

    Q. And then the little narrow one which is pen 5, okay,

              THE CORONER:   That is the one that you are
         talking about, isn't it?

B             MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes, it is.

    Q. That is called pen 5. I was wondering, could you have
       been mistaken? Could fans have been going from pen 4
       into that pen, I wonder? - A. I can't say.

    Q.    Is it possible? - A. It is possible, yes. There are
         always occasions where fans are allocated areas and
         want to move to other areas. That happens all the
         time.
    0. Yes. So you would not know if that pen was a pen that
       was used? - A. No.

    Q. Because it is so narrow you would not know that? - A.
       No.

    Q. Do you know if someone had told Peter Wells that there
       was going to be a delayed kick-off? - A. Pardon?

    0.    When Peter Wells told you, came around and said there
         was going to be a delayed kick-off, do you know who had
         told him that? - A. No.   I assumed it would be a Police
         Officer. Peter Wells liaised with Police on a really
         sound basis.

    Q. All right.    Thank you very much.

                          Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL:

         Q. From what you said when you started giving your evidence
            I formed the view that at the time you didn't have a
     B      great deal of experience as an ambulanceman, is that
            correct? - A. That is correct.

         Q. Now you have more experience, it being some twenty months
            on? - A. Yes.

         Q. The situation you observed at or shortly after ten past
            three when you arrived at the Leppings Lane terraces was
            one which in your experience was quite unprecedented? -
            A. Yes.

         Q. As an inexperienced ambulanceman would it be fair to say
            you knew even less how to react than those people with
            more experience than you? - A. That's perfectly true.

         Q.    You, again as I understand your evidence, were keen to
              follow the direction and instruction of Peter Wells? - A.
              Yes.

         Q. You had acted as his bearer of the oxygen bottle? - A.
            Yes.

         Q. You were putting yourself entirely at his disposal? - A.
            Yes.

         Q. Can you remember now whereabouts on the fence you first
            went to? - A. Do you want me to show you on the...?

         0.   If you are able to recall.  Perhaps on 274, which is a
              larger scale.   Not 274, I'm sorry.

                   THE CORONER:   Do you mean the standard one we use?

                   MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, yes.

                   THE CORONER:   Why don't you put an acetate up and
              then he can mark that, then we can put a number on it.
              The one of the terrace, of pens 3 and 4.   That is the
              one you are after?

                   MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, it is.

                   THE CORONER:   What was the question?

                   MR. RUSSELL:   Was he able to remember the point at
              the fence he went to first all under the direction of
              Peter Well, when I think he said he first attempted to
              give oxygen, first of all by mask and then by pipe.   (The
              witness marked the plan)

                                            E. B. GILLATT


     THE CORONER:   That is C.376.

     MR. RUSSELL:   As somebody who was keen to do what
Peter Wells was telling you to do, would it be fair to
say you were concentrating fairly hard on the task you
were being given? - A. In what respect?

You were not doing something with which you were wholly
familiar or experienced, were you? - A. At that point
there were few people doing anything that could be done.
At that point, at reaching the fence I carried the
bottle.   That was all at that point.

Would it be fair to say from what you said that your
attention was directed towards what Peter Wells was doing
with the oxygen mask and the oxygen tube? - A. Yes.

That was where your attention was concentrated? - A. Yes.

Would it also be fair to say your attention was not
concentrated upon the rate at which Liverpool supporters
were being evacuated through gate 3, or any other gate
for that matter? - A. My first experience of gate 3 was a
heap of bodies, literally.

Were you concentrating on what efforts were being made to
remove supporters from that heap of bodies? - A. Yes.

It is right that attempts were being made at that time to
remove bodies from that heap of bodies? - A. That's true.

And to remove them from the heap of bodies through the
narrow gateway? - A. That's right.

               Further by THE CORONER:

I want you to mark another plan.   I want you to show me
where you were when you were in your position at the
corner of the Spion Kop and the South Stand, which is
where you were supposed to be, and would have stayed if
nothing had gone wrong.  (The witness marked the plan)
That is C.377.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much indeed.   I am
much obliged to you for coming.   Mr. Cain.

                                  By THE CORONER:

      B   Q. Good afternoon. You are Steven James Cain I believe. Is
             that right? - A. Yes.

          Q. Is it still                                is that right,
             Runcorn? - A. Yes.

          Q. And you were a friend of Kevin, weren't you, Kevin Tyrrell?
             - a . Yes.

                   THE CORONER: Is Mr. and Mrs. Tyrrell here, as a
             matter of interest. Are you Mr. Tyrrell?

                   MR. TYRRELL:   Yes.

                   THE CORONER: Sergeant Griffiths, would you be good
             enough to bring me the file, Kevin Tyrrell's file, the
             black folder.

          Q. You in fact had a ticket for the match.     That is right?
             - A. Yes.

          Q. In fact it was not just Kevin there were several of you
             who were going, weren't there, and you came by coach.
             Right? - A. Yes.

          Q. Amber Line.   That is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

          Q. Do you know what time you left about? - A. About quarter-to-

          Q. What time did you get to Sheffield? - A. Around 1 o'clock.

          Q. And you I think were caught up in some traffic jam for
             about 20 minutes or so. Is that right? - A. Yes.

             When you got to Sheffield the coach was parked and you
             went out for a meal or something, didn't you? - A. Yes,
             we went to the chip shop. We had to walk past the ground
             first.

          Q. I see, to get to the chippy? - A. Yes.

          Q. Having been there I think you had something to eat and
             so on and then you came back to the ground. What time
             did you get back to the ground? - A. About 20-past-2..

          Q. I think you were all searched, weren't you? - A. Yes.

          Q. And the Policeman ate some of your chips? - A. Yes.

I see, so you had a rough idea what it was like? - A. Yes.

But you like standing behind the goal I imagine.    Is that
right? - A. Yes.

Having entered did you go down the tunnel? -   A. Did we what?

Go down the tunnel to get to your match position?
- A
  . Y
    es.

And which I take it was completely empty or virtually empty
and you entered the terrace.  It was the right-hand one,
was it? - A. Pen 3, yes.

So what time was that? - A. About 25-past-1, something
like that.

So you had no problems? - A. No.

I think you lounged around? - A. Yes, we sat around on
the steps and read the programme.

There was music I think you said being played over the
Tannoy or something.

      Now let us go on then till about half-past-2
because until then I think nothing happened? - A. No, not
really.

At 2.30 had the position changed, was it still as empty
or what was happening at 2.30? - A. I thought it was
near enough full to capacity because I said:  "It's getting
packed in here, isn't it?"

Could you remember a beach ball being bounced about? -
A. Yes.

Q. Was this at that time or later? - A. I am not really
   sure. I should imagine it would be after half-2.

Q. After that? - A. Not long after.

Q. Did you join in knocking the beach ball around or were
   you not in the right area? - A. No, just watching like.

Q. Was it at the time when this beach ball was you know
   being knocked around that you got separated from Brian
   and Kevin, Brian is your other friend isn't he? - A. Yes.
   I think it was around then but I think it was after the
   beach ball had, after the last time.

Q. I see. Would it be right to say whilst the beach ball
   was being knocked about the three of you were together?
   - A. Yes.
Q. I think you have already said it was full but how full
   was it at that point? - A. I would say it was full to
   capacity.
Q. Were you uncomfortable at that point? - A. Not very, there
   was a bit of like shuffling around.

Q. So once the beach ball episode had finished, whatever
   time that may have been, what happened to separate you
   from Kevin? - A. There was just a lot of pushing like.
   There was like surging but there was nothing to surge
   about because there was no action happening on the field
   so I just thought like when people come in and they push
   you you know to walk past you I thought it was just like
   that.
Q. I see. Were you concerned about it for yourself at that
   point? - A. No.
Q. And you yourself weren't distressed either at that point
   or were you? - A. Not at that point, no.

Q. Is it right that you have been to many big matches where
   Liverpool have played? - A. A couple.

Q. And have you been pushed about on those matches? — A. Yes.

Q. How did this pushing which we are talking about compare
   with that, you know the other matches as far as your own
   personal experience is concerned? - A. After a while
   like you started getting pushed forward but you weren't
   going back.

 Q. That was unusual? - A. Yes.

    Q. Do you remember the players coming on to the pitch? -
       A. I did not actually see them come out but I remember
       them coming out.

    Q. I see you remember them being there but you did not see
B      them run out of the tunnel? - A. No.

    Q. At that point what was it like for you? - A. Well I had
       a pair of dungarees on and one of the straps had snapped
       so I was like trying to keep my dungarees    up and then
       all of a sudden   like I had got moved away  a bitand between
       the two bars there is a gap and like the crowd went either
       side of the gap so they go round down towards the front
       and they went by the bars, so I just walked because there
       was no one there sort of to the front but not like exactly
       to the front, it was just behind the bars.

    Q. So you were able to make a passage through there at that
       point? - A. Yes.

    Q. You were saying   that you went between the     crashbarriers.
       Is that right?    That is not a popular position, or is it?
       - A. No, because no one wants to go, get like pushed right
       down to the front.

    Q.    W&s    it that point that things really became bad asfar
         as you were concerned or when did it happen? - A. Once
         I had stepped forward to like get into the empty position
         it closed up behind me and that is when like there was
         another surge and that was like the bad one.

    Q. You definitely felt surges? - A. Yes, everyone like just
       followed me in.

    Q.   We know the players were on the field because you have
         told us that but had the match kicked off by then? - A.
         I didn't know.

    Q. Did you see any Police Officers at that point anywhere?
       - A. At the perimeter fence.

    Q. What were they doing when you saw them? - A. Just watching
       the crowd.

    Q. Were they standing on the track, the grass or the fencing?
       - A. The track.

    Q. Did you see the gate? - A. Yes.

    Q. You did? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you notice it open at any point in time? - A. It
       opened and then it looked like someone got pushed back
       in and then it closed again and then it only seemed like
       a couple of seconds later it was opened again and that
       is when I got out.

        Q. I see, so you were sufficiently close to be able to see
           this gate? You must have been because you have just
           described it? - A. I was like side on to the perimeter
           fencing.  I had been turned round a bit. I was looking
           over my shoulder.
    B
        Q. And you saw it open, somebody appeared to get pushed in.
           Did you see was it one person or more than one, can you
           remember? - A. I could not really say.

        Q. The gate was shut as far as you could tell. Is that right?
           Did you actually see it shut. You did? - A. Yes.

        Q. And then you said a couple of seconds later it opened
           again. How did you then get out? - A. There was like a
           pause and no  one could move and then people started to
           move and get  out and like I just went with the flow
           really.

        Q. Does it mean  you were one of the     early ones to   get out?
           - A. Yes, one of the first few.

Q. You didn't have to be carried or lifted out? - A. No.

Q. You managed to walk? - A. I walked out on my own.

Q. When you got out, did you notice whether the game was
   still in play at that time? - A. It was still in
   play.

Q. Can you remember, and tell me if you cannot remember,
   having got out and seen the game in play can you
   recollect whether the crossbar was hit? Did you see
   the crossbar being hit? - A. No, I didn't see it.

Q. You      never saw thatand so     you do     not know? - A.No.

Q. Then you saw somebody run on to the pitch to stop the
   game, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. You cannot actually say what happened to Kevin
   because you got split up from him? - A. No, we got
   split up.

Q.   You     got split up from him   before    the teams cameonto
     the pitch, is that right? - A. Before the what?

Q. Before the teams came on to the pitch? - A. I would
   say so, yes.

Q. Or was it at the time? - A. At the general time I
   think because I didn't see them come on to the pitch.
   So I think it was at the general time that they did
   come on to the pitch.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:

Q. Mr. Cain, you have been to many matches? - A.
   Correct.

Q. You have been in capacity crowds? - A. Correct.

Q. So you are in a good position to tell us, you thought
   round about 2.30 that the pen you were in was near
   enough full to capacity because you made a comment.
   What was the comment you made? - A. I just said to my
   mates, "Its full in here and look at the ends, its
   empty".

Q. Although after that the beach ball was being pushed
   around you were still in a capacity full pen, were
   you not? - A. Yes.
                                                     S. J. CAIN


Q. The fact that the beach ball was being pushed about
   does not mean there was plenty of space in the pen,
   does it? - A. No, people could just get their arms
   up.

Q.    Getting    your arms up, I just want to get the picture,
     and the picture might be because of the beach ball we
     are in a very wide space with lots of room to run
     with the ball, play football, what have you? - A. No
     one could actually jump for the ball though.

Q. I am sorry? - A. No one could actually jump for the
   ball.

Q. Why could they not jump for the ball? - A. Everyone
   was around them.

Q.   Explain what you mean by that, everyone was around
     them? - A. It was just full to capacity so that you
     couldn't .

Q. Could not what? - A.      You couldn't like leap forward.

     MR. PAYNE:   I wonder if I might just ask a question
arising from Mr. King's questions about how full it was at
the time when the beach ball was being thrown around.

       THE CORONER:   Yes.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. Did you see a big boy getting up on to one of the
   crash barriers, standing up on it and then falling
   forward on to the heads of the crowd in front? - A. I
   did.

Q. You did. He said that the last time he did that was
   when the players came out on to the field. Did you
   see that? - A. I didn't see the players come out on
   to the field.

Q. So he was able to get up on to the barrier, was he? -
   A. I should imagine so, if he did.

Q. When he fell forward on to the heads of the people in
   front, did they seem to mind about this? - A. I
   suppose a few of them were moaning.    I don't know
   because he never fell near me.

Q.   He was not near you? - A. No.

Q.   What? - A. He was like a few feet away and   so it
     didn't really affect me.

                     Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. Show us where you were with Brian and Kevin and mark
   that with a 1? - A. Yes.

Q. 2 was the position you reached just before you were
   able to get out, is that right? - A. Yes.

     MRS. PERKINS:    C.378.

     THE CORONER:   I want to interpose a witness at this
stage who does not even know I am going to call him.

     THE WITNESS:    Is that it?

     THE CORONER:   That is it, thank you very much indeed.
Mr. Tyrrell, would you just come forward.  I have just one
question and that is mother's occupation.

                     FRANCIS TYRRELL Sworn

                        Bv THE CORONER:

Q. First of all, it is Francis Tyrrell? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it still                                  ? - A.
   Yes.                                         r

Q. Mr. Tyrrell, forgive me for troubling you and may I
   say I am very, very sorry you lost your boy? I speak
   for everybody when I say that. All I want to find
   out is, could you give me his mum's full names? - A.
   Margaret Rosemary.

Q. Margaret Rosemary Tyrrell? - A. Yes.

Q. Could you tell me what her occupation is apart from a
   housewife, if she has one? - A. It was a machinist.

Q. That is all I need to ask you. We want to know that
   for registration purposes. - A. I got the form
   yesterday.

Q. Yes, that is right. We wrote to you but I did not
   realise you were going to be here and so I thought we
   might as well get the information. - A. You do not
   need it back now then?

Q. You may as well send it anyway.    It is not essential
   in the circumstances. - A. Yes.

     THE CORONER:   I take it nobody wanted to ask   any
questions on that. Can I just say to Stephen that    you did
very well.  It is quite a frightening experience.    I forget
to say it because I am used to it but you did very   well.
Well done.

        Q. You were? - A. Yes.

        Q.   What   are you now?    - A. Nothing.

        Q.    I am sure that is only a temporary hiccough. You are
             a Hillsborough supporter, is that right? - A. A
             Liverpool supporter.

        Q.   What   did I say? -    A. Hillsborough.

        Q.    I am sorry, you are a Liverpool supporter. I beg
             your pardon. You were also the friend of Andrew
             Sefton, were you not? - A. Yes.

        Q. Both of you decided together with somebody to come to
           the match on 15th April 1989? - A. Yes.

        Q.   You all had tickets, is that right? - A. Yes.

        Q.   Did you come by car? - A. Yes.

        Q. Do you know what time you left? - A. About half past
           ten.

        Q. You actually stopped on the motorway at the services
           for something to eat? - A. Yes.

        Q.   How    long were you there?- A. About     twenty minutes.

        Q.   Not very long? - A. No.

        Q. Then what time did you actually get into Sheffield?
           You also had a bit of a holdup but what time did you
           get into Sheffield? - A. About half past one.

        Q.   You    parked your car and you arrived   outside the
             ground at between 2 to when? - A. Between 2 and 2.15.

        Q. That is right, is it? - A. Yes.

        Q. What was it like when you got outside the ground? -
           A. By the turnstiles it was just a mass of people
           outside.

Q. There were other people? - A. Yes.    There were no
   queues just a big mass of people.

Q. How long did it take you to get through? You got
   through a turnstile eventually in the end, did you? -
   A. Eventually after about half an hour.

Q.   Was it a crush? -A. Yes.

Q.   We do not need to     go   into that detailbecause we have
     heard from many other people about it. What I want
     to ask you is, did you see any Police Officers be
     they mounted or otherwise? - A. I think there was
     three or four mounted Police Officers.

Q. You saw that? - A. Yes.

Q. Having got through the turnstiles you were in the
   concourse area, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.   You saw a tunnel, is that right? - A.   Yes.

Q.    Is that where you went down? - A. After about five
     minutes. We bought a programme first before we went
     through and went to the toilet.

Q. Did you notice any big gates opened while you were in
   that area? - A. I didn't notice.

Q. You did not see any? - A. No.

Q . When you entered the tunnel, what was the tunnel
    like? Let us stop for a minute. As you approached
    the tunnel were you able to see the pitch through it?
    - A. I can't remember.  I could see the sky.

Q. Pardon? - A. I could see the sky.    I remember seeing
   the sky.

Q. But you do not remember seeing the pitch? - A. No.

Q. Did you then begin to enter the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Was the tunnel itself clear at that point in time
   when you entered it? - A. Yes.

Q. When I say clear I do not mean devoid of people? - A.
   There were people in there.

Q. But you were able to walk through? - A. Walk through
   with ease.

Q. Then I think you got to the end of the tunnel, is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. What met your eyes there? - A. The pen was quite full
   and so I said to Andrew that we will go back because
   I could see the other pens were quite empty. The
   pens to the right of it was quite empty and I said,
   "We will go back and go in there" but we didn't. We
   decided we would be all right in here.

Q. Speak up? - A. We were going to go through but as we
   were going down there were people coming behind and
   we didn't want to put anyone out and said, "It'll be
   all right in here".

Q. You looked but then decided you would go on anyway? -
   A. Yes.

Q. You could have got back, could you? - A. It would
   have been a bit of trouble to get back because there
   were quite a few people starting to come through
   then.

Q. You are not saying there was a solid wall of people
   coming down? - A. No.

Q. Or are you?   Maybe you are? - A. No, not a solid wall
   of people.

Q. You decided you might as well go on? - A. Yes.

Q. What I am trying to find out is whether you were
   unable to get back or you assessed the two situations
   and decided it was not worth the effort and you would
   go on? - A. We could have been able to get through
   probably but it would have been quite hard to get
   through.

Q. Quite hard to get through? - A. Yes.

Q. So you decided to go on. Which pen did you go into,
   do you remember? - A. I think it was Pen 3.

Q. Do you know what time you entered the pen? - A. I
   think it was about quarter to or ten to three.

Q. Is that a guess or because you looked at a clock,
   watch? - A. I looked at my watch just before. When
   we were outside I looked at my watch and I was just
   going by that time.

Q. Although you are not absolutely certain it is not
   wildly out? - A. No, it will be within five or ten
   minutes.

Q. Having got into this pen, how did you get through the
   crowd? Was it difficult to get through into the pen?
   - A. Not really because there was a small gap. You
   could push through.
                                               A. CAMPBELL



Once you had got through,  I am told it is quite
common for there to be a crowd at the entrance to a
pen? - A. Yes.

Was it any easier or was it exactly the same? - A. It
was about the same really.

How far down did you and Andrew go? - A. About three-
quarters of the way down I think.

Did you stop near a barrier or not? - A. Yes, we
stopped behind the barrier about three-quarters of
the way down.

I will get you to show me   on a plan in a moment where
that was. You and Andrew    were together at that
point? - A. Yes.

0. What if anything was happening on it? - A. Nothing, at
   tnat time.

0. Did you, eitherwhen you came onto theterrace or while
   you were making you wayto this position, see a  beach
   ball being knocked about? - A. I didn't notice.

Q. Did you hear the players being called out? - A. I heard
   the teams being announced.

Q. Where were you when you heard that? - A. I think I was
   still stood behind the barrier.

Q. So you had reached the barrier by the time the teams
   were announced? - A. Well, it was about that time, yes.

Q. About? - A. Yes.

0. I am not saying you had been there for long but you
   were at the barrier. How was it at that point? - A. It
   was started to get crushed in there, starting to get
   packed in there.

0. I couldn't hear? - A. It was starting to get packed in
   there at that time.

          HR. KING:   I thought I heard him say originally,
     "Start to get crushed in there", but I may be wrong.

0.        THE CORONER:                 I think you did use the word
     crushed? - A. Yes.

Q. I could not hear very well either, so you were starting
   to get crushed in there at that point? - A. Yes.

Q.   was    ....

          MRS. McBRIEN:   Excuse me, to interrupt.  I
     tnougnt he said it started to get packed in tnere?

                THE WITNESS:           I said both.

                THE CORONER:           He said both.

0. Let's find out what you mean, okay? - A. Yes.

Q. Because what I might call a crush you might consider to
   be a garden party, I don't know, or vice versa. We are
   talking about the point in time when the teams were
   being announced, all right? - A. Yes.

    0. Tell me again what it felt like for you at that point?
       - A. I was being crushed against the bar. The bar was
       being pressed into my midriff.

B   Q. That was obviously not comfortable? - A. No, very
       uncomfortable.

    0. But were you concerned at that stage? - A. Slightly,
       yes.

    Q. What did you anticipate was going to happen? - A. I
       didn't know.  I just didn't want to get hurt, that's
       all I was thinking about.

    Q. Did you then see the teams come out? Did you stay in
       that position? - A. No, I ducked under the bar. I
       managed to force ....

    Q. You dipped underneath it? - A. I managed to force
       myself back and just ducked underneath.

    0.   That was to   get yourself more comfortable? - A. Yes.

    Q.    "Were you more comfortable at that point? - A. For a
         while, yes.

    Q. Till wiien were you more comfortable? I am not saying
       very comfortable but just more comfortable than you
       were squasned against the bar? - A. For a couple of
       minutes.

    0. Pardon? - A. For a couple of minutes.

    Q. What happened next? - A. I turned around to Andrew and
       told nim to duck under, because ....

    0.    Sorry? - A. I turned around to Andrew, who was being
         crushed against the bar as well, and told nim to duck
         down, but ne said he would be okay there so I got
         turned around and pushed, and I got turned around and
         was facing away so I didn't see tne teams come out.

    0.   Did you see the teams come   out?- A. No.

    0.   It is difficult to hear.

              MISS ADDLEMAN:   I amsorry to interrupt.   It is
         almost impossible to hear anything the witness is
         saying at this end.

              THE CORONER:    I am sorry.   Let us try again.

              HR. KING:   Sir, I don't think he is speaking into
         the microphone, that is the problem.

              THE CORONER:      He's not?

              HR. KING:      No, he is just missing it.

B   o.        THE CORONER:   Lift it a bit and lean forward.
         Say "One, two three", or something like that. - A. One,
         two three.

              THE CORONER:      Can   you hear him now?

              MR. RUSSELL:      "A, b, c"?

              THE CORONER:      He said "One, two, three".
         (Laughter)

         Get your head right close and speak slowly.  I think
         this is part of the trouble, that you speak rather
         fast. You had ducked under the bar, yes? - A. Yes.

    Q. You were a bit more comfortable on that side of the
         barrier? - A. Yes.

    Q. And your friend Andrew had stayed on the far side of
         the bar? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Where you and he had been crushed against it? - A. Yes.

    Q. You said to him, "Come under"? - A. Yes.
    Q. And he said, "No thanks", or what did he say?    You tell
         me wnat he said? - A. I think he said, "I can't",
         because he was getting pushed from behind.

    Q. That is not quite what you said first. - A. I can't
         remember.   It is a long time ago.

    Q* Yes, I realise that, but did he appear to you to be
         willing to stay wnere he was? - A. I couldn't say.         I
         was too concerned about myself at the time.

    Q*   Did you see the players come out?      Tnat I think   is
         where we got to? - A. No.

    Q« Did you see the game kick off? - A. No.
    Q* Not at all? - A. No.
    Q. Did you see any part of the match? - A. No.
    0. You are quite sure that you did not see theteams out?
       - A. I seen Liverpool's goalkeeper when he came down to
       the Leppings Lane end.

     Q. Have a look at the last three lines on this page. Does
        it remind you? - A. Yes, there was a big cheer when the
        team came out so I knew the team was coming out.

B|   Q. Would you agree that this is correct or not? - A. Yes.

     0.    Do you wantto read it to us slowly?   - A.   All of it?

     Q.    No, just the last fewlines. - A. "He was immediately
          against the barrier. This was about 3 p.m. The teams
          were out and the game just starting. The crowd was
          just building up and a lot of pushing. I remember one
          surge".

     Q.    I will read it out as well: "He was immediately
          against the barrier. This was about 3 p.m. The teams
          were out and the game just starting. The crowd was
          still building up and there was a lot of pushing, and I
          remember one surge", and then it goes on. Now, would
          you say that that is a correct description of what the
          position was like at that point? - A. I should think
          so, yes.

     Q. This surge, did it move you in any way? - A. I didn't
        move me - I wasn't shoved right down to the front or
        anything like that, but I was getting moved about.

     Q. Did you catch a glimpse of Andrew again after that? -
        A. No.

     Q. That was really the last time you got a proper view of
        him? - A. Yes.

     Q. Did you then get moved - you got next to the railings
        of pen 2, didn't you? - A. Yes.

     0. How did you get there? - A. I just got shoved there.

     0.   And over what period of time was  that? Was that after
          you have seen Andrew, as you have described to me? - A.
          Yes.

     0.    Was it a gentle sort of shoving?Was it episodic - did
          you get pushed, and then stop? - A. We were just being
          moved about all the time, constantly.

     0. Did you get out by going into pen 2? - A. Yes, because
        a lad in pen 2 cupped his hands through the railings
        and I stepped into his hands and he let me out.

     Q. Did you notice wnat was happening on the field at that
        point in time? - A. No.

    Q. So you don't know what time that was? - A. Not exactly,
       no.

    Q.   You don't know whether the game was still in play? - A.
g        No, I wasn't taking any notice.

    Q.   No, I don't blame you.

                      Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

    Q. Do you often go to watch football matches? - A. I don't
       any more.

    Q. No, but before this happened did you go? - A. Yes, all
       tne time.

    0. All the time? - A. To every Liverpool home match and to
       some, occasionally away games.

    0.    Do you agree with what the Court has been told, that
         before a big game when there isa big match,   it gets
         tightly packed, and then after kick-off the crowd finds
         its own level? - A. Yes, that usually happens.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING
    0. when you went down the tunnel and you got to the end of
       it, you could see that there was, or appeared to be,
       some more room to the side than straight in front of
       you? - A. Yes.

    0. Whicn was a pretty obvious thing anyway, because many
       people like to stand behind the goal, don't they, if
       tney have a preference? - A. I just stand in the
       corner.  I don't like standing behind the goal because
       it gets too crushed.

    0. You don't like standing there? - A. No.

    0. So you made an unusual decision for you, because
       altnough you said it would not have been just so easy,
       you could nave gone back and aimed for the corner flag?
       - A. I could have tried, yes.

    Q. But you decided to stay where you were? - A. Yes.

    Q. It was no   surprise to you to have to push past the
       first few   people at the top of the entrance way because
       that is     where quite a lot of people were standing? - A.
       Yes, it     was quite easy to get     through thatway.

    0. Quite easy to get through and     it continuedto be quite
       easy to   get through until you      took up yourposition on
       the barrier? - A. Yes.

    Q. Then the time came when you felt uncomfortable on the
       barrier, you made yourself some room, ducked underneath
       and went the other side of the barrier? - A. Yes.

    Q. Stood there for a couple of minutes, turned round and
       had a look at Andrew, and suggested to him that he
       tried to do the same? - A. Yes.

    Q. But he didn't? - A. No.

    Q. And then from there on in you lost track of him? - A.
       Yes.

    0. Not by any particular major thing but just by pushing,
       a constant sort of pushing around? - A. Yes.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. KING

    0. Mr. Campbell, you were asked about your experience at
       other matches and how you expected a crowd to find its
       own level, although it sets out quite tightly packed.
       Do you remember being asked about that just a few
       moments ago? - A. Yes.

    Q. The terraces which you have been on, does that include,
       for example, the Kop at Anfield? - A. Yes.

    0. Is it right in the Kop at Anfield the crowd, though it
       can enter at a central position, can spread out the
       full width of the terrace? - A. That is correct, yes.

    0. Of course, you were going into a pen where to spread
       out to the width of the terrace would lead you to a
       radial fence going down the middle? - A. Yes, but we
       didn't know that at the time.

    0. You didn't know that? - A. No.

    Q. when you got to the end of the tunnel, you have given
       us tne time which I think you put at 2.45 to 2.50, it
       seemed full to you? That is what it seemed to you? -
       A. Yes, quite full.

    Q. Normally you would have gone behind the goal,
       obviously, by the sound of it? - A. To the corner of
       tne goal, yes.

    Q. What was it that met your eyes which you said to
       yourself, "I don't particularly like this, I'd like to
       go back if I could"? - A. Because there were just a lot
       of people there, more than in the corners.

        Q. Was it more people than you were expecting when you set
           out down the tunnel? - A. I didn't really think about
           it.

        Q. So be it. Clearly though it was full to you because
           you wanted to go back if you could? - A. Yes.

        0. I think the answer you gave to the learned Coroner,
           because very properly the learned Coroner was
           interested in your answer, was that it would have been
           quite hard to get through, back through the tunnel.
           That is what you said, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

        Q. Was that because of the number of people who were
           entering the whole time? - A. Yes.

        Q. I just want to make sure my note is correct again.
           Your evidence was that you had reached the barrier you
           got to, the one you were crushed against, about the
           time the team was being announced, is that right? - A.
           I think so, yes.  I can't be ....

        Q.   foo, but about that time? - A. Yes.

        Q.   At that time, which of course we know and I can help
             you on that, it was just after 9-minutes-to-3 when that
             was happening, when the team was being announced, at
             that time your evidence is that you were starting to
             get crushed against the barrier, that is right? - A.
             Yes.

        0. Have I got your evidence right also, that when you had
           got under the barrier and you turned round to Andrew
           and you wanted him to duck under, your evidence this
           afternoon, among other things you said, was he said, "I
           can't, because I am getting crushed from behind"? - A.
           He said, "I can't.  I'll be okay nere", or something
           like that, but I can't remember exactly.

        0. But I have made a note, I may have got the note wrong
           but I can check it, that you told us words to tnis
           effect, "Because he was getting crushed from behind".
           That is the note I have made. - A. I can't remember
           word for word what he said two years ago.

        0. Of course you can't.  I am not picking you up on tnat.
           I want to get the impression. The impression I got
           from your evidence was that he was being crushed from
           behind, that is why he couldn't get under? - A. I think
           so, yes.

        Q. That was the impression you had? - A. Yes.

               Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL:

Emerging on to the terrace from the tunnel you were with
your friend Andrew? - A. Yes.

You were able to make your way with your friend Andrew to
the barrier? - A. Yes.

I don't think you have explained to us which barrier that
was and perhaps the Coroner will invite you to do that in
a moment.   Can I ask you this: when you made your way
was there any - you didn't lose Andrew, you didn't find
the crowd was pushing him in one way and you in another,
is that right? - A. No more than at normal matches, no.

You were able to stay together? - A. Yes.

You were able to make your way in the direction which you
wanted to go rather than any other direction which a
surge of the crowd might send you, is that right? - A. In
the general direction we wanted to go, yes, but not
exactly where we wanted to go.

But you were able to stay together at that stage? - A.
Yes.

     MR. RUSSELL:     Sir, do you wish this witness to mark
on the acetate?

     THE CORONER:     Yes, I do.   Do you have any further
questions?

     MR. RUSSELL:     Sir, probably not.

                  Further by THE CORONER:

I want you to show me the barrier where you were when the
teams were announced, as far as you can, on the plan.
(The witness marked the plan)   Before you leave that,
you got over into pen 2.   Do you know where you were
when that happened? - A. When I climbed over to pen 2 I
just walked straight across.

You don't know where that is?   You can't put a mark on
the plan? - A. No, I can't put a mark on it.   I just
walked across.

Fair enough.    That is C.379.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I have just been asked to ask a
question, but I think it was covered.   I apologise, sir,
if it is repetition.

         Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

When you got down the tunnel and you said to yourself the
pen was full, you spoke about the sides appearing to be
empty? - A. Yes.

You could see that?   You didn't have any difficulty
seeing that? - A. No.

That was obvious to you? - A. Yes.

     MR. MANNING:   I hesitate to come back, sir, but I
have a clear note and I am sure I will be corrected if I
am wrong, that what he said was, "I remember seeing the
sky through the tunnel.   The pen was quite full.   I
could see there was room at the side."   He didn t say
the pen was full as my learned friend was suggesting.

      THE CORONER:   Are you saying, Mr. Manning, that you
interpreted that as meaning room at the side of pen 3,
or...    Mr. King and, indeed, I, understood it as meaning
room at the side of the terrace, taking the terrace as...

     MR. MANNING:   That is as I understood it, that
there was, comparatively, room that he could see to the
sides, if one puts it that way, not to the side of that
particular pen.

     THE CORONER:     Yes, I think that is what Mr. King
understood.

     MR. MANNING:   My learned friend in that question
put to the witness when he came down the pen and could
see the pen was full.   As I understood it, what he said
was the pen was quite full, he could see there was room
to the side.   It was a comparative, rather than saying
that that pen was full.

     MR. KING:      Let me try and make clear what I am
talking about.

         Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

I am talking about - Mr. Griffiths, if I can borrow your
famous pointer on the model:

Anthony - you don't mind me calling you Anthony - look at
the model.   Mr. Griffiths show the centre pens.   You
see the centre pens being indicated, pens 3 and 4, and
Anthony you point out the sides which you were referring
to which seemed to you to have room in.   Which are the
side you are referring to?   (The witness indicates)
Indicating the side pens of the terraces, which are pens
6, 2, possibly 7 and 1.

          THE CORONER:   Yes, that is how I understood him and
     I thought that is how you understood him as well, and
     Mr. Manning understood him initially.   We are all agreed
     actually.

          MRS. McBRIEN:   Excuse me coming in on this.         I
     have written down, "quite full"...

          MR. KING:   I don't think we are arguing.   I think
     Mrs. McBrien is not dealing with the same issue. We are
     talking about identifying the sides I was talking about,
     sir, and we are all ad .idem.

Q. You are Rodney Jolly? - A. Yes.
q.   of                                 Merseyside?   - A. Yes.

Q. You went to this semi-final on the 15th of April with
   really members of your family, basically? - A. No, not
   really, there was one cousin there and the rest were
   friends.

Q. I see, they were friends.   There were quite a lot of the
   Gilhooleys there? - A. That's right.

Q. They   were the   family.  Is mum and dad of Jon Paulhere?
   No.     One of them was a young lad called Jon Paul?- A.
   Correct.
Q. How did you come?         Did you come by mini-bus? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it a properly organised one? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. It wasn't a private one? - A. No.   My friend owns a bus
   company, so it was his company bus.

Q. What    time did    you    leave? - A. Maybe 10.30.

Q. What   time did  you arrive in Sheffield? -A. About 2.30, I
   suppose, because there was a lot of traffic on the road.

Q. Did you stop anywhere en route? -A. No.

Q. So you came straight through from 10.30 to 2.30 and the
   delay, if any, was due to the traffic? - A. Yes.
                                                    R.   JO LLY



Was it just heavy traffic or anything else? - A. It was
match traffic, I suppose.

Which way did you come? - A. It was through the outskirts
of Manchester and over the Pass I suppose.

Did you come over one of the Passes? - A. Yes.

There were several Gilhooleys? -A. Yes.

There were two brothers, John and Brian, and they had
stand tickets? - A. Yes.

You decided to take the little lad? - A. Jon Paul, yes.

With you on to the terracing? - A. Yes.

You approached the outer gates of Leppings Lane at about
what 2.50? - A. Twenty to three, I suppose, something
like that, quarter to three.

It didn't take you long to walk from where you had
parked? - A. Where we parked the bus it was a mile.        It
was down a steep hill.

There were an awful lot of people there? -A. Yes.

And quite a bit of tumult and so on? - A. Yes.

I think you decided you were taking Jon into that crowd?
- A. When I arrived I had a look around and it was utter
chaos with the turnstiles, going through the turnstiles.
There wasn't much organisation there.   As we were there
there was a Policeman on a horse and the horse was
spinning round, it was out of control, so I pulled him
away and I didn't try to go in there.

Where did you go? - A. We just hung around a bit, just
round the corner.

You were really waiting for things to quieten down? - A.
Sure, yes, obviously.

Had you actually got through the perimeter gates? - A.
No.

Do you know what I mean by the perimeter gates? - A. Yes,
sure.

The park-like gates? - A. No, I don't think so.

So you were still on the outside? - A. Yes.
                                                                    95

         Q. Then I think you noticed at some point a big blue metal
            gate had opened? - A. Yes.

         Q.   Where were you when you noticed that? - A. There were
     B        just three, the right hand side of the perimeter gates
              there.

         Q.   So you were still outside? - A. Yes.

         Q.   How did you get from there to these two big blue open
              gates? - A. Well, we just walked through.

         Q. You went in through these gates? - A. Yes.

         Q. They were wide open? - A. Yes.

         Q. Having got through them - had you been to the ground
            before? - A. Yes.   I was there the year before but I was
            in the seating.

         Q. You entered, I take it, through the tunnel? - A. Yes.

         Q. You went into pen 3? - A. As I went through the tunnel I
            turned right, to the right hand side of the goal, looking
            down at the goal.

         Q. Passage through the tunnel, what was that like? -A. It
            was pretty reasonable.

         Q. As you set off you can see the pitch from the end of the
            tunnel. Do you remember whether you saw it? - A. No, I
            don't remember.

         Q. When you got to the end of the tunnel,.just before you
            hit the terracing, were you able to exit from it without
            any difficulty? - A. Yes, it was OK.
s#




         Q.   You didn't have to push your way through abig crowd or
              anything like that? - A. It was quite packed but you
              could move. There was room to manoeuvre.

         Q. Having to on to the terrace did you glance at the pitch?
            - A. I think I did.   I vaguely recollect you could see
            the players' heads.

         Q. On the pitch? - A. Yes.

         Q.   Did you look at your watch? - A.   No.

         Q.   But you are pretty sure the players were onthe pitch
              when you got on to it? - A. Yes.

    Q. What did you do then?   You had Jon with you, of course.
       - A. I had him in front of me. We took up a position
       maybe half way down the terracing.

B   Q» Did you find it particularly difficult getting there? -
       A. Well, it was packed, but you could manoeuvre.

    Q. At that point would it be fair to say you were not too
       concerned? - A. It was quite comfortable - well, for me
       anyway.

    Q. I don't think you were near a barrier or a fence at that
       point? - A. No.

    Q. Players were on the pitch,   you hadtaken up your
       position, you have told me   how you felt it was, what
       happened then? - A. There was a kind of a surge.     It
       started getting tighter and tighter.     There was no room
       to manoeuvre.   I had Jon Paul in front of me and I was
       checking he was OK, obviously.    There was a surge and I
       ended up at Gate C, is it?

    Q. Well, it is not Gate C.   Gate C is the one youcame
       through.   There is a gate. - A. Well, I ended up about
       three or four feet opposite a gate.

       Which leads on to the pitch? - A, Which leads on to the
       pitch.

       That's gate 3. - A. Gate 3.    I was starting to be
       concerned because it was really tight.     There was no
       room to manoeuvre.    There was aPoliceman on the gate
       and I shouted to the Policeman, "I have got a child
       here", and could I get him out, but there was no
       response. As I say, it was getting tighter and tighter
       and I kept checking on Jon Paul and I passed out,
       apparently.   When I came to on the terracing I heard a
       Policeman say, "This one's still alive," and the
       Policeman dragged me out and put me on the pitch.




                Q. You have given a very graphic.




H
                                     R.   JO LLY




You have given a very graphic description and that is
helpful because it gives us an understanding, some sort
of understanding.

      When you were calling out to the Policemen:  "I
have got a child here" how many Policemen were there,
can you remember? - A. It is hard to remember, may be
two or three I suppose, you know.

Not an awful lot? - A. No.

Your recollection is not of a great number? - A. No, no.

You said there was no response? - A. As I say I was 3'
away and it was utter chaos and I shouted out to the
Policemen:  "I have got a child here* could I bring him
out of the gate?" you know.

Did you hear any other shouts coming from around you?
- A. Well I suppose so, yes.

But did you hear them? - A. Oh yes I heard them, sure.

Were you able to distinguish what people were saying?
- A. No, not really no, but I was more interested in
John Paul, you know.

Can   you remember, you have told me about the Policemen,
you   have told me that the players were on the field.
Can   you remember whether there was any match in play
yet   by this point or don't you know? - A. Sorry?

When you were shouting to the Police Officer. You are
looking at John. You said:   "I have got a boy here,
a child”. You were shouting at the Police Officer.
Had the match kicked off yet? - A. Oh I think it had
kicked off, yes.

You are sure about that? - A. Yes.

Was the gate open or shut? - A. Shut I think.

Did you see the gate open at all? - A. May be once or
twice but as I say I was more interested in the child,
you know.  I think there was people going through
may be one at a time and it would be shut again then
and it may be opened again.

Be careful because I want you to tell me what you your­
self saw.  I want to start this question again because
I want to be sure to get the right answers, not the
right answers but the truthful answers as far as you
are able to. There is no right answer to this? - A.
Well I think there was people being allowed through the
gate.
                                  R.   JO LLY




So you actually saw it open? - A. Yes.

Did you actually see it open and if so who opened it?
- A . No, I can't answer that one, I am sorry.

How close to the gate were you? - A. I was 3'.   I was
at the gate 3' away.

But are you then saying there were people ahead of you
who were getting out through the gate? - A. I have no
idea. I have no idea where they were coming from.

But there were people who you could see who would getting
out through the gate? - A. Yes.

What was hindering you, I know that sounds a bit stupid ..
A. Well obviously it was people in front of me but you
see I could not move.  It was really packed, you know.
There was no room to manoeuvre.  I ended up with an arm
up here somewhere apparently.

You see I can't reconcile what you have just told me
with your earlier account when you said that you called
to the Policeman and he just stood and he did not respond
because somebody was responding to something, weren't
they? - A. Yes, but you see if I was 3 or 4' away from
the gate a Policeman is going to take no notice of me
because may be he can't hear me, you know, but the people
that were directly in front of the gate obviously they
are going to try and go through aren't they? I was 3 or 4
away from it, you know.

Did you see who was opening the gate at all? - A. I didn't
no. I shouted to the Policeman:   "Will you please let
me through, I have got a kid here?" and there was no
response.

But would I be right in saying, I am not trying to catch
you out, that if this Police Officer had responded, let
us imagine for a minute that he had, in what way could
he have got you out? - A. I have no idea.

But what I think you have said to me is that the gate
was being opened and possibly shut, people were getting
out but you could not get at it. Is that right? - A.
I suppose so, yes.

That is what you have said, isn't it? - A. Yes, but
you expect some reaction when you shout someone to try
and help someone, you know, a Policeman whatever.

I quite understand that. Nobody is saying you should
not have done that. You have mentioned that you saw it
open. Did you actually see it closed as well? - A. Yes,
the Policeman closed it I think.
                                   R. JOLLY




Did you see it open again? - A. I don't know.

Because you lost consciousness yourself? - A. Yes.

You have told me that the match    was alreadyin play so
you must have been conscious at    thatpoint. Is that
correct? - A. Yes.

Or have you reconstructed it after? - A. Oh no, no, the
match was in progress then, you know.

I see. Then of course we know that poor old little John
lost his life and I am very sorry? - A. He did.

Do you have anything to do with the family?     Do you still
see them? - A. Oh yes, yes, sure.

Will you tell them when you see   themthat Ispeak on my
own and everybody  else's behalf to say how sorry we
are? - A. Will do.

      THE CORONER:    Mr. Payne?


              Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

When you were shouting to the Policeman and some people
ahead of you were going out through the gate, what do
you mean by saying it was "utter chaos"? - A. Well you
had no room to manoeuvre. You were jammed solid.   I
mean if I put an arm up like this there was no way I
could put my arm down again there was that many people
there.

Was there any noise? - A. I should imagine so, yes, but
the child was in front of me.  I was trying to protect
him, but as I say you were jammed solid. You could not
turn round, you know.

Quite, you were concentrating on John? - A. Yes.

      MR. PAYNE:     Thank you.


             Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

All this happened fairly quickly, Mr. Jolly, after
getting on to the terrace? - A. Yes.

And up to then you had no premonition at all of the
sort of horrible problem that you would face down at
the bottom? - A. No, none whatsoever.
                               '   R.   JOLLY




No real problem getting through the tunnel? - A. It was
quite easy for me, you know.

No real problem getting through the beginning of the
crowd at the terrace? - A. It was quite comfortable.
That was my opinion.

Guiding the laddie in front of you? No problem getting
down to a position on the terrace? - A. No, obviously
there was people there you had to squeeze through but
I would not say it was all that packed.

Quite comfortable, as you have described it? - A. Yes.

      MR. MANNING:   Thank you very much.


              Cross-Examined by MR. KING;

Mr. Jolly, can I just see if you have got your recollection
right when you end up near that gate? - A. Yes, I remember
that gate man.

You ended up 3 or 4' opposite Gate 3. Your first evidence
to the learned Coroner was that your impression was at
that stage that Gate 3 was shut. That is your recollection
- A. Yes.

Then you tell us that you saw that gate open once or
twice; people were getting through one at a time and then
the gate would be shut again? - A. Yes.

And that is your impression and recollection? - A. Yes.

And at that time when people were getting through and
then it be shut again you were in such a position that
you could not move because you had no room to manoeuvre
and you have described very graphically how jammed in you
were. That is right? - A. As I said before I was like
this. There was no way I could move, you know. Obviously
I could turn my head but not my actual body.

That was obviously true of everyone around you? - A. And
if you went down on the floor you would not have a chance,
I tell you.

That was obviously true of everyone around you who you
could see? - A. Yes.

And at this time you were also conscious of the fact that
the gate was being shut after people had been allowed
through? - A. Yes.

And shut by Police Officers? - A. Yes, there was a
Policeman on the gate there, you know.

                                           R.   JO LLY




Q. And you saw him shut it? - A. Yes.

Q. Thank you. - A. I went to the game the year before and
   I arrived there at more or less the same time and the
   game the year before was just totally organised. The
   Police were really good, you know. I went the same
   system in a mini-bus and your mini-bus passed through a
   Police cordon. You were parked up. If you did not have
   a ticket you weren't allowed in the vicinity of the ground
   and the organisation the year before you could not compare
   it with last year.

Q. What was the major difference which you noticed? - A. The
   organisation was fantastic.

Q. What was missing in 1989 which had been present in 1988?
   - A. The Police presence. There was no one checking
   tickets.  If you did not have a ticket you weren't allowed
   in the vicinity of the ground.

Q. That was in 1988? - A. 1988 sorry, yes.

Q. And how far could you get to the ground in 1988 before
   you were stopped? - A. Well people were just walking up
   with no tickets, you know.

Q. That was in 1989? - A. Yes.

Q.   In 1988 where was the process ....   A. At the ground
     they were moving them away, the Police were.

Q. You say in 1988 you witnessed some sort of system for
   checking people for tickets before they got to the ground?
   - A. Exactly.

Q. But that system did not operate in1989? - A. No way.

           MR. KING:   I see, thank you.


                       Further by The Coroner:

Q. Let me just ask a couple of questions out of that and
   then I will come to you.

           What time did you arrive in 1988? - A. I would
     probably say round about the same time, I suppose, but
     as we arrived the Police got a cordon outside Sheffield
     and they marked the bus with a sticker or an X, I don't
     know, and the Police would tell you where to park.

Q. What I am interested in is where you were checked for
   these tickets? - A. We were checked before we got to the
   ground on may be two or three occasions.
                                                         102


                                        R.    JO LLY




Q. As you walked along? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you have a ticket in 1988? - A. I had a ticket for
   the seating area.

Q. You say people weren't allowed anywhere near the ground
   if they did not have a ticket.  How many people did you
   actually see were turned away? - A. Quite a few people.

Q.   You did see them being turned away?     - A. Yes.

Q. What were they told? -A. They were told to move away
   because they did not have a ticket.

Q. I see. - A. As I say the year before ....

Q. That is what I am talking about, 1988? - A. The friend
   I went with took his son and where Iwas standing on
   the terracing in the last game that is where he was
   in the game before.

Q. Did he complain to you about it? - A. He said the
   organisation was amazing, incredible.  I totally agree
   with him, you know.

          THE CORONER:    Thank you.   Mrs. McBrien?


                 Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Jolly, after shouting to the Police:  "I have got
   a child here" you mentioned being unconscious. That is
   what I have written down here. How soon after you called
   out to the Police did you lose consciousness? - A. It
   must have been a couple of minutes I suppose, I don't
   know.

Q. And do you know what happened to you? Have you found
   out since what happened to you? - A. Well apparently I
   passed out. I was on the floor in the terracing and I
   heard a Policeman say:  "This one is alive" and he
   grabbed hold of me and he lifted me out of the terracing,
   obviously,and he put me on the grass.  I opened my eyes.
   I could see the blue sky, you know. Then somebody gave
   me a glass of water and I made it down to the corner of
   the opposite end where the first-aid people were and I
   went down there. Somebody checked me over and I was
   found to be okay. Then I went looking for John Paul then.

Q. Did you find him? - A. No, obviously not, you know.

          MRS. McBRIEN:    Right, thank you very much.

                             Further by THE CORONER;

          Q. Mr. Jolly, I want you to show us on this little plan
             where you took up your position when you came in, you
             said about halfway down I think you said? - A. Yes.
      B
          Q. Show us, mark it with a 1, put a little 1 against that
             cross and show us where you were in relation to that
             gate? - A. I was about 3 or 4' away.

          Q. Can you indicate on the plan where you would have been?
             That second position is very close to those dotted lines.
             You may not know what they are? - A. Yes.

          Q. Do you remember, and if you don't please do not guess,
             do you remember either seeing or hearing any barriers
             break, crash barriers? - A. No.

          Q. You don't recollect that? - A. Basically when I come
             round on the terracing I remember being one at the side
             there, crushed you know.

     MRS. PERKINS:    The plan, sir, is C.380.

     THE CORONER:     It is ten minutes to and   thereisno
way we can finish PC Packer today and I think it is too
tiring. It has been quite a long day. At least I feel
tired.

     MR. KING: Our productivity today, sir, has been quite
commendable generally and so I do not think anybody would
say we were doing any inefficient if we stop now.

     THE CORONER:    That is my impression as well. PC
Packer is probably here. Yes, I am sorry, we will postpone
you. Actually it is in everybody's interest. We will try
and give you another date. It is not likely        tobe
tomorrow, I do not think. You never know but I do not
think so. Ladies and gentlemen, we shall go home.
Tomorrow then at ten o'clock. Good night.   I will just
stay for a minute or two in case there is anything that
needs doing.

                 (The Jurv retired from Court1

     THE CORONER:   Tomorrow we have got listed Arthur
Butler, David Bownes, and we have Inspector Bullas as a
reserve.  I did mention by the way that one or two of the
witnesses I would be calling with limited objectives and
Inspector Bullas is one of these. He could tell us an
awful lot I have not doubt but I am interested in one
particular aspect of what he saw and so I am going to try
to address myself to that when he comes.

     MR. KING: We obviously know, sir, that Mr. Bownes'
evidence is related to the Safety Certificate because the
City Council are involved.  It is probably my ignorance,
sir, but I have not been able to trace to what issue Mr.
Butler speaks or the nature of his evidence.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Butler I think is called the
building surveyor. He formed, if you like, part and parcel
of the advisory group or the working party depending which
stage we are at. So far as I remember, his
responsibilities within that working group was on structure
and barriers. Mr. Bownes is an administrator after all and
Mr. Butler is somebody who I thought might be able to tell
us a little bit more.

     MR. KING:    Was he a member of the City Council, an
employee, sir?

     THE CORONER: I beg your pardon, yes. He works here
but I do not know which direction.   It is somewhere within
this building. He deals with building regulations and the
building side to do with safety in sports grounds.   I am
aware that Mr. Bownes gave evidence at Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry at great length in fact and I am also
aware that we could easily find ourselves spending two or
three days with these gentlemen if we so wished but whilst
I do not want to curtail the evidence unnecessarily I also
want us to keep in mind that we are really only looking at
a limited objective. We have got a limited objective and
so within reason I think I have got to be firm with
myself - I find that quite difficult - and you have got to
be firm with yourselves. I will have to be firm with you
as well if I disagree with you. Certainly what I want to
avoid is doing a total rerun of everything that Mr. Bownes
said. Mr. Butler did not give evidence before Lord Justice
Taylor but the same comments apply to him. I do not want a
total rerun of Lord Justice Taylor's questioning.   I do not
think we need it in the sense that it is public knowledge
and so it is not as if this particular matter has never
been aired and we have, therefore, got to use this
opportunity to air it. What we need to find out is whether
the activities, inactivities, or whatever it might be, of
the people associated with the Safety Certificates have any
bearing on how these 95 people came by their deaths and
                                                  106



what implications, if any, it has for any of the other
interested parties.  I think that would be the way that I
look at it. I hope I     have made myselfclear on that.

     I gave you an estimate yesterday about the length of
time and I do find it    a very difficult problem because I
have had another look    at my witnesses. We have still got
quite a few supporters. I think it is probably fair to say
they are not likely to say very much more. There may be a
few who have got nuances which are a little bit different
to what we have heard but judging by their statements I
anticipate that the evidence will be in line more or less
with what we have heard and you might, therefore, say to me
- and I will be interested to hear if you have any comments
- "Why don't you just chop them and let us not hear them?"
but a lot of these supporters are people whom I have in
mind to call and are people who are associated in some way
with some of the deceased.  I have not called somebody for
every single one of the 95 persons. That must be obvious
but there are quite a lot who have got connections. There
are some who are not connected but who are connected with
the barrier in the sense that they actually saw and heard
something.  If you like, they are new. So my inclination
is to call them even if it means a few more days because it
seems to me fair to do that and in the interests of balance
and justice. Is there anybody who would dissent from that
in any strong way? I know in the end it is my decision but
I am more than happy to listen to your views but I am glad
to see your response. I take it, Mr. King, you are not
dissenting, are you? Perhaps you are.

     MR. PAYNE: Sir, you invite comments. The only
general comment I think we would make is that where one
aspect of the case has by now been well established in
evidence so that it is quite clear what, in fact, happened
our submission would be that it is not necessary to call
any more witnesses to deal with what has already been
established. That is a broad submission. Without looking
at the particular witness statements we would not be able
to apply that to a particular case.

      THE CORONER:  You will know that to a certain extent
I have already done it because we have gone over, if you
like, the entry into the stadium in far lesser detail than
we did at the beginning and to a certain extent we know
that.

     MR. PAYNE:   Quite.

     THE CORONER:   I have referred to loads and loads of
people including loads of supporters but what I was saying
is that the descriptions of what was going on in the
terraces will to a certain extent be repetitious but it is
unavoidable if we are going to hear them because it is very
difficult to say, "Look, I don't want to     hear anything
apart from this minute variant on what we have already
heard" unless you coach the witness and tell him what to
say which I do not do and do not want to do. I may lead
him but that is another matter. You have got to give the
                                                   107


witness a chance to acclimatise himself to the situation in
which he finds himself.

     MR. KING: Sir, the gist of the instructions I have
just been handed shows the other side of the coin which my
learned friend has put forward to you and it shows the
dangers of the perception of the Inquest to those I
represent if, in fact, we do not do what I understand you
are going to   do, sir,  which     is to call as many witnessesa
you feel you   are able  because the instructions I have been
passed is really a query as to why isn't it that witnesses
are not being called for each and every one of the 95? In
many ways it is rhetorical question but one can understand
it because, of course, to those who have lost lovedones
each of the 95 is a separate entity.

     THE CORONER:   I have carefully thought about it and
taken a decision on it.

      MR. KING:   Of course, sir, I sun putting this to you,
to use my learned friend's phrase of not long ago,
redressing the balance. The danger of cutting it short on
the grounds,    "We have  heard        enough" may be clinically
possibly correct although I do not necessarily agree butit
does carry that grave danger that justice not will only be
seen ^to have been done but w o n 't have been seen to be done
and it is very important to those who are sitting behind
me, I know.

     Can I raise another matter, sir, and it is a sensitive
matter and really I am speaking to those behind through you
to them and I am as guilty of this as anybody? Sir, at
various stages of the Inquest, today for example , all of us
obtained light relief. We obtained light relief when, for
example, we had the microphone not working properly and 1,
2, 3 became A, B, C. We all laughed across the bench,
understandably so. I know there is a perception behind me
that that gives an impression that there is a
trivialisation of the deaths which have occurred. Of
course, I know that that has not been intended and I also
know that sometimes light relief for the advocates can be
very useful because you can then, in fact, concentrate your
brain a few moments later.  I mention that, sir, so that
those behind me know that I have taken it on board.   I do
not seek to lecture anyone along here because they could
point the finger at me as much as anybody in responding to
such light relief.  I mention that, sir, because you can
see what is happening me.  I cannot.




                               /THE CORONER
     THE CORONER:    I know, I realise that.  It depends
how it is done.   If we were laughing our heads off the
whole time I would entirely agree that we could be
accused of trivialising it. I think, in fact, it is a
good thing that we do have the occasional laugh when
something is said which strikes us as funny, not
because it means that we are denigrating anybody who
has died. We have been here for weeks and it is
necessary, if you like, for the relief of tension if
for no other reason, that one should laugh at an
appropriate matter.

     If we started laughing when somebody was
describing how somebody was dying, then I would take -an
exceedingly dim view of it, but nobody has made any
attempt to do that.   If we laugh, as you said today at
the "a, b, c", and I remember we laughed when one of
the witnesses was talking about a horse relieving
itself. That in a sense was quite funny and we did
laugh.  I don't see that that in any way reflects on
the deceased, and I think if that is the perception
then it is a mistake.

     I think I ought to say one other thing, because
there is a misconception, I think.  It is not you, Mr.
King, who has got the misconception, at least I don't
think it is, but you raised the point, why are we not
calling evidence for everyone of the 95? The answer,
of course, is that we have called evidence in respect
of each and every one of the 95 persons. We spent 2%
weeks doing it, and we took evidence in infinitely
greater detail than any other Coroner would have done
in this country, I think.

     I actually went and listened to some of the other
major disaster inquests.  I took the trouble to listen
to the way the evidence was taken in other major
disasters - big headline jobs - and if I tell you that
what we took 2% weeks over - no, if I get the ratio
right, what we took a week over, or eight or nine days
- you would have to do the arithmetic to work out the
exact number of days - they managed to do in two,
proportionally, you will that we did take evidence, and
what is more we took it in respect of each and every
one. The present phase of the inquest, as we all know,
is trying to deal with the question of how, and of
course at the end of the day it will be the sura total
of what has been the evidence which the Jury will be
considering, and that will include evidence in respect
of each and every one who we have dealt with.

     I know many of you weren't there but Mr. Catchpole
was there, Mrs. McBrien, Miss Addleman and Mr. Limb for
a good bit of the time as well, so I think it is
important that people should understand that. For some
of the people there is nothing to be said, because
there is nobody who can actually say anything which
moves the inquest forward.  I actually went through all
the 95 cases and I re-checked, as far as I was able,
all the statements I considered to be relevant, and
listed who I thought could possibly say something, then
I excluded some I didn't think I needed.

     Mr. King, that is not in any sense a criticism of
you, of course, but simply is an explanation because it
might help the people who instruct you.

     MR. KING:   Sir, it is helpful, and I emphasise,
again why I rose to my feet, to really redress the
balance of what my learned friend was saying, that it
is as difficult balance which you have to make, and I
can only repeat the observation again of perceptions
the whole time.

     THE CORONER:   Indeed, and I think Mr. Payne would
agree with you.

     Having said that, I now get to the point I really
wanted to make, and that is I think, it depends to a
certain extent how long we take tomorrow, but if we
assume for a moment, which is my objective, that we do
not exceed tomorrow with Mr. Bownes and Mr. Butler, we
have no supporters listed for tomorrow, but we do want
to start again on Thursday.  If we succeed then I think
by sometime next week - it is impossible to say exactly
which day - we will have finished with all the
supporter evidence, and also the bulk of the evidence,
the peripheral evidence from other people. That
actually only takes us to the end of this month, or the
1st February if you like.

     What will then be left will be a few hard
decisions which I have to take as to one or two people,
whether I want them or not, plus the people whose
conduct is being called into question, the principal
actors if you wish, plus a few people who were in the
Control Box - the junior staff, I mean, as opposed to
senior staff. So numerically we will be down to a
relatively small number but what I cannot at this stage
predict is the length of time we are going to take over
each individual principal actor, and that is why I said
end of February, because I just don't know.   If we take
two days over each it will go into March.   I don't want
to do that, that seems to me unnecessary and too long,
but if we take a lesser period then it may be, of
course, considerably shorter. We are bound to have
some witnesses in this category who will take a fair -
bit of time, it is unavoidable, but you will be able to
judge for yourself. You will be able to make some
guesses as we go along.  I am mentioning this simply as
an aid for you.  It is one thing to say we have got
another 100 witnesses,  it is another thing to say we
have got another 12 or 15 or whatever it might be -
yes, but they could be long.

     Does that help in any way? It is purely intended
to help you in your planning, and nothing else. Thank
you very much. We will start tomorrow at 10.

         (The Inquests were adjourned until
           10 a.m. the following morning)

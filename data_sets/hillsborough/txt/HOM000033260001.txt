     The Right H on. Jack Straw M P,
     Hom e Secretary,
     5 0 Q ueen A nne's Gate,

     Dear Mr. Straw,
     I am sure you will he aware of the cam paign hy the families of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster
     in 1 9 8 9 to re-open the inquest into the deaths.
     I have only been actively involved with this for the last six m onths, h u t have already learned enough to
     convince me th a t the verdict of 'accidental death' in 1991 was a travesty, and an insult no t only to the
     memories of the victims, hut also to the reputation of British justice.
     I always assumed th a t the families knew who I was, hut did n o t want to talk to me (I was a volunteer at
     the hospital, and involved solely in resuscitation attem pts on the first twelve or so victims.) In January,
     I found out th at I was spoken of at the inquests as an 'unidentified doctor', and th a t several families had
     te e n trying to trace me for eight years. I was m ost certainly n o t unidentified, and have docum entary
     proof of this.
    I have met several families, including the H am m onds, whose 14-year-old son was the first I tried to save
    on the day, the Hicks who lost their two daughters, and Eddie Spearitt, whose son A dam I also tried to
    save. Mr. Spearitt is trying to find o u t n o t only exactly what happened to his son, hut what happened to
    him over a tw o-hour period before he appears at the hospital.
    H illsborough was not a jet aircraft blasted o u t of the sky. N or was it an express train careering off the
    tracks, or a m adman loose with automatic weapons. It was a football match. It was a F .A . cup semi-final,
    with policing, stewarding, crowd control, and video surveillance, which took place in the middle of a major
    English city on a sunny spring afternoon.
    It is inconceivable to me th a t 9 6 deaths under such conditions could be 'accidental'. W hat I have heard
    and seen over the last six m onths has affirmed this. There is a huge mass of 'new' evidence, which is not
    in fact new, but was simply never presented at the inquest.
    I would urge you to consider this evidence, and its im plications in term s of the inquest verdict. N othing,
    of course, will bring back the victims. N o-one believes it will. B ut the least we owe them is the tru th .



    Yours sincerely,




    D r. E d Walker

             Final at H i l l sborough,            Sheffield.

              I was shown on the order as being                      in Serial            under the         command of

             PS    1829 France.           Our serial       comprised al m o s t totally E G r o u p officers

              frorn Mai n Street.             Tra n s p o r t was   laid on at R o t h e r h a m a n d we            were

              t aken to H i l l s b o r o u g h arriv i n g at about 9.15am.                  We went       into the

              N o r t h S t a n d for    briefing w h i c h star t e d at about             10am.       For a start

              the m i c r o p h o n e   system was next to useless and                   I and others           round me

              could hear very            little of what was a c t u a l l y said.                We kept as k i n g              the

              senior officers            to speak up,        but still       only heard 2 w ords              in 4.         This

              lead to a bit of            c o nfusion among         officers      in the stand an d match

              orders had to be checked to see exac t l y what we were s u p p o s e d to do.

              We then had our snack of                 crisps,      etc,   an d went out on patrol                  shortly

             afterwards.           Our    serial,       together w i t h Serial 37, were depu t e d to go

              by train to the ground.                 We a r r i v e d at about        11am at the station,                      and

              all went onto the               platform out of the way.               We were told shor t l y

              afterwards        by C hief      Inspector P u r d y that this was not a l l o w e d and so

we had to go an d stand about                   in the s i d e r o a d next      to the s t a t i o n from

11am,      until        the t rain arrived.          I was     sur p r i s e d to find that only           1

t rain was         due an d that was s c h e d u l e d for £.0£pm.               This meant        that 22

officers were             standing aro u n d killing           time for 3 hours           doing

a b s o l u t e l y nothing.

Wh i l s t at our         point awaiting        the train,         I spoke to several          supporters

mo s t l y from Liv e r p o o l who were w a l k i n g a w a y from the ground.                     They

b as i c a l l y w o u l d not turn a r o u n d w h e n asked,         and contipued up Hali f a x

Road.

Nu m e r o u s    of these       had cans of beer w i t h tpmm a l t h o u g h to b e g i n w ith

they did not app e a r             drunk.     I also      spoke    to several       people who were

w i t h family who w a n t e d food and d irections                  to the ground.            One family

consisted of 2 me n a n d a y oung boy.                      The   b o y ’s father     had a home made

stand for his son to use                   inside the ground but shortly before                     I had

heard a mess a g e            stating that milk        crates were          to be banned       in the

ground.           As this stand had o b v i o u s l y had some              care taken      into    its

construction.                I a d v i s e d the father    to return it to the             car to a void

loosing          it.    This     he did.     As he was       doing    this,     I was talking        to his

son and the other man who were                    both eating         chips and fish.             I asked

if I     could have one,            and then we spent           the next       10 minu t e s   eating

these and having a good                  laugh.      On the fathers          return,      I gave them

directions             to the Liverpool       end of the ground where               they had tickets.

B y now,         due to the hot weather,             I was     beginning           feel   very hot,        but

no drinks were a v a i l a b l e           nearby.                     /

The    influx of suppo r t e r s           both on foot a n d / i n vehicles was g r a d u a l l y

increasing,            and    it was   n o ticeable    t h a ^/lots of the         p edestrians      had

w i t h them 4 packs of beer etc, a n d iv(/ne noise                       level was      increasing.

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall    a r r i v e d at our    location some time a r o u n d            1pm,

and spoke to us.                As he was at our          location,        a radio m e s s a g e was

received that a g roup of s u pporters were                         causing     problems at the           rear

 of Halfords Store          o n , Kilner Way.          Mr.    Marshall       and several        of our

 serials went up Jtro the              location,     and    I saw the G a t e w a y S u p e r m a r k e t

 I remember had what a p p e a r e d to be a pack of/i2 cans or bottles                                of

 beer/lager       in a g reen         covering a nd he was alre a d y drinking                one of

 these as he       left the store.            The    prob l e m outside H a l f o r d s was sorted

a short time        later,     and we       returned to the station.                 I was sur p r i s e d

 to see so many youths                etc sat on the g r a s s e d a rea outside Halfords

 drinking.        The grass was          covered in cans a n d bottles as we wa l k e d

 thro u g h the    crowd.      A short time          later,     at about 2pm,         the train

arrived,        an d we   lined up by the steps as the fans got off.                            Mounted

 officers       had by this       time arrived,         an d we stopped the fans until all

were    off     the s t a t i o n an d in a large       but mana g e a b l e     group.       I together

w i t h several      other officers s e a r c h e d        random fans as they            left the

 station,     an d this was           received w i t h a good deal           of fun an d a m u sement

 by the supporters.

The     procession then set off an d I f ound myself                       in a good n a t u r e d bit

 of banter w i t h several             of the s u p p o r t e r s who seemed to think            the
                                                 \
whole     thing was a huge joke.                 No n a styness at all.

 I must    say now that         up to this        point     I thought      e v erything was going

 quite well and we          seemed to be w i n n i n g         over the suppo r t e r s         we were

 talking      to by having a laugh and a joke a n d it seemed to be                             paying

 off.

 The s upporters were           taken to the gro u n d without               incident an d taken to

 the turnstiles.           I found that traffic was                still     running along

 Le p p i n g s Lane w h i c h seemed daft as          it was only adding             to the

 congestion.        At the elbow of the              road    right outside         the ground,         the

 s i t u a t i o n was so bad that         I went    into the       road a n d began to work

 traffic and       pede s t r i a n    control    off my own bat,          because      people were
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    R360

milling       e verywhere an d someone was              going    to get hurt before m u c h

longer.        Buses were          trying to plough thro u g h and the s i t u a t i o n was

tense.

I sorted out the                initial    problem a n d went     back onto the f o o t p a t h on

the opposite          side of the          road from the ground where           I saw dozens of

people just hanging                round drinking and sitting on the wall.                     These

w o u l d not move        towards        the ground w h e n asked.       In other words we were

wasting       our time talking             to them.     It also    became a p p a r e n t    that    lots

of people antd I m e a n               lots were    looking    for tickets.       I was a sked

myself,       and anyone who was sat on the wall                   or standing       nearby,        was

a sked about tickets.

The     crowd outside            the ground was       now growing     to such an extent             that

it was beginning                to swell    onto the    roadway from the forecourt.

I d e c i d e r to go          in among    them and see what       the   problem was         because

the^e a p p e a r e d to be no recognized queues.                   PC 2547 R a m s d e n f r o w

S erial     37 went w i t h me,           and we went    into the     centre of the          crowd.        We

w ere   i mmediately swam p e d by people w a n t i n g to know w here to go.                         They

had tickets,           but      could still     not find out where        to go.       This    raised a

point as far as                I was    concerned    in that the signs above           the

t u rnstiles were              found to be tota l l y inadequate.          They are         too small

for     people to read until               they are    10 yards away from the t u rnstiles

and by that time                if they found they were          in the wrong      s e c t i o n of the

crowd,      they f aced an almost             impossible       task to swop to ano t h e r          part

of the      crowd where           they should have       been.

The tickets were                coloured,    so w hy the hell      not   put up very         large

signs m e a suring             10 feet x 5 feet,       or s o mething similar,         w i t h arrows

pointing down to the turnstiles                      painted    in the same     colours as the

tickets.

This w ould have stop p e d all               or most    of the     problems w i t h    people

wa n d e r i n g a r o u n d    causing    problems m e r e l y by their     presence.

It was as      I was d i r e c t i n g    people    that a young        lad came up to me and

asked    if I could help get his fri e n d into the ground.                          His   friend and

he had tickets          for the N o r t h S t a n d an d his friend was             in a wheelchair.

I pushed my way thro u g h the              crowd a s s i s t e d by anot h e r    officer who         I

think was PC 2 4 0 3 M o r t o n and made a path through the                      crowd through

w h i c h the 2 lads      passed.         I then banged on the c o ncertina style gate

a n d 2 stewards        opened this up and the boys were admitted.                         The gate

was then shut.

As    I made my way back to the forecourt,                     I was    confronted by a ma n of                     J



a bout 3 5 - 4 0   who was       nearly hysterical.             He was a c c o m p a n i e d by a

w o m a n and an older gentleman,             a n d they had tickets            for the N orth

Stand.      He began shouting about                how crushed he was and how badly

o r g a n i s e d things were,     and g e n e r a l l y how he was a p p a u l e d by the

whole situation.           He    insisted that           I open the c o ncertina gate a g a i n

to admit     everyone w ith a N orth S t a n d ticket and to stop the                       crush.          I

e x p lained to him that this was               not      possible      at that time.       Wit h this

he became very a g g i t a t e d and         I informed him            that   if he felt so

s t r o n g l y about   the s i t u a t i o n that he should write            to the FA,      the

football      club an d the Chief C o n s t a b l e         on his     return     home to make his

feelings known.           This    he said he w o u l d do.             He then s t o r m e d off    back

to the queues a n d the           lady with him a s k e d me to forgive               him as he was

upset by everything.              I spoke     to the       lady for about 2 minu t e s and she

t hen left me thanking me for my help.

The    crush for the 5 N o r t h S tand t u r n s t i l e s was by now getting very

bad.     I went and took up a position a g a i n s t                 the wall     of the sweet

s hop where the forecourt                of the ground joins           it.    My back was      to the

wall and the        crowd were       pressing       up to me,       passing from       right to left

in front of me.           On several        occasions       I had to speak to young men who

were just      pushing      into the backs          of    people and surging a n d being

b loody daft.

I d o n ’t know what         time    it was      by now,    some time betw e e n 2 . 3 0 p m a n d

3 . 0 0 p m I realised that things were               getting totally out of hand.                    Where

I ware I was having           to pull young         lads a n d their fathers          out of the

crush due to the y o u n g s t e r s        being    crushed and feeling         faint.         One

young    lad I had to literally               put m y foot       into the    crowd to force a

 pace before         pulling      the    lad out w i t h one arm and holding him to me

             he   came   round.     His father       pushed his way out also,             and then I

 ot them out of the            crush and onto the f o o tpath outside                 the shop.

             saw grown m en       coming out of the            crush pale faced a n d one          in

              ar was     saying     "Fucking mad.          I've had enough of that.               They're

fucking mad."            He stood beside me until               he   regained a bit of his

colour and got his breath back before                       going out of the f o recourt and

out onto L e p p i n g s Lane       to wait for the            crush to stop.I       can remember a

lady of about 50 wearing a fawn o v e rcoat who was                         crying due to being

crushed.          She was    crushed with her head facing me and could not even

tur n her head forwards             due to the       pressure she was under.              She     shouted

to me    "Help me,        I'm going to faint."              I pushed      into the    crowd and

got hold of her           coat by the front and the                  left shoulder an d      pulled her

towards me t h r o u g h the        crowd.       Once my back was          to the sweet shop

wall    I pulled the w o m a n to me as she had                  lost nearly all       her    colour and

h eld her to me w ith my arms a r o u n d her                  until    she regained a bit of

composure.I         then stood her beside me to my right so that her back was

a g a i n s t the shop wall. I don't know what happened to her then                             as        I was

getting       crushed myself            by this    time,    as   the crowd swelled and became

intent on forcing a way through to the turnstiles.                             I looked a r o u n d me

^at this time an d          I saw       Supt. Marshall         stood on a brick wall         to       my right

next to the         river.     He       was talking        into his radio and        I caught         a

mess a g e    through my      radio about         opening a gate before a " c a t astrophe"

happens.          I do not know         if Mr.   M a r shall    was the person who used this

phrase however.

F r o m what    I could see the s i t u a t i o n was         chaotic all a r o u n d the area.

Pe o p l e were    pushing,         chanting,    singing and the           position was useless

from a control             point of view.       Young me n were a c t u a l l y      climbing over

the wall a bove            the West S t a n d seating      turnstiles and          into the ground

By now people were getting hysterical                      a r o u n d me both male an d female

an d begging for help.                I decided that someone was              going to get

s e r i o u s l y hurt     in the    crush before m u c h     longer,      and there was         nothing

anyone     could do to stop trouble happening.                        (By trouble      I mea n

someone     being        crushed.)      The s i t u a t i o n was    literally out of       control.

I m4de a d e c i s i o n to seek advice             regarding opening          the   concertina

foor leading to the N o r t h stand to a l l o w people to just rush through

the    larger opening,          and possibly save          life as that's how bad              I

thought      it was.         I tried 3 times on my           radio to contact gr o u n d

control      but   received no answer.              I then tried to contact Supt.

Marshall       via t a l k - t h r o u g h 3 further    times       to ask his     permi s s i o n to

ope n the gate.             I a g a i n received no reply.            I then pushed my way

through the forecourt                of the gr o u n d and across          to where M r . Marshall

was.      I then spoke         to him,     told him a bout          the   crush,   and a sked

p e rmission to open the              concertina     gate.      He said "Yes go on Gary."                  I

then pushed my w a y back through the                   crowd to the gate a nd            banged on

it.     The s t e wards a p p e a r e d at the w i n d o w s a n d told them to o p e n the

gate up and        let the       crowd in before        someone was killed.             This       they

did after       I had       repeated myself.

Im m e d i a t e l y the    crowd surged forw a r d to this gate and went                  through.

The presure        eased w i t h i n 30 seconds,          but still        people were     pushing

an d   I admit     that      I took hold of 2 young           idiots of about          17-18 years

who were just            going w ild to get       in knocking         people everywhere.

The whole m e n t a l i t y seemed to be not to miss the kick off at any

price.       It was        frightening.       I b o l l o c k e d the 2 lads an d then let them

go.     To be quite honest             I was sweating        like a dog and was           p h ysically

        tired due to all             the    pushing,       shoving,    etc.      plus the w a r m weat h e r an d

        having     to wear tunics             in hot weather.          I was sha t t e r e d to be frank.

        I was wi p i n g my s e l f        down with m y h a n d k e r c h i e f as    I heard a radio

        m e s s a g e to the effect          that all       officers were to go onto the               perimeter

        at the L e p p i n g s Lane         end.     I ran into the ground by the               gate   I ’d just

        ope n e d and then under             the N o r t h Stand.       I ran up thro u g h the first

        gangway a n d        into the stand          itself.      I saw the Liverpool           players

        trooping      off the        pitch on the other side of the ground from me and

        then I saw the L e p p i n g s Lane Terr a c e             (from now on called the L.L.T.)

        T here were         people all       over    it,    bobbies an d        civilians.     I ran down the

        steps,     over the wall,            over the a d v e r t i s i n g hoardings a nd onto the

        pitch.      I ran to the fence and stood on the wall.                            The first thing

        that struck me was             the noise,          a mixture    of squeals and shouts.              Next

        the smell.           You    could smell       beer strongly.             I saw how crushed things

        w ^ r e / i n the    pen and my first          instinct was            to climb up the fence and

        jm np into the         pen to help,          but as    X b e g a n climbing up I realised that

        I *d land on someone               inside and hurt        them,    so I stopped where          I was

        an d tried to kick,            pull and tug the fence down.                    I even threw myself

w   \   at     it shoulder         to wire to try a n d knock           it down but of course nothing

        happened.           People were s c r eaming          for help only         18 inches a w a y on the

        other side of the             line but I c o u l d n ’t do a bloody thing.                T hen bodies

        an d    injured      came over the top and the first                     person I saw was shaken

        and totally out of breath.                    I laid him down on the              pitch and asked

        him what hurt etc,             but he was only shaken up.                   I o b t a i n e d his details

        as A n t h o n y Lei q h ,          years,                        I,           } Liverpool.        I ’m

        not sure but he             could have hurt his           right ankle.          I helped to get him

        over to the a d v e r t i s i n g hoardings at the N orth S t a n d side of the

        pitch and       left him there with his mate or a man who said h e ’d help                                I

        c a n ’t remember which.

        I then turned back to the stand LLT an d                        it was awful.          I w alked

towards    it and       I saw a limp figure          passed over the fence.                I got this

body onto the       pitch and began m o u t h to m outh and                 cardiac m a s s a g e with

a young    girl    from the St.      Johns A m b ul a n c e who seemed t o t a l l y shocked

but did a good job.            A ma n in a L i verpool            shirt then came to me and

he had a green stretcher.             He a s k e d    if it was any use and               I said

"yes'.     We    loaded this young m a n onto the stretcher and then we                            ran

the    length of the       pitch as fast as we             could to the First Aid Post at

the back of the stand but whe n we got there                        a nurse told us he was

dead and to take him into the gym.                    This we       did.     I then went       back      to

the LLT and we fetched out 2 people,                      a ma n and a young         lad who were

injured but alright.            These we dumped at the First Aid R o o m and                       ran

back.     I realised at this         point that           I'd lost my helmet.            F u n n y how

yo u think of things           like that at such a time.

Me and the Liverpool           lad were    running         back to the LLT w i t h the

s tretcher a g a i n w h e n   I saw 4 lads      carrying another             lad on a board.

T h e y were    "Help us."       I saw that    the        lad on the board was            blue   in the

face and his eyes were            half open.         He    looked about       18-19.       I said

"Come on I'll       show you where        to go."          I then grabbed part of the board

they were       carrying and we      ran to the First Aid Room.

A ma n looked at the y o u t h and said "Sorry                    it's too    late",       and m oved

on.     I knew w here      to take the body but the board w o u l d n ' t                 go through

the door,       so I picked the body up in my arms and                      carried     it into the

gym and    laid him down.         No one seemed to know what was                     happening and

so    I ran back out and back towards                the LLT.

The next       person    I helped was a young w o m a n who was tota l l y shaken and

I sat her down at the            pitch side.

I'd stopped getting details as things were well                            out of    control     by now

and names and a d d r e s s e s were the       last things on my mind.

One thing that          I do remember was      that t hroughout all              the    chaos and

shit,    only one gaffer was         (as far as           I was    concerned)       doing a n y t h i n g
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     R 3 60

and that was Chief Supt.              Nesbit and he was doing a b r illiant                    job.           He

was    everywhere at once.            Fantastic.

I then ran to help a bobby who was                     strug g l i n g w ith a s t retcher and

found     it to be PS Turner          (late of C1 D i v i s i o n and n ewly promoted).                        I

h elped him to take another              body to the gym where we               laid him out

b efore    running an d back to the LLT.

It seemed that        by now more        dead than alive were being                carried to the

gym from the LLT.            E v e r y time    I went    there     someone w a n t e d a hand w ith

a stretcher        or board to carry,          on the main,         a mate     to the F irst Aid

Room,     and    I took anot h e r 3 bodies        into the gym in a short                 space of

time.      The gym was to put          it blun t l y     'fucking awful'         and    I'll        never

forget the sight          of the bodies dumped all                over.     I'm just       glad      I didn

get stuck w i t h staying w i t h a body               in the gym t h a t ’s all.

When    I went     back    onto the    pitch a g a i n    I saw     a ma n    who a p p e a r e d    to be

a doctor        going from body to body.               This was     on the pitch at the Hop

end of the ground where             the bodies         had been carried by friends                   etc.

I gave m o u t h to m o u t h on a man who the doctor                  thought     he    could save

but to no avail.            He had been carrying            out    cardiac m a s s a g e    on the

same man.         We then went to anot h e r m a n and             swopped roles.           B oth died

and were        taken a w a y by friends        etc.    to the gym.

By now I was feeling            rough.        I'd carried dead,           wo r k e d on dead and

felt    shocking.         I was sweating and tota l l y shattered.                   M y shoulders

were    burning and        I felt   sick.       I just    felt useless         to be quite honest

I've never w o r k e d as hard in my             life and got nothing out of it,                      that'

what made        it worse.

B y now the worst was over and                 I went    back towards        the L L T and began

to console        people on the       pitch who were         crying etc.         One     lad just

passed out        in m y arms as we sat talking.                  H e ’d lost his mate         in the

crowd and        couldn't    find him.         I brought     him    round     and gave      him a

drink and he came to and went away.

            We event u a l l y   left the   pitch w h e n all   the supporters had gone and wer

            told to sit      in the stand.

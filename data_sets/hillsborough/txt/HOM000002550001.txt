         HILLSBOROUGH - COMPLAINT BY MR HICKS

         I forward herewith, in the strictest confidence, a copy of a statement
         of complaint made by Mr Hicks alleging collusion between Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield and Mr Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable,
         South Yorkshire Police.  The contents of the statement are self
         explanatory.

         In view of the implications of the complaint for Lord Justice Taylor's
         preliminary oral hearings I felt that you ought to know of its existence.

         South Yorkshire Police are likely to register the complaint against
         Mr Duckenfield and will invite Mr Geoffrey Dear to carry out the
         investigation, which I will undertake on his behalf.  As far as
         Mr Jackson is concerned the regulations require that allegation to be
         put before the South Yorkshire Police Authority for a decision to be
         made as to whether it is construed as a complaint and to appoint an
         Investigating Officer.  I understand that South Yorkshire Police
         Authority will not meet until 5 January 1990 when the allegation against
         Mr Jackson will be considered.

         I will keep you informed of developments, but you and Lord Justice Taylor
         may have some comment to make on this matter.

            overall          result          being       the       maligning             of    Liverpool            supporters             in    the

            The    evidence             to    support             this    c o m p l a i nt      is      contai ned         within          the

            transcripts             of       evidence             given       by    C/Superintendent                  DUCKENFIELD                to

            question          whether             Assistant          Chief          Constable            JACKSON        was      unaware             of    the

            real       circumstances                relating             to    the       opening         of    the    gate,        as      1 can          see

            no    reason          why    C/Superintendent                      DUCKENFIELD               would       not    have        told         him       the

            truth.           In    other          words       I    consider             that    there         may    have     been         collusion

            between          the    two       of f i ce rs         concerning                 th i s    po :i.nt     and    I would          wi s h       this

            personally             have       no    hard          evidence          at    this       time      I wish       this        matter            to    be

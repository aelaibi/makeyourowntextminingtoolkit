    Dr S Popper
    HM Coroner
    Medical Legal Centre
   ^Watery Street
    SHEFFIELD




    Further to our telephone conversation of yesterday evening, I have pleasure
    in enclosing a copy of the video tape compilation for your personal use and
    retention.   Should you require more copies in the future please do not
    hesitate to contact me.

    My Chief Constable, Geoffrey Dear, mentioned last night to Lord Justice
    Taylor the question of the Coroner's Inquiry which I, with my officers, are
    completing on your behalf. The suggestion was put forward that we may be
Jtjkable to complete the full inquiry for you, hopefully by the Autumn, but
    long before that we would indicate to you when we would be ready so that
    you could discuss with Lord Justice Taylor the timing of the Inquest. I
    will keep you informed of the progress of the enquiries.

       With best wishes.




        ENC


                                                    SHEFFIELD OFFICE
        PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
FILS NOTE DATED 19.7.89.
LONG MEETING WITH MERVYM JONES BE HILLSBOROUGH.


We agreed that he would let me have a copy of his notes which
would be really a list of the points which we had discussed.
This is so that I don’t have to duplicate the recording
of the meeting.
Perhaps the most important thing we discussed was the involvement
of the D.P.P.     He will be getting in touch with him and
I said that it might be a good idea if we both met him so
that we can try and sort out the D.P.P's involvement
and the effect if any on the Inquest.
I also spoke to him about the ACC's report and discussed the
fact that it might be abvisable to get a bit more work done
to try and sort out the figures before and after the opening
of the gates and also to have a look at the loading, if
that's the right word, of Ffea 2 which appears to have been around
the Green Guide figure, but which was being described by virtually
everyone as pretty empty.
We   discussed Fiance for a little while.   I explained that if
we were to hand out anystatements of people whose evidence
was admitted for documentary purposes, then we would normally
expect to make a charge, and that I agreed in the present
circumstances, and for the time being to waive my charge in
favour of Sheffield City Council.
Mervyn wanted to know whether I refunded any costs to the
South Yorkshire Police Authority in connection with either the
officers who are permanently employed, or other investigations.
I explained to him that we never made any payment whatsoever,
but that this was provided for us by the Police Authority as required,
on a Free of Charge basis.
He mentioned that he had had a letter from their solicitors to the
effect that he should not be acting for the Coroner and making some
illusion that the Coroner might hsve to pay the bill.        This was not
Mervyn's understanding of the situation, and he wanted me to confirm
that in the past and indeed currently that police involvement in Coronal
work was not debited to the Coroner's Service.
FILE NOTE.          — -
BATED J&k-Jwlv 1989.      C


MEETING WITH MERVYN JONES, NICK FOSTER, MALCOLM ROSS.
THE MEETING WAS FILMED BY THE B.B.G. FOR DOCUMENTARY
WHICH THEY INTEND TO SHOW AFTER THE INQUEST WHEN THE
INQUIRIES ARE C O M P L E T E D . _________________________


We discussed the present state of play, in particular Nick
Foster pointed out that they were making reasonable progress
with the identification of individuals.           He produced
some plans showing that everything up to 75 had been identified
either alive or dead or both at various positions on the
terraces and in the ground.

It is clear from the plan that there was a certain amount
of clustering around the broken barrier.

Nick Foster pointed out that one case No.80 was clearly
identified as alive aaS apparently well at about 5 past 3
and gret subsequently, he was found to be dead.          This of
course is well outside the time when Gate C was opened.

Although it had not yet been established, it appeared that
there was a surge diagonally across Pen 3 from the opposite
corner tj^the tunnel entrance.           They were still working
on this/was obviously a very interesting observation if
in fact it could be established but it might explain
the reason why somebody like Case 80 might have died
         from his position he might have been caught by
such a surge.

Nick Foster also reported that of the number dead, about 20%
had actually come in to the ground when Gate C was opened.
This again is very interesting because if the Pens were
packed solid prior to a surge, well even if they were not
packed completely solid, it's difficult to see how these
people who must by definition have come in from the back,
manage to get through.        It might be that this was due to
a sort of wedge effect.

The Health & Safety Executive had completed the report,
copy of which was han&edkta me.          This was being dose for
the Inquiry.

We discussed the question of alcohol and the possible effect
                                 LcA*7
that this might have nad.       I' pointed out that a large number
of public houses had now been identified, in which at least
a 100 supporters had been present prior to the match.        There
wer$ of course many other     pubs where supporters were not
in such large numbers.     In addition, off-licences had sold
alcohol.    Gateway I think or one of the Supermarkets nearby
had sold £1*300 in less than an hour.

There was some reference made to the crush at the outer gates.
This needs some further illucidation.

Lord Justice Taylor's inquiryeis now scheduled to end in
the first week or so of July.     Apparently Dr. Ashton has given
evidence at the inquiry.    He was the gentleman who rang up
and wanted to be heard without fail, either there or at the
Inquests.

Work was progressing on the individual cases.       Flow eharts were
being prepared.    The intention being that they should chase
the individual from leaving home to the point of death.        We
discuseedi the-sdfortoat-rand in particular the central time core,
should it possibly be identical over the crucial period, so
that one could compare different charts directly.

 We discussed the video evidence.      I said that I thought we would
have to show the jury certainly the compilation of the video and
possibly some others.    Mervyn pointed out that some of the videos
showed very distressing scenes which might be upsetting for the
families.   He was very anxious that we should not io this unless
it was absolutely necessary.     I agreed and said that we would
have to review the videos in due course.

We discussed the photographic evidence.      They had defined a system
whereby photographs could be photocopied.      They had a photocopying
process which was much cheaper.     It is not quite clear who would
be responsible for the costs of these.      Mervyn mentioned that
it was my responsibility.     I did not take this up with him
at the time, althoughit& e u i** t/c CM- “’^supplied with photographs
by the police on a Free of Charge basis.

We agreed that we would have to meet fairly soon,in order to establish
what photographs would be required for the Inquests.

We thought that we would still be in a position to be on target for us
to start in the middle of January.

The work on the individual files of the deceased was progressing and
they would let me have these.

They were making arrangements to let me have copy statements of all the
witnesses who had given evidence at the inquiry togetherwte&thesngpiy
additional ones which they.g g ^ ^ g e t hold of at the present time.         The
full report of the Iras?@si/ will of course be forwarded to me.         The
volume of statements was absolutely enormous at the present time already.

We also spent a bit of time talking about alcohol that was in the individuals
                                                 -    3   -




      and.in particular the case which I                  had mentioned to Mervyn.   This
      was being investigated by trying to establish what if anything had
      actually been drunk,

            Dear Dr Popper

            Please find enclosed a copy of the notes taken by Mr Jones at your
            meeting with him on Wednesday 19 July 1989 at the Medico-Legal Centre,
            also enclosed is a copy of a letter addressed to Mr Jones from
            Miss Elizabeth Steel, Chairman of the Hillsborough Steering Committee,
            which is referred to in the notes of the meeting.

            With reference to your letter of 12 July 1989, I regret that I am unable
            to send you a copy of the minutes taken on 22 June 1989 as they were
            never transcribed, only a note that the meeting took place was entered
            into our Policy Book. This was because the majority of the Items
            covered had previously been discussed by Mr Jones with other members of
            staff and by not transcribing the notes I felt It would save time and
            duplication. Upon receipt of your letter I intended to transcribe the                              J
            notes and send them for your information, but I now find that the          ^* -
            particular note pad has been mislaid in our moves between Birmingham,
            Furnival House and the Medio-Legal Centre. I am very sorry that I
            cannot help you in this instance, but I will endeavour to recover the
            note pad and, if possible, get the notes of the meeting to you. I hope J
            this does not cause you too much Inconvenience.                          1
                                                                                                           i
            Yours sincerely




             V S Chalcraft (Secretary)
             To Assistant Chief Constable
             (Hillsborough Inquiry)


   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                    Birmingham
Wednesday 19 July 1989

1115        Discussion with Dr Popper in his office at the Medico-Legal
             Centre, Sheffield.  Items discussed were as follows:-

       1.   He has not yet received his copy of the transcripts for Day
            32 (the closing date of the Inquiry).  Nor has he seen the
            submission made by Counsel to the Inquiry or those
            representing interested parties.  (Police Sergeant Parkes to
            arrange a copy of the transcripts to Dr Popper. Nechells to
            arrange a copy of the submissions to Dr Popper).

       2.   We had a discussion with regard to the allegations made by
             Counsel for the bereaved and injured parties concerning the
             allegation of "unlawful killing", Dr Popper referred to
             Section 16 of the Coroners' Act 1988 and the Coroners' Rules.
             It was thought appropriate that Dr Popper, myself and
             Detective Chief Superintendent Foster should meet with the
             Director of Public Prosecutions, or his representative, at
             the earliest opportunity.  (I will arrange).

   3.       Dr Popper asked if we could find out what time he was first
             telephoned by South Yorkshire Police on Saturday 15 April
             regarding the disaster (I have established from the South
             Yorkshire Police Log that Dr Popper was telephoned at 1616
             hours.  I have also established that PC Thompson arrived at
             the mortuary at 1647 hours. Also that Dr Popper left the
             mortuary at 1830 hours to go to the ground).

   A.       Dr Popper drew my attention to the Daily Telegraph of 15 July
             1989 where he indicated the words used in a report on the
             closing day of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, which could be
             construed in contempt of court.    The relevant words used in
             relation to the forthcoming Coroner's Inquests were
             " ..... is likely to return verdicts of unlawful killing".
             Dr Popper was raising this matter with the Attorney General.

   5.       Note for diary - Dr Popper will be away on leave out of the
             country on 26 September and for the two weeks following.

   6.       Dr Popper would like a full set of the statements taken.
             (I have already discussed this with Detective Chief
             Superintendent Foster and the matter is in hand).

   7.       I advised Dr Popper that a copy of the Channel Four programme
             will be sent to him in the very near future. (Detective
             Chief Superintendent Foster to Action).

   8.       I discussed security at the Medico-Legal Centre and other
             logistical matters with Dr Popper. Dr Popper has no
             objection to us providing appropriate locks and extra power
             points should we so require.
We had a discussion about the release of statements to
solicitors representing the injured and bereaved. Also the
request from Sheffield Social Services for a copy of the
compilation video. The principle that Dr Popper would like
to adopt is that which would appertain had this been a
straight forward fatality, ie material would not be released
until after the inquest had concluded.  Given the
extra-ordinary circumstances Dr Popper understands the
difficulties and says he would like to release as little as
possible without being too unhelpful.  At the present time
Lord Justice Taylor has permitted statements to be released
to solicitors representing the person who has made the
statement.  This also can continue as far as Dr Popper is
concerned. However, requests for other statements will have
to be considered on their merits by myself, in consultation
with Dr Popper.

With regard to the compilation video, Dr Popper agreed that
this has already been in the public domain and that there
would be no objections by him for it being released to a
professional body such as Social Services.  We have received
one request from Sheffield City Council - Hillsborough Task
Team.  I intend to make the Chairman of that Team responsible
for one copy of that video which he may care to have copied
for other Social Services a3 he sees fit, placing the onus
upon him to ensure that its use is properly controlled and
that any copies made are properly accounted for.   (I will
write to Sheffield Social Services on this matter).

I advised Dr Popper that Mr Benen Hytner QC had approached
Lord Justice Taylor through Mr Andrew Collins QC, for
permission to show some or all videos recorded on the 1989
Semi-Final.  The reason for this was that the relatives of
the deceased wanted re-assurance that there was no cover up
and they felt that this can be best achieved by viewing of
the video material.  Lord Justice Taylor had agreed that this
could take place and I have been advised accordingly by
Andrew Collins QC.  I am decidedly unhappy about this aspect,
not least of all the distressing nature of much of that film.
I advised Dr Popper that Elizabeth Steel, the solicitor and
Chairman of the Hillsborough Steering Committee, had written
to me to follow up the earlier discussion with Mr Hytner.
(Letter at Policy Book Number 883). Elizabeth Steel will be
visiting Nechells in week commencing Monday 24 July 1989 to
discuss this in greater detail. Miss Steel also included in
her letter an indication that they would like copies of the
photographs in appropriate cases. Dr Popper and I agree
that this is rather like the statements and the request
should not be acceded to at this stage.  A good point at
this time, made by Dr Popper, was that in the light of the
suggestions of "unlawful killing", it would be highly
inappropriate to release material during the course of an
investigation.  Our views also coincide over the showing of
video material, although that may create a lot of
difficulties, should we refuse, now that the request has
          already been agreed. (Detective Chief Superintendent Foster
          will meet with Miss Steel and discuss this next week. He
          will not be in a position to agree anything at that time for
          what we will be able to do will have to be subject of
          discussion with Dr Popper and possibly the DPP's Office).

    11.   We had a discussion on the part that the Health and Safety
          Executive played in Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, and in
          particular, aspects of Dr Nicholson's report such as rate of
          flow, capacity of pens, density of packing. Dr Popper is of
          the opinion, and I agree, that more work will be necessary
          from the HSE for the purposes of the Inquest.  (I am to
          arrange a meeting between Dr Nicholson, myself and Dr Popper
          early in August. Det Chief Supt Foster or Det Supt Taylor
          to attend if possible).

    12.   Finance - we had a general discussion about the financing of
          the investigation.  The Coroner has no responsibility to
          meet police costs, for this is a matter which is normally
          dealt with by the police.

    13.   I discussed the possibility of Dr Popper's secretary using
          our word processor facility at the Medico-Legal Centre. We
          will make one key available to Dr Popper personally to hand
          to his secretary to use the machine where appropriate. Mrs
          Chalcraft will undertake the training of Dr Popper's
          secretary as soon as is convenient. Dr Popper will be
          supplied with his own word processor facility in the
          (hopefully) not too distant future.

    14.   We discussed the availability of the key to the photocopying
          machine.  Inspector Sawers to raise this matter with the
          Admin Officer, John Batley, on his return to work.  In the
          meantime Inspector Sawers to borrow the South Yorkshire
          Police Coroners Officer's key.

    15.   We have now installed   a fax machine at the Medico-Legal
          Centre, the telephone   number is 0742-726247.  If Dr Popper
          wishes to receive fax   messages, or send them, in connection
          with the Hillsborough   disaster then he is most welcome to use
          this facility.

    16.   We had a general discussion about security matters and it was
          agreed that items that we would supply Dr Popper which can be
          construed as "sensitive" would be kept under lock and key.
           (This, of course, applies to all documents of that nature
          kept by our officers in the Medico-Legal Centre, including
          the copy of my policy book).

             Furnival House2
             SHEFFIELD




             Dear Mr Jones,

             I confirm the request made initially by Counsel for the injured and bereaved
             Mr Hytner QC, through Mr Collins QC, for arrangements to be made for the video
             footage of the scenes on the terraces at the Leppings Lane end to be shown to
             those bereaved families who wished to see the videos at Liverpool.


 K           We are very much obliged to you for agreeing to this request and I will be in
             touch to arrange a convenient date for the showing.

             I have written in the last Bulletin to all Solicitor members of the Group
             notifying them of the proposed showing, warning them that the scenes are
             distressing and asking them to confirm whether their clients do wish to
             attend.

             Todate I have received positive replies from approximately 6 or 7 firms but
             have given everyone a deadline of Friday this week to let me know whether their
             clients do wish to attend and if convenient to you I will get in touch in the

'K           early part of next week to let you know numbers and so that a convenient date
             and time can be arranged.

             Some Social Workers are willing to attend with their clients which should help
             and as agreed I have extended the invitation to Social Workers who are involved
             in the "helpline" projects in the Merseyside area.                                     I also confirm that some
*’/) "       of the Groups clients have also expressed the wish to see the still photographs

             I understand that there is a spare set of negatives and if you wish I would
             be happy to take those and to arrange for prints to be available at Liverpool

         \   for Social Workers and clients to see and then if they wish we can arrange to
             take further prints for their use.

             I look forward to hearing from you and again I am very grateful for your assistance

             Yours sincerely

 FILE NOTE DATED 24.1.90. MEETING AT NECHELLS POLICE STATION BIRMINGHAM
WITH SUPT TAYLOR AND CHIEF INSPECTOR TOBE TO DISCUSS VARIOUS ASPECTS
OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY._________________________________________


1. C/Supt Foster was away ill.   Mervyn Jones was at the Police College.

2. We had a very useful meeting and covered quite a considerable
    amount of ground.

3.   I recounted briefly Counsel's advice with regard to the holding of an
     Inquest to take "non-contrflversial evidence" and in particular his
     view that we should do this before the D.P.P. had/upnis mind. The
     general view was (and this confirmed my feelings as well) was that
     this was not a good idea. It was likely to be exceedingly difficult
     to control the questioning. The D P.P. might well be unhappy. We
     had already indicated that we were not going to proceed until after
     the D.P.P. had made up his mind and C/lnsp. Tobe pointed out that
     if we did in fact now hold this partial Inquest, people might well
     assume that either the D.P.P. had already decided not to proceed or
     indeed they might take the other view but in either event they would
     feel that some information had passed between us and that that was
     the real reason why we were proceeding. We therefore agreed that
     despite Counsel's opinion, we would stq^k by what we had initially
     decided with regard to timing.

4 . Supt Taylor indicated that although he was not fully aware of all
     the circumstances, the impression that he had formed was that the
     D.P.P. was likely to take a very much quicker decision than had
     initially been anticipated. He had apparently indicated that
     he does not need to see quite as many statements as had been
     produced in the first batch and it was hoped that all the documents
     that he needed to see would be with him by the end of March. That
     he would be responding some time in April. That Further work required
     would be completed by June/July time, by which time a decision would
     be announced. The reason for this increase in speed were the recent
     decisions in Wapping and elsewhere where prosecutions failed because
     theye had been a delay.

5.   We then spent a considerable amount of time looking at the specimen
     folder and mainly discussing minor details of wording in order to
     make it so that I could understand what the references meant. We also
     discussed the question of the precis which had been raised. They felt
     that what would be best from their point of view would be if I had a look
     at the files, indicated who I wished to call, who I might use as
     documentary and who I       not wish to call. With regard to the latter,
     they would then prepared a suitable precis which could be used, assuming
     that it was agreed. We discussed the questions of photographs again
     and it was agreed that each individual folder did not have to have a
     whole set of photographs available. They could select where they had
     several photographs of more or less the same scene, but that there
     should be at least one complete set of photographic evidence. I felt
     that it would be wise to have that set in court in case an issue arose
     as to a particular photograph or not, but that it would then remain as
     part of the archieval material at West Midlands. We discussed the number
     of documents which we would need. The problems as always is that it
     is difficult to decide whetherthe D.P.P. will issue proceedings or not.
     I felt that we did not want to have too many photographs because of the
     cost, but the minimum seemed to me to be at least 2 for the Jury and 2
     for Solicitors and 1 of course for the witness plus the ones that I had
     in front of me.
 We also agreed that it was exceedingly important that whatever
 we did should be excellent as it was vital that people should realise
 that the work had been properly done. The position was to a certain
 extent emeliorated because the familes had already been contacted
 though to discuss the visml evidence, and in that sense they
 to a large extent knew what and where their deceased member was found
 and therefore a lot of the anxiety and pressure had been taken out
 of the matter.
We
discussed the issue of family members attending the Inquest and the
 cost of transportation backwards and forwards. C/lnsp. Tobe wanted
 to know whether we would pay for every and all members of the family
 or whether we would have some restriction. I pointed out that
 normally speaking we would not pay for any family member unless
 they were called as a witness, but it might be that in this case,
 we ought to make some exception and pay for some. We discussed
 whether it might be a good idea to arrange for a coach maybeto take
 people backward and forward or whether we should make some other
 arrangements either using Social Services or not. In the end
 we decided that I would think about this and we would come to some
 decision.

  Dear Sir , "'             5                                                •

  figi RESUMED INQUESTS - INDIVIDUAL QWCBIES
  We write further to our letter of the 19th December 1390 to provide you
  with a summary of outstanding queries which have been raised by families
  in connection with deceased individuals.
                                                     *
  In a number of instances, family members are seeking amendments or additions
  to the West Midlands Police Summaries.      We are enclosing copies of the/
  relevant documentation but for your ease of reference will summarise
  the amendments/additions and queries below

   Amendments/Additlons to West Midlands Police Summaries
   1.      Christopher Edwards
           The Summary indicates that a number of named officers attempted to revive
           Christopher • The Edwards family would like more information as to what
           Christopher’s condition was when the various Officers attended him and
           also what time these attendances took place. The family would like the
           Summary amending to reflect these details and we enclose a copy of the
           specific question of the E d w ard s’ for your consideration. It may be
           that the various Officer's statments may provide the information the
           Edwards’ desire.

   2.      James Gary Asoinall
           The Aspinall family are concerned about what happened in the time between
           James being identified on the pitch, ie. 15.27, and being certified dead
           at 15.45. Is there any other visual evidence which may/aocount for the
           missing 18 minutes and can the summary be amended to reflect to this. A

 3.      Jonathan Oweni
         The Owens family would like the Summary amending to reflect that Jonathan
         together with hit friends, P e t e r Birckett and Michael Robertson, were in
         a snooker hall between 11*15 and 13.15 on the day of the tragedy*
         information was contained in a statement given to the West Midlands Police
         by Mr Robertson >

         The Owens family also dispute P,C. Parkes' account when Jonathan Joined the
         crowd outside Lappings Lane at 2.40pm. Video evidence timed somewhere
         between 14.45 and 14.50 showed Jonathan and his friends standing in
         Lappings Lane and making no attempt to join the crowd. Can this        w —
         discrepancy be clarified ? You will note that in our letter of the
         19th December 1990 we requested that P.O. Farkes be called to give evidence
         and it was with this issue in mind that we made this request. A copy
         of Mr and Mrs Owens*letter dated the 15/10/90 enclosed for your information.

  4.     Adam Edward Boearrltt                     .
         Adam’s father, Edward has been attempting for some time to discover what
         happened to Adam before he was slgHted in front of the Spion Kop at 15.25.
         The Summary (paragraph 5) gives the impression that P.C. Harratt saw Adam
         pass between Pena 4 and 3 at around 15.05 and=therefore leaving some 20 4
         minutes unaccounted for. However* the release of P.C, Harratt’s statement
         statement show that in fact the sighting took place between 15.22 and 15.30.

         Mr Spearritt would like the Summary amending to reflect these timings.
         He would also like to know if other sightings were made of Adam prior to
         P.O. Harratt's other than the unconfirmed ones at 15.08 and 15.09.

  5i      Phillip John Steele
          The Summary indicates that Mr John Liam Boyle gave assistance to PhillipG
          The Steele family would like if possible to know what time this a'ssistance
          was given and the Summary added to accordingly. It maybe that the answer
          to their question is contained in Mr Boyle\s statement and we would
          respectfully ask that you consider releasing a copy to ourselves. We enclose
          a copy of Mrs Steele's letter of 12/11/90 in this1regard for your
          Information*

   6.     Paul Brian Murray
          The Summary is unclear as to when Sergeant David Fox came into contact
          with Paul, merely placing the time after some time after 15.05. Photograph
          Reference 5/32 timed at 15.32 shows Paul being carried on a temporary
          stretcher by, among others, Sergeant Fox. The Murray's are anxious to
          fill in the missing 25 minutes or so and perhaps you would kindly consider
          releasing Sergeant Fox's statement.

           We enclose a copy of Mr and Mrs Murray's undated letter.which outlines
           their concerns and should be obliged if it would be possible for you to
           kindly consider the further questions contained therein,*

    7.     Sarah Louise Hicks                                    ,
           The Hicks family are anxious to establish' whether Sarah received attention .
           between 14.50, when she was seen by Paul McCaffrey and 15.21 when she
           was helped through the perimeter fence by P.C. Marshall. We should be
           obliged if you would kindly consider releasing a copy of P.O. Marshall's
           statement which may deal with this aspect. A copy of Mr Hicks letter of
           13/11/90 is enclosed for your information,
$,    Victoria Jane Hicks
      You may recall that in our letter of the 19th December1 1990 we requested
      that you kindly consider calling P.C. McGuinness and Mr Paul Taylor,
      We enclose for your consideration a copy of a letter dated 13/11/90
      which provides further details of Mr Taylor's account of his contacts
      with Victoria. Mr Taylor^s account of cuddling Victoria conflicts with P.C.
      McGuinness' account of removing her from a pile of bodies on the
      terracing and the Hicks family would like this clarifying if possible.

 HILLSBOROUGH STEERING COMMITTEE
FILE NOTE DATED 16.11.90.

A lot of statements arrived on the 16th at about 2.30 or so

from Mr.   Frazer.   Somewhat later another batch of

statements came from Hanunand Suddards and later still about

5 critique of the proposed summaries from Dr. Eastwood's

solicitors.

I spoke with Mervyn.    He informed me that Caroline had

considerable difficulty getting responses from some

solicitors and that there was quite a lot of objection to

the content.    I said in the circumstances we wold not use

them but would proceed without them and without much

further ado.    We agreed that we would bring some witnesses

forward for Tuesday afternoon in the circumstance.       We

would start with Inspector Layton on Monday afternoon.          I

went through the statements which Mr. Frazer had sent.

Three or four of them referred to various witnesses with

copy statements which I have requested so that I can assess

them.    W ith regard to the rest,   it seems to me that they

have completely misunderstood a. what is happening and b.

what the objects of an inquest are.       I can see at the

moment no reason why I should depart from my decision to

treat the cut-off point as far as the how is concerned at

about 3.15 or in fact even earlier.

  Dear Mervyn,

  Thank you for the fax re conversation with Mr. Hayes. I agree with
  your explanations to him.

  For the sake of the record :

  1. It is essential that all representatives and by extension the
  interested parties must be treated in an equal and even handed
  manner. It follows that SYP are not entitled to any privileges nor
  are they to be put at a disadvangage as compared to other interested
  parties.

  2. I confirm that it is my decision as to whom I wish to call and also
  my decision as to whether advance notice of the names of potential
  witnesses should be disclosed to interested parties or their
  representatives and if so whether this should be restricted to those
  who attended the meeting on 30th Oct. 1990.

  3. As indicated at the meeting of 30th Oct. 1990 I am not prepared
  to supply copy statements made by potential witnesses. There is no
  question of early disclosure of what is likely to be said. As you have
  pointed out the coronal enquiry is inquisitorial and not adversarial.

  4. To avoid doubt point 3 above does not apply where I decide that
  in exceptional cases copy statements or information should be supplied
  to witnesses. This could well apply for instant to expert witnesses
  though not to expert witnesses who are introduced by interested
  parties and who I decide in the interests of the enquiry or justice
  to c d lia . Nor of course does it apply to WMP officers working on the
  inquiry or undertaking assignments or preparation of reports or
  statements at my request.

  5. My objective is to have a proper coronal inquiry and that it
  should be undertaken fairly, even handedly, openly and with the
  purpose of establishing the truth as far as this falls within my
  jurisdiction so that the jury at the end of the day can reach a
  verdict on the evidence.



  Yours sincerely,

            F.A. CUP SEMI FINAL FOOTBALL MATCH

            EVERTON V NORWICH

            VILLAR PARK STADIUM, BIRMINGHAM

            SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989



            I am currently the officer in charge of the Complaints and Discipline

            Department of the West Midlands Police, stationed at Force

            Headquarters in Birmingham.    However, for the period from 31 March

            1986 to 21 May 1989, I was the Divisional Commander of 'D' Division

            of the West Midlands Police, an area which encompasses the Villa Park

            Football Stadium, the heme of the Aston Villa Football Club, and one

            of my responsibilities was to make the necessary policing arrangements

            in connection with the Football Stadium.



        The Stadium is equipped with a dedicated Police Control Box, and

            facilities include comprehensive closed circuit television equipment
                                                                  PAGE     2
                                                                  D1885

to enable monitoring both inside and the immediate outside of the

ground.    A recent addition is a visual display unit from the Club's

computerised electronic turnstile counting facility from which it is

possible to monitor the total number of persons entering the Stadium,

and the numbers in any particular section of the ground.



Villa Park was chosen as the venue for the semi final of the F.A. cup

between Everton and Norwich on Saturday 15 April 1989.     Such games

have been a regular feature at Villa Park for many years, and I

personally had been responsible for the policing of two previous semi

final games and in addition a number of comparable matches.     I am

therefore used to dealing with football supporters, and was well aware

of potential difficulties, and planned accordingly.   A detailed police

operation involving same 680 police officers and also Traffic Wardens,

Special Constables and civilian staff was prepared, to deal with all

facets of the event.



The Stadium capacity currently stands at 46,500.   A capacity crowd was

expected and it was declared an all ticket game.   All tickets were

sold well before the event,    in accordane with a well established plan

it was possible to segregate the two sets of supporters in the manner

shown on the plan of the ground marked "R.J.M.l"   The effect of this

was that the Everton supporters arriving from the North West were

situated in the North part of the ground and used the Witton Lane

turnstiles and Norwich supporters arriving from the East took the

South part of the ground, using the Trinity Road turnstiles.    This

arrangement, combined with the use of separate railway stations, coach

and car parks and motorway exits, enabled complete segregation of

opposing supporters on the approach to and departure from the

stadium.   These arrangements are illustrated in plans marked "R.J.M 2"
                                                                  PAGE         3
                                                                  D1885
 (Everton) "R.J.M. 3" (Norwich).   The final official attendance figure

 was 46,553, comprising 24,515 Everton Supporters and 22,038 Norwich

 Supporters.



 On the day of the game, supporters from both Everton and Norwich began

 arriving in the vicinity of Villa Park from approximately 11 am.       From

 12 noon onwards, I took up position in the Police Control Box within

 the Stadium.   The turnstiles were opened at 12.30 pm and from that

time onwards there was a reasonably steady flow of spectators into the

Stadium.    Generally speaking the Norwich supporters were well behaved

and in good humour, arrived in the locality early and queued in an

orderly fashion.    By 2.35 pm, the vast majority of Norwich supporters

were in the Stadium and settled.    However, it was most noticeable at

that time that there was a comparative lack of Everton supporters in

the Stadium.    Such was the disparity that I instructed Police

Constable 5299 G BRANNINGAN one of the staff in the Police Control

Box, to check with the Police Motorway Control Centre, Perry Barr, as

to whether there was a problem causing any delay on the motorway

system.    The reply was that although traffic was heavy, there was no

specific reason, such as road works or an accident.    At that time - 2.

35 pm - all the coaches which were expected from Liverpool had

arrived, all special trains had unloaded and a large number of cars

were in the appointed car parking area.   My conclusion was that a

substantial number of Everton supporters were in the vicinity of the

stadium, but were not in or near the stadium.   I was informed that

many of the local public houses were crowded, but I had no detailed

information as to who was in than, other than that many were making

their way to the football match.



The game kicked off at the scheduled time of 3 pin.   At that moment,
                                                                   PAGE      4
                                                                   D1885

 the turnstile monitor in the Police Control Box was registering     total

of 42,523 spectators in the Stadium.    I instructed Police Constable

BRANNIGAN to make a written record of this figure, which he did.     At

that time, the Norwich sections of the stadium were full to capacity,

where as the Everton sections were not.    The closed circuit TV cameras

showed substantional crowds in Witton lane, particularly in the

vicinity of the 'L' block turnstiles, of Everton supporters. They

were not queueing in an orderly fashion and I instructed that the

mounted and foot officers in that vicinity should be augmented by

mounted and foot officers from Trinity Road (the Norwich turnstiles)

where there was no queuing or crowds.   The crowd in Witton Lane was

boisterous and noisy, unco-operative and there was evidence of many of

them being under the influence of drink.   Although there were no major

problems, it was necessary to arrest 25 Everton supporters before they

arrived in the stadium for drink related offences.



At this stage of the proceedings a series of problems emerged.     There

were a number of incidents of Everton supporters jumping the

turnstiles, in order to gain entrance, presumably because they had no

tickets.   Furthermore, a number of Everton supporters gained entrance

in this manner by way of the Trinity Road turnstiles, into the Norwich

section of the crowd.   Also it was brought to Police attention that a

number of Everton supporters were making threats to turnstiles

attendants in order to gain entrance without tickets and some were

offering cash as alternative to tickets. There was also an incident

requiring police attention in the stadium ticket office in Trinity

Road when two persons in possession of tickets for the Liverpool v

Nottingham Foest semi-final at Hillsborough caused trouble when their

request for the tickets to be exchanged were refused.   There was one

arrest of an Everton supporter for the robbery of tickets from a
                                                                       PAGE     5
                                                                       D1885
 Norwich supporter.       There was no evidence of forged tickets in

 circulation, which had been a feature of previous similar games, and

 this was attributed to a new process of computerised printing of

 tickets on heat sensitive paper, which makes forgery much more

 difficult.



 At 3.15 pn all supporters were in the Stadium.        It was at this point

 that the official final attendance figure of 46,553 was registered on

 the turnstile monitor.      This meant that 4030 persons - all of than

 Everton supporters - entered the Stadium after the game had kicked off.



Throughout the game, the Everton supporters behaviour was poor and

they required constant police attention.         By comparison the Noriwch

section of the crowd was reasonably well behaved.         It was necessary to

eject 16 persons from the game for breaches of ground rules,

comprising 12 Everton and 4 Norwich supporters.        After the game was

over, there were sporadic outbursts of disorder, all as the Everton

supporters made their way back to their coach and car parks, and the

railway station, necessitating 25 arrests for public nr-He>r and drink

related offences.     There were no such arrests of Norwich supporters.

The total number of arrests in connection with the football match was

109, broken down, as followss-

Q13.   DID THE SUPPORTERS FROM YOUR COACH LEAVE THE COACH PARK POSITION

       WITH A POLICE ESCORT?

       They didn't appear to be escorted.



Q14. WHAT TIME DID YOU DEPART FROM SHEFFIELD ON THAT DAY?

       5 . 30pm (17 30).



Q15. WERE YOU MISSING ANY PASSENGERS ON THE RETURN JOURNEY?

       No.



Q 1 6 . IF YOU HAD MISSING PASSENGERS,     CAN YOU IDENTIFY THEM?

       N/A.



Q17.   FOLLOWING YOUR JOURNEY BACK FROM SHEFFIELD AND THE PASSENGERS

       LEAVING YOUR COACH, WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF ALCOHOL HAVING

       BEEN CONSUMED?      (Briefly Explain).

       None whatsoever.

       I searched them when they got on in the morning and they were
                                                                                 PAGE 4

       return journey.



Q18.   IS THERE A N Y OTHER INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE TO GIVE WHICH

       YOU FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

       Alcohol is banned on coaches visiting a football match.                  Yet,

       fans were hanging out of the pubs in the area drinking at

       between 2.30   (1430)   to 2.45pm (1445) which I think is wrong.

       All pubs in the locality should be shut.

       (IF YES, COMPLETE A SUPPORTERS QUESTIONNAIRE).

       No.

      Yes.

      (Briefly Explain)

      Yes - I went via Stockport and then over the Woodhead Pass.                 It

      took me from 12.45           (1245) to 1.40   (1340)   to get through Stockpot

      because of very heavy traffic.            Going over Wo odhead we got stuck

      behind a low-loader for about 5 or 6 miles and we were down to

      about 20 mph.        Due to these delays,      one arrival, at Sheffield

      was late     ( 2 .40pm)(1440).

        No.



Q18.    IS THERE A N Y OTHER INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE TO GIVE WHICH

        YOU FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

        1.     I was told by a colleague that if I w anted to get into the

        match without a ticket I would just have to show m y badge and

        they would let me into the main stand.                        Another driver at

        Sheffield told me that Hillsborough was one of the easiest

        grounds to get into without a t i c k e t .



        2.    At least a dozen of the fans on m y coach went into the

        ground and did not have to hand their ticket in.                             Another two

        fans had tickets          for Leppings Lane End and they told me that

        they had come out because of the crowding and the Police sent

        them to another entrance where it wasn't so crowded and they

        were let in there without the right ticket.

     Dear Dr Popper


     I was very pleased to receive your letter of the 28
     March, commending to me the work carried out by my
     officers during the Hillsborough Enquiry, and
     particularly the Inquests.

^1^ The actions of these officers have already been
    recognised in-Force, but I am delighted to hear that
    they have been of assistance to you.


     Yours sincerely



     Chief Constable
  MEETING WITH MERVYN JONES, MR METCALFE AND MR FRASER TO DISCUSS THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL
  DISASTER INQUESTS HELD ON 26TH FEBRUARY 1990

  The reason why I wanted to meet today, Mr Jones and I have been discussing it, and we
  thought it would be helpful if we had an informal discussion between ourselves as the
  people with whom I have corresponded as opposed to other firms of solicitors that may
  have interests, but who at this stage, haven’t yet had occasion to write in a substantial
  way.

  You will recollect that both of you are anxious to obtain data because you need it for
  various civil matters which are of no concern of mine.

  The original intention was that once the public enquiry had been completed that I would
  resume the Inquests reasonably promptly.  It was fixed for the 15th January but in the
   vent, because a criminal investigation was initiated, I changed my mind about that

•  ecause one would normally hold Inquests after the DPP has made a decision, and then
   depending on that decision.

  I had a letter from Miss Steelsaying she understood the difficulty with the criminal
  aspect of the matter but could  we at least help her with regard to where the deceased
  were and the medical evidence.    I reflected on that and wrote to the DPP and thought that
  this might be a way forward so   that we could have a resumed Inquest on a limited basis
  with fairly tight rules as to what kind of evidence we would hear and how we would
  present it. Obviously it may not give you all the answers you want but it would go a
  long way down the road. What we would be dealing with is who the deceased was, when he
  died and where he died and we would strictly not be dealing with the question of how or
  why.  That of course could prejudice the criminal part.    The DPP has specifically asked
  me not to. Certainly, if you look at it from the bereaved’s point of view it would be
  against their interests assuming there are bereaved people who wish to have the
  prosecution and certainly Mr Hytner indicated that in his    .... remarks, so it may not be
  in your interests but certainly the bereaved would not want me to muddy the water to such
  an extent that any criminal prosecution, assuming that there was one, fell to the ground.

     you feel that it would be helpful if we arranged to have ........ the Inquests for
^Plhe purpose of taking evidence in that limited way. We will then have to reiterate at
  the end of that particular evidence and I will come to the question of what will happen
  on resumption because that will depend on the DPP to a certain extent. Have I made
  myself clear?

  Mr Metcalf - Speaking from the point of view of the SY Police, I am one day away from
  being able to say whether it would be useful or not because we have a hearing tomorrow
  for Mr Justice Stain at which what is in conflict is whether the present civil
  proceedings should continue or whether they should cease to be restarted or new
  proceedings started when all matters, including the Inquests have been completed.   Now if
  the conclusion tomorrow is that the present proceedings have to go ahead, whether they be
  heard in October or later, then I can say straightaway it would be extremely helpful if
  Inquests could proceed, that must be true of all defendents.   If the proceedings are
  discontinued, then it really ceases to be significant from the point of view of SY Police
  except with any information the sooner we have it, the better.

  Mr Fraser - Certainly so far as the bereaved are concerned, one of the major questions is
  in their minds, is how did my husband or son die? WHy can’t I have particular information
  about him? I think anything that can be done to get that information to them, in almost




          INIAAF
                                         - 2 -

 a non-adverserial way, would be warmly welcomed by them.  The proceedings of which Mr
 Metcalf speaks, don’t directly involve the bereaved because they are, correct me if I ’m
 wrong, it’s the contribution proceedings between the various defendants, the insurers of
 SY Police have agreed that subject to proof, they will deal with all the civil claims and
 there are issues arising from that. Certainly in terms of the bereaved, those
 proceedings are not a factor and I am sure they would all welcome as much information as
 is possible to get.

   Mr Metcalf - I think there’s a further point which again I don’t suppose affects us
   directly, which I perhaps ought to make on that, nobody is being kept waiting for
   compensations INAUDIBLE so that’s not a live issue, the question of the amount of
   compensation is in issue and one of the particular aspects is something known as pre
^ ^ e a t h terror/pre impact terror which we used to describe as pain and suffering before
i^Pleath. If it be the case that there is evidence of people having survived for a long
   time or recovered consciousness sufficiently to recognise what state they were in or
   suffered pain, then the bereaved relatives are likely to be entitled to higher
   compensation on those grounds.     That may be a factor which is preventing cases being
    settled at the moment.

  Mr Fraser - Certainly that’s a major factor but I don’t think that’s adverserial in the
  sense as between ourselves, that’s really a matter for finding out information, that’s
  why yo u’ve been bombarded with all these letters from people.

  HMC - Looking from the bereaved point of view, my feeling is that they would welcome a
  limited Inquest, provided that the limits are explained to them an that they understand
  the reason for it.

  Mr Fraser -There will be one or two people who you will be faced with if you do proceed
  who   find those restrictions difficult to accept and you will    have to be as firmas I have
  not doubt you can be with them, even though they have it explained in advance, it’s an
  extremely emotional situation particularly for those who were there with people who died,
   ot perhaps so much for people who are at arms length.   It may be seen as an opportunity

•  or

  HMC
        those who were there, to get it off their chest and that

        - We have thought about this, it is difficult and I also
                                                                     could be a problem I think.

                                                                     recognise that it is
  impossible for me to satisfy 95 families.   I have thought about how we should present the
  evidence and I feel we should not ask any SY Police Officers to give oral evidence at
  this hearing.

  Mr Metcalfe - I can’t think that any of them could give any information about this, they
  could give general information about body positions and so on.

  HMC - There are a lot who participated in the rescue and resuscitation and by not calling
  them, it’s only fair to say that we are harming those that did well and tried very hard.
  But we decided it was impractical to select.  It becomes very much harder to control all
  the questioning and for that matter the answers.  The principal way we want to present
  the evidence is that there will be be team of Officers from W Midlands, they will prepare
  a summary of the evidence and will present that summary of how the deceased arrived at
  the ground and the events which took place at Hillsborough, basically statements. As
  soon as the summaries are available, they will be circulated to the solicitors of the
  Steering Committee.  If you felt that that was acceptable as it stands, then I would




          INIAAF
                                         - 3 -

 propose not to call any other evidence.     The summaries will be as factually accurate as
 the Officers can make them but they w o n ’t deal with the how.  You will know what the
 statements contained factually and you will also know the names of the witnesses but you
 w o n ’t see the witnesses in person.

 We want to use anna-cappas.  These are intended as aide memoires and we will have the
 Officer produce this, it actually summarises the major events in this particular person’s
 history.  On the opening day, someone will explain the diagrams.

  Mr Jones - Running parallel to this is the visual evidence which is actually much more
  precise in timing terms.  It actually says a lot when you have visual evidence and you
  compare it with people’s accounts of what they remembered and didn’t and indeed the
^^ime s

  HMC - We intend to have this for every deceased plus the summary.

 Mr Fraser - Plus any video or still photographs that are available as well?

 HMC - We don’t want to use the videos at this stage because it is very distressing. Most
 of them have already seen the videos and stills because the Officers who are going to be
 presenting the summaries will be able to say that the identifications have been confirmed
 in nearly every case.  There are a few that we have not been able to establish the
 whereabouts and there are a few where the families just didn’t want to look. What I have
 in mind is a plan with different dots where various people were seen alive. We will
 produce those plans and if somebody feel that they want to see the photograph, we will
 have blow ups of the video still.    Any thoughts on that?

 Mr Fraser - The only comment I have about the summaries is that, perhaps it’s because I
 have a Liverpool background, but any summary is somebody’s approach to the problem.   I
 wonder whether in addition being given the summary, it is possible or even practicable to
 be given the evidence from which the summary has been extracted so that when the
  olicitor has read the summary, if there is anything in it which causes him or his client

• oncern, the body of the evidencecan then be gone to. I wouldn’t expect the body of the
 evidence to be gone through piece by piece before you, but any summary is bound to be
 subj ective.

  HMC - W e ’ve thought about this at considerable length and it can’t easily be done,
  particularly with regard to the evidence of the Police Officers because it may contain
  their statements, there really is a tactical problem with some of the statements.       Quite
  apart from that, statements may contain DPP sensitive information. We have thought about
  going through the statements, which would be a mammoth task, and scoring out all the bits
  but on balance, we thought that would be even worse than doing what we are doing.       That
  doesn’t of course preclude at the Inquest from saying, w e ’ve heard what y o u ’ve said but
  if the Inquest were to be resumed, it may be that we would want to hear it in more
  detail.    I could make a note of that and subject to resumption, I would consider it as a
  possiblility.

  It may be when I read through the files, there may be some witnesses I feel I could call
  or it may be that I can read as documentary evidence, even evidence from Police Officers
  because I only need to read what is relevant under the rules, and I would say that.

  Mr Fraser - There will be some families who want their, someone said, their 15 minutes of
  fame.  I suppose to some extent they are going to have to be given that opportunity
  aren’t they.  I think the vast majority will go through very smoothly but I think that
  there are going to be one or two who are going problems.

  HMC - We recognise that, but we want the Inquests to be meaningful.

  Mr Fraser - Yes, it’s serving the two points particularly, getting information and also
  dealing with our problems on the civil front.

   Mr Jones - The summary is not only one of my Police Officers’s summary but    that is
   reviewed by me and my people, it’s actually going to go to Dr Popper so he    gets actually
^ ^ h e full file with all the statements and including matters which could be   considered
^Prejudicial.     He can actually read those matters which relate to the death   and look at
   that in terms of how it compares with the summary.   The summaries come out   from the
   Coroner as opposed to come out from me.

  Mr Fraser - No disrespect to W Midlands’ Officers, I think that if that point is made,
  and clearly made,   I think some of the"oh it’s another policeman and another policeman’s
  statement" sort of comment, then if a statement comes from your office, i t ’s going to be
  much easier to swallow.

  HMC - Would you want to see the summaries Mr Kennedy?     I would prefer not to send the
  summaries to dozens of parties.

  Mr Fraser - One of the points at issue is that at the moment a broad swipe has been taken
  at this pre-death payment and suffering, those summaries are almost bound to contain
  information which  will benefit us and I certainly would have no objection to the oterh
  side seeing them,  I don’t know whether they would want to.

   Mr Metcalf - I think the distinction that can be drawn between us and the other
^ ^e fe nd en ts is that we are doing the paying out, so we have a legitimate interest.

  HMC - I ’m quite happy is you say it would be helpful to see them before we begin.

  Mr Jones - There’s no problem.    The first thing was to clear with Mr Fraser in terms of
  that side of things.

  Mr Fraser - We have to work together, if the document became available and the plaintiff
  relied upon it, I would have to disclose it any way, so you might as well see it at the
  beginning rather than.  It will be a matter of public record after the hearing because ti
  will be part of the deposition.

  Mr Metcalf - Returning to the beginning of this, there is I think a line to be drawn in
  making clear what these preliminary hearings are intended to deal with between saying,
  well look w e ’re doing this to prevent any possible risk of prosecution, but not actually
  giving the idea that a prosecution is certainly going to follow.

  Mr Fraser - That has occurred to me and will occur to others.

  HMC - We thought about doing this a while ago but I turned it down because I thought that




           INIAAF
                                          - 5 -

  if I held a limited Inquest as this stage, everybody would assume that I knew what the
  DPP was going to do.   The reason why I feel we can do it now is because of Miss Steel’s
  letter.   She requested the information, what we are doing is trying to comply with her
  wish.   It would be made clear, if necessary 95 times, that under no circumstances can it
  be construed as a preliminary.   Do we say that because somebody w o n ’t believe it, we
  don’t do anything at all?

  Mr Fraser - that’s right, there will be one or two hotheads who will look for the
  ulterior motive behind this.  The vast majority will accept it in the spirit which i t ’s
  done.  The press will do the same.

   HMC - I am quite satisfied in my own mind that we are not doing it for that reason.
^ T h e r e are three scenarios which are worth mentioning.   One, that the DPP decies to
®|rose cut e somebody or several people for manslaughter.      If that were to happen, then
   Section 16 of the Coroner’s Act would apply and I would adjourn the Inquests on
   provisions of that Section. Whether I resume or not, I will decide at the end of the
   prosecution, but it is my normal practice not to resume when prosecutions for murder,
   manslaughter or ......... take place.       Secondly, that he decides not to prosecute for
   manslaughter or a charge that falls within that Section.      In that case, I will have to
   decide on a resumption then I will make up my mind how much further evidence I will need
   to call.     Thirdly, he decides not to prosecute but that somebody brings a private
   prosecution.     Again, I ’m not saying it will happen but it is a possibility, Mr Hytner I
   think hinted at that possibility.

  Mr Metcalf - I would take his remarks very carefully, he at no stage gave the idea that
  he or his colleague, King, thought that there was anything in which they were putting
  forward. What they were saying was, "some of my clients believe”. He was very careful
  in his wording.

  HMC - I w a s n ’t suggesting that he thought that one should be brought, I was just saying
  that he recognised that there were some people who might wish to do so. Assuming that
^^jomeone brought a private prosection, then you ’re back in the Section 16 situation.

  Those are the three scenarios.   If the DPP were to prosecute, then if I hadn’t done the
  resumptions at this stage, I would have had to resume on a limited basis to at least take
  the medical evidence.  Bearing mind even if the DPP does prosecute, he may not actually
  prosecute 95, he may select.   It might be that it would be unfair not to at least take
  the sort of evidence we have been talking about for the other x number who aren’t
  mentioned on the charge sheet, but it would be covered under Section 16.    So I might be
  faced with having to do all this anyway after the DPP has decided. Assuming that we do
  it now, that work will have been done if the DPP decides to prosecute, I will resume the
  Inquests for the purposes of adjourning under Section 16 and then I will make up my mind
  when it is over.

  Mr Fraser - I t ’s going   to take a lot of heatout of the situation.    There is a need to
  know, I think so far as    i t ’s possible to give that information, I think it’san excellent
  idea.

  Mr Jones - Humanely, if you look at it in terms of not doing anything at this stage, it
  could be quite a while, and the psychologists tell us that the grieving process needs
  this in order to work through.  The vast majority of families want to settle down and




           INIAAF
                                           - 6 -

  start rebuilding their lives but they can’t do it.

  HMC - I don’t know what the DPP    is going to do any    more than you do. When I mention it,
  that’s got to be put as part of    the scenario.

  Mr Jones - To help you on that, if this goes ahead      at the time we are           talking about,th
  final submission to the DPP w o n ’t have been made whilst this is going on.

  Mr Fraser - What sort of dates are we talking about?

  HMC - What we want to do as soon as you are happy, we want to have the pre-inquests with
  you next week because we want to give everybody a chance to hear and know w h a t ’s going
   n, and resume the Inquests on the 18th April, and start actually taking evidence on

#  ndividual cases on the 19th. When we first set it, it was said, how can you do it
   around the anniversary.  I t ’s certainly a point. The people will obviously very
  emotionally involved on the 15th anyway, and it may possibly be better to take them while
  they are already upset, quite naturally, instead of letting them go down and then lift
  them.

  Mr Fraser - How long do you anticipate this is going to       take?

  HMC - I ’d be interested to hear what you think?

  Mr Metcalf - A week or two weeks came into mind straightaway.

  HMC - I think the minimum is two weeks. What we want to do is eight a day if we can and
  that would take us 12 days.  The first day we don’t want to take eight.

  Mr Fraser - Timetabling is a problem.  Eight a day is eight families in and out, it can
  be done if the Social Services support and everybody gets their act together.

       Jones - What I intended to do with Summary Officers,     that    each one would only have one
^ P e r day, so h e ’d actually chaperone them in and out, so   they     wouldn’t     have thisideaofa
   sausage machine.

  Mr Fraser - I know that the Social Services in Sheffield are keen to help if that’s a
  possibility.

  HMC - The Zeebrugge Disaster managed 18 a day but I think their problem was different.
  Although they dealt with where the people were found, it was bearing in mind that the
  ship wa sn’t lifted until six weeks or whatever after the incident.    Nobody knew where the
  people had been because the water had gone into the bow. We have the problem of trying
  to find 95 people in thousands, out of thousands of photographs. So it will probably take
  a bit longer to present the evidence.   I don’t want this rushed, I want each family to
  feel that they have been treated with courtesy, i t ’s been dignified.

  Mr Metcalf - I can’t see us and the others really having any questions to raise, I can’t
  see us being more than present hearing the evidence.

  Mr Fraser - Would you attach to the summary the PM report or would you include it in it?




          INIAAF
                                           - 7 -

  HMC - The PM report would be separate.    I might call the Pathologist to every Inquest and
  I ’d value your comments.

  Mr Jones  - I t ’s a question what the family want to some extent.    I know there are one or
  two PM reports which talk of fractures and what the family want to    know is whether that
  fracture caused any distress.    In the majority of cases, they are   very sympathetic
  reports.  I can’t see very many families wanting to put questions     to the Pathologist.
  One or two certainly.

  HMC - There are one or two where there were queries.    I want the families to be able to
  hear what was what, i t ’s better if it’s dealt with in Court. What I had in mind, and I
  haven’t yet spoken to Prof Usher, is on the opening day, to take evidence from Dr Forrest
   ho did the alcohols, otherwise h e ’sgot to sit here for 12 days, about half didn’t have

#  ny alcohol at all, another large batch only had relatively low levels, there may be a
  few where the alcohol level is a bit high.    I thought that we could call Prof Usher or
  some other suitable Pathologist, so that he could give us a general dissertation on
  traumatic asphyxia death.    The families wouldn’t have heard it but the solicitors would,
  it may be that if we do that, we could then take as documentary at least a proportion of
  the PMs. But if you say this family w o n ’t be happy unless they hear from the
  Pathologist, then I will consider that.

  The Jury, initially I was going to do without but I have changed my mind.  There will be
  a Jury even at this preliminary stage, though the Jury will have nothing to do because
  there will be no verdict as such at this stage.  Bearing in mind that one of the
  scenarios is that a prosecution may take place and that I may adjourn under Section 16,
  and at the end of the day, may not resume, if we do this without a Jury then none of its
  been heard with a Jury and I think technically it’s better if the Inquests were heard
  with a Jury.

  Mr Metcalf - I can’t   fault your logic but it would be nice for them if there was a way
  round it but I can’t   think of any.

^ ^ M C - Initially I was going to dowithout, but assuming I did resume in six months time,
   w e ’d have to repeat a fair bit of it anyway, even if I can get the same Jury ro w e ’d have
    to start with a new one, and do the whole job again.   I felt it would be unwise to
   proceed without them from a legal point of view.

  Mr Metcalf - I t ’s case where you would automatically have had a Jury had their been no
  possible element of prosecution.

  HMC - That’s the problem.  The Act says that if, a Coroner shall proceed ......... I
  think its wiser.  The Jury is going to cause a bit of a problem because I know from some
  of the, at least one, a bereaved representative that they are worried about how you can
  get an impartial Jury.  Bearing in mind that this is an Inquest not a trial, I ’m not
  really worried about selecting.

  Mr Jones - For this purpose, as they are not going to come to a verdict,     it doesn’t
  really matter.

  HMC - We will probably exclude anybody who is related to any of the deceased, I think
  that is something which we should discuss and decide whether we want to have any criteria




           INIAAF
                                          - 8 -

  for exclusions on the Jury. We don ’t want to pick and choose but we do n’t want to have
  people who by definition are involved in some way.  I have to think about this.

  We are inclined to hold it here and I will show you around the building later. As we are
  going to be dealing with 95 Inquests and provided we can get the summonsing right, we
  shouldn’t have   too many people in the building at any one time.  Except on Day One when
  the press will   be here, then I think they will go away. We want to try and arrange for
  coffee and the WRVS, and we want to inform the Hillsborough Support Group.     I do n’t want
  to get involved in the running of that side because it’s more for Mr Fraser. What Ihave
  in mind, is when we warn the family of attendance, we would at the same time warn the
  Support Group.    We will then expect you to co-ordinate them, the Social Services etc.

^ ^ r Metcalf - Are they all   represented, all 95?

  Mr Fraser - There’s about two or three that aren’t, this    is something that your Officers
  and I can check. Representation has changed.

  HMC - Can you let me have you updated list?

  Mr Fraser - Yes, I can let you have that by the end of the week.     Our difficulty is one
  that I have no wish to embarrass my friend about, but we as a Steering Committee, may not
  be here because we have a problem with the Insurersabout being here.        Our original, if
  I ’m treading on difficult territory, please say so. Ouroriginal approach       to your
  Inquest was this; we have already sent out a questionnaire to all solicitors who
  represent the bereaved and with very few exceptions, they have all returned them saying
  they want block representation.    This means you would have one individual or a team of
  two or three working on a rota basis appearing before you.     It had originally been our
  intention to match representation with our protagonists, but in view of what you have
  said today, my view, subject to the view of my Committee, would be, that it would be at
  solicitor level only and probably me because I have 22 personal bereaved families and as
  I lead the team for the    Inquests, I would probably be before you. That was on the basis
^^.hat the Insurers would   fund that en bloc. They have declined our invitation to pay for
^Representation for the bereaved at the Inquests at all. Not either en bloc or as
  solicitors or for each individual family. So the present position is that we either have
  to persuade them to see   the error of theirways and there is a meeting on Wednesday of
  this week at which an attempt will be made, or, we have to tell the families they cannot
  be represented unless they pay for individual solicitors themselves and the prospect
  therefore is that you have a different solicitor for each bereaved, or in some cases, no
  solicitor at all. The third possibility is that there is funding available from another
  source.   I can tell you that as I speak there is no other source available.       It has been
  suggested that we approach the Legal Aid Board, it is not possible.     I t ’s been suggested
  that we approach the Disaster Fund, and they have declined, so there are only two
  possibilities, either we can persuade the Insurers.     In fairness to the Insurers, their
  stance was taken before this information came available to us, but either we can persuade
  them to change their minds and agree to fund block representation or fund individual
  solicitors representing their clients and those solicitors instructing us as agents. Or,
  secondly, you have a team of different solicitors, you have a different solicitor for
  each bereaved in front of you with my exception.     Some have blocks of three, four and
  five solicitors, but there are quite a lot with one.     The present situation is that you
  could end up with up to 40 solicitors in front of you and that is a problem for which I
  TAPE ENDS

  That’s the situation as we talk at 3.30 today.

   Mr Metcalf - I think the particular problem is that for two reasons my clients, and it
    isn’t just the MMI in this instance, don’t wish to go beyond that which they are legally
    liable for and the two reasons are, firstly, we are pursuing the others, the Club,
   Eastwoods, the City Council, and if we pay out for something for which we are not liable
    legally, then we w o n ’t get any of it back.    Secondly,without giving any details of cover
    involved, it has been     a matter of comment and it is partly correct, that if the amount to
   be paid out goes over a certain limit, it will be the       ratepayers of S Yorkshire, whatever
   Treasury support they       may get, who will be paying out compensation.   In those
   circumstances, nobody wants to take a decision which could lead them to being surcharged
   at a later date for having willfully given away what turns out later to be public money.
^ J h e y present quite serious obstacles, whether there is anything that can be done I ’m not
^ ^ u r e . There is a meeting on Wednesday where this will be discussed again. Mr Fraser is
   quite correct in saying it’s not me that takes decisions.

  HMC - From my point of view it would be better if we didn’t have, we do have many cases
  where people are not represented and there is no objection, but given the emotivenes of
  this case and the limitations, legal representation might be helpful and desirable for me
  and the.  In a sense I ’m in your hands, assuming for a moment that I were making a claim,
  then I would include in my claim, the expenses and that would include legal, then I would
  have to argue whether it was legitimate expense.

  Mr Metcalf - The difficulty is that it comes back to the question of civil action, the
  moving on at speed.  In general terms, an Inquest takes place before a civil action and
  it’s always legitimate expense to go and be represented at the Inquest because something
  might come out that will be relevant to the civil action.

  HMC - In a sense we   are doing that, we have brought the Inquest forward.

  Mr Metcalf - Except that we are talking about representation here, the trouble is the
^^greement has been made to pay out so there’s nothing for them to gain in that sense.

 Mr Fraser - Our argument is one of the issues that you are going to clarify is the extent
 of suffering before death and therefore we are here to get that information, and
 therefore we think that we should be paid.  If we get the papers in advance, we don’t
 have to come.  It is my wish that the Steering Committee is here and will represent as
 many as possible, I will be here in any event and it is my view that as many as possible
 should be done, because although like you I have no wish to do it any more quickly that
 is necessary, if we have done the first day’s worth at eight, then we should be able to,
 if we can establish a pattern, without it being too obvious, then it will be easier for
 everybody.

  Mr ..... - Can I just clarify here INAUDIBLE If a decision was that it w a s n ’t going to
  be forthcoming, the costs, where would that leave us in terms of communication, talking
  to whom, the families directly and for them to decide as to whether they employ at their
  own cost?

 Mr Fraser - No what the Insurers say is that they will pay the generic costs of our
 preparation for the Inquests e.g. I ’m here today as one of the Committee as part of the
 generic costs of that Committee.  But the moment the Inquests start, then no we would not



          INIAAF
                                            - 10-

  be here.  Up to the 18th April we would be in, but once you switch       on the microphone   on
  the 18th, then w e ’re not here.

  HMC - You would accept communications     and presumably notifying your clients?

  Mr Fraser - Yes that’s right.

  Mr .... - But it does change how we got here, the question of Social Services support is
  that it isn’t something that we could actually lay off to you.

  Mr Fraser - No, I wouldn’t have raised the question of money had that not been an obvious
  link. Our present view is that if funding is granted, we will be here in terms of an
   dvocate and at least one legal runner who knows his way around the papers and can assist

«  our Officers.

  Mr Metcalf -I would have thought we would have been looking at one representative here,
  solicitor or a clerk after things got going.

  HMC - Le t’s assume the financial side got sorted out and that you will be here. If we
  are going to do eight a day, I reckon we will have to move at a fairly briskpace and
  what I have in mind is to warn the family to come at x time, deal with the case, take
  them out of Court, bring the next family in. That will mean that if you want to see the
  family who we have just dealt with, then you have got to have somebody here to see them
  because we will be starting the next Inquest.

  Mr Fraser - or they may want to see me, but I would have somebody from my office here or
  from the Committee to deal with any problems then, similar to the Public Inquiry. Who do
  you anticipate will be before you?

    HMC - I have drafted a letter to all solicitors I am aware of, not just the Committee.
    There are quite a lot of firms who were        represented at the Inquiry who have not
^ ^ o n t a c t e d me at all but I intend to tell them about the pre-inquest review so that they
^ R a n attend if they wish.        I suspect that not everybody will come and that at the Inquest,
    it will be yourself and possibly you.

  Mr Metcalf - I would have thought the Club and Council would have someone at the
  Inquests.

  Mr Fraser - I think to some extent that the publicity that comes from your office about
  what the Inquest is for may reduce the numbers.  If it is known that it is non liability,
  non adverserial.

  HMC - I think they will be here the first two or three days, then they may decide there’s
  not much.

  Mr Jones - Can I just add that there will be transcripts as well.

  HMC - We are wired for sound and we usually transcribe from tapes, but at the moment that
  even if we have it here, I will get preferably the same firm that did the Inquiry to do
  shorthand transcripts and we will probably record as well. We will let anyone who wants
  copies of the transcripts, have them at the usual rate.  I will try and get individual



           INIAAF
                                          - 11 -

  Inquests done separately so that we w o n ’t get a whole day ’s proceedings.    You can ask for
  individual copies rather than all those for that day.

  Hr Metcalf - It will reduce the need to go through the evidence at the end.  I can’t
  think at the moment of circumstances where we would have questions to ask, if we do n’t
  the likelihood is that we would want a low level representation and a transcript.

  Mr Fraser - I think from a political point of view, the Ch Constable might want somebody
  in.

  Mr Metcalf - Yes and no.   If it isn’t necessary, but I would have thought, I ’ll have to
  think about it.

(^■MC - I want to call the cases in Pathologist order because if I do need to call a
  Pathologist, I want to call him for half a dozen.  But of course where there are two
  people in the same family have been killed, then that’s an over-riding consideration.
  Those Inquests should be done on the same day.  There are other factors which come into
  it as well.  They will appear random.  The disadvantage is that they w o n ’t be in
  solicitor order.  If the Committee doesn’t represent, it’s not a problem.

  Mr Fraser - How much notice would you give the families or would you tell the
  solicitors?

  HMC - What I have in mind, is that we would notify the solicitors of the time and also
  the family directly. An Officer would tell them, and of course any witnesses we may want
  to call, the Officers would notify. And of course the Hillsborough Support Group so it
  may well be that in certain circumstances, w e ’d turn up at the door as well.W e ’d have
  to say that the Inquest is going to be held on x day but be prepared for change. Mr
  Fraser, you could explain those aspects.

   Mr Fraser - It would help me if you could also tell me with my Committee hat         on, the
^ ^ r o p o s e d dates as well.

  HMC - Yes.  If I know that the Committee will be representing en bloc, I wouldn’t notify
  the individual solicitors, I would just notify you of the dates.

  Mr Fraser - I think it would be better if you told the solicitors as well.  To a large
  extent, we are anonymous in the sense that we have deliberately not identified ourselves
  as individuals and if I have the information, then by the time I get to his solicitor and
  he gets it out, or he gets the information get back to me, I think if it’s possible, tell
  the family, tell the solicitor and also tell me.

  Mr Metcalf - It only matters in terms of preparation,    reading up etc.

  HMC - That   is all I really need to say today.

  Mr .... -    This question, your objectives as it were, in asense    you are united in terms
  of finding   out the information in order to settle on

  Mr Metcalf   - We each have the idea that this thing is better settled     quicker.




          INIAAF
                                         - 12 -

  Mr .... - In particular, the pain and suffering levels, immediately before and after
  death, there may well also be needs amongst the families to actually question, which they
  would normally do in an Inquest, question the people who were actually there, to say what
  did you do to help my client.  One thing that you will have to be sure of is that this
  ’device’ will actually bring out that to your satisfaction. A lot of it will centre of
  what the summaries say, but the ability to cross examine will not be there at that point,
  either for you or for the families.  If we called the police after we had just completed,
  and in many instances they would be in a position to give that evidence under cross
  examination, there could also be considerable problems there where it could become
  adverserial in terms of complaints against police.

  Mr Fraser - The majority of the families w o n ’t be looking for that problem, there will be
  some.  I think the advance publicity can make it as clear as possible, on bothsides of

• ^he Pennines, that this is an exercise to give information and not one to

  HMC - This is the draft letter.

 Mr Fraser - Would it be your intention to talk to the press before next w e e k ’s meeting?

 HMC - I ’m inclined to say I should tell the press about the meeting and I have drafted
 another press.

 Mr Fraser - Somebody must copy it to the press agency.

 Mr Metcalf - The only thing I would mention from your point of view is that some people
 might phone that number on the second page and be surprised when someone says "W Midlands
 Police".

 HMC - It is going to solicitors apart from those few who are not represented.     I am going
 to do a covering letter to those.

^ d r Fraser - So this is to all those solicitors who have notified you they   representthe
^Bteceased to all organisations who were represented

 Mr Metcalf - Other   bodies who were given representation at the Inquiry.

 HMC - Do you think   you could send me the addresses?

 Mr Fraser - When would you   expect to release this?

 HMC - Tonight if we finish early, we need the addresses sotomorrow.   I do n’t intend   to
 send one to each deceased, just one to each firm.   I do intend at some point   to have a
 meeting with the press and re-explain a) what we are doing, b) try and pointout that I
 don’t want any more bad press in my Court.  I also want to talk with the Social Services.

 Mr Metcalf - I suspect you will get quite a big turn out next week from people, I don’t
 know if there’s scope for extra benches.

 HMC - We w o n ’t have all the families, it will all be solicitors.   I do n’tthinkw e ’ll
 have enough space      next week but I agree with you, I suspect there will be quite a few
 representatives.

  Hr .... Can I just confidentially brief you both in terms of the progress of the
  investigation.  That is continuing, I saw Hr Hetcalf’s eyes raise when I said the final
  submission to the DPP w o n ’t have gone by the time this starts on the 18th.  It w o n ’t be
  long after, I intend to finish it in the Spring and await the D P P ’s response.  But in
  fairness, it will not be completed, every t crossed and every i dotted until the end of
  this particular process.     Not that this process is anything to do with it, it’s just
  simply that other things are going on and that includes interviews which I will be
  talking to you about.   I have had your letter, we didn’t deliberately respond other than
  to acknowledge because we wanted to talk about this, bearing in mind your letter came
  about the same time as Hiss Steel’s asking very similar questions.

  HHC - Are you content that we should proceed in the way that I have outlined?

^ R r Hetcalf - I see no reason why not.

  Hr Fraser - I agree entirely.  There will be one or two problems with this but on balance
  I think it’s an excellent idea, primarily from the point of view of the relatives to get
  the information that they have wanted for nearly ayear, and also from the lawyers point
  of view, there is  an added bonus that    information will come out, and those few problems
  will be the price  we will have to pay    for a much larger benefit.

  Mr .....   - Without naming any individuals, do you think there would be scope and would
  it be appropriate   to take those cases   which perhaps could cause greater difficulty
  towards the middle or towards the end, rather than on the first day when all the press
  will be queued up?

  Mr Fraser - It depends on the nature of the problem really.

  Mr Hetcalf   - I think it would be usualin most Courts to take shorter cases before longer
  ones and if the anticipation is that in some cases there will be a lot of questions, the
  usual thing would be to list them at the end.

4^r   ...... What you might get is a lot of the other families hyped up.

  Hr Jones - I think it should be started as a low key thing and hopefully it     will run that
  way. Whereas if you have the world’s press here on the first few days, the      disadvantage
  is that if they get hold of the timetable, I think they’ll do that anyway.       But I agree,
  the stuff which can be got out of the way without any difficulty should be,      so as not to
  upset them as individuals.

  Hr ....   - Hinimise the trauma really.

  Hr Hetcalf   - Again, if any cases which are going to cause any particular problems are
  last on the list on any given day, then no other family is going to be kept waiting.

  HHC - Structure them within the days as well.

  Hr Fraser - I would say that there is one particular case I can think of that should be
  heard in the morning.

  HHC - If you have any views Hr Fraser you must tell me.

  Hr Fraser - I have to be very careful.

  HHC - I ’m not asking you to tell me now.

  Hr Fraser - There is one family who would   swell the coffers of the local hostelry before
  they arrived, so if they were a 9.00am start.   One other thing, what time will you start
  in terms of travelling?

  HHC - Any thoughts?

  Hr .....    - 9.30am at the latest I would have thought.

^^IHC - Can you do it?

  Hr Hetcalf - There’s no problem from our point of view, I am just thinking about.

  Hr Fraser - An hour and three quarters to     drive but I don’t want to do that    15 days.

  HHC - No but from the families, if it takes two    hours for the journery from Liverpool

  Mr Fraser - A third of them are not from Liverpool.

  Hr ..... - INAUDIBLE      see in fact in the order of the day whether         wecan actually get
  the geography.

  Mr Hetcalf - I would have been inclined to suggest a start at 10.00am and be prepared to
  sit later rather than starting at 9.30am.

  HHC - Iagree. Without a Jury you can sit as long as you       like but with    a Jury   you have
  to stop   for refreshments, etc. W e ’ll have to do the best we can.

^J'he witnesses will be paid in the usual way. There w o n ’t be many witnesses but none
^Hktnesses, that includes family, will not be.

  Mr .... - Do you want to mention the possibility not the probability, the possibility of
  another week being set aside for.

  HMC - W e ’ve chosen the dates because they suited us from a practical point of view but we
  recognise is that there may be INAUDIBLE we want to finish it if at all possible before
  the 4th May. We have tentatively reserved another week, beginning 21st May I think to
  ...... the stragglers or those on holiday.

Dr C Nicholson
Health and Safety Executive
Broad Lane
Sheffield      S3 7HQ


Dear Dr Nicholson

Hi IIsborough

Further to our meeting with you and your colleagues in January in the
company of Deputy Chief Constable Mervyn Jones the Coroners Officer
and his assistant Detective Inspector Perkins, I now take pleasure in
providing the information which was promised.

As indicated to you, whilst I accept the reasons for the appointment
of my practice related to the Third Party litigation, it was stressed
that we were eager to obtain the truth.  As a result a huge amount of
primary research work had been undertaken including the removal of
the remains of barrier 124a to laboratories in West Bromwich where it
had undergone extensive testing under the aegis of the "Experts" by
SGS Inspection Services Limited.  A copy of their report dated 4th
July 1990 has been provided at no cost and should have by now arrived
with you.

It is completely understood that the Coroner’s primary interest is
how 95 people died at Hillsborough.  Whilst there were a number of
other points which were pertinent to the case which the meeting was
intended as a forum to discuss, there were two main points

a      the number of people in pen 3 at the time of the disaster

b      the collapse load of barrier 124a

The Third Parties in the civi I action were of course the South
Yorkshire Police under whose solicitors instruction my own practice
has been acting, the Club whose solicitors Davies Arnold & Cooper
instructed Dr J Weaver BSc (Eng),PhD, DIC, FICE, FIHT and his
colleagues at Sir William Ha Icrow & Partners.  A copy of Dr Weaver’s
two volumes of Report dated 22nd August 1990 are understood to have
been obtained already.  The remaining Third Party was Eastwood &




Telex: 33B 024 Burne   Fax: OS1-454 1173        Cables Firebrand           Registered in England 21 43 44 0
Partners whose representative at the forum of Experts was a
metallurgist A R Entwisle MA PhD FIM, Sheffield University Metals
Advisory Centre.  The Engineering input was to some extent provided
by Mr Sam Thorburn FEng, FICE.  A copy of his Report may be
ava iIabIe.

The majority of the work undertaken by my practice has in addition to
my own regular staff of Engineers been undertaken and checked by Dr
Tim Baker MA, PhD, FIM, CEng of Imperial College and Dr Jim Dickie of
Manchester University.

In respect of the number of people in pen 3 you showed us the A1
enlargement of the Police photograph taken at 15.03 recorded by the
stand clock 15.02 real time.  One corner of the pen was missing but
by the use of computer drafting to digitise all faces that would
clearly be seen and the application of a similar density for the
missing area had been undertaken.

The site of pen 3 had then been divided into four strips based on the
three rows of fences.  The rear three rows taken as extending across
the whole width of the pen 14.355m had a front to back dimension of
2.5m for the rear row, 3.5m for the third row, 3.5m for the second
row and 3.6m for the front row, an overall dimension of 13.1m and a
total area of 188.050 square metres, the front strip being 51.678

             second strip       50.242

             third strip        50.242

             rear strip         35.887

This makes no allowance for cross hatched areas, areas behind the
wing wall at the tunnel entrance, any area in the tunnel itself.  No
allowance in respect of any of the terrace hardware.

Using your densities of 7.5, 7.6, 8.1 and 10 persons per square metre
would give occupancy levels of 269, 381, 406, 516 for each of the
four strips and a gross total of 1572.

Modification of the occupancy     level of the front strip to 8.1would
reduce the total by 100.

You also were kind enough to  show us a further photograph taken from
the north stand at 1452 from  a similar angle to that at 1459 in Lord
Justice Taylor’s Report.  That photograph carries the same problems
as the one which we used in terms of the numbers of persons obscured.
Your figure for pen 3 on the basis of the 1452 photograph is 678.

That compares with our own evaluation as reported in Appendix C of
969, both figures being heavily dependent upon estimates of those
hidden.

Our own evaluation of the occupancy of pen 4 is for an appreciably
greater number of people at 1214 in an area which is 3m2 larger.

In short I am prepared to accept that the figure of actual occupancy
of pen 3 at the time of the collapse of the barrier of 124a was
appreciably higher.  However, after further detailed consideration
the figure of 1400 and an average occupancy of 7.7 per square metre
for 1503 is a preferred figure.  This compares with the Green Guide
density of 5.4 per square metre.

Another way of looking at it is that there were at least 400 people
more in their pen than there should have been without any allowance
being made for gangways or cross hatched areas.

For the record our own evaluation of the videos is that barrier 124a
actually collapsed at between 1505 and 1506.

As promised I have sent to you a copy of the British Standards
Institution book on Ergonomic Standards and Guidelines from which has
been provided the information contained at page 26 of our Report,
chapter 3 relating to Green Guide paragraph 89.

That arrives at a density of 67.5 substantially framed men per 10m2 .
That is an area of occupancy for each individual of .148m2 . The
ellipse of the actual hip area is actually .1mz and with allowances
for clothing arms and the partial spaces between individuals the area
which can be attributed to each substantially framed man is .148m .

If we look at the same effective figures for a fifth percentile of
women as distinct from the ninety fifth percentile of men, the
dimensions for the el I ipse are 310mm and 210mm, the area of the
actual ellipse .051m2 . Allowing for spaces, arms and clothing gives
us .076m2 per small woman and a maximum packing density of 13.16 per
square metre.

For the sake of completeness, if we take the fiftieth percentile of
men, the ellipse dimensions are 465mm x 250mm, an ellipse of .091(11^
with the allowance for clothing, arms and spaces, an area of .135m
and an occupancy of 7.4 per square metre.
Ninety fifth percentile men without any allowance for clothing or
arms would occupy rows of ellipses on a half drop pattern the centre
lines of the rows being 247.9mm apart and a spacing of 510mm giving a
density of only 7.9 per square metre.

The section in my Report dealing with this aspect was primarily to
consider the potential in terms of loading of the barriers.  In terms
of robust substantially framed men the figure of 6.75 per square
metre is comp IeteIy vaIi d .

We next addressed the question of escape routes as identified in our
Appendix M and in respect of the Green Guide requirement at section
96 addressed on pages   27 to 29 of our Report. The figure of 12m
comes directly from BS 5588 whichis the standard work in provision
of proper escape routes.

29.1# of those in pen   3 are beyond 12m from the exit tunnel, the vast
majority being in the   front strip of pen 3 and the remainder in the
southern end of the second strip.

In addition there are a further 4# of the occupants who are more than
12m from the tunnel, but who are less than 12m from the gate in the
radial fence marking the southern perimeter of pen 3, since this is
not a vaIi d emergency ex it .

At the Third Party trial there was considerable discussion in respect
of this aspect which leads to the fundamental conclusion that there
simply were not enough exit gates and there were no proper exit gates
onto the pitch.   In order to comply with the 12m rule there would
have had to have been at least two full size gates onto the pitch
which could be opened by would be escapers and which were suitably
marked.

Leading on from that the Green Guide at chapter 16 addresses the
estimation of safe ground capacity and at clause 220 gives three
methods of evaluating those who can be safely accommodated.

Method A is the capacity of 5.4 persons per 10mz which, as we have
already seen, gives an absolute gross figure of 1,015.

Method B relates tothe numbers who can leave by the normal exit
route in 8 minutes.   As we have indicated at page 51 of our Report
the assessment through a normal exit route is simple to make from
clause 234.  This is on the basis of 60 persons per minute per unit
of exit width of 0.55m.   The tunnel represents 2.7 units of exit
width giving an 8 minute evacuation of 1,334 spectators.
Method C is the number who can leave in an emergency within a time to
be assessed which should not exceed 2 i minutes. At page 52 we have
evaluated the number who can exit in 2i minutes on the basis of 60
per .55m exit width, which means that the tunnel can take only 417
people.

If we take into account the gate in the rear of the radial fence,
this adds another 300 people, a total of 717.

The theoretical capacity   of pitch gate 3, although it was incapable
of being opened by those   who would wish to exit, having a width
of .81m or 1.47 units of   exit width gives a maximum theoretical
capacity of pitch gate 3   as 220.

The maximum capacity figure under chapter 16 therefore is 717 with an
absolute top limit of 937.

Turning now to the failure of barrier 124a, the SGS Materials Report
gives tensile strengths of 499 N/mm2 for the low carbon steel rail 1
to 2, 375 N/mm2 for the wrought iron rai I 2 to 3 and 405 N/mm2 for
the wrought iron rail 3 to 4. These are in fact somewhat higher than
the figures which you had already obtained for rail 3 to 4 of 365
N/mm2 . However, in order to avoid confusion, we have used your
figures throughout in analysing load.

Elastic analysis of the rail 3 to 4 indicates that it would deflect
34.8mm under a load of 6kN/m and that would exceed the elastic limit
for the ra i I.

The SGS photographs of support 3 end of rail 3 to 4 figure 1.17 and
support 3 end of handrai I 2 to 3 figure 1.14 shows that there was
failure of the rail over support 3 which would result in the rail at
3 to 4 become technically simply supported although it would still
remain connected.  Please note that figure 1.14 was originally
erroneously typed as being fractured at support 2 and I trust your
copy has been correct Iy amended.

The rail 3 to 4 under the same loading of 6kN/m run, but now
effectively simply supported, would deflect an increasing amount as
it was already beyond the elastic limit. This deflection would
reduce the bow string dimension to less than the distance apart of
the clips on the top of support 3 and 4, such that

a     There would be a permanent deflection of approximately the
      180mm shown to actually be the case in SGS figure 1.15 and
b     The already corroded support end of rail 3 to 4 would exhibit a
      fracture on a part of the rail and the remainder would pull out
      of the strap on support 4. The detail of this end is seen in
      figure 1.18 of the SGS Report.

During this process of bending before pulling out there would be a
twisting action on the clip to support 4 which would cause lateral
forces to be exerted and cause support 4 to fai I at the lower end of
the rear leg where it had been previously repaired against corrosion,
and at the upper end of the front leg which is the primary point of
vulnerability demonstrated by the on-site testing programmes.

Once the support 4 end of rail 3 to 4 was no longer provided with
adequate support, the portion of tube previously engaged below the
strap on support 4 was bent laterally as the continuing load of
approximately 6kN/m moves the handrail even further forward.

Since the material at support 4 was unable to sustain the loading,   it
deformed and released itself from support 4. At that instant the
total load on support 3 would be

      approximately half the loading on the span 3 to 2 and

      virtually all the loading which had previously been on the span
      3 to 4

Supports 2 and 3 were 2.265m apart and supports 3 to 4 were 2.2m
apart.    In a continuously supported situation there is an attraction
of load to the intermediate support as a result of the continuity.
In a two span configuration this attraction of load can be as much as
24/S. The effect on the intermediate support 3 is that it would carry
appreciably more than half the load on the adjoining spans.    With a
load of 6kN/m the half share would be six times 1.1325 plus 1.1, or
13.4k N . As a result of the continuity this could be increased to
16.6kN and with the pulling out of the remote end of rail 34 from
support 4 would rise     instantaneously to 20kN.

Such a force is more   than sufficient to cause total and collapse
loading on support 3   such as to fold it to the ground in the position
in which it was found, but all of which had originated only from a
maximum load on the rail of 6kN/m.

The testing of the barriers is covered comprehensively in Annexe C of
the Green Guide which is addressed in pages 57 onwards of my Report.
The 6kN/m run load was applied via the Eastwood test rig to barrier
124a specifically in June 1983 and on 19th July 1988.

The load is intended to be applied in ten equal increments and a
record of any deformation during loading, maintained loading or
recovery period is required to be retained.   There is at clause 4 a
requirement for the force to be applied and maintained for five
minutes in each of three consecutive periods.

What actually happened in the tests was that the load was applied in
one single increment, held for a notional five minutes and then
removed, the deflections of rails centrepoint only being measured.

In our own testing using both the Eastwood rig and the SGS rig the
load was applied in increments and deflections were measured both at
mid span and the supports.   The objective was to measure the
deflection of the support and the additional deflection of the rail
in relation to the support.   However, even in this incremental
application of load the deflection dial gauges were still rotating at
the end of five minutes.   In other words, the real deflection was not
all completed despite the passage of time as a result of the
incremental application of load and the time taken to measure a
considerable series of dial gauges.   In other words, we do not
believe that the 1983 and 1988 measurements of deflection were
accurate.  They were optimistic.

We have also discussed at length the fact that each of the three
periods was treated as a separate test and the dial gauges were re­
zeroed each time rather than being measured continuously.  The
consequent ratchet effect is discussed at page 60 of our Report
showing that the real permanent deflection achieved by the tests
under less than 6kN/m was substantially greater than that perceived
by the Eastwood technicians.  Had they perceived the test in the way
that we believe is appropriate, the barrier would have been failed
and replaced.  Dr Eastwood is the only one Engineer of whom I am
aware, despite enquiry from a considerable body of technical opinion,
who feels that his technician’s interpretation was appropriate.

Even with the shortcomings of interpretation, there were actual
failures of uprights achieved by the 1983 and 1988 tests.     141
particularly had failed and been repaired at the centre support.     The
repair plates can be seen at photograph 7 of Appendix F page 31 of
volume 2 of our Report.    The photograph also shows how, with a load
of 6kN/m run, the rearleg failed again    by a tension necking failure
on the forward flange.    This photograph also shows the compression
failure of the front leg caused by bowing of both legs of the angle
on the front part of the support.


                                    7
Barrier 123 also shows an identical failure at the first rivet hole
on the rear leg at photograph 3 page FI7 of our Report.  The loading
again was 6kN/m under the Eastwood rig.

One of the difficulties in attempting to correlate the various
testing is that there is clearly a wide disparity in the quality of
materials actually in the barriers themselves.  We have already seen
the disparity between the material characteristics in handrail 1 to
2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4 on 124a from the SGS tests.

In reality there was a preference for the SGS rig as a means of
applying actual loading but regrettably there was confusion on site
because of the load cell calibration certificate.  I have pleasure in
attaching hereto a replacement Appendix G for our Report with the
corrected calibrations.  From this you will be able to see

      Barrier 124 had a centre support rear leg failure at around
      6kN/m and with a permanent deflection of the support of 35mm
      after holding 7kN/m for five minutes.

      128a failed at the centre support of the rear leg at less than
      7kN/m.

      132 was the new barrier used for correlation purposes and shows
      very satisfactory recovery.

      The uprights of 138 were tested individually to see what they
      were capable of carrying and we concluded that an actual load
      of l6kN would cause failure.

I have already indicated the reservations that we have concerning the
Eastwood & Partners test rig particularly where the bolts which are
supposed to act as pin joints are tightened up. There is in fact
substantial horizontal load induced by the configuration.  Indeed,
during one of the tests the whole rig physically moved laterally with
a violent reaction.

We have reanalysed 124a using the CADS analyse programme.    We have
made allowances for a reduction in thickness from 4mm nominal to 3.5
nominal for   corrosion and imposed a load of IkN/m to rails with a
factor of 1 to 7 to a I lowfor a range of loadings.

We conclude   for a load of 5kN/m the maximum support moment of
2.519kNm the elastic stress in the tube would be 305N/mm2 . For a
yield stress of 294N/mmz this would give a UDL for yield of only
4.82kN/m.

We have looked at the reactions on support 3 under 6kN/m run and if
the rail was continuous the loading on support 3 would be 14.856 kN,
but in a non-continuous situation 11.814 kN. The instantaneous
reaction at support 3 with the rail having parted from support 4 at 6
kN/m run the reaction at the support 3 would be 26.418 kN assuming
full continuity still, but in the position of a crack having occurred
in the uphill face of the rail there could well be a reduction to
20.676 kN. This validates the point made in our Report that the
combined stress would create a yield in the rear leg of the handrail
of 124a at a rail loading of 5.25 kN/m run.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,


I think that it is pretty disgusting that this cas#
of maligning the police and wrongfully accusing them
of not doing their job at the Hillsborough Football
Ground.     I wrote to you on the 5th July 1989 and told
you that I witnessed the whole of that affair and I
know quite well that it was the drunken Liverpool
supporters who caused the trouble.


If you check your records you will find that one
policeman was on the floor being kicked and that
four men were trying to take another man of his
horse.    I also saw a man put his arm around a post
and people climbed up his back onto the top terraces
but they were throw back down again.     I know I was not
the only one to have witnessed this.     I have no
intention of not backing the police when I know they
are right.     I suggest the Government conscripts
men from 14 upwards in to the army and teach them to
be citizens and to protect people.


I do hope that Superintendent Dukinfield will not be
victimised.


Yours sincerely,

HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - WEST MIDLANDS POLICE INVOLVEMENT


I forward herewith a letter dated 6th March, from the Coroner Dr S.L. POPPER, in
respect of the continued involvement of the West Midlands Police in the
Hillsborough Inquests.  The letter is self explanatory with his wishes clearly
stated. Whether I can respond to those wishes will depend on the financial
considerations within your remit and the operational appropriateness within mine.

I fully expect that the Jury will not return their verdicts until some time after
Easter and therefore into the new financial year. However, it is highly likely
that all the witnesses will have been called and their evidence heard before
Easter.  This will significantly reduce the workload of the West Midlands Police
team under my command.  The Coroner also shares the view that all the evidence
will probably have been heard before Easter. What will remain therefore after
Easter will be legal submissions, the Coroner’s summing-up, and the retirement of
the Jury to consider the verdicts.

 Clearly it will be necessary to retain existing members of my team but in all
 conscience I do not believe that I can justify the expenditure that would be
 incurred by retaining the whole team right until the end of the Inquests.
 However, we will need some.

 It had always been my intention subject to your approval, to retain three West
 Midlands Police Officers and one c l e r k / typist for the month of April to undertake
 the handover of the product of the investigation to you. However, they cannot
 start that process for obvious reasons until the Inquests have concluded.        Those
 Officers and myself would be able to assist the Coroner on a full-time basis
 until the conclusion.                    •

                                                          Sheffield


      PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                         -2-



The second issue is an operational consideration, but could have a financial
implication for South Yorkshire. My team of West Midlands Police Officers have
been fully engaged in the investigation followed by attendance at the Inquests.
It is my intention not to use any of my existing staff as Jury Officers for good
reasons.  The Coroner has asked me to explore the provision of "Jury Officers"
from elsewhere but for his good reasons, which I share, he would not wish to
allow this important task to fall to any persons who did not understand their
role.  If I fail to secure suitable Jury Officers from another source, and it
falls as a task to m e , I will arrange for three Police Officers who have had no
previous involvement to be recruited from West Midlands or elsewhere.    The cost
of hotel, subsistence and travelling for these three Officers together with the
retained four as well as myself will obviously have to be met.    It is hoped that
these costs will not be incurred for too long into the new financial year.

Before I respond to the Coroner, I would welcome your views and decisions on
these two issues.  I understand they are likely to be addressed at a meeting this
afternoon at Snig Hill by your senior staff with those from West Midlands.

To assist I have copied this letter to them and to the Coroner for his
information.

 As I know you are fully aware, it had been hoped that the Hillsborough Inquests
 would have been completed and verdicts returned by mid-February.  That was not to
 be and now on my best estimation I cannot see verdicts being returned until at
 least the week-ending Friday 5th April, 1991.

  The existing West Midlands Police team will disband on Thursday 28th March 1991,
  and the Officers returned that day to their home stations. However, subject to
  the approval of Mr R HADFIELD, I did intend to retain three officers to assist me
  in finally handing over to South Yorkshire Police the product of the
  investigation.  This will in my best estimation take up the month of April at the
  most.  This proposal is also subject to the fact that there is no need to re-open
  the criminal investigations following the evidence yet to come, the verdicts
  and/or any future communications you may raise with the Director of Public
  Prosecutions which require further work.  The remainder of this letter is based
  on the assumption that the Jury verdicts mark the end.

  You are also fully aware of the difficult financial circumstances that South
  Yorkshire Police operate under now and in the new financial year. As I
  understand it, no budgetary provision has been made for West Midlands Police
  involvement after Easter.  It seems therefore, subject to any alternative
  agreement being struck between the Chief Constables of South Yorkshire and West
  Midlands, that if the Inquests resume after Easter there will be no West Midlands
   Police involvement.

   Of course that may not matter very much in that all the work will probably have
   been completed, and all that remains is the overseeing of the Jury whilst they
   consider the evidence and return their verdicts.  If you have any queries these
   probably could be adequately handled by the three retained officers (subject to
   them being approved, of course).

raises an important issue regardless of timing and finance.

I did not intend to allow any West Midlands officers who presently^support me to
look after the Jury during their deliberations.   The reason for this is that they
all have been heavily involved in the investigation since the early days a n d h a v e
a deep knowledge of the disaster.   They have also spent a considerable time in
Court hearing the evidence before the Jury. Detective Sergeant GRIFFITHS is a
good example.  He was the statement reader to the investigation and he has read
every statement taken and has been involved in the taking of some. His duties
have been restricted to Court Usher throughout although he has been absent on
some days.  To date I do not believe his limited contact with the Jury could have
possibly compromised his professionalism.   If he were to look after the Jury he
could be approached quite inadvertently or otherwise by a Jury member.

difficulties not least of all presentationally. Similar circumstances apply to
my other officers and I owe it to them not to put them into positions where they
could be subject of complaint.   In that respect, I do not think either of us
underestimate the depth of feelings amongst the various parties to this disaster.

To overcome this difficulty, my thoughts are as follows.  I think it would be
highly appropriate for you to recruit (at Sheffield City’s expense?) persons
experienced in such matters.  For example, could the local Crown Court help
provide staff?

I would be grateful for your views on these two important issues so that they can
be considered without delay by the two Police Forces involved.

 act as Jury Officers given the potential verdicts relative to the involvement of
 all parties but especially the South Yorkshire Police.

Dear Mervyn
HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - FINALISATION
Thank you for your letter of 5th March 1991. I hope you are wrong
about the date but I fear you may well be right. I note what you
say with regard to the dispersal of the West Midlands team but may
I say that I would be unhappy to see that happen. The whole
principle has been to have West Midlands officers acting as my
Coroner's officers and it would seem to me to be a shame, apart
from being very disruptive, if over the last few days a different
system had to be implemented.
I note that you wish to retain some officers to assist you with the
handover but whilst of course I appreciate that you and they would
do all you could to help me, it is clear from what you say that
their involvement is more directed to withdrawal of West Midlands
from the enquiry rather than their functioning as Coroner's officers.
I appreciate that there are financial aspects involved because of the
unfortunate timing of the end of the financial year, but my position
is, simply stated, that I consider it essential that we maintain as
many of the existing team of Coroner's officers as are necessary to
ensure the smooth operation of the court and the Coronal effort.
That if necessary some further allocation of resources are mad,e.
If the times are correct, these are not likely to amount to a great
deal of money. In particular, I think it is absolutely essential
that Peter Griffiths as Court Usher remains available as well as at
least one officer who knows how to handle the video equipment and
can find his way around the cassettes and photographs.

                                                                           /continued.

Mr J Mervyn Jones
Deputy Chief Constable


With regard to the supervision of the Jury, I can understand your
point. My view has always been that, irrespective of what other
activities the officers might have been involved in, their present
function is as Coroner's officers and as such I would expect them
to be available to supervise the Jury. It may be that it would be
wiser not to use some of the officers who have been directly
involved in the last few months in order to avoid any misperceptions
but I do not think in principle it should be objectionable to use
West Midlands officers for this task. It is a responsible one and one
which I would be extremely reluctant to see fulfilled by persons who
have no experience or understanding of their responsibilities in this
regard. I have noted your suggestion about recruiting experienced
personnel but, whilst it may be worth exploring the possibility with
the Crown Court, I have my doubts as to whether it will work in practice.
In summary then:-
1.     Irrespective of the fall of the financial year, I do not
       wish to see the Coronal team disbanded until the conclusion
        of the Inquest and appropriate financial resources should
        be made available for this to be achieved.
2.     Unless one could make completely adequate alternative
        arrangements for Jury supervision, I consider it essential
        that this task continues to be undertaken by my Coroner's
        officers, which in this context are West Midlands Police
        officers.
Yours sincerely

P.S.    Incidentally, I would normally expect South Yorkshire Police
        to provide me with my Coroner's officers and although it may
        be that the cost of the West Midlands officers is a little
        higher, there would still be a cost to South Yorkshire if
        we simply substituted their officers for West Midlands.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - FINALISATION


As I know you are fully aware, it had been hoped that tha Hillsborough Inquests
would have been completed and verdicts returned by mid-February. That was not to
be and now on my best estimation I cannot see verdicts being returned until at
least the week-ending Friday 5th April, 1 9 9 1 .

The existing West Midlands Police team will disband on Thursday 28th March 1 9 9 1 ,
and the Officers returned that day to their home stations. However, subject to
the approval of Mr R HADFIELD, I did intend to retain three officers to assist me
in finally handing over to South Yorkshire Police the product of the
investigation.  This will in my best estimation take up the month of April at the
most.  This proposal is also subject to the fact that there is no need to re-open
the criminal investigations following the evidence yet to come, the verdicts
and/or any future communications you may raise with the Director of Public
Prosecutions which require further work.  The remainder of this letter is based
on the assumption that the Jury verdicts mark the end.

You are also fully aware of the difficult financial circumstances that South
Yorkshire Police operate under now and in the new financial year. As I
understand i t , no budgetary provision has been made for West Midlands Police
involvement after Easter. It seems therefore, subject to any alternative
agreement being struck between the Chief Constables of South Yorkshire and West
Midlands, that if the Inquests resume after Easter there will be no West Midlands
Police involvement.

Of course that may not matter very much in that all the work will probably have
been completed, and all that remains is the overseeing of the Jury whilst they
consider the evidence and return their verdicts. If you have any queries these
probably could be adequately handled by the three retained officers (subject to

MEMORANDUM

TO:   MR J M JONES


Dear Mervyn
You will be aware that Davies W a l H s Foyster have written to
Detective Superintendent Beechey requesting a copy of Mr R Thomas1s
statement and have enclosed an authority signed by him for it to
be released. Mr Thomas is a supporter.
You wil also be aware that Mr Devonside requested Dr Nicholson to
give him a copy of the HSE report, which I understand Dr Nicholson
in principle is prepared to do.
As I have already indicated to you, my view is that there is very
little merit in a rigid application of non-disclosure, particularly
inaa case like Mr Thomas where a consent has been signed and where,
in lieue of disclosure, I would be quite prepared to call the
witness.
You will also be aware that I have taken the view that I do not have
authority to order disclosure of statements which I have used or
have produced, but that does not alter ajy view as expressed above*
I appreciate that there may be other considerations but you can see
that it does create a certain degree of embarrassment or, at the
very least, an increase in workload by calling witnesses who otherwise
might possibly be despensible. Bearing in mind that we are approaching
the end of the inquest, it may be that we can deal with Hr Thomas by
calling him and letting him tell the story, but certainly 1f there
was any increase in requests I think it is essential that a review
of disclosure policy is undertaken.
I have no objection if you think it appropriate for you to copy this
letter to South Yorkshire Police.
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Popper

I am writing on behalf on my son Tony Campbell, who attended the Inquest into the
Hillsborough Disaster on Tuesday 22nd January.

Tony was very nervous at the thought of attending the inquest, but was reassured by one
of your officers that the inquest was to be held in a small room with four or five people
present.

When we arrived at the Town Hall to attend the inquest, we were show'll into a large
court room, I enquired if this was the room Tony was to attend and was told it was.

We were all shocked to discover that there were members of the public, press, I think
twelve barristers, their clerks, a jury as well as Mr Popper the coroner and his clerk.

This proved to be a very traumatic experience for Tony and he was completely taken
aback to face this ordeal.

I feel I must draw this episode to your attention and I wonder if any other witnesses
have been mislead in this way.

Yours sincerely_______ (_________

Dear Mrs Campbell
Thank you for your letter of 23 January 1991.
From the enquiries I have had made it does not seem that the information
regarding the size and location of the Inquest came from my listing
officers, nor would I have expected it to       come from them or indeed any
other member of my Coronal team, as it is       common knowledge within that
team, and also I suspect elsewhere, that I have been sitting in the
Council Chamber with a jury and substantial legal representation, since
19 November 1990. Your son was in fact about the 137th witness whom
we have heard in that location.
Apart from some misunderstanding, the only other possibility that occurs
to me is that the information you received came to you from a different
source, although I find it difficult to understand how even that may
have happened, bearing in mind the magnitude of these Inquests, which
after all involve the death of 95 people.
Be all that as 1t may, I am of course very sorry that you have been upset.
It Is certainly not my wish or intention that anyone should be misled,
and you will no doubt be interested to learn that Iam not aware of any
other witnesses who have written to me in       a similar vein to yourself.
Yours sincerely

               I have been speaking to the West Midlands Police, and it is to mv
               understanding- that, after the Inquiry has finished, you will be able to
               release copies of the Hillsborough Video.

               M y boyfriend, Ian Whelan, was as the match and was killed.                     The police
               has identified him in the crowd alive, and both myself and                     his parents
               have seen this.

               I would like a copy of the video, but only the bits where he is seen alive
               i6r personal reasons I do not wish for the surge or any of the crushing
               on the copy of the video.

              In his file, which myself end his parents have seen, there are photographs
              taken of him in the crowd, again alive. If possible, I would uk- a copv of
              these as well.       —                                         ~                     ^

w       M R ALAN KEITH SEAMAN - ASSISTANT CHIEF FIRE OFFICER

        You will recall that a verbal approach was made to Sergeant Griffiths on 3rd
        December last year for you to consider calling the above named as a witness to
        your Inquests.

        W e have caused enquiries to be made of M r Seaman's evidence and it occurs to
        me that this person is an important witness. He is particularly important in
        that he goes into considerably more detail than does Dr Eastwood or M r
        Bownes.   Indeed the latter almost "gloss over’1 many of the Issues but Mr
        Seaman is able to provide very useful and detailed information.

        As you know, on Friday last, in company with Detective Inspector Perkins, I
        had    a meeting at the      HSE  offices with Elrond Engineering Limited
        representatives.   The outcome of that meeting will be subject of a separate
        letter to you but there is no doubt that Elrond have brought out some issues
        which are of interest.

        For example, matters that affect the breaking of the barrier, the wa y in which
        it broke, the corrosion and the timing of the fractures. It could be suggested
        b y Elrond that Dr Eastwood may have been negligent for had he applied the
        tests as Elrond believe he should then the barrier 124a would have been
        rejected before 15th April 1989.

        Elrond also raise the question of distances to escape routes and again they
        indicate that the green guide has been ignored in respect of the number of
        escape routes from the pens. In essence, there should be an escape gate no
        further than twelve metres away from any one point. This should have meant
        that there would have been at least two properly constructed escape gates in
        the perimeter fencing on the playing field side.

        There is no doubt that this may become an issue and certainly H a m m o n d
        Suddards would want to examine the detail. In m y view I think it would be
        appropriate to call M r Seaman and you may think he ought to be examined by
        you before Mr Bownes or M r Butler’s re-examination on Wednesday.

                                                                                 /Continued

          You may, when you have read m y other letter on last Friday’s meeting, want to
          have a discussion with Dr Nicholson.

          I forward herewith copies of the relevant documentation that we have from M r
          Seaman for your consideration.

          I look forward to your response.

I hope you are now fully recovered after your illness and have started the new
year in full spirits; my best wishes to you.

For your information, we continue to support            the Coroner running his inquests
here in Sheffield, and my best prediction is            that they undoubtedly will run into
March if not the end of it. They are taking             considerably longer than either the
Coroner or myself intended mainly because of            the interest  by the various parties
as you and I have already discussed.

In the light of the latter, and because there is a great danger of widening the
inquests too much, the Coroner is in the process of reviewing his needs as far as
evidence is concerned.  In this respect he would have liked to have called you
but he is genuinely concerned about the feasibility given the experience of the
inquests to date. He agrees with me that your expert evidence of matters away
from Hillsborough would be very interesting, but because of the need to focus on
the "how" people died he does not intend to ask you either to do any further work
on the topics discussed or to call you to give evidence on the generality of
issues already discussed.

However, there is one area he has asked me to address to you. Can you, or
somebody you know, help him as an expert on the effect on behaviour that alcohol
can have on individuals, groups and a crowd overall in a situation such as
Hillsborough? If you can, or know somebody, perhaps a brief telephone call from
the Coroner could follow to help him decide if it helps his Jury discover more
about the "how" people died.




     PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT         .Sheffield
I hope that   our discussions to date have not inconvenienced you too much, and
that you do   not take any offence about the probable decision of the Coroner not
to call you   (subject to the alcohol consideration), but I can assure you, it is
made purely   for pragmatic reasons.

With best wishes.

    I have had discussions with Dr NICHOLSON and also Mr V. 0 ’CALLAGHAN (Davies
    Arnold Cooper), and they have advised me that neither the UMIST expert, Dr
    DICKIE, or the Halcrow Consultant, Dr WEAVER, support Mr BURNE’s view that the
    collapse of 124A occurred at 5.25 K/Nm.

    As a consequence, I have taken the liberty of arranging a meeting for you with Dr
    NICHOLSON and Mr GAMES at 4.15pm on Wednesday 30th January 1991, at your office
    at the Town Hall when you may care to discuss what you would like them to
    prepare.

POLICE CONSTABLE


On the afternoon of Thursday 24th February 1991, I was approached by Miss
ADELMAN, Counsel representing the, interests of South Yorkshire Police
Federation.  She raised her concern about the calling of the above named
vis-a-vis his mental state.

I advised her that you had received the most recent Doctor’s letter and that you
were sensitive to its contents. Confidentially, I advised her you were
considering three possible courses of action:-

(1 )            not calling              and leaving it at that without explanation

(2)              if non-attendance raised to deal with the matter "in chambers" with all
                 the legal representatives, or

(3)             calling the Doctor to open Court.

Miss ADELMAN was not attracted to the third option, and gave the good reason that
Police Constable|        had no knowledge of the contents of the Doctor’s letter.
If a discussion centred on his health and was reported, this could be, and
probably would b e , detrimental to his health.

I recommend proposal one, and I agreed with her that if you were minded to pursue
(2) or (3) I would advise her beforehand.

Dear Doctor Popper

                       Re: Police Constable

I understand that the above patient may still be required to take the
stand at the current inquest into the circumstances surrounding the
'Hillsborough Disaster” on 15th April 1989.

I have been looking after him in my capacity as his General Practitioner
and he has had a total of thirty two consultations directly attributable
to the above incident.  The first consultation was on 11th July 1989.

I believe that you have already had sight of a medical certificate that
I issued on 6th November 1990 in which I stated that an appearance at
the inquest would be likely to be very harmful to            health,
wonder if the following details will assist you in understanding the
reasons for issuing that certificate.

Since the d i s a s t e r h a s required continuous and intensive
treatment from myself and other health care professionals.   He remains
on treatment and has only shown marginal improvement in his severe
depressive illness.   He has demonstrated a significant suicidal risk
which has been confirmed by Professor Sims of the Department of
Psychiatry at the University of Leeds.

It remains my opinion that the distress induced by having to give
further testimony in a court of law poses the high risk of him suffering
a relapse with consequent exacerbation of the suicidal risk.  It is for
this reason that I feel he should not be required to testify.

Yours sincerely,




Dr J G Benjamin.

P.S. If required to appear in court myself, I would be grateful if this
could be arranged for a Thursday or Friday afternoon with as much prior
warninq as possible.__________________ ;

ELROND/HSB MEETING - 18.1.91




I have pleasure in forwarding a report from the H.S.E. which summarises the
position.

You will note that H.S.E. would like to see that part of Dr WEAVER’s report
(HALCROW) which deals with the barrier. I have made a request to the sponsors of
the report DAVIES ARNOLD COOPER (Mr Vincent O ’CALLAGHAN), and I await their
response, if any (1).

How would you like to proceed? I would suggest that we see if the Club are
prepared to release the extract, then, either way for you to meet Dr NICHOLSON
and discuss.

FILE NOTE DICTATED 5.                 'ING ON 2 7 . 2 . 9 0 .
PRESENT: MERVYN JONES                  MR. TOAjffijR AND DR. POPPER.



This meeting was recorded but the tapes have not as yet been typed.
The main points which were discussed were as follows

   1.   It was explained that the Inquest if resumed would be of
        a limited nature designed to give the medical cause of death
        and if possible to trace the whereabouts of the deceased.
        The evidence would be presented by means of a summary by
        a West Midlands Police Officer and we would probably also
        use the Anna Cappas which were in effect summaries with
        time scales on them.
        It was made clear that no South Yorkshire Police Officers
        would be called and that there would be no opportunity for
        a cross-examination.   The object of the exercise was that this
        would be a very non-adversarial hearing designed in the main
        to give as much information as possible to the relatives of
        a nature, but the information to be limited to matters which
        were not contraversial or under investigation by the D.P.P.
        It was made clear that in the interests of the bereaved, that
        nothing should be done to harm or hinder the Inquiry by the D.P.P.
        quite apart from any other considerations.


        Some disquiet was expressed about the summaries but it was made
        clear that I would see all the summaries sdnd all the statements
        before the Inquests (i intended to read all the 95 case files)
        and the solicitors were somewhat re-assured by that.
        We also said that we would send out, certainly to the bereaveds
        solicitors a copy of the summary before the hearing so that they
        could be acquainted of the circumstances. I will probably also
        send a copy to Hammond Suddards though I would be reluctant to
        circulate everybody else.
        The questions of photographs and videos were discussed.          I explained
        that we would not be using a video and that on the whole I was
        very reluctant to use photographs or blow-ups.          We would have them
        available, but in many cases families had already seen them, and
        in any case I preferred to rely on the plans rather than the
        photographs which were difficult to identify in some cases.
        I accepted that there might be some cases where we would have to
        look at the odd photograph.
        We discussed the presence of the pathologists.          I said that my initial
        intention had been to call the pathologist to all the Inquest
        but that upon reflection it might be possible to have one pathologist
        give an overall view of the general pathology of Traumatic Asphyxia
        and then merely to call pathologists to those cases where there
        were some complexity or where there was a particular reason why
        he should attend.   This seemed to be acceptable.         I also said that
we intended to prove     Dr. Forrest's evidence in one go
so as to avoid him having to be present at the Inquests for
weeks on end.    This also appeared to be acceptable, but again
I said if there were the odd case where his presence might be
required then I would certainly consider calling him.
I also said that it might be that I would take some statements
by way of documentary evidence or viva versa.    This was the
main reason for sending out the summary so that solicitors
could indicate whether they we tb satisfied with the contents
or if not if they could indicate where they needed further
elaboration, so that I could consider what to do.
We explained that we hoped to commence shortly after Easter
if all went well at the pre-inquest review on the 6th of March.
I explained that we would have to sit with a Jury.    I was not
very happy about this but I felt on balance it was the only
sensible thing to do in the circumstances.
We indicated that we hoped to deal with 8 cases a day.
We indicated that we would like the Hillsborough Support Group
involved but that we felt that it would be better if apart
from communications from us with regard to the date of any
individual Inquest, that contact was done through the Steering
Committee or Solicitors as appropriate.    Mr. Frazer pointed
out that there was a technical difficulty in that agreement
had not yet been reached for the funding of representation
at the Inquests.     If this were not forthcoming, problems
could arise.
We also discussed the various options which were open to me
some depending upon the decision of the D.P.P. e.g., no action
Inquest resumed and prosecution by D.F.F. Inquest adjourned under
Section 16.     Ho prosecution but private prosecution, Inquest
probably adjourned under Section 16.
We spent a little time discussing the order in which people would
be called.     I said that we had started out with the premise that
it should be in pathologists order but this could create difficulties.
We were looking at it and it was quite a difficult matter.        Mr.
Frazer thought that it might be the most difficult thing.
Both solicitors felt that in view of the nature of the proceedings
they did not anticipate that many questions would have to be asked
at this hearing.
We discussed the transcripts.     I explained that I intended to have
shorthand writers, like the Public Inquiry but that we would try
and bind each individual Inquest separately.     I did not intend-
that the transcript would be avilable on the day following but
within a reasonable time and copies would be available at the
usual charge which was now 80p per photocopied sheet.
We discussed the accommodation.     I pointed out what we had
available and that we were thinking of possibly getting some Portacabins.
The Press were mentioned and it was acknowledged that perhaps they
would be present but it was assummed that after the initial rush interest
would be lost.
We confirmed that we were intending to arrange for tea, biscuit^s and
possibly sandwiches to be available.
I explained that if in view of the rate at which we wanted to go, it
would be essential that solicitors were ready to proceed without fail
and if they wanted to see their clients after the Inquests they would
have to have somebody there in order to do that.    Mr. Jones pointed out
that it was intended that the Summarising Officer would only present
one case per day so that they would be available for liaison work
and shepherding families about.
Mr. Jones made it clear towards the end of the meeting that there would
be no opportunity for cross-examination and that nothing that was aaid
or done at this Inquest would be permitted to impede the D.P.P's
inquiries.
It was made absolutely clear to the solicitors that no decision had
yet been taken by the D.P.P. regarding the possibility of prosecution or not
and indeed that he was not in a position to take such a decision as the
paperwork had not yet been delivered to him.
It was not anticipated that the paperwork would be hgztd^(| to h-fm prior
to the commencement of the Inquest though it would/be done shortly
thereafter and possibly before we concluded.

 VIDEO TAPE RECORDING OF INTERVIEWS - HILLSBOROUGH


 I refer to your letter of 9th January 1991, in respect of the above topic and
 your possible attendance at the Inquests. I fully appreciate your difficulties
 in not attending especially with the very short notice.

 As it happens, on Thursday 10th January 1991, we did show forty five minutes of
 the video tape recording.  However, after lunch we ran into difficulties on a
 related issue in respect of the reading of a statement referred to in the actual
 interview.  During the course of legal submissions the question of video tapes
 and their evidential status and value was discussed.

 Following the legal submissions, the Coroner decided not to use the video
 evidence but to rely upon the viva voce evidence of the witness, in this case
 Superintendent MARSHALL. Whether the Coroner will use the video taped evidence
 of interviews for the other witnesses is far from certain, but I would think
 unlikely unless a witness contradicts something significantly which has
 previously been said by him on earlier interview under caution.

 To help you understand the debate, I forward herewith for your information and
 retention the transcripts of the relevant discussions. I hope these are helpful.

 If there are further developments I will keep you informed.      In the meantime,
 best wishes.

                   DRAFT FOR INSERTION INTO LETTER TO HAMMOND SUPDARDS

          There are several points where the opinion expressed within the
          reports differ from the findings contained within HSEreports and
          the two major areas are as follows:
          1.   Number of people in Fen 3

         The Elrond report concludes that 'the balance of probability is
         that the real number of occupants was nearer to 1200 .... than the
         preferred estimate of the HSE at 1576*. This conclusion appears to
         be based on the analysis of a photograph that was of significantly
         inferior definition to those analysed by HSE.

         The HSE estimate is not a maximum and no allowance was madein the
         estimate for any 'missed' or 'obscured' heads. HSE made the
         assumption that the density in the front row (the pitch side of
         Barrier 124A) was 10/sg metre, but the remaining three rows were
         actual counts of observed heads from photographs. Even if the
         assumption had been made that the density in the front row was the
         same as the HSE counted density of the second row, then an estimate
         of 1478 for the total in Pen 3 is obtained, again with no allowance
         for any obscured heads, it is worth noting that the Elrond report
         indicates that densities as high as 12.5/sq metre are possible.
         2.    Collapse load of Barrier I24A

         In the Elrond report there is much technical argument on the merits
         of the 'Eastwood Rig' and on the measured plastic deformations, at
         loads less than 6 XN/m, that occurred on several barriers tested
         both before and after the disaster, it is HSE's opinion, based on
         analysis, that the Eastwood Rig was a reasonably practical solution
         to the provision of a uniformly distributed load, and analysis
         shows that the rig produces bending moments on the top rail that
         are more severe than those from a uniformly distributed load.

         HSE's analysis shows that yielding of the support legs and the top
         rail of a typical 'old type' barrier will occur at loads less than
         6 kN/m and the analysis is in broad agreement with the Elrond
         report. However, there appears to be a lack of clarity in the
         Elrond criteria for failure. There is a significant difference
         between the load to collapse a barrier and the load that causes
         sufficient yielding so that the barrier fails the Green Guide
         criteria.

         However, in the incident, for the top rail to have become bent to
         the shape in which it was found would require the support legs to
         have provided sufficient reaction to support the rail during the
         time during which the rail was bending. Hence, HSE are of the
         opinion that the collapse sequence for Barrier 124A was that the
         top rail deformed to its present shape before the collapse of the
         support legs. The maximum load that the barrier sustained is
         therefore the load to deform the top rail and not the load to
         collapse a support leg. HSE therefore disagree with the conclusion
         in the Elrond report that Barrier 124A collapsed at a load of
         5.25 ICN/ra (page 6 para 6), this being the test load that caused
         yielding, but did not collapse the centre support of Barrier 131.
         HSE's estimate of the collapse load, based on a test of a similar

                                            1
HSE* SHEFFIELD            TEL N o .0742 755792        14,12,90   14:47   P.04




       top rail, was 8.1 kN/m, and the details are given in HSE report
       IR/L/ME/89/36.
       The Elrond report states that the 'HSE study concludes that the
       6 kN/m test load is not adequate' but does not qualify the
       statement. The HSE report actually stated 'Given that the gap in
       the row of barriers behind 124A was greater than that recommended
       in the Green Guide, the test load of 6 kN/m was inadequate.'

FILE NOTE DICTATED 4.12.90.     CONVERSATION WITH MERVYN JONES

ON 2 .12 .90 .____________________________ _________________________

We discussed again the question of Mr. McCauley's evidence

relating to the Manchester match.        I told Mervyn that I had

had further thoughts on the matter and that it was my view

that it was permissable for Mr.       McCauley to give evidence

as to what he actually saw on that occasion but that I

would not allow him to give any reasons or explanations as

to why the situation had occurred.        I explained to Mervyn

that the reason for my thinking was that we had

a. Allowed people to give recollections of the 1988 match

   and perhaps o t h e r s .

b. The plan at present was to call expert evidence.

c. I couldn't see how one could intelligently discuss the

   issues with some of the witnesses,       particularly police

   officers without allowing them to refer back.           It

   clearly would be unfair to exclude one particular

   witnesses.

d. That the evidence of course was a double edged one,           for

    on the one hand it tended to show a previous similar

    incident, but on the other,      no crowd injury occurred.

I had discussed this matter with Jim Turnbull as well and

by and large he said this was the correct way of dealing

with it, when I put it to him.

Mervyn was not particularly enamoured of the idea, but we

agreed that we would discuss it further when we actually

met.

  management and control.                                                         ^

    Consequently, it seems sensible to remind operators that under the Sporting Events
    (Control of Alcohol Etc) Act 1985 it is an offence for a person knowingly to cause
    or permit intoxicating liquor to be carried on a public service vehicle, (a) if
    he is the operator of the vehicle or the servant or agent of the operator or (b)
    if the vehicle is a hired vehicle and he is the person to whom it is hired, or the
    servant or agent of that person and the vehicle is being used to convey passengers
    to a designated sporting event. Also the police have found that the arrival of
    supporters at grounds hours in advance of kick-off time, creates many problems and
    they have specifically asked for co-operation on the following:-

       1.   Coaches should arrive at the venue no earlier than one hour before the
       scheduled start.

       2.   Coaches attending designated sporting events should not stop within ten
       miles of the final destination.

P      3.   Coaches should not stop at any place where intoxicating liquor is available..

       4.   Departure from the venue should be within one hour of the end of the event.

    Whilst the above is a general guideline, the Commissioner expects operators carrying
    supporters to sporting events, especially football matches, to co-operate fully
    with the police.

    Under Section 16(3) of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 the Traffic Commissioner
    has powers to place conditions on an operators licence relating to journeys to and
    from designated sporting events. However, at this time the Commissioner does not
    intend to use this power but the Police have been asked to notify him of any incident
    where problems have occurred. He will then consider whether conditions should be
    imposed.

    X am sure that the Traffic Commissioner can rely on your co-operation, and in view

    of his close interest in this matter I will be grateful if you can acknowledge receipt
    Of this letter, perhaps confirming your commitment to assist wherever possible in
    this area of deep public concern.

    Finally, I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.

  Dear Madam,

  REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE O F INFORMATION

  I refer to your letter regarding your request for copies of statements in
  connsction w i t h your son Paul.

  The policy on the release of information is as follows

  The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West. Midlands Police
  back in April 1939 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
  In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
  were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.

  The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lard
  Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
  ’’olice Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.  I n o w have to look to South
     -kshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in responding
r     your request.

  At the present time the po l i cy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
  release any information to any party.     This is based on legal advice that has been
  given which indicates that information should only be released on the order of a
  court which could include that of the Coronet1. •

  I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the mo m e nt and     as explained at the
  pteasni: tiin« I. ctuaL decline your request.

  Yc-urs faithfully,

 FILE NOTE DATED 14.11.90. MERVYN JONES RE DISCLOSURE OF

 STATEMENTS .____________ ___________________________

 We discussed the letters which he was exchanging with South

 Yorkshire Police    (Mervyn had pointed out that the letter to

 Miss Steele had the wrong date on it.         It was typed the

 18th and should have been the 13th).         I have arranged for

 this to be corrected and the correction to be faxed to

 Miss.   Steele.

 He was in a difficulty because he was waiting for South

 Yorkshire to make up their mind.        It seemed to me that if

 the people were m er e ly asking for their own statements so

to speak or statements of people who had authorised their

release the simplest w a y would have been for South

Yorkshire to agree to this unless a particular statement

fell wi thin public interest immunity and/or was

non-releaseable because of say disciplinary p r o c e e d i n g s .   I

thought that this would enable people to get what they

wanted and yet preserve South Yorkshire's position.            This

was incidentally m y personal opinion as to Mervyn but of

course it is a m a tter for South Yorkshire to decide what

they want to do.     As far as I was concerned there was no

reason w h y the statement shouldn't released and I had said

that in m y letter to M i s s . Steele and indeed had already

intimated this at a considerably earlier date.

         Dear H i s s. Steel,

         Re: Release of Witness Statements.

         Thank you for your letter of the 5th of November.   I am sorry about the delay
         in replying.

         I note that you are restricting your request to witness statements of your
         clients together with those statements of witnesses who have given a signed
         authority fot release to a particular solicitor.

         Speaking for myself, I do not have any particular objection to copy
         statements of this nature being released to the solicitor concerned, though I
         must say that just at the moment, we may be physically unable to comply with
         any requests.

         I suggest that if you can write to the West Midlands Police with the names of
         the people who you have in mind.  They will then look into the matter, and no
         doubt will deal with it as far as they can.


         Yours sincerely,

     Dear Dr Popper,

     RE:   RELEASE OF WITNESS STATEMENTS

    You may recall that shortly after the Hillsborough tragedy during the time
    evidencewas being taken at Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry I made a request
    on ehalf of the Solicitors acting for individual injured and bereaved that
    copies of the statements which their clients had given to the West Midlands
    Police in the course of their enquiries could be released to the Solicitors.

    The reasons for that are self-evident.   Reliving the disaster is traumatic
    and if clients are asked to make a statement again "from scratch" that does
    cause distress to those individuals.

A   At that time the West Midlands Police were working under the direction of Lord
    Justice Taylor and yourself and by agreement those statements were made
    available to the Solicitors which was of great assistance.

    Once the matter had been referred to the DPP by the Chief Constable of South
    Yorkshire Police the procedure was changed as the DPP would naturally not
    allow release of any witness statements which might be statements of potential
    witnesses to a criminal trial or potential Defendants.

    Now that the DPP is no longer interested and his decision has been made I would
    be grateful if you would consider again authorising the West Midlands Police
    to release individual statements to Solicitors upon written request. Those
    statements would of course only be those made by their own individual clients
    or, in the case of witness statements, statements of witnesses who gave signed
    authority for the release of a statement to a particular Solicitor.

    I appreciate that at this moment you are particularly busy but would be grateful
    if you could deal with this request.

    Every good wish.

    Yours sincerely,



    MISS E M STEEL

    FILE NOTE DATED 12.11.90.    TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH*          -j


    MERVYN JONES._______________________________________________

    Mervyn repported that Mr. Edey had lost.       He was told that

    he didn't have any right to bring the proceeding but then

    Lord Justice Watkins listened to the point anyway and

    dismissed it.

    Mervyn confirmed that he agreed that we should not release

    statements etc to the Press.     On the other hand he felt

    that we did have to make some provision for them.        He said

    he had made arrangements for a limousine to pick me up on

    the Monday to arrive at 9.30      He suggested that we have a

    photo session before court sat.      I said so long as the Jury

    were not there and we were doing it as a session before we

    convened,   that should be alright because we couldn't film

    within the court.

    He confirmed that he had given instructions that no West

    Midlands Police Officer should give any interviews.

    He wanted to know w hen Det.   Inspector Layton would give his

    evidence.    I said on the 2nd day but I would prefer it on

    the first day as well in case we had time to take his

    evidence.

    Mervyn thought that once the agreed speech had been agreed

    by everybody it might be possible to give that to the Press

    or a copy of it once it had been delivered in court and of

    course on the assumption that it wasn't substantially

    altered in delivery.    I think that is satisfactory.

    There had been no further Press interest or comment arising




    BADAAT
out of the point made by the Daily Mirror reporter on the

Sunday.

I told Mervyn that we had heard from Hammond Suddard with a

list of quite a lot of names.   He expressed a little

concern as it might upset the balance of the evidence.     I

said that they had made it clear that they were only asking

me to consider the names and to select. Obviously one would

have to look and see what or who they were proposing.

We discussed the letter from Mr. Jackson re P.C. Smith.     I

said, or the copy of a page from P.C. Smith struck me as

being entirely compus mentus f but in any case we had

specifically decided that we would not use the videos

unless they were approved. As far as the audio was

concerned I couldn't see any reason why we shouldn't use it

in our standard practice in a coroner's court to use PACE

statements.

Mervyn wanted to know when Mick Foster would be needed.     I

said that depended upon when we would be reading these

statements and I couldn't remember which ones he had dealt

with.

I asked him if he would look into what had happened to the

comment about from I thought it was M r s . Joynes that she

had been told that the Pens were full at 2.30 and why

hadn't anybody taken any notice of this.        (Stan rang me back

later and said it was actually the Hewitts who had raised

this p o i n t ) .   He had taken it up with them.   All they said

was that somebody had mentioned it to them and Mr.         Beechfey

told them that if they would let him kno w who it was he

would arrange to take a statement, but if he didn't hear

from them he would have to assume that the person couldn't

or wouldn't give evidence.         There had been no further

comment.

We agreed to meet in Sheffield at 11 to have a look at the

court etc.,      this is on Friday.

I recountered to him the conversation with the Daily Mirror
                                                                                         1$C )
reporter and also gave him some of the background                                    ^

information regarding what appears to be the issue.                     I

asked him to get in touch with the Press Office to alert

them.    I said that my feeling was that we should respond

briefly.



1.   That I was not aware of any communication from Mr.

     Hughes to the Home Secretary until I was told on Sunday

     by a member of the P r e s s .



2.   That I did not consider it appropriate to make any

     comment.



I also told Mervyn that as far as I was concerned,                  I had

always endeavoured to ensure that everything that I did was

transparently open,        in fact I had gone over the top in view

of the appointment which I have.           I did not have to either

disclose, discuss or seek approval from the local

authority, bearing in mind that I was an appointee,                   held an

office and was not an employee.

Mervyn then recountered some of his conversation with Helen

Muir.     He said it was very interesting.          She was

particularly interested in the number of times the gates

were opened because she felt that the opening and shutting




BADAAR
 of the gates may have acted as magnets so to speak to bring

 people forward.     She also had ideas about crowd behaviour

 snd the effect of the ethis of the crowd on particular

 behaviour and in particular if the crowds were controlled

 too tightly they reverted to in a sense a childlike

 behaviour, ver y dependent.

 She was particularly interested in the Control Box.       She

 felt that the fact that Superintendent Duckenfield had only

 recently been appointed, was a senior man, was surrounded

by a superintendent and two juniors who in fact were more

experienced than he was m a y have influenced some of the

decision taking process.

Apparently she thought that to simply describe his reaction

as   'freezing' was not entirely satisfactory.      There was

probably more to it than t h a t .   On the other hand it was

well known that people did     'freeze'   in stress situations

and it might well be appropriate if some sort of system for

testing people were established.      This is people who were

likely to be in a situation where other people's lives

depended on them and which could give rise to stress e.g.,

airline pilots or maybe commanders at football fields etc.

Mervyn asked me to think about it and if I felt she could

make a useful contribution we would have to try and give

her some more specific guidelines as to what we wanted her

to be considering.

I pointed out that one of the things that interested me was

the jamming of the gates as compared w ith the jamming of




BADAAR
    the airport d o o r s .   He said that they had noticed this as

   well when they were watching the films.

   We agreed that this time factor would be a good thing if

f t - * Stephen gtetmd came over probably on W ednesday to go   through

    the videos with m e .

FILE NOTE DATED 5.11.90.    TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WIT H STAN

BEECHEY._____________                                          _____

Stan asked me if I could let him have the names of the

witnesses who are likely to be called for the first few

days as soon as possible.     He confirmed that work was

proceeding on the statements.      He confirmed that he hoped

to have the alphabetical list available by to-morrow.             I

asked him to check with Sgt. Tredgold the names of the

people who didn't want to come or weren't available so that

their names could be deleted from the initial list but that

we should retain them on a supplemental list so that we

didn't lose them and so that we could make some assessment

as to what our attitude with regard to them w a s .       I said

that if we did get further people I didnt necessarily feel

that we had to re-circulate those lists though we might

well do so once we knew who they were.

He said he was meeting Social Workers to-morrow to discuss

their involvement.      We both felt that it should'nt be as

extensive as it had been, but he was going to indicate the

numbers of witnesses and also give them the pro-forma of

the sort of expenses which people could expect.

I pointed out to him that whilst we would normally pay

second class rail fare or public transport costs,         there

were certain cases where it might be appropriate to pay

mileage.   If there was any difficulty then these would have

to be referred for decision.

He mentioned that the statements were being prepared and he

Dear

                    Resumed Hillsborough Inquests

Further to o u r earlier correspondence H.M. Coroner h a s b o w decided
that he would like to hear your evidence at the resumed Inquests.

Accordingly you should present yourself at the Town Hall, Pinstone

St., Sheffield on                  __    the                           1990

at                              a.m/p.m. Please go to the main
reception desk and ask for the Listing Officer Hillsborough Inquests.
A -street plan is enclosed to assist you.

You will appreciate that the smooth running of the
inquests and the minimising of stress and distress to every one is
dependent on people being on time and available and your cooperation
in this regard is both requested and thanked for in anticipation.

You will I am sure also realise that organising the witnesses for
inquests of this complexity presents major problems. For example it is
often impossible to predict precisely how long the evidence of a
particular witness is likely to take. Although it is regretted, it is
anticipated that rearrangements may have to be made often at short
notice. You should therefore be prepared to come on a different date
to that specified and in your planning for events around the above
mentioned date you should allow for this.

It is therefore essential that you should keep in touch with
the listing officer Det. Sgt Tredgold. He can be reached on _ _ _ _ _
You should check with him 48 hours before the above date and again
24 hours before so that he can keep you informed of any likely changes
as they affect your attendance and so avoid unnecessary inconvenience
to yourself. Should your times or dates have to be rearranged we take
this opportunity of apologising for the inconvenience this may cause
you and thank you for your forbearance.

The amount reimburseable in respect of financial loss, subsistence
and travel costs are laid down by regulation and when you arrive you
will be given a form so that you can make the appropriate claim.

If you intend to make a claim for financial loss then please make
sure that when you come you let us have your employers name and
address together with a payroll reference if you have one so that the
amount of your claim in this respect can be established and paid
subject to and in accordance with the regulations.

As far as travel is concerned you should assume that the amount
reimburseable will be based on appropriate public transport costs
such as coach or second class rail fare.

We hope that the foregoing is clear to you but if you do have any
particular problems please get in touch with Sgt. Tredgold who will do
his best to assist. Please however remember that he is likely to be
very busy.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter by signing the attached form
and returning it in the envelope provided.
Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                          FAX TRANSMISSION

 He had had Mrs. Coleman on the phone.          She wanted to come

 to the meeting.    She was complaining that if Mr. Jackson

was allowed to come why should she not attend.

 I explained to Stan Beechey that I looked at this meeting

analogous to private correspondence so to speak.                 Mr.

Jackson was there because he was representing what I

considered to be potentially interested parties.                 That

whichever way you looked at it, M r s . Coleman was not an

interested party.

However,   I did say that if she still felt badly done by, if

she could persuade Mr. Frazer to include her in his party

so to speak or even request that she should be allowed to

come, I will be prepared to waive my objection.

I asked M r . Beechey to let me know the outcome in due

course.



Mr. Beechey rang back.He said that he had had another long

conversation with her.           She didnt want to go to Mr. Frazer.

She said she was coining to represent two families, the

Glovers and the Churches.           That she was there to support

them.    He had told her that if she came to Sheffield,                it

was very likely that she would not be allowed to come into

the meeting.    It was therefore a matter for her.               He had

also apparently made it clear to her that this was a

procedural meeting.      I decided to ring Mr.         Frazer and

discuss the matter with him.

  DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE - HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION
 F u rth e r to o u r m eeting on 24 Septem ber and su b seq u en t corresp on d ence, I have
 now c arried out th e n e ce ssa ry re se a rc h into th e p ro d u ct of o u r in vestigation
 which hopefully will help you p re p a re a suitable b rie f fo r C ounsel. We see th e
 position as follows
  The d isa ste r, as you know , o ccu rred on th e afternoon of S a tu rd ay , 15 A pril
  1989.      On th e m orning of S unday, 16 A pril 1989, Mr G eoffrey D ear was
  contacted and was ask ed b y S ir R ichard B a rra tt, th en          H er M ajesty’s Chief
  In sp ecto r ofC onstabulary, e ith e r to u n d ertak e th e role of      A ssessor to a
  Judicial E nquiry on th e H illsborough d isa ste r o r to lead an investigation into
  th e circum stances. T hat same m orning Mr D ear contacted me and advised me of
  th e re q u e st th a t h ad been made to him and asked if I would be p rep a re d to
  e ith e r lead th e in v estig ation in my own rig h t o r do so on a full time b asis on
  h is b eh alf. The n e x t d ay , I u n d e rstan d th a t Mr P e ter W right, th en C hief
  Constable of South Y orkshire Police, made contact w ith Mr D ear and also asked
  him to c a rry out an in vestigation into th e policing a sp ec ts.
  S hortly a fte rw a rd s, th e p re s s picked up th e sto ry and th e re ra n fo r some
  time a belief in p re s s circles th a t th e re w ere two inv estig atio ns ru n n in g
  ind epen d en tly of each o th e r. T his was n e v er th e case and certain ly was n ev er
  my, Mr D ear’s o r Lord Ju stice T aylor’s u n d e rsta n d in g . C onsequently, fo r some
  considerable time we were a t pains to rem ind th e p re s s th a t th e re w ere no t two
  sep arate in v estig atio n s.
  On T u esd ay , 18 A pril 1989, Mr D ear and m yself v isited Sheffield and met with
  Mr W right and his senior officers a t Police H ead q u arters, Snig Hill. It was my
  recollection th a t Mr D ear had b y th en been recognised as th e In v estig atin g
  O fficer and th a t his role was to service th e needs of th e Ju d g e , who had b y
  th a t time b een id entified as Lord Ju stice T aylor. I am su re th a t Mr W right
  fully ap preciated th is .

                                                                            /C ontinued . .


     PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T             Chester
L ater th a t same day Mr D ear and m yself met w ith L ord Ju stic e T aylor and
to u red th e g ro u n d . L ord Ju stice T aylor made it quite clear th a t Mr D ear was
w orking d irec tly to him an d th e p ro d u ct of th e in v estig ation would be made
available to him.          At lunchtim e th a t d a y , H er M ajesty's C oroner fo r South
Y orkshire (W est), D r S L P o p per, atte n d ed a t Police H e ad q u a rters, Snig Hill,
Sheffield, and spoke to Lord Ju stice T aylor and to m yself.                    D r Popper
exchanged a few w ords about th e d isa ste r w ith L ord Ju stice T aylor and ag reed
th a t he would co-operate w ith th e Ju d g e’s w ishes. I in te rp re te d th is la te r to
Lord Ju stice T aylor th a t in g ath erin g evidence fo r th e in v estig atio n we would
do th is b o th fo r th e b en efit of Lord Ju stice T aylor as well as H er M ajesty’s
C oroner know ing th a t ultim ately an In q u est would have to tak e place. Lord
Ju stice T aylor ap p reciated th is p o in t.
The rem ainder of th a t week following th e d isa ste r was consum ed b y me and my
West Midlands colleagues in tak in g over th e investigation alread y in h and b y the
South Y orkshire Police as well as p re p a rin g ou r own arran g em en ts. The second
week following th e d isa ste r we deployed officers to various p a rts of th e co u n try
b u t in p a rtic u la r to Sheffield and Liverpool to s ta r t g a th e rin g th e evidence.
The evidence took two basic form s. F irstly , w here West Midlands Police officers

th e y collected u n d e r th e provisions of th e Criminal Ju stice A ct. A sim ilar
re q u e st fo r ’’recollections” was also made to th e Solicitors re p re se n tin g th e
in te re s ts of th e Sheffield W ednesday Football C lub, Eastwoods E ngineers and
Sheffield C ity Council.
All th is evidence was g ath ered ov er th e following weeks and on 15 May 1989
Lord Ju stice T aylor opened his public h earin g a t th e Town Hall in Sheffield.
We had alread y supplied him w ith th e evidence th a t had been obtained;
how ever, we still continued to g a th e r statem en ts, recollections, as well as
docum ents. L ord Ju stice T aylor continued to h e a r oral evidence fo r 31 w orking
days and eventually on 4 A ugust he published his Interim R ep o rt. By th a t
timp we had re g iste re d on o u r com puter 2,710 docum ents, 4,216 questionnaires
and 3,941 statem ents.
On 4 A ugust 1989 Mr P e te r W right, who had had earlie r sig h t of Lord Ju stice
T aylor’s Interim R ep o rt, announced th a t he had se n t a copy of th e re p o rt to
th e D irector of Public P rosecutions and asked him to consider w hether th e re
were any crim inal issu e s to b e reso lv ed . In m aking th a t announcem ent, Mr
W right indicated to Mr D ear th a t he would like him to c a rry out a crim inal
investigation if th a t was th o u g h t ap p ro p riate b y th e D irector of Public
P ro secu tio n s.
On 11 A ugust 1989 Mr D ear and myself v isited th e office of th e D irector of
Public Prosecutions in London and met w ith Mr C hristo p h er Newell, A ssistant
D irector. At th is m eeting Mr Newell made it quite clear th a t he believed a
criminal investigation should follow and th a t Mr Allan G reen, th e D irector,
would ag ree.

                                                                      I Continued
Following th a t m eeting Mr D ear w rote to Mr W right in d icatin g th a t we would
conduct a crim inal in v estig atio n following Mr W right’s p rev io u s re q u e s t. It was
also indicated in th a t le tte r th a t we would continue to service the needs of Her
Majesty’s C oroner w hilst c a rry in g out th e crim inal inv estig atio n .

On form ally tak in g up th e crim inal in v estig atio n , th e appointm ent of Mr D ear as
In v estig atin g O fficer was form ally ra tified b y th e Police Complaints A uthority
and Mr Noel T aylor was appointed as th e S u p erv iso r, th e in v estigatio n being
defined as one suitable fo r d ire c t su p erv isio n . T hroughout th a t in vestigation
th e Police Complaints A u tho rity p u rsu e d a ’’h ands on” su p e rv iso ry ro le. On
behalf of Mr D ear I had re g u la r m eetings w ith Mr T aylor and followed his
in stru c tio n s.
C onsequently, we continued to g a th e r evidence and over th e coming months
a fte r 4 A ugust we re g iste re d a fu rth e r 1,170 docum ents, 182 q u estio n naires and
1,411 statem ents.
A note of caution. T hese fig u res do not tr u ly define th e date before o r a fte r
the statem ent, th e questionnaire o r th e document was obtained.                      The
inform ation indicates th e date on w hich th e y were re g iste re d and th ere fo re th e y
can only be tre a te d as a guide. In o rd e r to u n d e rstan d th e origin of th e piece
of evidence and th e tim ing of its collection each item would have to be examined
individually. I th in k you will agree th a t would b e an in ap p ro p riate exercise to
em bark upon a t th is sta g e .
We continued o u r criminal in vestigation w ork, keepin g th e C oroner fully
informed of o u r p ro g re s s.       On 30 M arch 1990 we concluded th e file to th e
D irector of Public Prosecutions which was se n t to him on th a t d ay .                 At the
same time we supplied th e C oroner w ith a copy of th e statem ents which
su p p o rted the re p o rt b u t fo r obvious rea so n s, and a t th e C oroner’s re q u e s t, we
did not sup p ly him w ith an y of th e re p o rts .
On moving to th e crim inal investigation in A ugust of la s t y e a r, L ord Ju stice
Taylor made it quite clear th a t th e m aterial th a t he had g ath ered b u t had not
u sed should be made available b o th to th e C oroner as originally u n d ersto o d as
well as to th e crim inal in v estig atio n . At th a t time Mr D ear assum ed all th a t
m aterial to be p a rt of th e criminal inv estig atio n and as a consequence its
confidentiality was su sta in ed .     In ad dition, all th e m aterial th a t h ad been
supplied to L ord Ju stice T aylor was also reta in e d as confidential, th e only
m aterial b ein g made available publicly b ein g th e tra n s c rip ts and th e su p p o rtin g
documents and vid eo/photographic evidence which had been received in th e
openness of th e public h e a rin g s. As a consequence I continued to re s is t
applications from all m anner of p a rtie s fo r copy m aterial and th e lik e . T his
policy has been m aintained th ro u g h o u t and is still operative u n til su ch time th a t
the Chief Constable of South Y orkshire Police decides w hat he w ishes to do.
A fter th e D irector of Public Prosecutions h ad received th e re p o rt th e
in v estig atin g officers continued to p re p a re fo r th e interview s of c ertain p erso n s
who played a p rin cip al p a rt in th e ev en ts on th e d ay . About th e same time Mr
Dear le ft th e West M idlands Police to tak e u p an appointm ent as H er M ajesty’s
In sp ecto r of C onstabulary. It was assum ed th a t the new Chief C onstable, Mr
Ronald H adfield, would be able to take u p th e resp o n sib ility as In v estig atin g
O fficer. However, because Mr Hadfield had been a t the match and had made a
statem ent of h is observations it was quite rig h tly th o u g h t in ap p ro p riate th a t he
should take u p th is resp o n sib ility .
                                                                           I Continued
C onsequently Mr Leslie S h arp , Chief C onstable of Cum bria, was la te r in v ited
and accepted th e resp o n sib ility as In v estig atin g O fficer.
The West M idlands Police team , u n d e r Mr S h arp 's d irectio n , eventually
interview ed certain k ey p erso n n el about th e circum stances of th e d isa ste r. The
p ro d u c t of those interview s was forw arded            to th e D irector of Public
P rosecutions as an Annex to th e earlie r re p o rt.
The D irector of Public P rosecutions announced his decision not to tak e any
proceedings in th e crim inal co u rts on 30 A ugust 1990.
A fter th e announcem ent Mr S h arp , who had concluded th e police discipline
in vestigatio n s as well as th e crim inal in v estig a tio n s, p re p a re d his re p o rts fo r
South Y orkshire Police. It was decided a t th a t time to sen d a copy of th e
D irector of Public P rosecutio n s’ re p o rt and th e rela te d discipline re p o rts to th e
delegated discipline a u th o rity in South Y o rk sh ire, Mr Stew art A nderson. T his
decision was actioned in e arly Septem ber a fte r consideration had been given to
th e C oroner’s concern th a t to p a ss th e inform ation a t th a t time may cause
difficulties la te r.  How ever, as you know , th e file was p assed to South
Y orkshire Police.
Up u n til th is time I h ad continued a policy of n o n -disclosure         b ased on th e belief
th a t th e u sual p ractice would ap p ly , i .e . th a t th e C oroner     would no t like any
evidence to be released u n til su ch a time th a t th e In q u ests         h ad re tu rn e d th e ir
v e rd ic ts. However, as a re s u lt of one of th e ’’p a rtie s” to        th e d isa ste r b eing
afforded th a t inform ation (even th o ug h th e audience w ithin                  th a t organisation is
extrem ely lim ited) he would not issu e a direction to me to                       continue a policy of
n o n -d isclo su re.         C onsequently, th e re a re no d irections I    can follow a t th e
p re s e n t time which would p re v e n t me from resp o n d in g to         re q u e sts fo r such
inform ation.          (I have a lre ad y se n t to you photocopies of       those c u rre n t and
e a rlie r r e q u e s ts ) .
As I see i t, and a view sh a red b y Mr S h arp , th e p ro d u ct of th e in vestigation
was initially th a t of L ord Ju stice T aylor and H er M ajesty’s C oroner. In early
A ugust th a t p ro d u ct p assed from Lord Ju stice T aylor to th e D irector of Public
Prosecutions fo r th e crim inal investigation w ith th e continuing in te re s t of th e
C oroner. At th e same time th e Police Complaints A u th o rity h ad a su p erv iso ry
resp o n sib ility b u t did n o t, as fa r as I can reco llect, re q u ire an y statem ents
specifically to be tak en fo r th e ir p u rp o se s. Ind eed, all th e inform ation had
been g ath ered e a rlie r and th e ir role was specifically d irected to e n su re th a t th is
inform ation was p ro p erly analysed and p re se n te d .            However, th e Police
Complaints A uthority did have a resp o n sib ility fo r su p e rv isin g who should be
interv iew ed , as fa r as police a re concerned, about th e d isa ste r. S ep arately , it
was a decision of Mr S harp th a t Mr Mackrell of Sheffield W ednesday Football
Club should be interview ed.
 Finally, th e p ro d u ct of all th e in vestig ation s m ust belong to th e Chief Constable
 of South Y orkshire Police who was one of th e original sponsors of th e
 investigation in A pril 1989 and followed th ro u g h in A ugust 1989. He is th e
 ’’owner” of all th e inform ation and ultim ately - p e rh a p s a fte r th e C oroner s
 In q u ests have concluded - will assum e complete resp o n sib ility and possession of
 all th e inform ation. I t is a m atter fo r him to decide w hether he w ishes to
 resp o n d to such re q u e sts a t th is time.
                                                                             I Continued
The only additional p oint I would like to ad d is to give you a definitive lis t of
e v e ry th in g contained w ithin th e p ro d u ct of th e in v estig atio n . The following a re
th e broad categories of inform ation collected. In deciding w hether to accede to
a re q u e st, each, in my view , will have to be looked a t on its own m erits:

      (a)    Criminal Ju stice Act statem ents from w itnesses tak en fo r L ord Ju stice
             T aylor (L JT ) and H er M ajesty’s C oroner (HMC).

      (b )   Documents seized on behalf of LJT/HMC.
      (c)    71 h o u rs of video film received fo r LJT/HMC. (Most of th e m aterial
             is from th e BBC and th e re are obvious co p y rig h t co n sid eratio n s).
      (d )   2,411 ph o to g raph s draw n from th e p re s s , South Y orkshire Police and
             p riv a te sources obtained fo r LJT/HMC.            (T h ere a re also obvious
             co p yrig ht co n sid eratio n s).

      (e)    Recollections from w itnesses not tak en u n d e r caution o r w ithin th e
             provisions of th e Criminal Ju stice Act fo r LJT/HMC.
      (f)    Statem ents specifically obtained fo r HM C oroner fo r th e p u rp o ses of
             continuity an d death e n q u iries, e tc .
      (g )   Statem ents o r tra n s c rip ts of interview s u n d e r caution fo r th e
             crim inal/ discip lin ary in vestigation su p erv ised b y th e Police Complaints
             A uth ority.
      (h )   Video /audio reco rd in g s of th e interview s a t (g ) above.
I tr u s t th is ra th e r len g th y and complicated le tte r is of some a ssista n ce . I m ust
confess it has tak en some u n rav ellin g to g et to th is p a rtic u la r point which you
m ight th in k has not tak en y o u r deliberations a g re a t deal fu r th e r . I would
th erefo re su g g e st th a t you make contact w ith me if you wish to d iscu ss th is
issu e fu rth e r.
You may also find it ap p ro p riate th a t we meet w ith Counsel to answ er any
questions th a t he has specifically on th is su b ject.
I look forw ard to h e arin g from you in due c o u rse . In th e meantime I have
taken the lib e rty of forw arding a copy of th is le tte r to Mr S tew art A nderson,
Mr Leslie S h arp , Mr G eoffrey D ear and D r S L Popper.
MEETING WITH STAN BEECHEY AND CAROLINE ON 12th OCTOBER

1990.                 _____________________________________

We spent some time discussing practical aspects relating to

the Inquests.

We agreed that probably the sensible thing would be to

circulate all potential witnesses with a pro-forma for

their reply to give us a little bit of time to decide who

we actually wanted.   We would use the schedules which I

had prepared.   I let them have draft letters and pro-forma

and Mr. Beechey agreed that they would get in touch with me

on Monday.   It was also agreed that they would send the

letters out but would charge us the postage.

We discussed the possibility of pre-inquest review.      I said

that I thought that we perhaps ought to have this but we

would have to allow interested parties to attend.

Dear   ' U y -'

1 understand that you are moving today. X hope that it all goes
smoothly and well.

X an faxing up to you a redraft of the schema for the Inquests

end. I think this will have advantages in that we will get into the
events of the day quicker and also the more complex Batters will all
be concentrated at the end. I think that there may be other advantages
as well.

I had a useful meeting with Dr. Nicholson. Me will have a look at the
Elrond report and let me have any appropriate comments. He will also
have another think about the 14.52 photograph and head count. I had
suggested to him that it might be possible to take for example a
section of high density population which is clear and then extrapolate
to other areas from that. He I think is going to try and compare head
counts in a particular row between this photograph and the one of
15.03 and see whether this adds anything useful.

X also drew his attention to the comment to page 101 of the DPP report
(Part I¥). The entry figures through the turnstyles are shewn. If you
calculate these it would seem that all but 374 had entered the West
and North Stands through the tumstyles Mo 1-16.

The thing that pussies me is that the area outside those turnstyles
which is physically separated from the area ouside tumstyles A-G and
which also is larger was just as congested as the area outside A-G, If
the computation is correct who were all the people seeking to enter
through 1-16. and who entered through gate A. If the stands were
full where did they go too.

It may well be that that crowd included some displaced if. terrace
supporters and might well include some non ticket holders but it would
be strange if they all were non ticket holders in that area. Another
explanation I suppose would be that there were people on the stands
who should not have been there and who presumably got through the
tumstyles.

It would be helpful to know whether there are computer print out of
tumtyle totals for A-G and 1-16 at different times to 3.00p.m. Do you
know whether this is avaiable. Dr Nicholson said he would think about
this further.
I also had a very interesting talk with Dr* H* Muir fro® the Cranfield
Disaster centre. She told me she toow« y<m from your other interest
(horses). She will let m have a video on croud behaviour in simulated
life threatening situations in aircraft. At some time we will need to
discuss this to sae whether she has something to offer us.

She also told me that they have discovered that the pressures exerted
bv group trying to get out of an aircraft is higher than at first
thought. This may be relevant to Dr. Nicholson and his leaning crowd
model.
I am still rathar concerned as to how to deal with the documents which
either I or the parties may wish to Introduce. Maybe the best thing is
to hear what people have to say on Tuesday and then review our
decisions*
I have assumed that you were planning to come down on Tuesday but if
that is wrong please let me know. If yo are conaning what time are you
expecting to be at MU2?


Yours?sincerely,

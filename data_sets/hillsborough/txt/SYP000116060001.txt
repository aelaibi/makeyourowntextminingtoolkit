Dear Peter,

Hillsborough - Police Expert Evidence

I enclose herewith one box file containing a copy of the final
version of the report of M r . J. D. Phillips, prepared on our behalf,
and a copy also of the report of Mr. John Stalker, prepared and
served on behalf of the Football Club.    The Engineers have indicated
that they are not producing Police expert evidence.

I have a limited number of original copies of the photographs which
make up Appendix B and trust that the photocopies attached to the
copy now sent are satisfactory.  So far as the video material is
concerned, 1 a~ obtaining further copies of Hr. Phillips’
compilation which forms Appendix A and also of the BBC compilation
which forms Appendix F. I will forward these as soon as they are
available.  I believe that you already have a copy of the West
Midlands compilation which forms Appendix E.

So far as the content of the Stalker report is concerned, the bulk
of the criticism relates to the problems outside the turnstiles and
I think that these are reasonably well dealt with in Mr. Phillips *
report.  Moreover, the HSE evidence that no more than the expected
number of spectators actually entered the terraces, including those
entering through Gate C, should substantially reduce the importance
which is attached to the e%rents outside the turnstiles.



                                                                                                                 /... contd.

So far as the events inside the ground are concerned, Mr. Stalker
blandly states that the tunnel ought to have been closed by the
Commanding Officers, but does not give any reasons for suggesting
this.  His only other pertinent criticism appears to be that
binoculars should have been available inside the Control Box.

I have, of course, asked Mr. Phillips to comment on Mr. Stalker's
report and shall write further when his comments are to hand.

In the meantime, I should be grateful to receive any comments which
you or the members of the Inquiry Team have on this report.



Yours sincerely,

PREFACE



I am presently the Deputy                    Chief   Constable       of     the

Devon     and    Cornwall        Constabulary.          I     have    had     a

major responsibility during the course of my career

for dealing with policing football and other major

public events.           In particular during the past                    five

years,     until     June    1989,        I    was     Assistant       Chief

Constable       in   the     Greater          Manchester       Police        in

charge    of Operations           and had       a responsibility            for

policing        thirteen         football        and        rugby     league

grounds,      as well      as other       sporting venues            such as

Old Trafford Cricket Club.                   My experiences         included

handling         large       crowds            in      demonstrations,

disturbances,        carnivals,         FA    Cup    home    comings       and

the   like,     as well      as       responsibility         for managing

and investigating disasters such as the train crash

which overspilled onto                the M602 and the Manchester

Air Disaster in which 55 people perished.




For most of my time              as    Assistant       Chief    Constable

(Operations)         I     was        Secretary        of      the        ACPO

Sub-Committee on Hooliganism in Sporting Events and
                                 -2-


      during my tenure I was responsible for a series of

      innovations          including         re-writing                   national

      guidelines      on   policing     football;          setting         up   the

      current     National       Football       Intelligence               System;

      organising annual conferences for match commanders;

      and    acting   as   a   spokesman in       respect of national

      policing     issues      in     relation        to       football.          I

      maintained      a    regular     liaison    with         the        Football

      League,    Football       Association        and         other        bodies

      connected with football, and I was a Trustee of the

      Football   Trust.        During that       time      I    was        largely

      responsible for the introduction of CCTV systems at

      football     grounds     and     the   development             cf     police

      strategies in relation to hooliganism.




1.3   As    Secretary to the ACPO Sub-Committee                   I prepared

      and presented police           evidence    to     both     the       Inquiry

      conducted by Mr.         Justice POPPLEWELL          and the Inquiry

      conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR.




1.4   Over the course of        time I have        visited most major

      football grounds in England and Scotland asd I have

      been in personal command at numerous major football

      matches.
HTTBOPUCTIOH



On     20th    October,     1989,     I    was     as'£ed to      consider

documentary          material     emanating        frca    the     Inquiry

conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR into the disaster

at Hillsborough.           I have confined my research                  to    a

consideration         of   documentary        evidence      although          I

have     spoken       to   other      senior       police        officers,

serving       and retired,       in relation to this match and

other    issues       in   general,       (none    of     vhom    had     any

direct involvement in the game at Hillsborough).




My     observations        and   comments        are    bised     upon       an

attempt       to match the       circumstances          of policing          at

Hillsborough against general                 standards of policing

football which prevailed at that time.




There are many issues in this disaster vhich could

be discussed          in great     detail.        There    are two time

sequences:       a    sequence      spreading       over    r.any       years

involving planning,           design      and preparation;          and an

immediate sequence where just a few minutes witness

a move        from normality to tragedy.                There are many

hundreds of witnesses            and many        different opinions.

Causation too is a question that can be a'svered at
                                -4-



several      levels.       What       part did planning decisions

take?     How did the immediate events unfold                              and why

did most      of    the    fatalities occur                in one physical

location?       In     short,         although           the    planning           and

control      issues       provide       a    common        background,             the

cause   of    death       may    be     interpreted             by    much      more

immediate      evidence.              (The        concentration            of      the

fatal     casualties        in    pen         3     as     against           pen     4

certainly      requires explanation).                      I    do     not      feel

competent      to     express         an     opinion       on        all   of      the

questions which might be raised,                         some of which are

properly subject of enquiry by                      others       and         I have

confined my observations to eight general issues:




1.        Perspective of the Ground Commander;

2.        Crowd Behaviour;

3.        The Certification Process;

4.        The Safety Certificate for Hillsborough;

5.        Planning;

6.        Events at Leppings Lane;

7.        Overcrowding at pens 3 and 4;

8.        The view from the Control Room.
Broadly        speaking       the        construction            I    place          upon

events, which gives order to the structure of                                         this

report, is as follows



2.4.1     The      circumstances                    out     of        which            the

          Hillsborough Ground came                        to be certified as

          safe are critical.                       With   the perspective of

          hindsight                 the               certificate                      was

          unsatisfactory;                the       re-structuring               of     the

          ground after 1981 made it potentially unsafe

          in     the    event           of     a    capacity         crowd.            The

          Police       role        in     that       process         is    therefore

          subject to scrutiny and comment.




2.4.2     It      is         absolutely               essential            to          the

          interpretation of everything that transpired

          thereafter          to        realise       that       the      potential

          danger       was        never      recognised          by       any        party

          involved           in     staging           football            games         at

          Hillsborough.                      Indeed           the           opposite

          contention         generally              applied      - there was             a

          false        confidence              that        the        ground           was

          particularly well structured and safe at the

          capacity fixed.
                              -6-



2.4.3   It     is impossible            to make              any assessment of

        this        case     without              grappling               with        that

        perjorative               cliche                "the           wisdom            of

        hindsight".               My        observations                  very         much

        concern       filling           in        the        perspective              that

        would have          been       applied             by   police        officers

        and     examining          why       now           evident         weaknesses

        were not identifiable.




2.4.4   This       issue    leads       to        an       evaluation            of     the

        planning       undertaken            by        the      Souih      Yorkshire

        Police      for     this       game.            In      this      regard        the

        concept       of      planning             for          policing          major

        events       has     to    be       examined              ar.i     explained.

        The    word        "planning"             seems         to     have      raised

        presumptions          which           in        my        estimation            are

        fanciful.           The    proper          gauge of planning                     is

        as    to    whether        or       not    the          ric"       levels        of

        manpower       and    logistics                are available              to be

        applied      with     judgement                -     it      is    not        about

        whether detailed schedules of mrvement exist

        for every conceivable eventuality.




2.4.5   On the day, events at Leppings lane produced

        a difficult          and eventually chac.ic policing

        dilemma       which        I        shall            argue        could         not

        reasonably          have       been foreseen and which                          in

        my view,       on    the       basis       of        the evidence,             was

        handled      as well           as    it might have                 been with

        the    resources          at hand.              The opening              of     the

        gates became almost inevitable.
        2.4.6   '
                “’e now know that by that                time,      the density

                cf spectators         in pens     3 and 4 exceeded              the

                ireen    Guide     limit^a ^ and         an    issue    which     I

                shall    discuss        in   detail   concerns         why     that

                vas   not    recognised.          Failure      to    anticipate

                zhe     possible        consequence       of     opening        the

                rates on pens 3 and 4, regardless of whether

                ihere    was      any    earlier      perception         of     the

                difficulty in those pens, has been described

                as a blunder.            If it was,       it is      one      which

                ran be mitigated and my report examines the

                context      within      which    that    alleged        failure

        2.4.7   The events        thereafter have         to be considered

                against the reality that              in practical            terms

                r^iere was not too much that could have been

                zone that was not done.




        2.4.8   Overall the persistent thread to the account

                is that the police            responded professionally

                vithin      the   limits     of   their       competence        and

                experience        and as well as others might have

                ione.

2.4.9   The    alleged           mistakes                that     were        made         in

        failing       to         recognise                 over-crowding                  and

        failing to secure                   the tunnel when the gates

        were opened,            largely sprung from what was                                a

        fateful        flaw            in           the        arrangements                at

        Hillsborough.             The       construction of the West

        End      terraces,              and              access        and         egress

        therefrom,         created              a    potentially             dangerous

        configuration.                That          it    was     not       recognised

        by the engineers who designed                                 it,    Sheffield

        Wednesday          Football             Club,           members        of        the

        Safety Team,            the     Stewards,               the     Police,          the

        Football      Association                   or    anybody           else    until

        too late, stemmed in part from the fact that

        the   stadium had hardly                         ever been tested                  at

        capacity.          Unruly crowd behaviour caused the

        opening       of        the    gates             and     in    some        degree

        carried    through             to       create         pressure            in     the

        tunnel    leading to pens 3 and 4.                                  In view of

        the    late        arrival          of           the     crowd        and         the

        evident    enthusiasm               to       get       to the terracing

        it    seems        to     be        a       open        question           as      to

        whether,      if the crowd had entered the ground

        through       the       turnstiles,                there       might            still

        not have       been           similar            pressure       through the

        tunnel on to the terracing in pens 3 and 4.
PERSPECTIVE OF THE GBOUHP COMMMTORg



A     senior        police         officer           will        generally           be

responsible         for       policing          a     particular             football

ground.       Depending upon              the       size    of    the       crowd     or

the     fixture,        his        rank    may        vary       between           chief

inspector and chief                superintendent.                It    is    usually

the      case       that       for        larger           grounds          such      as

Hillsborough         the      local       divisional             commander         will

liaise       with     the        football           club     on        matters        of

strategy.        He may of course not police                           every r.atch

but    will      take      the      major       occasions             and     mcritor

policing generally.




All this said his              responsibilities               have      to be put

in context.          As divisional commander he will                               tarry

responsibility for the policing enterprise within a

considerable geographical area with a population of

probably in excess of two hundred                            thousand         petple;

he    will    command       anything        between          two       hundred and

five      hundred          police         officers;              he         will      be

responsible          for       a     considerable                administrative,

logistical       and       support        effort       employing             prcrably

more than one hundred civilian staff; he will tarry

an     overall      responsibility              for        local       contingency
                                           -10-


      plans; for tie daily torrent of crime and incident;

      for     the         processing           of        prisoners;             for       public

      relations;          for    liaison           with       other       local       agencies

      and     so     os    and        so     on.         In    short,          it    would       be

      misleading zo             imagine           that      his      role      in     policing

      football was central to his responsibilities or one

      upon which ie would have                         time        to    concentrate            his

      effort and clergy with singular persistence.




3.3   Precisely i-ecause of the great range of his duties

      a     police        :ommander          has       to      be        something         of     a

      generalist          vho        applies       his        overall       knowledge           and

      experience          :f    command           to     any       problem      and        relies

      upon    the discipline                and good sense                of the Service

      in making                best of opportunities.




3.4   Despite        this,      some        aspects           of    policing          football

      have    emerged as something of a specialism over the

      last     ten        years.           This        point        is     made       somewhat

      reluctantly          because,          whilst           the       need    for       greater

      knowledge az.i special skills has been advocated and

      to      some         extent            facilitated                 by         the      ACPO

      Sub-Committr*             on    Hooliganism              in       Sporting          Events,

      the     means       zo    develop           specialist             commanders          have

      simply       not     been        there.            The        sheer      busyness          of

      police         co— anders             and,         of         equal       importance.
                                    -11-


      personnel changes within police                    forces which entail

      a frequent turnover of staff, has meant that it has

      been very difficult to develop experience and skill

      in match commanders.              These are issues that we are

      well aware of and they are not necessarily anyone's

      fault,    but    they      form     part      of    the    context          which

      needs    to be taken into account in trying to assess

      the decision making of               the    commanders          in    the    face

      of this disaster.




3.5   Typically a match commander will have had access to

      his force instructions on policing football and the

      ACPO     "guidance".          (These       documents       are       reference

      documents       and     before       assuming        that       a     detailed

      knowledge       could    be    anticipated          it    should       be said

      that     instructions         and      guidance          will        exist     in

      respect of all his duties such as to fill a library

      shelf).     He may have attended conferences organised

      by the ACPO Sub-Committee where topical issues will

      have been discussed and techniques                        highlighted         (in

      this case it would appear that none of the officers

      in command       roles had).           Some    of    their       staff       will

      have been specially trained in the use of CCTV and

      intelligence mechanisms.               They will be supported by

      some     officers     in   middle      ranks       and below who will

      have had     a prolonged          experience         in     policing         that

      football ground.

3.6   In short, it was then,                   and still will be,                      something

      of    a     lottery       as        to      the      level             of       experience

      prevailing        in    the         senior        officers              commanding             a

      given      football       match.             New        commanders                   have     to

      'command* and have             to begin             somewhere.                  Hopefully,

      as    in   this    case,       they are           supported by                   immediate

      staff who have a greater experience.                                        Equally          tie

      particular        game         of        the        15th          April           1989        st

      Hillsborough           was        a        "repeat"               of        a        previous

      encounter,        and should have been                        a    relatively safe

      learning          environment.                      Nonetheless                       overall

      experience        tends      to       be    of      a    general                nature       &c:d

      based      upon practical             experience.                 There         is    a     c&se

      for     more    detailed            study        and     for           more          specific

      training and this              is     currently being pressed,                              tut

      in    assessing the          context which prevailed                              in 19£?,

      match      commanders        policed           on       the        basis         of       their

      overall experience rather than anything else.




3.7   A    final point should be made about the perspective

      of the      typical match             commander          in        relation           to his

      areas      of   responsibility               at     a    football                game.        Xs

      this report will emphasise elsewhere,                                   in my opinicn

      he did not see himself as qualified to argue abcut

      the physical        safety of the                 football             ground          excect
                                     -13-


      where his experiences had indicated a problem.                                He

      did      not      regard         fire        risk         as     his      major

      responsibility although it would be in his mind and

      his officers would              know the standing instructions.

      Management :f the crowd was                   taken       to be     a general

      responsibility        but       in    a hybrid       way.       The primary

      police         ccrcern         was        with       the        control        of

      hooliganism.         The       police      are     well     aware     they are

      only   present       because         of    hooliganism.           They    would

      simply not be there in such numbers were it not for

      the likelibrod of "trouble".




3.8   Strategies        for        preventing            hooliganism           require

      something       :f    a      monopoly        of    control        over     crowd

      movements.        It is largely because of this                       that    the

      police have inherited a responsibility for managing

      the    crowd.        Match      commanders          typically,         although

      not necessarily universally,                      would have accepted a

      de facto presumption that overall management of the

      crowd was it their              direction.          This responsibility

      for manager-ent         of     the    crowd,       however,       would      have

      been     regarded         as     contingent          upon       two      things:

      firstly,        in      the      event        of      emergency           direct

      intervention         would      be        organised        by   the      police;
                                         -14-


       secondly,         that       in     ordinary            circumstances,                once

       properly in the ground, the ground was safe for the

       numbers for which it was certified.




3.9    Overcrowding would only concern the match commander

       in an indirect              way.        In     theory,           and    this     is    the

       purpose      of    the        Safety         Certificate,               provided       the

       capacities        are       not    exceeded,            over-crowding             cannot

       occur.       Police           concern             is    with           policing        the

       turnstiles         to       ensure        that          cannot          happen.         If

       crushing     is        to    be    a     problem            it    is    usually       when

       people are seeking to get in or                              out of the ground

       in   undue    haste.           There         are       few       examples      in     many

       thousands         of     fixtures            of    serious             crushing       when

       people    leave         the       game    in      ordinary             circumstances,

       equally there are few examples                              of   serious       problems

       at the turnstiles.




3.10   In    general,              therefore,             police              concern        with

       overcrowding            would       relate             to        the     control        of

       turnstiles         and        capacities,               the        prevention           of

       incidents         which       might          create          panic       and      simply

       keeping      a weather            eye     to      any       problem       within       the

       crowd which becomes obvious.

3.11   The    most   experienced    commanders    policing   grounds

       which are     frequently at capacity may well         be much

       more aware of crowd densities than match commanders

       at    the   typical   game   where   the   crowd   falls   well

       short of capacity.
CROWD BEHAVIOCH



There     are tvs questions which need to be addressed

concerning the behaviour of                        supporters.           The    first

relates       to     the       impact    of     hooliganism         in     general

terms      on      pclice       planning           and strategies.                The

second        is         aore    specific          and relates           to       the

behaviour          of     supporters          in        Leppings    Lane        which

caused      the pressures            which         led     ultimately          to the

tragic sequez.ce of events which was to ensue.




The police         in large         and organised numbers,                     do not

generally          attend          crowd        gatherings          on     private

premises.          Indeed        football          is    probably    unique         in

attracting              this     kind      of       police     planning            and

attention anc the reason is simple:                            in most          cases

stewarding         is      sufficient         to    organise       the movement

and direction of crowds without the requirement for

law     enforcen-ent.            Large     crowds          enter    the        London

Underground              system,     pack trains,           escalators             and

platforms, vith no control or direction, in numbers

which dwarf tlte "green guide".                            The police are in

no doubt        th = t    their presence at football grounds is

fu n d a m e n ta lly    a response to an incipient problem of

hooliganism              and    disorder.          Over years       the        Police
                                       -17-



      have    had     to     inveigh          against         thousands        of     fans

      gesticulating         and       chanting        with     all    the      war-like

      mannerism       of     a       Zulu     impi,      or    to    fight        running

      skirmishes through the transport network and in the

      approaches       to        football          grounds          with       organised

      mobs.     Segregation became                 an essential            strategy     to

      prevent mayhem.




4.3   This    anticipation             of     "trouble"         is       specific       to

      football.        For       example,          when       considering           events

      outside     football           the    following         are    notable        and I

      believe typical examples:-




      4.3.1 At      Maine        Road,        Manchester        on       8th      August,

              1988,        39,000      people         attended       a     Pink      Floyd

              Rock Concert.                There   were       31 police officers

              on duty within the stadium;




      4.3.2 At Wigan's               Rugby League ground on Boxing Day

              1989,    at        a    top    of    the    table      clash      between

              Wigan and St.                Helens,     27,075 supporters were

              policed by 12 officers within the ground;
4.3.3 At Royal Troon,            Ayrshire for most of the last

         day of the British Open Golf Tournament 1989,

         approximately 36,000 fans were policed on the

         course by just 17 officers.




Let there be no doubt that the police                     are only at

football     matches       in    their     large    numbers,         with    a

fairly      complex        logistical           plan,     to        control

disorder.       The   safety question            in the     Police mind

has been largely a function of that.                      Firstly,         the

police    have a duty to protect                innocent       spectators

who may be attacked.            Secondly,       they are aware that

nothing    is more likely to create a dangerous crowd

surge    than    violence.          The    catastrophe         at    Heysel

stadium serves as a classic reminder.




It   seems      to    me     that    to    criticise        the      police

pre-occupation        with      disorder    is     unfair.          Were    it

not for the potential for disorder there would net

have been a need           for a large number             of    policerren

inside the football ground in the first place.




Typically       police     planning       for    football       games       is

concerned with maintaining vigilance over both sets

of   supporters       as     they    assemble,       make      their       way
                                           -19-


        through       the       transit           system,       pass        through      the

        turnstiles,         assemble         in the      ground        and    eventually

       make     their     way home.               Containment and segregation

        are the constant themes of police                            tactics.      Whilst

        there    are policemen on                 traffic points             and general

        crowd duties tie bulk of the commitment relates                                   to

       preserving           order.           This        is      universally            true

        throughout the Football League.




4.7     As to the behaviour of fans on the day in question,

        I     have    examined         the    statements             and    the   witness

        examinations         cf      the     mounted      officers          at    Leppings

        Lane.        I have         also    read other          evidence which was

        presented         in         Lord         Justice        TAYLOR'S          Inquiry

        (Appendix        'C'      attached         to    this    report       adumbrates

        statements       already           given    in    evidence          relating      to

        drunkenness arc disorder).                       It     is significant that

        very    experienced           mounted       officers,          from Liverpool

        themselves,         ercressed         a view          that    the     conduct of

        the      crowd         at     Leppings           Lane        turnstiles          was

        exceptional         and       unaccountable^5 ^.               If    it    is    the

        case that heavy drinking and culpable                               late arrival

        coupled with an irresponsible                         enthusiasm to breach

        the turnstiles caused the initial problems, and




(a)   Evidence of Sgt. 1S52 SMITH (2/89)
      PC 1300 GRUNNILL 2/91)   (Appendix C)
                                        -20-



        there    is much evidence which                    speaks of      that,      then

        this matter        is       very     material      in    assessing         police

        response.         If    it     is    that the       crowd behaviour was

        exceptional, and by that I mean                      exceptionally bad,

        then    the construction might be applied that had it

        not been     so,        police       arrangements        would       have    been

        more than sufficient.




4.8     In short, the police might have a responsibility to

        plan for and execute tactics                      to manage predictable

        crowd behaviour,              even misbehaviour,              but can hardly

        be expected to answer for the consequences if crowd

        behaviour       is entirely unpredictable.                     Once    control

        is lost it is very difficult indeed to re-assert it.




4.9     Lord     Justice            TAYL0R^a ^      asks     the       question        in

        response     to    the        police       contention      that      the    crowd

       was      unco-operative              in     failing       to     respond        to

        exhortations           to    stop pushing         - "How could they?"

       The     report     indicates          the     crush      was    such    at     the

        turnstiles             that         most      people          were         acting

        involuntarily               hence          Lord      Justice          TAYLOR's

        inference.

4.10   1 would        like    to    make    some observations                 to     answer

       the question based upon my experience of                                  handling

       large      crowds            at      turnstiles.               Firstly/               an

       experienced       football           crowd       attending         a      capacity

       fixture    know        full       well    that        if   they    voluntarily

       arrive    late        they    will       have     great       difficulty              in

       getting    in on        time.        I have       seen       large queues             at

       turnstiles        behave           quite         properly          and          queue

       patiently and 1 have seen them surge and push.                                        It

       would be quite          ridiculous          to    imagine         that      no       one

       individually has             any control over whether there is

       an uncontrolled crush or an orderly queue.                                      It    is

       simply the case that if the majority wish to queue

       properly       they will          assist        the    police        in     dealing

       with     the    minority          who     are     pushing.             They      will

       object to losing their                   turn.        If   a majority           start

       to push it is true                 those near the front will have

       little    control       over       things.            That    does        not    mean

       that there are not many                   in the crowd with a clear

       culpable responsibility for causing the crush.




4.11   I have seen mounted officers deployed into                                  a crowd

       which     is    pushing       and        seen    the       demeanour        of       the

       crowd change to being orderly.                         It is not the             case
                                             -22-



           that if several thousand people are at a turnstile

           there must be an uncontrollable crush.                             For that to

           occur       there      must       be   enough       people         individually

           behaving selfishly and irresponsibly.



    4.12   The    video      tape,      part      of Appendix            ’A ’, concerns       a

           derby    fixture        between Chelsea                 and   Tottenham         with

           late    arrival of fans unable to get into the ground

           at kick off.            Similar numbers are involved and                         the

           construction           of    turnstiles           and    gates     is   not      too

\          unlike      Hillsborough.              The      video     tape     illustrates

           this point.




    4.13   It    may    be     worth     considering          this       problem      in    its

           reverse      form.          Tie    crowd     enter        a   ground     over      a

           fairly      long period of time, they are all available

           to leave on the final whistle.                          If the momentum of

           the     crowd       was      inevitable           there       would     be      mass

           crushing       at      every game.           In    fact       of   course       most

           people      do not push to get out and                        that makes         the

           difference.




    4.14   There is a very considerable body of evidence                                   that

           the    crush      at    Lepoings         Lane     turnstiles        came     about

           because large nuriers arrived late and, not wishing
         to pay the penalty of                   missing          the     start,        pressed

         forward        to    enter,       in      a    quite       unreasonable             way.

        There      was       nothing       inevitable              about        this:        late

         arrival was voluntary as was impatience to get in.

        The evidence           of    the     policemen             (Appendix           ’C ’) and

         from     the    video       tape,^a ^          of    wholly           uncooperative

        behaviour        is overwhelming.                   Equally        there       is    very

         strong    evidence         of     heavy drinking (Appendix                         'C*).

         In short, despite the fact that some people at the

         front    of     the       crush     had       no    option        and       were    mere

         flotsam       in    the     struggling             tide     of        fans,     enough

        people      were      behaving          badly        so    as     to    overwhelm       a

         considerable              police          effort.               In      a          sense

        misbehaviour on this                 scale          is something of a wild

         card.     It is not predictable                      and       once     it     begins,

         requires very considerable resources to quell it.




4.15     In summary,          a general observation needs to be made

         that police          presence       at        football         grounds        and    all

         their     strategies          for      controlling              fans    are        based

         upon a perceived danger of violence and hooliganism

         if     control       is    relaxed.            A    specific           observation,

         based    upon much          of      the       evidence,          is     that       crowd

        misbehaviour           in        Leppings            Lane        was     sustained,

         intense       and dangerous             so     as    to        unbalance        police

         tactics.

4.16   No queueing strategy can work without some level of

       co-operation.       No   matter    what degree of planning,

       if the crowd turns up late in large numbers it will

       be   impossible     to   achieve    a measured            and      orderly

       progress   into the ground.          If       a   crowd     of     several

       thousand    refuse       to    respond        reasonably         to        the

       efforts    of   a     relative     few        policemen,           drastic

       response   will     be   necessary       to       achieve    order.          A

       drastic    response      before    the    disaster          such      as     a

       baton charge or mounted charge into the crowd would

       itself have carried grave risks.                  Any other type of

       response would have           required a considerable amount

       of time to organise, time which was never available.
5       THE CERTIFICATION PBOCES«y



5.1    The      following          observations           can   be made         about      the

        role of the Police in the determination of                                   "safety

        certificates"            under     the      Safety      at     Sports       Grounds
                       (a)
        Act     1975         .      The        Act        requires           the         local

        authority to         certify the grounds as safe primarily

        by    limiting           capacity      for    discrete parts                of     the

        ground according            to their         condition,           configuration

        and    facilities.           In    this      general         requirement           the

        local       authorities          are   obliged       to      consult         amongst

        others, the Police.




5.2    The      first real         question         th=t needs to be examined

        is    the    capacity       of     the      Police      to     comment on the

        issues which         are     relevant        ^o    certification.                When

        the     legislation              was     erected          it      was        assumed

        presumably          that     Police          Cfficers          who      regularly

        policed       football        grounds        vould         rely      upon        their

        experience           in          offering          advice            to          local

        authorities.             Again, presumably,             their advice would

        be pertinent         in certain areas                but     perhaps         not    in

        others.        There         was       no     programme           of        training

        officers       to    offer         advice,        there        was     no     advice

        forthcoming from government as to what issues

      Police Officers            should      take    into    account    or     what

      matters     they should            specifically       comment on.        This

      is not necessarily unusual                    but   the   point    is    made

      that   it    was,       again       presumably,       considered        to   be

      unproblematic for the Police given that they would

      be     making         commonsense            statements       about          the

      configuration and             construction of          football    grounds

      insofar     as       those    arrangements affected their                role

      in policing the crowds.




5.3   A major consideration of course                     in determining           the

      safety     of    a    football        ground is capacity and             safe

      tolerances on          terraces        and    in    seating   areas.          Of

      central         importance          here      is    the   viability           of

      evacuating a stadium which                   involves     the efficiency

      of   gangways,         exit        doors,    stairways     and    all    that

      goes   with      that.        Equally,        crush    control    barriers

      are self evidently an important matter.




5.4   On   the    face      of     it,    it is difficult to know what

      qualifications the Police would have in these sorts

      of areas.        The Police would not be in a position to

      comment on the             structure        of crush barriers       or       for

      that     matter,       the     gradient        of     terracing    or        the
                                            -27-



        evacuation       time in relation to gangways                             in seated

        areas and so on.                  Whilst any member of the                  "Safety

        Committee",          itself          an     ad     hoc        creation     with     no

        specific       legal         status,        would clearly have              a     duty

        to speak up if he had a concern,                              it is likely that

        those    sorts of issues would be                           dealt with      by     the

        local     authority's               own    officers           and   probably       the

        Fire Brigade.




5.5     The Fire       Brigade            have     a particular             expertise and

        experience      in assessing the time                         it takes to clear

        buildings and structures.                        It would be difficult to

        imagine        the            Police          in           any      circumstances

        contradicting the Fire                     Service       in      their estimation

        of    that   sort        of       problem or the              requirements        that

        would fall from such recommendations.




5.6     The     role        of        the     police          is      perhaps       put     in

        perspective          by       reference          to    Schedule       II    of     the

        General        Safety             Certificate               for      Hillsborough

        paragraph       2        4    .     This     refers         inter    alia    to     an

        inspection          by        a     suitably          qualified           chartered

        engineer        as           to     "the         current          compliance        or

        non-compliance               with    good     engineering           and    building

        practice       and       with       the     relevant          British      Standard

        Specification and Codes of Practice and with the

       dated      September    1987^a ^         refers   to     areas     of

        responsibility on the officer side as follows:

      have been agreed by the Officer Working Party (9/6)]
(b)   Letter from G.MACKRELL, 23 October 1987 (6/20)
5.9      The point to be made here is that the Police would

         approach their participation in safety                                   certificate

         meetings on the basis                    that their             general       function

         consisted of maintaining law and order at football

         grounds.        They would look at the proposals made in

         respect      of      the      ground,           some       of        which    involved

         making new         restrictions               to    make        the    ground          safe,

         against           their            operational                  requirement               in

         maintaining law              and       order.        That       would        of    course

         include      crushing             at     turnstiles             and     other          pinch

         points     in     the    ground,          but       generally          speaking          the

         Police       mind        would           not        be      directed              towards

         considering how to make                       the    structure          as        safe    as

         possible.




5.10     I    think      it      is        fair        to    say     that        they           would

         anticipate         those          matters          would        be     addressed          by

         structural         engineers             who        might        be      technically

         conversant        with       the        Green       Guide,              and       by     the

         Fire      Brigade,         and         that    they       (the        Police)          would

         comment on the proposals.                          They would           also       see    it

         as   their      place        to    make proposals                that would make

         operational policing more effective.

5.11   Not to put too fine a point upon it, if the Police

       had    ever     accepted a       responsibility                for    examining

       the    football       ground     with       a view        to    making       clear

       recommendations regarding the entire                           safety of       the

       stadium,       then there would clearly have had to have

       been a training programme to teach officers                                 a good

       deal    more     than    they     generally             knew.        They    would

       have   had      to    have been        trained      in         the safety          of

       structures, about evacuation times,                        about the width

       of gangways, the strength of metal barriers and all

       the    rest.     That     no     one    saw       the    need    for        such    a

       programme,       at    least     at     that      time,        indicates       the

       general       presumption        that       the     Police       advice        was

       usually to be restricted to making statements about

       the    operational viability of the                      structure of the

       football        ground     from        the        point         of     view        of

       maintaining law and order.




5.12   My recollection is that when grounds were initially

       certified,       the     local     authority            staff,       using     the

       advice in the Green Guide, made an estimate of what

       the    safe     figure     was        for     a    particular          area        of

       terracing or seating and then took into account the

       state of gates,         fencing,        crush barriers, whether or

       not the concrete was decaying or in good order, and
                                           -31-



       those     sorts       of    things,         and then    set     a     limit     for

       that particular             part of the ground.                If     the     limit

       was     below     what           the    capacity       might        be   at     its

       ultimate under             the      terms    of the    Green Guide,           this

       was usually set             on the basis that if the                  club made

       certain alterations                 or repairs the        limit would            be

       raised upwards.




5.13   The Police were frequently involved in this process

       in the sense that they would visit the ground with

       those     making      the      recommendations          and     take     part    in

       the     sort     of        inspection          that    ground        commanders

       routinely undertake before a game.                        That is to say.

       Police     Commanders            would      examine     superficially           the

       state of terracing,                   the state of       the       fencing,     the

       ability of people                to    climb over       from one         area    to

       another,       and similar matters;               and make remarks and

       suggestions as             to whether or not            they        thought     the

       ground     was     in      a     sufficient       state       of    repair,     or

       whether there needed to be particular alterations.




5.14   I cannot think that the Police would have ever been

       in    a    position            to      argue    for     particular          crowd

       capacities       unless          they had       some    recent       experience

       of over-crowding and made a general point.                               In most

       cases     of   course,           capacities      were     way       beyond      the

5.15     In this context it is worthy of note that the word

         "capacity"            is fundamental.            it refers to the total

         number       of        people       which        it      is     considered           a

         particular part of the ground can safely hold.                                      It

         does    not       take       into    account       distribution           and       in

         general      terms          it is difficult to            see how it could

         do so.       There are masy, many football grounds                                with

         vast areas            of terracing,        some of them quite steep,

         where the potential                 for crushing          if the crowd             all

         congregated            or     surged      into     one        particular          area

         would be great.               It is difficult if not impossible

         to imagine how,               on a large         area of open terracing

         anyone might achieve "crowd distribution".




5.16     Once crowds           have gathered,             if they choose           to move

         and sway,         only the physical structure will contain

         them and         anybody who         is    a part of the              crowd will

         simply be         carried along with them.                      This may seem

         an     obvious         point,       but    the     issue        is    that        when

         capacities were              fixed for parts             of the ground,             it

         was    on    the       assumption         that    if   that      capacity         was

         reached,         it    would be a safe number                   if that        crowd

         reasonably distributed                 itself.         However nothing              in

         the     Safety         Certificate^3 ^           requires        steps       to     be

         taken       to    achieve       that      distribution           so     that       the

         inherent         assumption          was     that        the      crowd        would

         naturally distribute.

5.17   Another issue which has               to be     raised which              is    of

       central    importance,          concerns       the     actual        structure

       of   so    many        football       grounds        in     the          Football

       League.      Many       of     them    were     built          in    the       last

       century     and        their     construction             thereafter            has

       largely been fragmentary and ad hoc.                            Construction

       programmes have waxed             and waned with               the       fortunes

       of   the club.         In particular many              football          grounds

       are located in our old industrial centres and stand

       cheek     by jowl with          terraced housing            or      industrial

       accommodation.




5.18   There is an old saying that if you want                             to   get    to

       Sebastapol don’t start                from here.          This could well

       be   applied      to    football       grounds.           In     seeking         to

       achieve     an     accommodating         and     safe          stadium         many

       football     grounds         present      an     immense            challenge.

       They are badly built,             they are built in the wrong

       places and their construction has been piecemeal so

       that it is frequently badly configured and does not

       provide     for        efficient         crowd         flow.             Without

       labouring        the    point     this    is     the      context         within

       which Safety Committees have had to work.




5.19   Over many many years.             Police       Officers        have       become

       accustomed to policing grounds                   which are basically
                                           -34-



       bad structures.                Their plans,            based on experience,

       have sought to compensate for                          the    inadequacies         and

       inefficiencies            of    grounds.          The        Police have         often

       made suggestions for improvement,                            but the realities

       of   the clubs'           finances         have usually entailed that

       programmes         have     been      based       more        on    a    first     aid

       principle,         repairing          what       immediately needs               to be

       repaired,       rather than on major                    reconstruction.             It

       is   not      really for me            to       comment on the financial

       issue      in      any     detail.          It     has        to    be    observed,

       however,        that       football             clubs        have       often     been

       prepared to spend a great deal more on players than

       on     the      construction               of    their        grounds       and     on

       facilities for spectators.




5.20   In     understanding            the        Police       perception          of     the

       business        of policing           football,          it    is necessary         to

       take     into       account          that        Police        generally          have

       accepted        the      poor       quality       of     football        stadia     as

       being one of the                constraints            of     policing,     one     of

       the parameters within which they have to work.                                      It

       is     also        right       to     say        that        despite       all     the

       difficulties          associated with               old       fashioned stadia,

       most     of     the      time,        over       many        years,      they     have

       managed       to    accommodate            the    comings          and    goings    of
                                             -35-




         large football crowds without too many difficulties

         of safety.             It    would       be    difficult        to    argue        to    a

         football         club       that       a particular          configuration              of

         turnstiles            needed        to       be     radically         altered           at

        massive          cost,       if    the    evidence was the ground had

         accommodated large                  crowds        over many years            and    had

         not generated major safety problems.




5.21    Police          Officers          would       have    been       constrained             in

         pressing         this        case       too       far.     They      might     under

         Section         10    of      the      Safety       at    Sports      Grounds       Act
                 (a)
         197 5          have sought             the    local      authority      to    appear

         in   the       Courts        and seek         a restraint on           a football

         game      if    they        thought      there      was     immediate        danger.

         It is difficult to see that the local authority or

         the Court would have moved                          very    far      without       some

         firm evidence               if the context was               only that in the

         worst of all possible cases the turnstiles might be

         unsafe.




5.22    It    is        also     worthy          of     record       that      the     Police

         generally             work        on     the        basis       that        football

         spectators             are        reasonably             familiar      with         the

         advantages           and disadvantages               that    football        grounds

         offer.         People going to major football matches                               are

         in the main used to going to major football

!•          matches.          In roost cases of course they are going to

            their    home        stadium       and    they have       learnt over          the

            years how they              can    get    to    and     from    that    stadium

            with a tolerable amount cf comfort.                            They know from

            experience          that they have to make                their way          in    a

            particular           direction,          give    themselves         particular

            time periods             to get     in cid out of            the ground        and

            because        of    this        collective      experience          there     are

            usually not many problems of                      this       sort    with     home

            crowds.        Away       crowds     too have         often got        a pretty

            good knowledge of away stafia.                        (In this       case     they

            had     been        there    the     previous         year).        Those     that

            travel away often tend to hi:w football grounds and

            their       limitations.            Equally       they    are       usually       in

            lesser numbers than the hoir.s crowd.



     5.23   It is in this regard of courie that semi-finals are

            unique.        Both       crowds     are       ’ivay"    crowds      and it       is

            often       the     case     that    neither       crowd       will     be     too

            familiar          with     the    stadium.        Equally,          semi-finals

            are occasions when capacity crowds can be expected,

            and capacity crowds are rarely anticipated in other

            than    a    few      first       division       rrounds.        Despite       all

            this,          many         crowds          attending            semi-finals,

            particularly             those     associated         with     major        clubs.
                                     -37-



       have previous experience of such fixtures,                           may know

       the    ground   quite       well        and will     probably        know   the

       problems    that      these       big    occasions      yield.         By   and

       large the crowd, or most of the crowd are compliant

       and    Police   tactics           are   based    on     the     presumption

       that most people within a football crowd will know

       the     limitations     of        football      grounds        and    respond

       generally to those limitations.




5.24   It is a fair point to make that any crowd numbering

       tens of thousands cannot be controlled unless there

       is    a good measure         of compliance.             Police officers

       are,    in ratio to the crowd,                very     small    in number.

       They can only hope to manage and control crowds                              if

       most of the time            there       is a degree      of willingness

       to     co-operate.          All     Police      planning,        except      in

       relation to known hooligan groups                      (and perhaps          in

       situations      of    crowd        demonstrations        and     the    like,

       where    trouble     is on the agenda),                is based        on   the

       presumption          that         the    crowd       will       be     fairly

       knowledgeable         and     reasonably         co-operative.              Any

       other    plan   would        have       to   involve     either       massive

       Police    numbers      or     Police         tactics    geared        towards

       pre-emptive     action and the use                 of greater         numbers

       of horses, dogs and materiel.

5.25     It    is    also       a point       worth       making       that    because     a

         semi-final is an all ticket fixture there should be

         no question of overcrowding, simply a matter                                  of a

         capacity crowd.               The    two    things          are not the       same.

         Provided there           is no widespread forgery of tickets

         there      should       be    no    need        to    be     overly    concerned

         about      capacity           as    theoretically             the     crowd     has

         already been distributed safely by the distribution

         of tickets.




5.26     Returning         to    the    issue       of    certification,          from my

         own experience and from the enquiries I have made,

         I     am    not        convinced          that       the     arrangements       for

         certification at South Yorkshire were in any degree

         different to those that appertained throughout most

         of the rest of the country.                          Comment has been made

         that the meetings were not minuted in any detailed

         way and that there was                    a good deal          of    informality

         in    their      deliberations^3 ^.                  Whilst    in most        areas

         this has        considerably          improved         in the very        recent

         past,      in    the     1970s       and    most       of     the     1980s    that

         arrangement was general.



5.27     It    should       be    pointed          out        that     the    legislation

         required        that the ground should be certificated by

         the   Local       Authority^b ^ .           It       did     not    require     for

         any re-certification or any continuing system of

         inspections by the             Safety    Committee          (although           the

         certificate       required      qualified           engineers       to     check

         the   structure       annually).               On    the     face     of        it,

         once certificated a ground might be considered safe

         until scmeone brought to notice some change                              in     its

         structure.       For this        reason what happened in most

         cases     vas    a    reasonable         degree        of        co-operative

         effort    to    get     the    certificate          determined           in    the

         first place       and    thereafter        no       arrangements           of     a

         formal mature involving              the police were considered

         necessary       unless    the    Club     applied           to     alter       the

         ground.




5.28     Before      commenting          on       the        configuration               at

         Hillsborough, some general remarks need to be made

         about -Jze effect on            Police    planning of             the safety

         certificate       and    the     issue    of        crowd        density       and

         safety.     The whole purpose of the Safety at Sports

         Grounds Act was to provide safe limitations for the

         number cf spectators in parts of the ground against

         the   potential         for    overcrowding           set        against       the

         requirement for          emergency       evacuation.               Once       that

         point is fully understood it is a logical sequitor




(a)    Clause   24 Schedule             II,      Safety        Certificate              for
       Hillsborc.gh. (6/4)
                                           -40-



       that thereafter, provided those capacities were not

       exceeded,         the        question          of     overcrowding           is    not       a

       question at all.                In short, provided the turnstiles

       are not cheated in some way, no part :f the ground,

       theoretically,                can        be     overcrowded            because          the

       limits that have been set are ones viich provide                                             a

       safe        tolerance.             Set        against      this      reasoning          and

       providing capacities were not exceeded                                   it would be

       illogical         for the          Police,          or   indeed for          the club,

       to set about a system of monitoring crowd density

       to     ensure       that       overcrowding               did    c:t     occur         as    a

       general phenomenon.




5.29   Having        said       this,           most        people       experienced               in

       policing          any    kind       of        crowd      are    conscious         of     the

       possibility of overcrowding and                                the   issue        remains

       as     to     when      that        consideration               wo. Id      be    at     the

       forefront         of     people's             minds.       The       fact    that       the

       crowd       might       be    at    capacity would cf course                        raise

       the possibility of crushing but in gszeral terms it

       would       still       not    suggest          that      the     stadium overall

       should       be    in    any        way       overcrowded            'especially            as

       this was          an "all       ticket"             fixture),        what would be

       of importance would be ensuring that -he turnstiles

       were policed so that people without tickets did not
                                        -41-



       get    in or that people did not jump the turnstiles

       and    the        rest.     Equally       it would        be       important          to

       monitor           the     numbers    of        people      passing           through

       turnstiles          so that when capacity was                      reached          they

       could       be     closed.       A weather eye would be                      kept     to

       possible          pinch     points       and     queues       as     the      ground

       filled        and eventually             emptied,       but     beyond         this,

       experience would not call                      for much more.                General

       monitoring of density is not something I have ever

       been familiar with.




5.30   It    has    to      be     conceded       that     if     some       unforeseen

       eventuality allowed              unrestricted            ingress         then       the

       issue of overcrowding would                       become       relevant.             All

       that        can    be     said    however         is     that      if        such     an

       eventuality occurred                it    is     likely       that      it     would

       arise       from some sort of crisis or loss of control,

       when    sober           consideration       of    possible         consequences

       not previously countenanced is perhaps less likely.




5.31   The    bottom        line    really       is     that    in     the      light       of

       existing          experience,        and       recognising          that       police

       planning at football matches takes for granted the

        inadequacies of football                  grounds,       there         is    nothing

        so    outlandish           about    the       Hillsborough             Ground        or
                          -42-



Leppings   Lane       turnstiles    in particular that would

have   caused     a    typical     police   commander   to   have

intervened in the         arrangements      for this particular

football match.
6       THE SAFETY CERTIFICATE FOB HILT.SwnponriTT



6.1    The      history           of        the     safety           certificate            for

        Hillsborough             is    well       documented           in    Lord     Justice

        TAYLOR's       report^and                  there       is      little       point    in

        me    reiterating the sequence of events.                                  There are,

        however,       s:me specific               issues      for me         to    consider.

        Primarily there                is   the     question         of what         role did

        the police play                in the alterations                  made     after   the

        1981 game,          and should the police                      have pressed for

        modificatizrs to the safety                       certificate              because of

        those charges?




6.2    I     have     me;    and       discussed         with        Mr.     R.J.     GOSLIN,

        Q.P.M., v tz is now retired,                     the events of 1981.                 At

        that        time,    Mr.       GOSLIN       was        the     Assistant        Chief

        Constable           (Operations)            of      the        South        Yorkshire

        Police                    had         overall          responsibility               for

        Hillsborough.




6.3    At the 19E1 semi-final, Mr. GOSLIN made                                     a decision

        to    remove        fans       from       the    Leppings           Lane    terraces,

       necessary            in    his       view,        "to      ease        a     dangerous

        situation vhere                serious      injury        or    even       fatalities

       were a real possibility".

                                      -44-



6.4    He    further expressed the view that the capacity of

       the Leppings Lane terraces,                 10,100 was too high and

       that more division was necessary so that spectators

       did not form a solid mass.




6.5    At a    debriefing           subsequent     to     the    1981    incident.

       Inspector       CALVERT        expressed      a     view^a ^      that      the

       central entrance to the Leppings Lane terraces,                             the

       tunnel,      caused delays and blockages and was in need

       of      reconstruction.               It     was         resolved          that

       Mr. GOSLIN,           would       take     the     matters        up       with

       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.




6.6    On    30th   April,       1981,     Chief     Superintendent           HEROLD

       reported        to     Mr.     GOSLIN      that     he    had     r=t      with

       Mr. ENGLAND, the Sheffield Wednesday Club Secretary

       on    28th April,         1981.     He advised Mr.          ENGLAND that

       the     police        regarded      the     Leppings       Lane     terrace

       capacity as being too high and were also in favour

       of     radial        fencing      which     extended       back     to      the

       turnstiles^ )         .


6.7    On the 5th June 1981,               the Chief Constable cf South
                                                                           (c )
       Yorkshire Constabulary wrote                  to    Mr.    McGEE,           the

       then     Chairman         of      Sheffield        Wednesday        Football

       Club.     In his letter he stated, "The Leppincs Lane

            end is not constructed                   to give maximum aid to the

            packing and control                of    the crowd       and the accepted

            crowd     capacity      is        such    that     there       is    no    safety

            margin".        He   further advised that a meeting of the

            Safety at Grounds Committee of the South Yorkshire

            County Council         should be convened at Hillsborough,

            with a view to taking                   further preventive measures.

            He     added,    "I    am         in     favour    of    a     free       zone    on

            terraces behind the goal to which spectators can be

            moved in an emergency."




    6.8     On 2nd September             1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote

            to     South    Yorkshire              County     Council      referring          to

            radial      fences,         it    stated,        "It    is    intended         that

            these     fences      are    so        positioned       that    they       divide

            this      section     of         the     terrace       into    approximately

            three      equal      areas,            each      served       bv        its     own

            entrance".




    6*9     It   is    later made            clear that diagram 3563/1 was                     a

            representation         of        the     intentions.                It    clearly

            shows     the    radial          fences        extending       back       to     the

           turnstiles.

     6.10    Meetings of the Officer Working Party were not well

             minuted,        or recorded.               They met at Division Street

              Fire Station on 11th September                       1 9 8 1 . There              it

             was     agreed that three individual pens,                       each served

             bv     its     own    turnstiles, were              advisable,         and    that

              increased control of the terraces would result.




     6.11    The     correspondence              indicates       that   South      Yorkshire

             County Council,            Eastwood and Partners,               the Football

             Club and the Fire Service had considered in detail

              the matter of emergency exit when the radial fences

             were      built.       The      letter to South Yorkshire                  County
                                                                                               (b)

              includes       the    sentences:           " It    is our      view    that       in

              the     event       of    an       emergency        spectators         can       be

              evacuated       quickly            enough    by    the    gates       onto       the

              pitch and by the norr.al exit gates at the rear.                                  Ke

              will     of    course       be     prepared to discuss             the matter

        responsibility                     for          examining             the             safety

        implications                of     tie        radial        fencing.            The       only

        correspondence                with        the       police     over        this        issue

        relates         to      a     specific          policing       problem           -    where

        crowd       barriers             intersected with             the radial              fences

        Police          complained               of     spectators           climbing              the

         fence.




6.13    On 14th December 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote

        to South Yorkshire County Council                              stating           that the

         radial         fencing            indicated          on      their        plans          were

        substantially corcrlete and that                              representatives of

        the     South        Yorkshire           Police        had    examined          the work

        and            were               "satisfied                with           the             new

        Eastwood and                Partners          might    be     compared          with       the

        report        on     ground         rapacity          of    January        1979,      which

        minutes     of       the     Officer       Working          Party     the picture

         remains    unclear.              Certainly        the       police            sought       a

         reduction       in       the     capacity       on     the    West        Terraces,

         certainly the            police        sought    radial           fences,           to    be

        extended        across          the    concourse        to    the         turnstiles,

         certainly additional turnstiles were planned.




6.15     From other documentation                     it is clear           that         several

         attempts       to    design          a suitable        arrangement between

         the terracing            and     the     turnstiles          by    Eastwood              and

         Partners       were       made       prior    to 1985.            This        work       was

         not    however        completed          by     Eastwood           and        Partners

         because    Sheffield             Wednesday       Football          Club         shelved

         the proposals for financial reasons.




6.16     Either    way,       once       the     new   radial         fences           had     been

         built     no        steps        were     taken        to     reconsider                 the

         capacity       within          the    West      terracing.               It     can       be

         argued     that       the        engineers,          the     Club         and       South

         Yorkshire       County          Council       might        well     have            raised

         this    issue       as     it    was     very    much       their         territory.

         None of the correspondence nor minutes that                                     I have

         seen     address         the     matter.         One       telephone            message

         apparently directed to Mr. STRANGE of Eastwood                                           and

         Partners from the Club Secretary,                           Eric ENGLAND, and
                                                                           (c )
         dated 13 November 1981 is of interest.                                        Inter

        alia it says              “he       said      that     the       crush    during        the

        last        semi       final         made       him        suspicious       of        crowd

        calculations             on     that      end     anyway."          This     sentence

        apparently            refers        to    the West          terracing and might

        indicate that at least the Club and their engineers

        would have            some      knowledge that questions about the

        capacity existed and needed to be looked at.                                           This

        is     so    particularly                as     the    construction           in       1985

        involved          a    two      metre         wide     corridor          between        the

        fences        being           created.            It       was     bound     to        have

        affected the space available on the terrace.                                           At    a

        site    meeting          on     7     August 1985,            which      is minuted.

        Dr. EASTWOOD discussed this issue with                                   the Officer

        Working Party.




6.17    A further             issue     in    relation to            the West Terracing

        now revealed is that in August 1989,                                 subsequent             to

        the    publication              of       Lord    Justice          TAYLOR'S        Interim

        Report,            the        capacities              of      sectors        of         the

        Hillsborough             Ground          were    reassessed.             That of        the

        Tuesday,          21 November             1989,       during the course                of a

        football match,               the        South Yorkshire Police noticed

        that        the        North         West       Terrace           appeared        to        be

        transpired that Eastwood                and Partners            had assessed

        the    capacity from drawings                No.     1610/2     and 1610/2X

        vhich were inaccurate.                 Although        neither      of      these

        drawings, which were created by the consultants who

        preceeded      Eastwood          &     Partners,          are     available,

        drawing    No.     1610/64E^a ^,            however,      is    believed        to

        derive     from         them.         This     error        had     affected

        capacities       which          was     subsequently            reduced         to

        1500(b).




6.18    The over capacity of 800,                   served by       turnstiles        A-G

        r.eant   that,    in       April 1989,         despite         being        an all

        cicket game,       too many           people were         admitted          to the

        Vest Terraces.            If all800 had gone into pens 3 and

        4,     estimatedcapacity               of      1,200        and     1,000
                         (c )
         respectively              then        they         would        have        been

         evercrowded to the order               of    36%,     in excess         of the

        H.S.E. estimate of approximately 25%.




6.19    The police officers who were mainly concerned after

        1981     had     by      1988     left        the      Force.          In     the

        intervening           years       nothing           had        occurred         to

        illustrate       the     potential           danger       largely       because

        ehere had been few testing fixtures.                            Police views

        had of course been expressed                   in     1985 when        the use

        :f the West End terraces was changed and two

         additional               fences       put          up           to facilitate

         segregation.            So    far as        can be judged the police

         suggestion was           mainly      because       the     Club       wished       to

         accommodate       home       and     away    supporters          at       the West

         End of the ground and the police outlined what was

         considered necessary to achieve that end.




6.20     I take     it,    it would          be the role of the certifying

         authority to            satisfy themselves, having taken                         into

         account the views of the Fire Service, that the new

         arrangements          did    not     affect       capacities          and       still

         allowed for evacuation.                I do not think it is being

        over protective of              the police position to                      observe

         that police officers would not have felt themselves

        competent         to    have     calculated         the     impact          of     the

        changes      on        capacities      or     evacuation.              I    believe

         they would have              regarded that as             the    function          of

         the   local authority,              advised '-•/ engineers                 and    the

         Fire Service.




6.21     It was at this stage,                in 1985 that gate                    3 on    the

        perimeter         track        was    added        cecause        of       the     new

        penning.          It     is    clear        from     the     transcript             of

         evidence     of        Assistant       Chief       Fire     Officer,             A.K.

        gates were         there     for     police      control       purposes       and

        not for evacuation.                Calculations          as to evacuation

        times    from      these     terraces          presumed       the    perimeter

        gates would not be used.                   The standing level at the

        bottom      of    the    terraces         is    well     below      the     pitch

        level       and     it       vould        have        required       wholesale

        reconstruction to have used the perimeter gates for

        evacuation without            danger.           In effect people going

        out of      the    perimeter         gates       in    any    numbers       would

        have    been      faced with a hurdle                  at which      the    first

        faller would have produced a calamity.




6.22    The Guide to the Safety at Sports Grounds indicates

        that "a detailed inspection of the ground including

        all components and installations should be arranged

        annually         by the management.               It    should be carried

        out    by   a     person     with     a     relevant         and    recognised

        professional            qualification             and        experience        of

         inspecting existing structures.




6.23    The      Guide      goes       on      to        say      that       engineers

        commissioned            to    assess           structural          safety     may

             on.     It is clear and unmistakable from the Guide to

             infrastructure of the ground is safe and viable and

             meets the standards which are laid down,                             lies with

             management who must act on the advice of qualified

             engineers       and must        record       inspections           carried    out

             by qualified engineers.




    6.24     Whilst     police       officers        will     have       access     to    this

             Guide     and    will      usefully          refer     to    it,     no     other

             construction        could        be    put    upon     its        wording    than

             that it is not a police                  responsibility             to examine

             the     system    of    crush         barriers,      fencing,        gangways,

             gates       and         general          configuration               in       any

             authoratitive       way.         Regardless,         with         hindsight    it

             seems to be common cause that the                       configuration of

             turnstiles,       concourse,           tunnel    and    other       approaches

             and the divisions on the                  West       End     terracing       were

             such     that,    with       a        capacity       crowd,        there     were

             inherent     dangers       of     overcrowding.              An    explanation

             of that danger is apposite.




    6.25     In     brief,     in     ordinary            circumstances           the     feed

             through the       turnstiles           would     itself       be     such    that

             the crowd would be entering the stadium at a steady

             rate and be able to distribute itself according to

          comfort        and     convenience.              X sudden in-rush,                     which

         of course would be entirely unpredictable,                                     as might

         occur      if the          gates     were opened,               would        remove       the

         value of the turnstiles                        as a safety mechanism                      and

         place       a    strain        in    the        system      which        in        ordinary

         circumstances would not apply.




6.26     The West End terracing is sub-divided with                                           radial

          fences         ari    the     opportunity             to       move    between            the

          sectioned             areas,            whilst        it        exists,             almost

          disappears           if   those         sections       become         full        or    even

          over     full.         The     connection         between             the     terracing

          and     the      turnstiles             is     therefore         critical.                The

          turnstiles           do   not      serve       particular             parts        of     the

          terracing,            indeed       the        turnstiles         bring            all     the

          spectators in at one point.




6.27      Lord     Justice          TAYLOR^suggests                       that        the         surge

          into      the        ground       resulted        in       a    mass         influx        of

          spectators           opting        to    the     one       route       to     the       West

          Terrace        viich        led     them       into     the      area        which        was

          already overcrowded,                    the   implication             that    this was

          inevitable           once     the        gates    were         opened,        which        is

         very much the inference of the report,                                   is one          with

         which I take issue later in this report.                                     That

        aside,    that        the        design          did      not      prevent       this

       possibility       is now          recognisable as a serious flaw,

       although it is              acknowledged that                 the breaching           of

        the    turnstiles           was         a       factor,       although        not      a

       decisive one, in generating tension in the system.




6.28   The    features       of    the    ground         which       are     in question

       are;    the West End terracing (particularly the pens

       known as 3 and 4); access to that terracing,                                     being

       by the     tunnel          to the central pens 3 and 4, and at

       either     side       of    the     stand         to    the      wing    pens;       the

       concourse     area          at the back of               the      stand fed       from

       the turnstiles; and the turnstiles themselves.




6.29   The advantage of             turnstile entry               is     that I z      "drip

       feeds"     the    crowd           into       a    football        ground;      hence,

       having     gone        through           the       turnstiles,            there       is

       generally        no        need    to        monitor       and      control      crowd

       movement.        This       is a very important                     point      because

       police    arrangements             are very much                 based up; a this

       consideration.              The    difficulty usually                   in ranaging

       the impetus of the crowd will be at the turnstiles,

       at least before              the game.             Once       they      have    passed

       through     the       turnstiles             they have        in effect passed

       through     the       safety        valve         system        and     are     coming
                                             -56-



         through       in     such      numbers         and    so      distributed         that

         they    should          be    able      to    find     their      way     safely to

         wherever they want to go in the stadium.




6.30     It can be seen that                     if a gate        is      opened    and     the

         crowd        surge       in,        a     wholly       different          situation

         appertains.             Either       way     once     the     crowd      enter     the

         concourse       area         at    the     rear of Leppings              Lane     they

         are     faced      with        a     fairly       confusing            geographical

         layout.        Access to the various pens is to right and

         left     and       straight          on      through       the     tunnel.        The

         spectator has three choices.                         It is clear, however,

         that unless he knows                    the ground he            is most        likely

         to     opt     for      the        central      choice.           This     is     true

         whether or not the gates were open or if the crowd

         were simply entering by the turnstiles.




6.31     The    signing to the               right and left is more or less

         non-existent:            one        camera        sequence        I     have      seen

         indicates       a small sign                 to the     right with an arrow

         saying "standing" but this is not noticeable;                                    there

         is     nothing          to        the     left.       The        one     noticeable

         direction          is    the       placard        which       says       "standing"

         above the tunnel entrance to pens 3 and 4.^a ^

6.32    The next issue is that the tunnel is dark and has a

        sharpgradient         at    the         terrace           end,       (in     fact 1:6

        well     beyond       the     Green       Guide           recommendations                of

        l:10.^a ^       Further       measurements                 have      revised           this

        figure     to     1:6.8).          If    the         numbers         entering           the

        tunnelare       great       it     might             have the          effect            of

        careering the crowd towards pens 3 and 4.                                        In fact

        the gradient in the tunnel may have had more to do

        with      the impetus         of        the     incoming             crowd        to the

        terracing than the opening of the gates.




6.33    When the whole         of     the west terracing                     is examined,

        at   least      in    the   light of                what       is now known, the

        design problem concerns                  the        radial        fencing.             This

        fencing         is    so     constructed                  as    to     divide           the

        terracing into four,               and pens           '3' and          '4'       are    two

        of the four divisions,                  both served by                 the central

        tunnel.         The    radial       fencing does allow,                      if         the

        gates       at the     rear       of the            fencing          are     open, for

        spectators       to    move      between            the        various       sections.

        However, it is now fairly obvious that if the crowd

        is anywhere near capacity it is unlikely                                    that many

        people will be able to effect such movement without

        difficulty.          The gates which allow this are                               out of

        view when        entering        pens         '3'    and        '4',       and    at    the

        opposite rear corner from the tunnel entrance.

    6.34      Hence,     although              there         is     the        possibility          of

             movement        between          the     pens,        if    the     terracing          is

              anywhere       near       to    capacity,           the likelihood             is   that

             people will be stuck                    in the part of              the    terracing

              that they       first enter.              The        small       walls    on either

              side of    the       tunnel entrance                add     to    the difficulty

             by     tending        to    direct        the        incoming       crowd        either

              alongside the central radial fence,                               or between         the

             barriers        diagonally,              =-nd    tend         to    obstruct          the

              opportunity of moving tc the right or left,                                    towards

              the gates leading into " e wing pens.^a ^




    6.35     In     short,    the       lack     of    continuance              of     the    radial

              fencing        to         the      turnstiles               allows        for        the

              possibility          of    certain sections                 of     the    terracing

              becoming considerably overcrowded in the event of a

              capacity crowd.




    6.3 6    This may seem now to be a statement                                of the obvious

              because of          course        that is       exactly           what    happened.

              The    questions           are,       hcvever,        could        it    have       been

              anticipated          and        even     if     we        can     now     see       this

              configuration              as      dangerous              why      was         it    not

              recognised?

At    one     level          it can be             argued that           the       corporate

wisdom        of    the          Safety        Committee          might           well       have

recognised              this       danger          if    they     had        examined         the

ground        together,                and    had       considered           issues          like

evacuation,             and examined the width of the gates at

the end of the radial fencing.                                        It is also            known

to     be     the        case          that    the        question           of       carrying

through        the           fencing          to        the     turnstiles             and     so

preventing          the          possibility             of overcrowding                   in the

individual          pens          had been          an     issue       "on     the         table"

and    therefore              one       imagines          the    matter        might have

been debated.




My concern is the                       role   of the police.                     I    imagine

that        whilst           the       corporate          wisdom        of    the          Safety

Committee might well have had cause for                                        concern         it

would not necessarily be                            as obvious           to    the police

members       of that Committee.                          Their       function on             the

Committee           as       I     have       said       was     primarily             to    look

critically              at       any    measures           which       affected             their

ability            to        control           the            crowd     and           to     make

suggestions that might facilitate that purpose.




In     this    case           they        were       the       main-spring             of     the

original       suggestion                to    sub-divide             the terracing in

              1981,    ironically to prevent the crowd congregating

              in a particular area and                  achieve      some       measure    of

              distribution.            On    this     occasion,      of        course,    the

              original        police        suggestion      was     to    continue        the

              divide      to the turnstiles.             This was agreed but not

              done.^a ^         On     the     second       occasion,           1985,     the

              purpose was to make better use of that part of the

              ground by creating a divide to                      allow    for home       and

              away spectators to use the Leppings Lane terraces.




     6.40     I    have     given     this     very    careful       thought       and    two

              issues      I   think    are     of     importance.         The     first    is

              that    there     are many football             grounds          with penned

              areas and areas of              terracing which            are    not wholly

              dissimilar to the arrangements on the West Terraces

              at Hillsborough.              There is nothing which stands out

              as      different or            unusual.          Secondly,          football

              grounds are not, as I have said, well laid out and

              well    planned.         They tend       to    have        evolved     rather

              than have been developed to a plan.                         The upshot       is

              that     estimating       crowd        flow   through        the    existing

              containment arrangements                is not      an easy        task.     It

              is    often     difficult       to     envisage      the    total    picture

              and     recognise the           connections          between        all     the

              various dimensions: the turnstiles approaches, the

           turnstiles,      the        feed    to     steps     and       gangways,               the

           gates,    the radial divisions, perimeter fencing, and

           other features.




    6.41   Whilst      with            hindsight          certain              risks              are

           identifiable,          over         many       years          they          had        not

           materialised         and     there was        nothing           very        much        to

           distinguish       the        Leppings         Lane      end        from      similar

           grounds elsewhere.             It is really only apparent if a

           series     of   "what        if's" are        concatenated              -    if    the

           occasion were such there would be an urgency to get

           on to the terraces,            if a large number of fans enter

           the    grounds        at     once,       if no       one        directs            them

           elsewhere,      if     pens    3     and 4 were              already overfull

           and so on.




    6.42   Thus   the Police would not                   be   likely          to     recognise

           the    problem        in      the     course         of       say,        pre-match

           planning.        As        members       of    the        Safety          Committee

           however    they may have had to consider the matter                                      -

           if so,     the question is:              when?          On    the       face      of    it

           the    Police         were     involved            in        two        series          of

           discussions      -     Post    1981        semi-final,             and       in    1985

           when     further changes were made.                       The       record        shows

           that in both cases the Police expressed views about

           crowd control but, in debate with engineers and the
                                               -62-



          Fire      Service        they        evidently          did     not      see     fit    to

          challenge              the     visdom         of         their           professional

          colleagues.




6.43     At    the     risk       of    repetition           may        I make       the    point

          again:       the        whole        tone     of        the        'Safety        Guide'

          indicates that engineering questions in relation to

          safety       were        technical           matters           for        "qualified"

          people.




6.44     The     difficulties which occurred                        in the ground may

          have been compounded by                      the opening of               the gates.

          This      was     caused        by       problems        of    crushing          at    the

          turnstiles - was nhe engineering                              of the      turnstiles

          itself a foreseeable danger?




6.45     On    the    face        of    Lz     a    bank     of    some       23    turnstiles

          feeds almost half the ground                        capacity.             There were

          in   total        83    turnstiles           in    use    on       the day,       which

          indicates         at    the     outset       an     imbalance.^ I t                    has

          to   be     taken        into      account         that       at    most       football

         matches these turnstiles will feed the "away" crowd

         which       is     generally           much       smaller       than       the     "home"

          crowd      and          therefore           the     turnstiles              are        not

         generally under the sort of pressure they would be

        on a semi-final day.                 Regardless,             the construction

        of    these     turnstiles          leaves        much       to    be        desired.

        There    is    a natural           funnel       from      the main          road       and

        something of a gradient from the main                              road       towards

        this funnel.          There        is however some expansion room

        to the     right      facing        the     turnstiles            alongside            the

        river,    but     this    area       is     generally         kept          as    a    'no

        man's    land'    to prevent             conflict         with     fans          at    the

        other    end     of   this        particular          stretch          of    footway.

        Either way, in the event of a capacity crowd it is

        difficult       to     see     how       orderly          queueing          could       be

        maintained           given         the      construction                of        these

        turnstiles.




6.46    The     iron    gates        in    front        of     the    turnstiles               can

        provide something of a crowd barrier and operate as

        a valve        in the event of              the      turnstiles being put

        under pressure.           On       the    road       side    of     those         gates

        there is of course a good deal of expansion room to

        right and left along the main road.^a ^




6.47    After the events of                1981     the police            had expressed

        concern        both     about        the        capacity          in        the       West

        Terracing        and         the         need        to      distribute                the

        prepared plans supported by the Safety Committee to

I
           Whilst     the     November         minute       probably             relates        to

           rival    fans     clashing      rather than overcrowding,                        the

           interpretation         seems        to    convey           that       whilst     the

           proposals        for   extra     turnstiles               and    more    internal

           division        were      supported,             tinkering             with      the

           existing structure            around Leppings               Lane       turnstiles

           was not valuable.




    6.49   The     question       really       is    as         to    whether        in     the

           circumstances of a match :f this kind it might have

           been     foreseeable           that           this        configuration              of

           turnstiles would be             dancerous from a crowd control

           point of view.          I say "da-zrerous" not "difficult" -

           it will always be difficult.                     The only real measure

           is of course experience.



    6.50   A very disciplined crowd :f whatever size might be

           prepared to queue without causing much difficulty.

           It is not the nature                of football            crowds,       however,

           to be quiet and respectf-1                     when       they are queueing

           at turnstiles as the deadline of the kick off                                   time

           approaches       and    in    the     festive         circumstances             of    a

           semi-final.        That does not -ean that they are bound

           to be disorderly,            it only -eans that some degree of

           milling and urgency             can      is     anticipated.             Usually,

           of     course,     even      football          crowds           are     reasonably

           behaved      and       are      aware          of         the         dangers        of

           overcrowding at turnstiles and show some measure of

           restraint.

6.51   I have considered two things.                   The first is that in

       the   experience          of   all     the    officers       policing        this

       football ground on major occasions                         as well     as     the

       general       run     of       football       games,        the      sorts     of

       problems      experienced         at    this    match       had      not     been

       experienced         before.       It    is difficult          therefore        to

       draw the conclusion that they                       were    errant     in     not

       anticipating,         in the planning,              the sort of problem

       which in fact occurred.                 The    second observation              is

       that in looking at this grouping                       of    turnstiles it

       has to be said that there are lots of similar banks

       of turnstiles,         and lots of grounds where the crowd

       has   to be channelled down                  narrow    side       streets      or

       between       terraced         housing         in     the     approach         to

       turnstiles.         Indeed the expansion area on the main

       road on the far side of the iron gates is probably

       greater     than     in    the    approaches          to    ir.any    football

       grounds.       The    approach         along Wembley Way provides

       at    least    as    much      potential        for    packing         at     the

       forward turnstiles as does Leppings Lane.




6.52   In    my      judgement,         whilst       with     hindsight            these

       turnstiles are not             satisfactory          to handle        capacity

       crowds     if there is the possibility that that crowd

       might behave in the way the crowd                          reacted on this
                                         -67-



        fatal occasion, in the planning stages of the match

        there     was      no    evidence            and    nothing          obvious         upon

        which to make a judgement                      that       the       approaches         to

        these        turnstiles            were             so      dangerous                that

        extraordinary plans               needed to be             laid.           In    short,

        the     police       might      expect        difficulties                because      so

        many     Liverpool         fans     would           use    those          particular

        turnstiles but the typical reaction I believe would

        be    that     the      police     would           try    to    ensure          a    good

        number       of   officers         at    the        turnstiles            to    achieve

        some level of co-operation in queueing.




6.53    Furthermore,         it seems that over many years                              none    of

        the parties to the certification had recognised the

        difficulty or made strong comment about it.                                      Having

         said this        the Officer Working                    Party Minutes              of 13

        November          1985^a ^         do         refer            to         "continuing

        problems"         caused     by    the       merging       of       spectators          at

        the Leppings Lane End.                   These       remarks were however

        made     shortly        after      the       decision          to    increase          the

        number    of      turnstiles        and       improve          the    division          of

        supporters,          proposed           by     Eastwood             and    Partners,

        after the 1981 debacle, had been shelved.

6.54    At that meeting the Safety Committee seemed to take

         the view that short of actioning the plans prepared

         by    Eastwood    and        Partners,         ir.inor alterations                    would

         not solve many problems.                      It rr.ay also be                construed

         from     this    perhaps          ambiguous             minute           that        police

         concern at that          time          was     rather        more        to     do     with

         mixing of home and away supporters than the volume

         of supporters.




6.55    In     respect    of     both       the        racial         fencing           and     the

         turnstiles,           indeed        in        respect          of        the         Safety

         Certificate^^           in     general,            a    word     must           be     said

         about     "judgement".             I     have       continually               made      the

         point    that    •judgment         is     a     function            of     knowledge.

         The     recognition      of        this       difficulty            largely           turns

         upon watching the behaviour cf a capacity crowd.                                          A

         capacity        crowd     presents             an       entirely              different

         experience       to    policing          a     fcctball         ground           with     a

         crowd     below        capacity.              By       definition               capacity

         entails that the fixtures of the ground                                   are        tested

         to their presumed safe limit.




6.56    Policing     a crowd where                capacity         is not          approached

         never presents          a difficulty               cf    overcrowding,                 even

         at    pinch-points           it    is     rare         for     this        particular

         issue to arise because there is usually sufficient

t

           expansion room.               To have        recognised the difficulty

           it     is     likely       that     the      people             involved     in      the

           certification             process        would           have       had     to     have

           observed          the      ground        and        the          effect      of      its

           configuration whilst                it was at capacity on several

           occasions.




    6.57   To note that similar games have been played in the

           past     is    not      entirely       to    the        point.       When a very

           unusual       game is         afoot    such     as          a    semi-final        there

           are     so    many       matters        to     be       considered          that     the

           careful       sort       of   observation           I       have    in    mind     will

           probably          not    be     made.        Equally             whilst     problems

           would surface there may be tensions that would not

           surface.          Perception would be coloured by the fact

           that        the    officers           were      policing             a     "one-off**

           occasion.           In     short,       having          policed       one     or     two

           capacity crowds is not really preparation.



    6.58   I would like to make an analogy at this point which

           may     have        some       relevance.               A       Boeing      747     has

           automatic pilot               and in     ordinary               circumstances        can

           land     quite       safely       on     that       basis.          The     pilot     is

           there,       not because he needs                   to      make     decisions        in

           the functioning of the automatic pilot, but for the




4
                                         -70-



       outside       chance       that     something untoward may occur.

       If     something          untoward         does     occur        he    brings         his

       experience          and     judgement         to     bear       and    intervenes,

       hopefully decisively.                   To have       simply been               in    the

       "cock-pit"          whilst      the     plane       has     landed         safely      is

       not of itself a test of the pilot.                              The pilot needs

       to have managed the plane                      in its        landing sequence

       himself       on      many        occasions          so      that          he     would

       recognise        anything          which          might     be        regarded         as

       abnormal        and       has     the        skill        and        technique         to

       take-over.




6.59   Applying this analogy to the occasion in question,

       my point is that having been present at one or two

       previous      similar games when the immediate problems

       did     not     surface         cannot         really           be     counted         as

       thorough-going             experience.              The     bottom          line       is

       probably       that       games       of     this    sort        should         not   be

       played except where policing arrangements can fall

       back     on     a     considerable            experience              of     policing

       capacity       crowds       - but          this     again       is judgement           in

       the    light     of       tragedy      which        has    been       examined         in

       minute detail.




6.60   Hence,     whilst         it    can     be    said        that       the    corporate

       wisdom     of       the    Safety          Committee        might          well      have
recognised some possibility of overcrowding because

of    the     configuration,            ir   the     event      it     did    not.

Either way, the police represented only one part of

that judgement and would probably not be the party

most    likely      to    take    up     that      issue.        For     reasons

already        explained          that        kind       of     issue        would

generally be         one    raised       ry    the    local       authority's

officers or the Fire Service.                      Whatever, because no

one    had     experience         of    mrsitoring            crowd     movement

when    the ground          was    at rapacity,            the problem had

not     surfaced      and    a    false       impression          was       given.

Indeed the experience                  th*z did exist was               that the

configuration did not              present a problem                  and    might

well         have     solved           prrblems.              Finally,         the

configuration,           albeit    unsatisfactory,              is one which

is     not    entirely      unrecoc-isahle            in      other     football

grounds.




For these reasons            whilst I consider                 there    is    some

degree       of     responsibility           on    the     police       to    have

given more consistent advire on some aspects of the

existing configuration,                 (re-inforcing what they had

requested earlier)           that responsibility is very much

mitigated by the            actual       r:le of the police and by

their limitations            in bringing to bear                 the    sort of
-I




     wisdom    which      would   have   been      required    to    have

     recognised     the    problem.      It   is   difficult    to    see

     that     the   South     Yorkshire       Police    behaved       any

     differently than would have a typical police force.




                                                                            j
PLANNING



A good contingency plan is a fairly brief                             document

that     provides          for      a      command        system        and     a

communications            system,       identifies            resources       and

locates       rendezvous           points       and      other        critical

locations.




Most     forces      will        have     a    variety         of     specific

contingency        plans     but     the      point      is    really      this.

The     critical          aspect     of       any      contingency          plan

concerns       the        mobilisation            of     resources,           the

provision of equipment               and      communications          and     the

development          of     logistics.              Thereafter         it      is

primarily the role of the incident commander to use

those    resources,         (manpower         and physical)          according

to how he sees            fit,   and based upon his                 experience

as an operational commander.




Plans written with detailed instructions of what to

do     next   do     not     work.         They        presume      that      the

circumstance       for which one is planning will unfold

in a particular way and of course that can never be

predicted.           The     unique           circumstances           of      the

      necessary    - what     matters        is       flexibility        and       the

      ability of the commander to command.




7.4   Applying these thoughts to football/                    it should also

      be    said that the behaviour              of      football    crowds         is

      capable of indefinite elaboration.                    To suggest that

      there might be one plan if crowds come late/                             or    a

      different plan if crowds come early, or a different

      plan    if the pitch     is        invaded,     or a    separate         plan

      for crowd misbehaviour in each ground location, and

      so on, is quite out of the question.                    The best that

      the    commander     can hope       to do       is to identify crowd

      behaviour when        it is    abnormal         and    then    apply         his

      manpower    and his      communications             and his equipment

      to deal with the problem in hand.




7.5   In a word, the       art of        command      in these      situations

      lies    in making      the best use           of what is available

      and of     inventiveness,          imagination and a good                deal

      of     leadership.       It    isinconceiveable               to   me     that

      anyone     could     write     a     set      of     plans     for       every

      potential     contingency           which       might     occur         at     a

      football game,       and even more            difficult to         see how

      officers     couldbe    briefed             beforehand of          all       the

      many variations         to the plan         to be put into effect

             if    those     circumstances          occurred.        Kien      situations

             become        frantic,     people      do    not    have      the     time     to

             start     consulting       written          orders.        Che    only       real

             chance of control is for a commander to give clear

             orders,       for there to be the means                fcr those         orders

             to be transmitted and for everyone to do their best

             in the circumstances.




     7.6     On 20 March 1989, Hillsborough was ciosen to stage

             the     FA     Cup     Semi-Final           Football        r.atch    between

             Liverpool       and Nottingham          F o r e s t . T h i s           was    to

             be played on Saturday 15 April 1989.                          Lord Justice
                      (b)
             TAYLOR            notes         that        "As     anct-her         specific

             example,       in selecting Hillsborough as the venue for

             the Cup semi-final,             the FA did not c:-sider in any

             depth whether it was suitable for a high risk match

             with     an     attendance        of    54,000        reti r i ng       to     be

             segregated,          all   of    whom       were,     in     effect,         away

             supporters       lacking week          in week        out    knowledge        of

             the    ground.        No   special       inspection         was      made;    no

             consultation with Sheffield Wednesday or                          the    local

             authority took place."



     7.7    The South Yorkshire Police then had just 17 working

            days to plan and implement an operatic; which would

             entail deploying                 over    800     police     officers       in    and

             around       Hillsborough.              A   second      operation      entailed

             policing the City itself and the additional                                traffic

             which        was     to     be     expected       as    54,000       supporters

             converged on the ground.




    7.3     In all        1,122    officers          were     deployed,        representing

             38%         of      the         total       South       Yorkshire           Police

             strength.                  By    any    standard       this   was      a    major

             operation.




    7.3     There        was,    however,          some salvation.         An     identical

             fixture had          been        held     only    12   months       previously.

             The    venue       was      the    same,       many    of   the    same     police

             officers were available, indeed many if not most of

             the fans were              the    same.        There were no criticisms

             of the policing of the event in 1S88,                             indeed     there
                                  (b)
            was         praise.              Any     major     changes      to     the       1988

            plan would have been folly indeed,                           and more        likely

             to lead to confusion than improvement.




    7.10    On     27    March     1989 Chief Superintendent                   DUCKENFIELD

             took over          command        of    ’F ’ Division,        which       policed

            Hillsborough.               He was       the only senior            officer      who

            had not been present at the 1988 Semi-Final; his

                 experience     of    policing       Hillsborough was,                at best,

                 limited.      it is    inconceiveable                that he would           have

                 instigated     much    change.            He    rightly        familiarised

                 himself with the plan              and the ground,             beyond        this

                 he made little contribution to the overall plan.




        7.11    Chief      Inspector     BEAL        was        the     author         of     the

                 Operational     Order        in     1989.        He     had        previously

                 written       such      orders,           amongst            others,          for

                 Semi-Finals in 1987 and 1988.




        7.12    An   FA. Cup    Semi-Final         brings        two     sets    of     'away*

                 supporters     to    a ground:        the       stakes       are    high      and

                 segregation is        a critical          issue.        Since       Liverpool

                 supporters were expected to approach the City from

                 the North and West,           their       fans were allocated the

                 North and West        Stands       and the West Terraces.                     The

                 Nottingham     Forest        supporters              were     expected         to

                 approach      from     the        South        and     East     and         their

                 supporters    were     allocated          the    Spion        Kop     and     the

                 South Stand.




        7.13    Understandably,       Liverpool objected.                    For the second

                 year   running,       despite       their        bigger        home        gates,

                 their supporters were offered less than half the

         avail able tickets            and the more expensive                   at    that.

         South     Yorkshire          Police,        rightly,        in   my    opinion,

         stood     firm     -     the     difficulties              of    change      were

         enormous       and      to      have        acceeded        to    Liverpool’s

         request would have been, quite siaply, wrong.




7.14    The     operational         order       itself       vas     written         in   a

         fairly        standard          format,           giving         Information,

         Intention            and         M e t h o d . D e t a i l s                     of

         administrative             matters       and        communications           were

         depicted in the method and in the appendices to the

         order.




7.15    There     is   nothing         contentious           in     the   Information

         Section,      it       properly        indicates           the    anticipated

         sequence of events.




7.16    The     Intention        is      brief,       to      the    point      and       is

         reproduced here:

                  "Intention


                  It   is     the     intention         of    the    Police      to

                  to   segregate         and    control       opposing         fans

                This will be attained and displayed with

                professionalism".



7.17   The    dangers       of    overcrowding        generally           within       the

       ground or within -any particular area of it are not

       specifically              acknowledged          in     the            operational

       orders.        As I have argued in an earlier section of

       this report I believe                  the Police       were entitled to

       rely on the Local Authority certification that the

       ground       could    safely       accommodate         54,056          spectators

       and that number of tickets had been sold.




*.18   In    short,       entry    was by      ticket       only        and    a "safe”

       number of tickets had been issued - therefore there

       should be no general overcrowding.                           Crowd problems

       possibly, but not overcrowding as such.                                The Police

       contribution          to    the issue      of    overcrowding             was    to

       ensure that nobody other than valid                          ticket holders

       passed        through       the turnstiles.             The        operational

       order        gives     considerable         emphasis             to     turnstile

       control.



*.19   So    far     as     can    be    judged       from        the     operational

       orders,        the    de-briefing          notes       of        the     previous
                                            -80-




       semi-final,           and    other          documents,         overcrowding            was

       not raised as an issue by the Sheffield Wednesday

       Football        Club,        the          Officer       Working        Party,          the

       Police         themselves,                  Liverpool          Football           Club,

       Liverpool Supporters Club or anyone else.                                   Although

       there     is    now        some      evidence        that      at    the    previous

       game people had been packed tightly,                             the issue does

       not    seem      to    have          emerged       in    any    debrief          and    no

       complaints           had     been         received       by     the     Police          or

       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.




7.20   If it was        the case             that the arrangements produced

       an acute and alarming state of affairs on the West

       Terraces        or    at     Leppings            Lane    in    1988,       one    would

       have expected some                   kind of complaint               to have been

       made    somewhere.              As    the        issue was      not    raised,          as

       indeed     it    was        not       raised       in    relation          to     other

       turnstiles or other parts of the ground, it was not

       given attention.                It is difficult to see how any of

       the    planners        might         have        placed this         issue       on    the

       agenda    given        that          in     the    17    days       available          for

       planning        there       were          many     other      mighty       issues       to

       sort out.




7.21   The    execution           of     the       plan    is     treated         in     three

       phases.        Phase        One      - prior to          the kick off;            Phase
1
                                      -81-



           Two   -   the   game    itself,     (which   may    have       included

           extra time); and Phase Three started at the end of

           the match itself.




    7.22   Geographically the operation was divided into three

           sectors, each under the command of a Superintendent.




           Sector One -       Hillsborough                  Superintendent

    7.23   From 1988 Superintendents GREEir-'OOD and MARSHALL had

           swapped    functions.        Superintendent      CHAPMAN       retained

           the   Nottingham        Supporters.      Sectors        were     further

           divided into sub-sectors under the               command of Chief

           Inspectors,        in    short      a   standard         hierarchical

           structure       was     employed.        Chief      Superintendent

           DUCKENFIELD        elected     to    station     himself        in     the

           control    room,    which was       commaried,     as   in     1988,   by

           Superintendent MURRAY.
                                         -82-



7.24    Whilst Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD was                                  lacking

         in experience of policing a match of this order he

         was surrounded           by    Superintendents               who    had     as       much

         relevant         experience          as        the     Force       could    muster.

         There      may    have    been        a    case        for      placing      a       more

         experienced officer             in command but there was also a

         not      unreasonable         case,       based       on     prevailing         police

         practice,        that he was          the Divisional               Commander          and

         was      sufficiently         well    supported            to    command         -    the

         responsibility was his.




         The Distribution of Manpower at the Ground




7.25    The     manpower      available            at    the     ground      in    1989       was

         801,      127    less    than       the    928       utilised       in     1988.

         The distribution was as follows:




       Duties                          1988               1989                    Variation

7.26     It had been felt,           in 1988,    that        too many officers

        had     been    under        employed,      a      10%     reduction      was

         sought.       This    was     largely      achieved         by    reducing

        units from a sergeant and 10 police constables to a

         sergeant and 8 police constables.                       In the event,      a

         reduction      of     127     officers         or    almost       14%    was

        achieved.



7.27    At the Liverpool end of               the     ground       the    reduction

        was     74 officers     or     20%,   this,       however,       still left

        that sector with the largest single number of men,

        290 or 36% of the total.



7.28    These    figures      neglect the fact that of those shown

        in the ground sector,              79 officers were stationed at

        the Leppings Lane turnstiles and Stand area.
7.29     In   considering   the   Liverpool    sector   (outside   the

         ground)    in particular,     we can see a distribution as

         follows:

7.30      I note that the         reduction in staff          is distributed

          throughout        the   differing     sections       and     that    the

          larger cuts are made where the numbers are greatest

          zr,   for example,       at Middlewood Road, where in 1988

          tver-manning had been identified.




7.31      It    is   also    worthy    of    note     that    the     number    of

          officers     dedicated       to    searching,      and    the    mounted

          officers,     who       represented        two     thirds       of   the

          available mounted staff,            were unchanged.
                                     -86-



7.32     Final ly, on distribution of manpower,                 I should like

         to   consider     the     issue    of   reserves.       As      functions

         changed during the          3 phases       of     policing,       I    shall

         confine    myself    to    the    first pre-match phase only.

         In 1988 there was a reserve serial stationed at the

         Spion    Kop/South       Stand    car   park.       It was       scarcely

         used and was dispensed with in 1989.




7.33     That left two       reserve       serials    in 1989,        serials      20

         and 21, under the command of Inspectors DELANEY and

         BERESFORD.       Each     comprised        one    sergeant       and     ten

         constables and they were stationed in the gymnasium

         and adjacent to the Police Control Box respectively.



7.34     According    to     the     order,      these      serials       were     in

         reserve:     throughout           Phase      One     they        had      no

        designated operational function.




        Debriefing 1988




7.35     In accordance with the South Yorkshire Constabulary

        Policy,      at     the     conclusion        of     each        game     all

         sergeants    are    required       to   submit      written       debrief

        notices,     before       leaving     the g r o u n d . F r o m          such

        means lessons are learned, consequently the

        following changes        to the      1988 plan,          identified       as

        being    valid     by      Superintendent             MTERAY,           were

        implemented:^3 ^




        7.35.1    Communications            (UHF) had been interrupted

                  by local       radio.        An    immediate survey was

                   conducted but           the police       equipment          could

                  not    be     faulted.          It was    also found that

                  officers         within            the       Stadium           had

                  difficulty       in       hearing    transmissions made

                  and    therefore,          ear     pieces      -ere     ordered

                  for    issue        to    all     officers      vith        radios

                  within         the        grounds        for      the         1989

                  Semi-Final.




        7.35.2    Transmissions              from     mobile        units         in

                  relation       to     problems       with      traffic       were

                   received       at       Force    Operations       Room        and

                  were not monitored by               the Police Control

                  Room        within         the     Stadiuir.           It      was

                  considered           sensible        that       any         future

                  Semi-Final would continue to utilise this

                  format and,          indeed.      Chief     Superintendent

                  (Operations and Traffic) undertook to




(a)   Witness Statement, Chief Inspector D.J. BZX.L (4/7)
organise     and        implement     all        matters      in

relation     to     traffic        including             manning

identified        road      junctions          for        manual

direction.




Hand made traffic signs and parking signs

were   used        in     1988     due      to      financial

reasons.      In 1989 the Club             agreed        to pay

for AA signs        and these were complemented

by additional           hand made     signs         to    assist

supporters in finding car parking areas.




The use of        search squads at Oughtibridge

and Tankersley had the              counter-productive

effect of causing undue delays in coaches

and    transit           vans      arriving          at      the

Stadium.      For       1989,     it was       decided that

one team only would be               at each         location

for    selective          checks         and      that       all

personnel     outside       the     Stadium         would     be

charged        with             selective           checking.

Adhesive     stickers       were     used      to    identify

vehicles     checked       to     assist       officers       at

subsequent locations.

7.35.5   CCTV    was     used       at Wadsley Bridge Railway

         Station, the monitor for same being sited

         in the Police Control Room.                      This took up

         valuable        space       and     it    was    agreed             that

         this    would        not    be     implemented            in    1989.

         Having       said that,          portable video             cameras

         had    been purchased for use by the                            Force

         via the Football Trust and it was decided

         to utilise these in 1989.




7.35.6   It    was     found       that     as    Phase       Two    of       the

         game    approached,          a     number       of    peripheral

         serials            were          under      employed                 and

         therefore.           Serial             Instructions                were

         amended       to    utilise        this manpower               in    the

         Leppings       Lane        and    Penistone          Road       North

         areas of the ground throughout this phase

         until the 'final whistle'.



7.35.7   At    the     end of the 1988 Semi-Final                        there

         was      a     pitch        invasion            by        Liverpool

         supporters         from the North Stand.                       Serial

         Instructions          were       therefore,          amended         for

         1989     to    ensure        an    increase          in    manning

         levels        around       the      perimeter          track          to

         cater for this eventuality.
                         -90-



7.35.8    k    general     complaint        was       made    regarding

          the     quality       of    meals       and        rlans       were

          therefore           made,         in         liaison           with

          Headquarters        catering,          to    provide       a    hot

          meal to all personnel whilst the game was

          in progress.




7.35.9    As    Leppings      Lane     traffic         island       was    a

          potential flashpoint at Phase Three and a

          point where both sets of supporters would

          be    close    to    each    other,         the    1989    Order

          directed extra manpower                 to thst location

          at the end of the game.




7.35.10   If possible,         the    SYT    buses      in Penistone

          Road     North        should        queue          closer        to

          Catchbar       Lane        and     so       helc     to        keep

          Nottingham       supporters         further         away       from

          Leppings Lane traffic island.




7.35.11   As an abundance            of call signs could lead

          to    confusion,       officers         of    the     rank       of

7.35.12   As    always,          officers    on     the     West     Stand

          Serial       were         to      be      extra         vigilant

          regarding         fans         climbing      up     from       the

          terracing into the Stand.




7.35.13   A sterile area was to be provided                        on the

          Spion Kop (North Wing)                 to house Liverpool

          supporters who purchased tickets for that

          area.




7.35.14   The   1988      Order     resulted        in some officers

          on      peripheral             Serials         being       under

          employed.         A 10% reduction therefore, was

          to    be   sought        and    could     be      achieved      by

          reducing those Serials                 from one         Sergeant

          and ten Police Constables to one Sergeant

          and     eight     Police        Constables,        and    mobile

          units      from    one     Sergeant       and      six    Police

          Constables         to      one     Sergeant         and        five

          Police Constables.               A standby resource of

          officers          at     Phase      Three         was     to     be

          introduced        into Phase Two             of    the    Order,

          comprising         50    officers       in     Leppings        Lane

          and 50 officers in Penistone                      Road North.

          Police      coaches were          to be used            to house

          the officers.
                                          -92-




          7.35.15         To negate mobile units being utilised for

                          prisoner        transportation,                 three      transit

                          vans     were        to      be    identified            for     that

                          purpose.




7.36      These adjustments             amount to little more than                         fine

          tuning     of    the     1988    Order,           which    is     what     I would

          expect     given       that     the       policing        in     1988     was     not

          subject of criticism.




7.37      There are however,              two specific areas which concern

          me:      the     first      relates          to     the     perimeter           gates

          outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles;                             the second to

          the tunnel under the West Stand.




          7.37.1         There is evidence              indicating that              in    1988

                         the perimeter gates were not all open from

                         the outset        and that          they     were     used       as     a

                         filter         cordon,              thereby           preventing

                         overcrowding            between            them          and       the
                                          (a)
                         turnstiles.                 This        manoeuvre          did     not

                         form    part     of     the    1988        plan,     nor    did       it

                         feature in any debrief.                    The 1989 planners

                         therefore,        cannot           be      held      liable        for

                         failing     to    implement          it.        How it came           to

                         pass in 1988 is a matter for conjecture.

            7.37.2       In 1988 Sergeant T.               HIGGINS,         now retired,

                         recalls      being        instructed          to        close      the

                         tunnel under the West Stand and to direct

                         fans to the outer pens.                   This too did not

                         feature      in     the     1988     plan,         nor     in      any

                         debriefing          note.         Ex-Sergeant              HIGGINS

                         cannot          remember          how         he          received

                         instructions         to     close       the    tunnel       or      by

                         whom     they      were   given.         This       action         was

                         carried      out    "during        the game         and because

                         of the amount of             fans       within      pens       3    and

                               (a )   Police        planners           in    1989        would

                         have been unaware            of     this      action      - it is

                         noteworthy         however     that        the     Club     Safety

                         and Security Officer,               Mr     Lock,        does       seem

    7.38     The   Police        Control     box is        situated         at    the south

            west cornerof the ground. It               is elevated,                      above

             the   terraces and affords a                  view acrossthe pitch.

            The    box    is      very      smalland       has    seats           for three

            officers.

7.39   On     the    15th        April     1989,    these        were   occupied           by

       Superintendent             MURRAY,         the    controller.           Sergeant

       GODDARD who operated the radios and Constable RYAN

       who controlled the three telephones and the public




       address system.             The telephones were:                 one    internal

       on the Club's system, one Police phone for internal

       or external use, and one private phone for external

       use only.




7.40   At the back of the room stood Constable BICHARD who

       controlled          six    television        screens,       five       of    which

       were    linked       to     cameras      strategically           stationed          to

       give views of             inside     and    outside       the    ground.            In

       particular          these       cameras,     which        are    controllable

       and have zoom facilities,                   allow a good view of                   the

       West    terraces,          the Leppings Lane turnstiles and of

       Leppings       Lane        itself     and    the     approaches         to         the

       turnstiles.               The     sixth          camera      switched,              in

       rotation,          from    one    camera     to     another      and        made     a

       video recording.



7.41   These monitors             were situated in front of Constable

       BICHARD but behind the others, hence Superintendent

       MURRAY       was    dependant        on Constable          BICHARD      telling

       him what he could see.



7.42   The    public       address       system     was      relayed      through           a

       series       of     speakers        both     inside       and    outside       the

       ground.       In the normal course of events                       these were
                                   -95-



       used by a disc jockey,            to relay music, this however

       could be overridden by the police.                      Messages could

       be relayed to the whole ground or to specific areas

       alone.




7.43   Constable GUEST was stationed in the Club's control

       room, there he could, via video links,                     monitor        all

       the   turnstiles      and    the        numbers    entering      through

       them viich was       shown automatically on the                  screen.

       He was able to relay this to the Police Control box

       via telephone or radio.




7.44   For      serials      in         and      around        the      ground,

       communications        were        via     UHF     Channel       25     with

       Sergeant     GODDARD.       All    officers       of    the     rank      of

       Serges-it    an<j   above         were     allocated       radios,         in

       additirn     Community Constables               would   have     carried

       their :vn.




7.45   Sergeant    GODDARD       used    a portable        base      station,       a

       stand-iy     set    was     available       in the       event       of    a

       failure.     Furthermore,         a technician,         Mr.    SANDERSON

       was   available      at     Hillsborough          to    rectify        any

       techniial problems.

7.46   In    addition      to     UHF       Channel       25,     Channel         35     UHF,

       controlled         from       Hammerton          Road,    was       available       to

       units with multi-channel radio sets, and Channel 19

       was    dedicated         to    the    C.I.D.         These      channels were

       accessible to Sergeant GODDARD.                          Channel      2 VHF was

       controlled by Police                 Headquarters at Snig Hill and

       was used      by mobile           units.          Constable         BICHARD        had

       access to that channel via a hand held set.                                     There

       was    also    a     set       tuned        to     the    channel          used     by

       Sheffield     Wednesday           Football          Club    to      control        its

       stewards.




7.47   The matter of the keeping of a log was discussed by

       Superintendent           MURRAY       and     Sergeant TODDARD on the

       14th April         1989.       Chief     Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

       had    indicated         his     requirement         that       a    log    of     all

       radio messages be kept.                     Due    to the lack of space

       it    was    not     considered             feasible       t:       use     another

       officer; it was decided that Superintendent MURRAY

       and    Sergeant      GODDARD,           who       would    be       sat    side     by

       side, would maintain that log between them.




7.48   The    log    was     opened          and     maintained,            during        the

       morning       by         Sergeant           GODDARD,        tnd           later     by

       Superintendent            MURRAY.            No     entries          were         made

       subsequent to 2.21 p.m.
Throughout        the       day,    Channel       25    operated           on     talk

through,        this        facilitates          communication              amongst

units without recourse to control,                         however,         it can

be   difficult         for    control       to    exert        its    authority.

Should     this       be     necessary,         talk-through              would       be

switched        off     and        all     transmissions             would        pass

through control.




At about 2.35 to 2.40                    p.m.    reports       were        received

that     controls           transmissions           were        breaking           up.

Almost    immediately,             Mr.    SANDERSON,       the technician,

arrived     and       changed        the    Tulip       microphone              for     a

telephone handset.                 The fault remained.




The secondary set under the                      table     was       then       used.

Unfortunately the microphone                     lead was too short to

reach    above        the    desk.        After     two    or    three           calls

which     were        not      acknowledged.             Sergeant           GODDARD

assumed     that       set    to     be    faulty       too.         In    his        own

words,     "I    remember           throwing      the     handset         onto        the

control desk".              He then took the hand held set                            and

used that for all transmissions.




This,    in effect,           reduced       Sergeant        GODDARD         to        the

same priority as every other                      user,        it removed the
                                          -9 8 -




       option of switching off talk through and seriously

       reduced      his   facility            to    control.            It is difficult

       to see,      however,         what other                options      were     open    to

       Sergeant GODDARD given                      that his          main     set,   and the

       reserve      set    had        failed          and       the      technician         was

       unable to effect a repair.




7.53   The    purpose          of     having          superintendents                with     a

       command      responsibility                  for        areas     which       span    an

       operationally           viable         zone        is    to     allow      for direct

       action to be taken as and when problems arise.                                         It

       is    recognised        that when             there       is a high level             of

       background noise,              a very high                level       of    usage,     of

       some technical           fragility,            not all decisions can be

       controlled         at        the      centre.             For     these        reasons

       command      at football             grounds            is not       solely    reliant

       upon the communications system.                               The communications

       arrangements for Hillsborough were in my experience

       neither better nor worse                      than exist at most major

       grounds.



7.54   Whilst it is easy to say that for a major occasion

       of    this     sort          communications                   should       have      been

       perfect,      I have         never          known perfect communications

       at major football grounds.                         The level of investment
1                                       -99-



           in technology Las not been sufficient                         to    overcome

           the         technical     difficulties.             Unless      you     have

           experienced the very high levels of noise which are

           inevitable at a semi-final,              it is difficult to have

           an      under standing         of      how        problematic          radio

           communication c&r be.




    7.55   It     is    true   to    say that the communications                 system

           could have been improved by having telephone points

           at critical positions           and whilst this is something

           that I have reccmended over some years,                         it is not

           in     place    in mc$-      grounds.        In     one     other    respect

           too,    I would ha%5 to raise some level of criticism

           for     the     communications        plan.         There     should    have

           been a dedicated "command channel".                         In the event,

           however,       I am dravn to the conclusion                   that whilst

           communications              failed,           the           failure          of

           communications           fiii not of    itself materially affect

           the outcome on tie afternoon.                     I am not          aware    of

           any command decision taken which was not ultimately

           transmitted         and    -which     would       have      affected        the

           outcome.
        Briefing



7.56    By the     time Chief         Superintendent             DUCKENFIELD           took

        over       his    command            the        planning           process      had

        commenced.        His       first    briefing          took     place      in '-is

        office     on    29     March       1 9 8 9 ; it          was       attended by

        Superintendent             MURRAY,     Chief       Inspector            BEAL    and

        Inspector SEWELL.




7.57    Subsequent       to    further updates,             on    Friday        14 April

        1989 he briefed officers                   of    the    rank       of   Inspector

        and    above     at    Hillsborough,             and on       the morning of

        the match he addressed all officers                           at    the ground.

        Operational           Orders         were        circulated             down     to

        Sub-Sector Commander, Chief Inspector level.




7.58    Furthermore,          specific       briefings         were        hierarchical

         for   reasons        of    clarity        and    brevity,          with     Sector

        Commanders briefing their own Supervisory Officers,

        and    they      in    turn     briefing          their        Sergeants        and

        Constables.       This would be normal practice.




7.59    The briefing of the              stewards was            conducted         in two

         phases:      during the closed season and on match day.

                meeting of all stewards at the Sheffield Wednesday

                Football     Club.           There he briefed all                    the    stewards

                as   to    their           responsibilities,         in      particular         with

                regard      to     emergency          evacuation           procedures.               On

                Stewards     in        the    West    Stand.        He ensured that                 the

                stewards were properly dressed and that they                                    were

                aware     of which positions                they were           allocated.          He

7.60    The duties of          the mounted officers were                      stated as

         being to       maintain        order,       segregate       supporters        and

         escort them to and from the ground.




7.61    This     was     a    simple      brief       and       typical       of     those

         relating      to mounted officers.                 Mounted policing is

         a very specialised skill,                   officers        and horses        are

        well     schooled and as their tenure is often lengthy

         they    are    usually         very    experienced.             Briefing       is

         left     to their        own    supervisors,           in     this    instance

         Inspector       HAND-DAVIS,           who    on    this       occasion        was

         assisted by Superintendent MARSHALL.                           The    briefing

        was conducted at the Niagra Stables on                           the       morning

         of the match.




(a)    Operational Briefing Notes (SYP 14)
7.62    The    18   horses    of   the South Yorkshire branch were

         not considered       to    be    enough      and    mutual       aid   was

         sought     from Merseyside and Nottingham.                   In all     35

        horses were deployed,             6 to Midland Street              Railway

         Station,     10     to    the   Penistone          Road    end    of   the

         ground, where the Nottingham Forest supporters were

         expected,    and 19 (ore went lame on the day) to the

         Leppings     Lane    end viere         the   Liverpool       supporters

        were expected.




7.63    The    overall     strategy was both simple and sensible:

         the mounted officers            from    Nottingham        would    police

         the    Nottingham         supporters         and     the     Merseyside

         officers would police the Liverpool supporters.

EVENTS AT LEPPINGS LANE




The    second phase             of     the    operation          which       requires

comment       is     the        handling           of     the    crowd        outside

Leppings           Lane         turnstiles.               I      have        examined

statements and film evidence and I have visited the

scene.       I have also spent some considerable time in

discussion         with     experienced             mounted         officers.          I

have    at    first       some        general       observations          to make.

There are,         I think,           three    areas which have                 to    be

considered.           I    am        taking        into       account     that       the

matter       of     the      configuration                has     already        been

discussed.




The    three       questions          are     as    follows:          what    can be

said about the police handling of the crowd outside

Leppings       Lane        turnstiles          up        until    the     time       the

situation         started        to    become           critical?        Secondly,

what    can be        said       about the police operation                      once

the situation became                  difficult,           and    in    particular

should there have been either an additional plan or

an     alternative              strategy?               Thirdly,         once        the

situation was             out    of     control was             the decision          to

open    the    gates       inevitable              and    was     that    decision

taken        with         due         consideration              in      all         the

circumstances?
In dealing with the              first issue,            I have to return

to    the    comment        already      made,       'judgement             is     a

function      of    knowledge'.          Whilst      a weather          eye       is

always      kept    to     the   developing         situation,          by       and

large and with good reason, the police fall back on

previous      experience         just as they         do    in    any       other

situation.




The   history of policing these turnstiles                            was    that

they tended        to become very congested with                       a large

crowd,      such that it was difficult if not impossible

to    maintain        separate         queues       in     the     immediate

approach      to     the    turnstiles       -     that    is    to    say,       to

maintain separate queues between the iron                              railings

and   the     turnstiles.          Regardless of that,                 previous

experience had been              that,      with    sufficient          numbers

of police         officers,      order could be maintained,                      and

whilst      the    process       may   be    congested,          all    of       the

supporters          would        eventually         get     through              the

turnstiles.




Having examined what              occurred         until    the       situation

became critical,           I cannot see anything different in

the   way     that    South       Yorkshire        Police       handled          the

situation to what most other police forces handling

similar crowds would do.
8.5    Attempts were made                to     organise the crowd.                     Indeed,

        examining          the    film,^& ^      for          most      of      its   duration

        it     is    inclined           to    give        a       false      impression        of

        seriousness.              It is not until quite                      late     into    the

        film    sequence that                it becomes            evident       that police

        are losing control.




8.~    I     have     seen         large        numbers            of        people      around

        turnstiles           on        many     occasions,                and     the     sheer

        presence       of         a     large     number             of      people      in     a

        relatively          small       area     is       not      of     itself      unusual.

         (Appendix         'A',       Stamford Bridge)               For     example,        what

        was    seen    outside          Leppings          Lane       would       be   ordinary

        outside most games                   being played            at Wembley.             That

        is    to     say    there        would       be       a    huge      crowd      milling

        around outside the turnstile areas and congregating

        and aggregating towards the turnstiles.




£.3     The critical difference is whether or not the crowd

        is minded to develop                   a surge            and     momentum towards

        the turnstiles perhaps because, as                                happened in this

        case,       they fear they will                   not get          in    in time      for

        the kick off.

8.9     In short, the sheer                 presence of a large number of

          people     around the            turnstiles would not ring alarm

          bells     with     me    on       the     basis       of     my    considerable

         experience in looking at the turnstile operations.




8.10    I would add that when                     I have        in the past visited

          football grounds, which I did on a weekly basis                                  for

          some    years,      I always           made     a point of touring               the

          turnstiles        and        I     have,        I     think,       considerable

          knowledge of what goes on at turnstiles.




8.11      In the best of circumstances the police do achieve

          orderly queueing and the horses                         are used,         usually,

          to flatten out bulges and, so to speak, filter the

          crowd     before        it       reaches       the    turnstiles.           It     is

          recognised,       however,          we are not always in the best

          of     circumstances             and     ir.ajiy     grounds       have     fairly

          constricted approaches.




8.12      In those circumstances the best that could be done

          is to hold         the       crowd in check.                Ordinarily thisis

          achieved.           If the         crowd       does    surge       it    poses      a

          considerable threat because the ratios of police to

          public     issuch       that       it     is    difficult          to turn       the

          situation about once               it has          started to get out              of

          hand.

8.13    In reality the only effective police response                            to an

         uncontrolled surge around turnstiles is the use                            of

         horses    acting       together     in     some   numbers.         On this

         afternoon I would say that there would have had                            to

         have    been     a    considerable        number    of     horses,       with

         some room to manoeuvre,              to    have     achieved       a    great

         deal      in     the      circumstances             that     eventually

         appertained.




8.14     At 2.40 p.m.          it is evident        that the      situation was

         getting out of control,             and I take as a marker the

         point     at      which     Mr.      HAND-DAVIS            radioed        for

         assistance.Having                   studied the            sequence        of

         events which followed I do not take                      the view        that

         the police officers          failed in any material respect

         beyond what was possible.                I believe that given the

         resources       available    to     them     they    deployed          in the

         only way that was reasonable in the circumstances.




8.15    The alternative that has been posed                     is that          at an

         earlier        stage      than      that     at which        it        became

         critical,        it     should      have     been      obvious that

         Liverpool      spectators        were     late. Many       had not gone

         into    the    ground      and inevitably they             would       arrive

         late in large numbers and create a difficulty at

         the   turnstiles.        On    this    basis     a   secondary     plan

         should have been anticipated or devised to contain

         them some distance            further back.^a ^         I have   given

         this careful consideration and I do not give it any

         credence.




8.16    At some     stage the crowd had               to be held    in check.

        Creating     a     secondary       barrier       would     have     split

        police resources with little guarantee of improving

         things.     It is difficult to imagine how, without a

        very     considerable     extra        deployment     of   horses     and

         possibly    barriers,     some other          form of     check point

         could    have   been   set      up.     It    certainly    could     not

         have been set up quickly.                Had    it been set up        it

        may well have       either been          ineffective because          the

         area to cover would have been so great that people

         would have evaded it and ^gone round it or it would

         have created the same kind of jamming problems that

         were eventually to exist at the turnstiles.




8.17    I do not consider that the evidence, even if it had

         been available to Superintendent MARSHALL, was such

         that a reasonable         and prudent officer outside                the

         ground    would   have    moved       to a secondary plan,           for

         these reasons: firstly, an alternative plan takes

       tiaie     to    develop        and    would       require     briefing        and

       organisation, and there was little time for this as

       events         unfolded         too        rapidly;        secondly,          the

       recognition that there was a problem would not flow

       automatically            from        the    presumption        that         large

       sabers of people were going to arrive late.




8.18   Ii   is    my       experience        that    very        frequently        large

       rtnbers        of    people     arrive       late;    generally      speaking

       tiey get in on time,                 sometimes several hundred                are

       lite      getting        in.      This       is      normal   at     football

       notches and although                 in some circumstances             it    may

       he appropriate to delay a kick off, perhaps because

       s. train is          late,      generally         speaking    this     is    not

       c::e.      If it was,           latecomers would determine                  kick

       c:f time,           which    could     slip    back       indefinitely        and

       r=xe planning for all concerned impossible.




8.19   Tz   summary,         the      expectation         that    there   would      be

       Lite arrival of fans would not cause me necessarily

       t; move        to    a   secondary         plan.      I would expect           to

       i=ve to deal with the situation as                         it arose     and     I

       v:uld expect that              if they were very late it would

            their own fault if they missed the kick off.                               I

       vtuld     expect         football       supporters         to be     aware     of

8.20    My interpretation is that once the situation became

        critical        the        only        people         capable          of        achieving

        anything         were           mounted              officers.              Given        the

        resources available they did everything they could

        to achieve the only possible tactic,                                    which was to

        form     some     kind         of     line      at    the    gates          to     relieve

        pressure         on       the       turnstiles.^             I    t         is     evident

        from     the     film          that       at    some      stage        they       seem    to

        achieve this and for a minute or two it seems to be

        working.                  My     interpretaticn              of        the       film     is

        that shortly afterwards the gates to the ground are

        opened anyway, and this relieved the situation from

        the mounted officers'                     point of view.                (The evidence

        of mounted Inspector WILKINSON confirms this (c).)




8.21     I have    spent          some        time      in    tie    past       studying          and

         discussing       the          tactics         of    mounted          officers         and I

        have examined the film with the Head of the Mounted

         Department           from       the       Greater          Manchester             Police,

         Chief    Inspector             Paul      TEASDALE.              Attached         to     this

         report     is        a    statement            I     have       taken        from       Paul

         TEASDALE        in       respect          of       his     assessment            of      the

        policing outside Leppings Lane.



8.22     In    looking            at        the        actions       of        Superintendent

        MARSHALL          I            have        to        bear         in         mind         two

        considerations.             One       is     that    in    these     sorts       of

        circumstances            communications generally               work      badly.

        Much    has        been   said    about        what       occurred     at    this
                                                                                      (a)
        football       ground with            the    communications          system

        and I have to say that this is typical and reflects

        the low level of technical support which the Police

        Service       actually         gets     in    this     area.       This     is    a

        matter which has concerned us                        for many years.             We

        are    restricted         in    terms        of what      is available        and

        what budgets are available,                    and    it is     a fact       that

        we have to live with.                  Secondly, that in situations

        where there is very high ambiant crowd noise I have

        yet      to        see     any        radio         system     that         works

        effectively.




8.23    I have always recommended that                       telephone points            be

        placed        at    critical      junctures.              However,     in     the

        circumstances            as they unfolded,             that    Mr.   MARSHALL

        was only able to communicate on a fraught basis                                  is

        not surprising.




8.24    With hindsight it may be                     said that he       should have

        sought earlier to have withdrawn himself as far as

        possible from the scene to some vantage point where

        he would have had an overall view and been able to

          report back to control.                        (In fact he does appear at

          one stage to climb on the wall to attempt to direct

          e v e n t s ) . I n                   the         frenetic           circumstances

          appertaining,                it     is     difficult           to    see       that    he

          actually had the time to do much more than he did.

          From the point at which it became critical and the

         whole        police           operation           was     engulfed,         there      was

          little      opportunity             for him to take                 an alternative

         position.          My impression is that he acted according

          to    his     best           judgement           in    identifying         a    serious

          threat to life                and    limb,        staying with the problem

          and   seeking           to organise what to him was                            the only

          solution.          It could be said that his determination

          to have the gates opened reflected his professional

          concern for a situation that had got out of hand.




8.25     Moving       to         the    question            of     the   opening          of    the

          gates.        I        restrict          myself        at   this     stage      to    the

          matter of          those          police       officers        who   were       outside

          the    gates.            They       made         their      urgent    and       frantic

          request      in the belief                 that life would be                  lost    at

          the turnstiles.




8.2 6    I have only one                    query about which I have not been

          able to satisfy myself in considering whether there

        (7/4)
          was &r alternative to opening the gates                           - that      is

          the possibility that                some       effort    might    have been

          made to move the crowd from the A - G turnstiles by

          forcing       them along the             'no man's       land*    restricted

          area it the side of the river.                      Whilst I recognise

          that this would have been a difficult thing to do,
                                                                     (a)
          it dif offer potential expansion room.




8.27      As I tave said previously,                     the turnstiles act as           a

          drip feed and if the gates                      are opened under crowd

          pressure then the effect of                      that    safety       valve   is

          removed.          For       those     reasons       it     is     a    serious

          decision to open gates, and it has to be questioned

          as to whether due consideration was taken as to the

          ramifications.            In this        section however my            concern

          is to question the role of Superintendent MARSHALL

          in     particular,            and   to     ask    whether        he     had    a

          responsibility to take                any steps consequent on the

          decision to have the gates opened.




8.28      I ta>.5 the view that Superintendent MARSHALL had as

          much     is      it   was      conceivable        for     him     to    manage

          already on his hands.                He was in a situation where

          there      was    desperation            and    danger    and     he    sought

          authority to make a move which would alleviate that

        problem.         Once       that       decision    was     taken,       he    was

        still left with handling the aftermath at the gates

        and controlling the                crowd which was still arriving

        along Leppings Lane.




8.29    I take it that Superintendent MARSHALL did not have

        a    direct     responsibility to consider vhat would be

        the effect of opening the gates.                          He had,       anyway,

        no    knowledge        of   what       conditions       were     like    inside

        the     ground    and       he         had referred      the decision          to

        those that did.




8.30    It goes without saying that the request to open the

        gates was probably inevitable.                      Once       crowd control

        had      been     lost,      once        the   surge       bad     assumed      a

        potentially fatal impetus, the options available to

        Superintendent              MARSHALL - had            evazcrated.             The

        opportunity,        once         his    resources       were     overwhelmed,

         to organise anything else was simply r:t there.




8.31    At      2.40    p.m.    Mr.HAND-DAVIS             asked        for     help    at

        Leppings         Lane.^a ^              At that     time       control        was

         slipping.       At 2.47            p.m.Mr. MARSHALL rade his first

         request to open the gates.                    Gate       C v=s      opened    at

         2.52     p.m.;^            Gates       B   and    A,      a     few    minutes

         later.        The time available to interpret events                         and

        make decisions was short indeed.

8.32   The reality of controlling crowds is that once you

       are   overwhelmed            there      is     not     much       you        can do    at

       that point.           It all depends on your ability to hold

       the     situation           before        it     gets           out     of    control.

       Having said that, and having made the point that to

       have ensured any different outcome at the Leppings

       Lane turnstiles there would have had to have been a

       far     greater        deployment          of       mounted           officers      much

       earlier        in     the       day,     at     least           earlier        in     the

       afternoon,          that decision was never really one that

       would     be    in     the       mind     of        the     commander          on     the

       scene.         It    is     in    effect        a     decision          dictated       by

       hindsight.




8.33   Circumstances             leading       up      to        the     time       when     the

       situation           became       critical       allowed          the     officer       in

       charge on the scene                   to assume that              he was       dealing

       with a fairly normal situation as far as turnstile

       policing            was concerned.             Congested, difficult,                  yes

       but   not           out of       control       and it           would    have       been

       extraordinary             had    he    had      the       prescience           to   have

       guessed what was likely to occur and, at least half

       an    hour      before           the    situation           became           critical,

       summoned            all his       reserves          to that       one point.           He

       would have had to have                    had       overriding           reasons       to
                                          -1 1 7 -

             have    taken away mounted                officers       from     all    other

             duties    at    a time when             there was no real evidence

             that he needed to do so.



      8.34   I have compiled a video                  collage       showing crowds        on

             terraces       and outside        turnstiles at football games

             (Appendix       'A')    The    events       are not significant              in

             themselves       although      they       have    some parallels with

             the     fixture      with     which       we     are    concerned.         The

             voice-over on the tape by myself makes a number of

             inferences which I believe are relevant.




      8.35   In particular          the    tape       shows    circumstances         where

             large       crowds           assemble            outside          turnstiles

             immediately before            and       after    kick    off    and     whilst

             all     semblance      of     organised          queueing       disappears,

             some balance         is maintained.              The    film    also      shows

             occasions       when        crowd       misbehaviour        puts        severe

             pressure on policing                and    in    one     case     at    least,

             close parallels with the Leppings Lane scenario are

             evident.        In     all    cases       police        tactics     are     not

             noticeably different than those at Leppings Lane.

9     OVERCROWDING AT PEWS 3 AMD 4



9.1   The next phase vhich is of concern is the issue of

      overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 and the questions as

      to    who     was        responsible              for    that        occurring,         if

      anyone      was,         ajii why     was         the     dangerous            situation

      which    emerged           ^ot      spotted         early       enough         for    some

      remedial action t o be taken?




9.2   The     first        iss.a,         responsibility                 for    preventing

      overcrowding,             is   an    enigmatic            one.       I have          to go

      back     to        the     iebate       that           ensued       following          the

      Bradford Fire             a-=.d the evidence which I prepared on

      behalf of The Association of Chief Police Officers

      ACPO     and        submitted        with         Mr     James       ANDERTON,         the

      Chief       Constable          of      Greater            Manchester,            to     Mr

      Justice            POPFLTKELL                in        his         Inquiry.            The

      observations             ir.eie in     the        POPPLEWELL          Final       Report

      (paras.       4.13        and 4.14)          are a matter of               record in

      Lord    Justice           TaYLOR's       Interim          Report         (para.       164)

      and in effect reflect the dilemma which the Police

      presented           to    icth      hearings.                The     difficulty         is

      simply this.                     Police are at football grounds to

      assist        in    maintaining              public          order       and     thereby

      allow         an         entertainment                  which        is        produced

      commercially to take place.
The Police do not run football,                             the Police do not

wish     to     run     football,          the    Police           have       only        a

limited        say     in    how     football          is        conducted.             The

Police        however         recognise           that           without           their

presence there would probably be mayhem at football

matches,       and have           assumed    a    role           over       the    years

which    has     grown       in proportions                 as    it    has       become

increasingly difficult to deal with the hooliganism

problem.        Equally the Police have                          a time honoured

role to assist in managing                       the    movement             of     large

crowds.




With any large crowd there is always the potential

for    danger        should       that    crowd        develop          a    momentum

which     is uncontrolled.                Having       said all this,                   the

situation        the        Police        found        themselves             in,        in

preparing for the POPPLEWELL hearing was that they

recognised           they    had     a    role    which            could          not    be

separated        from       concern        with        safety          at     football

grounds.         Equally          they      believed              and       still        do

believe,       that the people who put on the enterprise,

who stage the performance, who own the stadium, who

supply most of the people whose                             job     it is to            run

the     occasion        from        the     point           of     view       of        its

administration              and    the     services              that       spectators

enjoy,        that    those       people    have        and        should         have    a

continuing responsibility for safety.
9.5    It is within my knowledge,                         for    example,          that       the

        stewarding functions in the away spectators terrace

        at Old        Trafford      are     fulfilled            by    police          officers

        simply because             it is impossible to get stewards to

        work in that area for fear of assault.




9.6    The     compromise          in     the        wording          of     Mr.       Justice

        POPPLEWELL’s R e p o r t ^ w a s                  perhaps          inevitable         and

        reflected        the       ambiguous          situation             in   which        the

        Police have found themselves at football matches.




9.7    From     the    club's       point       of    view       it     should also be

        said that if a crowd, or                     some       section of          a crowd,

        is     so     unruly       that     it       is    dangerous             for     police

        officers to be posted singly in their midst,                                      it is

        difficult        to     see       what       Stewards          can       achieve        in

        managing        a     crowd       of     that       kind.            This        is     so

        particularly          if    the     stewards            are    not of       the       same

        allegiance as the crowd.                     Equally it has to be said

        that    if     the     Police      control         most        of    the means of

        communication and most of the decision making as to

        the    crowd movement,             the       role of          stewards         is bound

        to appear ancillary rather than central.




(a)   Mr.    Justice         POPPLEWELL' s           Interim          (6/7)        and    Final
      (6 /8 ) Reports
For     these    reasons         I    have        personally         always         been

sceptical about the effective role of stewards                                        and

I    have   done      a    great       deal,          I    think,     to       try     to

improve the quality of                  stewarding.                In my       time    as

Secretary        to       the     ACPO           Sub-Committee             I    issued

guidelines to all               Police      Forces on stewards                   and    I

prc-iuced a video film supplied to all clubs and all

Police Forces about stewards.




I zsi left recognising that there is a limitation to

whet stewards         can do.              But    I am also of the view

thet if there is any packing to be done then it is

the function of stewards, by convention,                               to do it.

Here we have to draw a distinction between getting

perple      into parts           of    the       stadium       for    which         they

have tickets and              that     are       designated          for       them    in

particular, and the generality of packing people on

terraces.




In ~y view the            steward’s role                  is primarily to             see

pecple to their seats,                 to advise people as to where

th.57 should go with                 a particular            ticket    and/or          to

manage gates or            fire points             or critical             exits and

so    forth.       However,            I     am       not     aware        of       much

corritment       to     the     packing          of       crowds    on terraces.

There    seems     to     be     a    degree          of    mythology          in     the
         transcripts of the hearing about this issue.                                      If we

         star-     from        the    premise         that       any     piece        of    open

         terracing is safe at the                     limit which has been                   set

         witiin the safety certificate then there is no need

         to rack the terrace.               The distributing of people on

         an rpen terrace would be like trying to distribute

         sanr in a high wind.                    A    pointless          exercise.           The

         notirn of the crowd "finding its own level" applies

         ordinarily        at        most    football            grounds        with        open

         terracing.            The    proposition           of    course        turns       upon

9.11     Lori    Justice        TAYLOR^refers                    to    the     evidence       of

         Mr. LOCK and the business of stewarding on the West

         Terraces.         In        fact   the       report          says     "The    police

         accazted, therefore, that the proper filling of the

         peri and monitoring of them for overcrowding could

         and would not be carried                     out    by        stewards".           This

         may     well     of    course      be       substantially           true      but    it

         raises the presumption                  that    the          police    themselves

         would undertake such a role.                        At risk of repetition

         if it is an all ticket match and the only people                                     in

         the       stadium           are     those           with        tickets            then

         overrrowding           cannot      occur      and       packing        is     not    an

         iss -=.

\
      9.12   My impression here is that the Police perception of

             responsibility            for crowd density was                     no    different

             to    what would have                applied elsewhere.                  They would

             expect to react to overcrowding if it occurred,                                   but

             it     should       not       happen          and    crowd    distribution,        if

             necessary, was a matter for stewards.




      9.13   The problem             was     that      they,       and    indeed,      everybody

             else,    had        failed to recognise that the alterations

             made    to        the   football         ground had wholly               undermined

             the     logical           basis          of     the     safety       certificate.

             Everything          in this         case       goes    back    to    that      issue.

             Once    the West          End terraces had been                     segregated by

             radial fencing so designed that if the crowd was at

             capacity the ability of the crowd to move from one

             pen     to    another         was      seriously        impaired,         then    the

             whole         logic           of     a        safe     capacity          had     been

             undermined.




      9.14   From the point of view of those planning the                                     game

             and    of     those       who      might give          consideration to           the

             issue        of    packing,         this       was    not     an    issue.       They

             worked       from the          same      premise       that any other match

             commander would work                     from,       namely that         the   safety

             certificate provided a safe level of spectators and
#                                            -1 2 4 -




           that in ordinary circumstances the spectators would

           distribute           themselves         by     virtue          of     the       pressure

           that    the crowd itself created.                             Hence       the    failure

           to plan for monitoring and packing of the crowd is

           not an     issue that I would                      regard      as     in any sense

           negligent.           They had          little      experience             of capacity

           crowds,        they       had    not     learnt         the    lesson        that    the

           ground     had       become       unsafe        under         its     certification

           because         of        the     radial           fences.           They        planned

           therefore        on       the    same        basis    as      any     other       Police

           Force would have done.




    9.15   I have no experience of match commanders organising

           themselves           to    pack        crowds      on      open       terracing       as

           such.      My     only      knowledge           of      such    arrangements          is

           when      the     terracing             is      divided         into         specially

           constructed corailed areas,                          and   the match strategy

           is   to    fill       one       area    at     a     time;     then       packing     is

           monitored        before          the    next         section        is    opened.      I

           would add however that in my                          experience            commanders

           used      to    handling          capacity           crowds         are     much    rore

           alive      to     the       possibility               of      overcrowding           and

           generally have a much keener eye for its symptorr.s.

    9.16     In order to recognise overcrowding,                         as I have said,

             experience       is     critical.            Since          overcrowding           is

             hardly liiely to be             an        issue   when        the       ground     is

             below     its     capacity,          I     have    tried           to     identify

             occasions vhen          the   principal           officers,         by     this     I

             mean       Chief        Superintendent                  DUCKENFIELD               and

             Superinterients          MARSHALL          and     GREENWOOD,             policed

             capacity crowds.




    9.17     The     fact     that    it     is        inappropriate             for    me      to

             question tie officers on this matter has made                                   this

             difficult i-t from the records available to me, the

             collective       sum     is    probably           no        more        than      two

             matches.        It is unlikely that Chief Superintendent

             DUCKENFIELI had ever policed a capacity crowd.




             I refer t; a set of photographs                         taken       in    January

             1990    at     Liverpool      Football           Club       (Appendix           'B').

             The area c: the ground pictured                        is    serviced by 31

             turnstiles vhich are arranged in three banks.                                    The

             photographs       are    taken       at    time     intervals             as    each

             extra    1,001     spectators        are recorded in the ground.

             It will be noticed that on photograph A                                  when     the

             stadium is largely empty there                     is already quite a

             pack seen t-hind the goal.                  That photograph is

       taken     an    hour        and        a    half   before         kick     off.       At

       photograph B when 2,000 people                          are       in the terrace

       there are now people standing on the crowd barriers

       and     quite    a       knot     cf       spectators      behind         the    goal,

       whilst the flanks are noticeably empty.                                   Photograph

       C,    taken an hour before kick off with 3,000 people

       in the    Kop terraces,                shows a tightly packed crowd

       behind    the     goal       vi zh         both flanks well              spaced       and

       indeed     is    a       picture           reminiscent        of    Hillsborough

       before the disaster.




9.19   Photograph        D       taken            at   2.10   p.m. shows              thesame

       situation         in        very           exaggerated            form,         as     do

       photographs          E    and ? by which               time,       still       half    an

       hour before kick off, the crowd are tightly packed

       behind     the       goal       but        still   well    spaced         to    either

       side.     The following sequence shows the Kop terrace

       gradually         filling          *nd          photograph         L,     taken        10

       minutes        before       kick           off,    shows      a    very        tightly

       packed     crowd behind the goal.                         Photograph P shows

       this section of the crowd at capacity,                              some 16,000,

       with many        spectators stood on top of crowd control

       barriers and apparently a solid wall of                                   spectators

       throughout most of the terracing.

9.20   It     should         be     remembered                 that        the         capacity

       limitation on this part of the ground at 16,000 was

       only     recently          established                 and     at    the        time     of

       Hillsborough          was        in        fact       21,000.       On    this       basis

       anyone looking at                this        terracing and seeing                    it to

       be    very     full    would          have still              expected a further

       5.000        spectators               to      fit        in      somewhere!              An

       examination           of         these            photographs             shows         how

       difficult it would be                       for       officers      to    have       drawn

       conclusions       which           hindsight             now     dictates         at     the

       Hillsborough ground.




9.21   Another point to be made by                            reference         to the        time

       sequence       index        is     that          at    2.47     p.m.      there        were

       11.000       spectators          in        the     ground.          At    this       stage

       there are still 5,000 people to be admitted to this

       terrace.        (Significantly                    at    Hillsborough            at     2.47

       p.m.,     at    exactly           the        same       time.       Superintendent

       MARSHALL called for the gates to be opened as about

       the     same    number       of        people          were     pressing         on     the

       turnstiles       outside          the        ground).           From      the    set     of

       photographs we know that at 2.56 p.m. 15,000 people

       were    on     this    terracing              and      that     a   further          1,000

       entered before half time.

9.22     I will     now consider the failure                     of     the    Police    to

         notice     that    there      was        a problem.           With hindsight

         everyone     is         aware       that        the      wing        pens     were

         substantially underfilled.                  As a matter of logic it

         could have been deduced that if a large part of the

         crowd was in at kick off then the central pens must

         be   overcrowded.           That kind        of       mathematics          however

         is   academic.          I    cannot       imagine        in    reality       match

         commanders making those sort of calculations.                                 I am

         never    aware of match commanders                     seeing it           as part

         of their     responsibilities              to     make       calculations       as

         to the density of the crowd.                      Once again this flows

         from the presumption that the tolerances within the

         stadium     are     safe        because         the      ground       has     been

         certified.




9.23     The key evidence here is that,                        from Superintendent
                     (a)
         GREENWOOD          down       on    the    Police        side,       and    indeed

         from the evidence of many                   of     the       spectators,       the

         situation, even in the packed central pens, was, if

         crowded,    at least buoyant and acceptable until                              the

         situation          became           absolutely                critical         and

         immediately        fatal.          Even     when         the     crushing       of

         spectators        had       occurred       there       were     still       people

         several files back from the incident, only yards

away,    who     were       watching       the match and unaware               of

the serious problem that was occurring.



The question which has to be asked                            is    to why    the

police        officers       did       not notice     the      overcrowding?

If they were not geared to monitor that problem                                 it

seems    to me that they vruld not recognise it.                              Had

they been used              to    capacity crowds        they might have

recognised,           with        the    view     obtainable          from     the

control box,          that the density in pens                     3 and 4 had

become       so great        that       s:~ething needed           to be done.

Without        that    experience          they   may    well        only     have

seen     a    full     and       boisterous section of               the   crowd,

not     too    different          in     appearance     to     the    crowd     in

other    parts        of    the    stadium      (and not too different

from     the     crowd           shown    on    the     Kop        Terraces     in

Appendix 'B ').




Once people start to sh:-t and wave and gesticulate

as, for example when the teams come out,                             it is very

difficult to observe whether part of the stadium is

overcrowded or not.



In discussing              this    matter I am not            addressing       the

question        as    to     whether       or   not   officers        who     were

allegedly told that there was overcrowding,                                reacted

            quickly     enough.         I    am      seeking        to        address       the

            question as to whether or not                     those people on the

            perimeter          track,          or          Chief            Superintendent

            DUCKENFIELD,       Superintendent              GREENWOOD          or    those   in

            the control box,           or anyone else having a view                         of

            this   part   of    the     terrace,        were       in       a position to

            draw    the     conclusion              that      it        was         seriously

            overcrowded, and why did they not do so?



     ;.27   I fall back again on the proposition that judgement

            is   a function of knowledge.                    It    is       clear    that   no

            one did spot the problem.                   Large numbers of people

            had a view of        this       part of the           stadium,          including

            officials     of the       FA and of the              club,       and none      of

            them recognised        that there was                 a problem.           Indeed

            at 2.46 p.m. John M0XS0N, the BBC match commentator

            directed the camera to the West Terraces and said:




                   "Funnily       enough          you      know         I     think     whats

                   happened       is    that        some    ticket          holders     don't

                   come cause there's gaps you know in parts                                of

                   the ground.           Well,      you look at the Liverpool

                   end, to the right of the goal                            there's hardly

                   anybody on          those    steps,       no,    to       the    right of

                   there, that's it, look down there                           ..... which

                   means really that I'm not going to talk about

                   the capacity cause it might fall below it."

              As he said this the camera went close-up on pen 3,

               it then moved back, panned across pens                                    3 and 4 to

               pen   6/7.       An       experienced                commentator         such       as Mr.

               MOTSON     will,           undoubtedly,                have      had     considerable

               experience of capacity crowds and yet, less than 60

               seconds before Chief                     Superintendent DUCKENFIELD                     is

               called upon to                 'open the gates',                 with the benefit

               of    an     excellent               vantage          point       and        even     when

               specifically              referring             to        the    matter       of     crowd

               density, he does not make comment that pens 3/4 are

                        * * <a >
               over-crowded.




     9.29     Indeed      by        reference           to      the       TV    and     video       film,

               looking      across            the    ground         everyone          was    seemingly

               nonplussed           as    to    what         was      occurring        until bodies

               started         to        be     carried             onto        the. field.            My

               impression is that it is an easy judgement to make

              with     hindsight,              it       is     a      judgement        which        might

              possibly have been made by people used to handling

               capacity crowds                but      it      is    understandable            that    it

              was not made by those on this day on this occasion.

10      THE VIEW FROM THE CONTBOL BOOM



10.1    The next issue which I have considered concerns the

        recognition by those                   in the Police Control                    Box of

        the developing crisis and their response to it.




10.2    I     have     already       made         the         point     that        neither

        Superintendent             MURRAY        nor      Chief Superintendent

        DUCKENFIELD         nor     indeed       anyone        else in the Control

        box,     drew        any     conclusions               from         the    relative

        sparsity       of    the     crowd       in     the    wing     pens       compared

        with     the density in the central                      pens.       In     fact       it

        seems    that attention from the Control Box prior to

        Mr MARSHALL'S          summons was             largely        focussed on             the

        Spion        Kop    where    Liverpool           supporters          were        being

         isolated.            The     Control          did     have     some        view       of

        the      Leppings           Lane        approaches            via         the        CCTV

         installation but            as    there was           a Superintendent                on

         the     spot,        and         as     the      view         is         distorted,

        understandably they                waited       for     his    report           on    the

         situation there.




10.3    We have        seen how Superintendent MARSHALL sought to

         cope with his problems                  and that        at 2.40           p.m.       the

        mounted Inspector, Mr. HAND-DAVIS called for

       reserves.     From that point on. Chief Superintendent

       2UCKENFIELD      and    Superintendent               MURRAY     must     have

       :een aware of the problem at Leppings Lane and the

       c’jestion arises as           to whether         they did       everything

       reasonable to respond to it.



10.4   The problem was one of late arrival and there were

       rrobably    only       two      options         available        to    them:

       firstly,    to     postpone         kick       off     and    convey     this

       information      to     the      waiting        crowd.        Secondly     to

       summon whatever resources were                   available to assist

       Superintendent MARSHALL and Inspector RAND-DAVIS.




10.5   In the planning of the event.                   Chief Superintendent

       I'JCKENFIELD and Superintendent MURRAY discussed the

       circumstances      in which             it would be appropriate            to

       delay   the      kick     off.           .In   their      evidence       they

       inferred    that      where       supporters           were    delayed     by

       unforeseeable events,            such as a serious accident on

       the motorway,      a delay might be appropriate but                       not

       instances where supporters chose to arrive late.




10.6   In the day of the match at                     about    2.30 p.m.      Chief

       Superintendent         DUCKENFIELD             asked         Superintendent

       ■CRRAY to look at the numbers still awaiting entry
                                        -1 3 4 -




         at    the    Leppings Lane          turnstiles.              Based       upon his

         experiences        Superintendent              MURRAY        considered           that

         they would all gain entry by 3 p.m.^a ^




10.7     Although       it was not an issue at that stage.                               Chief

         Superintendent           DUCKENFIELD              asked        Superintendent

         MURRAY      to    remind       him        of   the     criteria          they     had

         chosen,     upon       which    a    decision          to    delay       kick     off

         depended.        This he evidently did.




10.8    The        issue     was not         raised        again,       though           Chief

         Superintendent DUCKENFIELD                     states       that    at    a     later

         stage     he     was     again        considering            this        question.

         Whilst doing so the             teams came onto                the pitch          and

         he    decided      that the         option       was    thus       removed.
                                                                                    (c )
         The teams emerged onto the pitch at 2.54 p.m.




10.9    Two      observations may            be     made      about     his       decision.

         In the      first place        postponing the kick off is not

         necessarily a solution.                   It is a very             considerable

         decision because there is a responsibility to those

         who   arrived at         a proper          time      and     are     waiting;       a

         responsibility           to    the        games      officials            and     the

         players; a responsibility to the general public and

         the television and radio people who have a schedule

          to     meet;      and     finally,             to      all     the      transport

          arrangements organised for after the game.                                  It is a

          decision       not      taken         lightly,         and     if     the    reason

          people are late is because they have chosen to seek

          refreshment       in public houses                  then the penalty for

          their    lateness might properly be                          that they       should

          miss    part    of      the       game       rather     than        inconvenience

          everyone else.




10.10     It seems to me glib to say that if ever there is a

          queue at the turnstiles at kick off time there is a

          danger of overcrowding and the kick off should be

          delayed.        Such          a      proposition             would     make     the

          management of crowds impossible.




10.11     Secondly,       the      issue          is    perhaps         academic.         The

          evidence of Inspector ELLIS is that from about 2.50

          p.m. he made a series of announcements to the crowd

          in     Leppings       Lane        using       powerful         public       address

          equipment.        In particular,               he   claimed that efforts

          were being made to delay the kick off (even though

          they were not) in             a desperate              attempt       to stop the
                                                                          (a)
          pushing.       It had no impact whatsoever.

                                       -1 3 6 -




10.12     Not all crowds who            are       late   at the turnstiles                are

          uncontrollable.         The usual case is that they may be

          bad-terpered but            they    know the dangers              of    pushing

          and    t£.=y accept police              direction.         I therefore           do

          not quarrel with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD's

          decision not to postpone the kick off.




10.13     The second option was to monitor the situation and

          get    vrat      resources          were       available          to     assist

          Superintendent MARSHALL.                  What     transpired was              that

          requests      for    additional          Police       resources         came     at

          2.40   pn     from   Inspector          HAND-DAVIS        and at        2.44    pm

          from     Superintendent               MARSHALL          (due       to      radio

          difficulties         this    call        was    routed      via     Hammerton

          Road     ?olice        S t a t i o n ) . I n               response,            the

          Control Room sent the following to Leppings Lane:

                      Inspector        DELANEY       with     a    Sergeant       and    ten

                      Constables,           the     reserve        serial        from    the

                      gymnasium.         (It      is questionable whether this

                      serial got past Gate A.)




             It is difficult to              see    what    other       resources       were

             available.




     10.14   Within     the     limits      of    the   system      they did seek to

             put all       available        resources       to    Leppings       Lane.     It

             has   to      be emphasized          that we     are    talking about a

             very limited time period.                  The point at which they

             became      aware    of   the        developing      crisis    is 2.40 pm

             and     the    point      at    which      Superintendent            MARSHALL

             first      calls    for   an      opening      of    the    gates is 2.47

             pm.     Given that any movement of resources around a

             crowded       stadium       needs      a   certain         amount    of     time

             there was        really little          room   for manoeuvre and it

             is difficult to see how either Chief Superintendent

             DUCKENFIELD         or    Superintendent             MURRAY    could       have

             materially         affected      the    worsening       scenario at the

             Leppings Lane turnstiles.




     10.15   The   real     question        is,     whether       they were       thinking

             ahead and what would be the consequence of opening

               the gates?        The sequence of events                seems to be as

               follows:        Superintendent         MARSHALL        made    his    first

               request for the gates to be opened at 2.47 pm.                            He

               was      referring     to     gates   A,    B    and     C.    This      was

               understood       in     the    control       room.       Superintendent

               MARSHALL made at least two                 further     requests before

               Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD,                   pressed by MURRAY

               to make a decision, agreed to open them.



                                                                                        (a)
     10.16     In    his      statement.       Sergeant        GODDARD        states,

               "Further       call   from     Superintendent          MARSHALL      asking

               for gates to be opened (means Gate C)".




     10.17     Superintendent          MARSHALL      is   quite     clear,     he    meant

               gates     A,   B and C,        Superintendent MURRAY likewise,

               interpreted the request               as   referring       to all     three

               gates.




     10.18     Chief      Superintendent        DUCKENFIELD •s          attention       was

               focused on Gate C, it was the gate he could see on

               the   monitor,        it was     the gate       through which entry

               was temporarily forced at 2.48 p.m.                        When he gave

               the order to open the gates he used the words,                           "If

               there's likely to be             serious      injury      or death     I've

               no option but to open the gates - open the gates."

                   Chief       Superintendent        DUCKENFIELD                 then        used       the

                   exact       transmission         is        unclear.               On     the        best
                                                                                                 (b)

                   there is an immediate entry of many hundreds.                                       Gate

                   B    opened minutes        later       at around             2.54 p.m.;             from

                   the evidence of the steward on the gate, Mr.                                       Brian

                   RIDGE,       and     Constables            ATKINS           and        BROWN,        the

                   steward's      prevarication           caused           a    significant             and
                                                                (c)
                   perhaps       disastrous         delay.                     The        people        who

                   entered Gate B, estimated at around 70,                                 headed       for

                   the   siie    area     in pens         6    and       7.          Gate    A    opened

                   minutes later by which time the pressure had eased

                   and th= die was cast.




         10.20     In    ar-    event,       at    2.52       pm     Chief           Superintendent

                   DUCKES7IELD took the fateful decision to allow                                       the

                   gates    to be       opened.      His       decision              seems       to    have

                   been inevitable.          Given that his alternative was to

                   contemplate        fatalities,         I     do     not       see       that       Chief

                   Superintendent         DUCKENFIELD              had         much       alternative

10.21     The    most      powerful       criticism         raised        against       Chief

          Superintendent               DUCKENFIELD            and         Superintendent

          MURRAY      is    that       they    should       have      anticipated         the

           flow of the incoming crowd and the likelihood that

          they      would        enter        the      tunnel        to    the       central

          pens.^a ^         It     was     strongly          argued        against       them

          that they should have                 taken steps           to prevent         this

          by    securing the tunnel                 entrance      and diverting the

          incoming crowd to the waiting pens.                              It is a fair

          observation         that once         the       turnstile mechanism has

          been subverted a potential                      for overcrowding             inside

          the     ground        exists.        The       safety       valve      has     been

           removed.        The question raised was,                   recognising that

          the decision to open                 the gates         was a crucial one,

           and that the crowd would enter with                            some momentum,

          why      was     it      that       neither        Chief        Superintendent

          DUCKENFIELD            nor     Superintendent              MURRAY      made     the

           connections which with hindsight                          the enquiry made.

          Why did they not               recognise         the   potential        for     the

           sequence of events which seems to have occurred?




10.2 2 I would like to                 take    issue at this point with the

           connectedness of events                  as    they    seem     to have       been

           presented.         The      critical          implication was          that    the

           surge into the ground continued as a surge through

          the     tunnel      and       impacted       the     crowd       on     the        West

          Terracing.                I    believe        some       caution            must     be

          attributed to this                 interpretation.              The    crowd        did

          enter the ground in a surge but the tape shows they

          moved into an area,                  referred      to     as    the     concourse

          area,       which    was       reasonably          spacious         and      allowed

          expansion         sufficient           for         the impetus              of      the

          incoming      crowd to be             absorbed and             slowed.           Whilst

          most people undoubtedly did seek to use                                the tunnel

          entrance,         perhaps because            of the very poor signing

          which       did     not        illustrate          any alternative,                 the

          presumption that they approached the tunnel with a

          fatal       momentum,          giving       individual          spectators           no

          other choice, is not borne out by the evidence.




10.23     There     seems      to       be    strong    evidence,          however,          that

          once they did reach the tunnel their efforts to get

          to the terracing were sustained so as eventually to

          create       dreadful          pressures.          The gradient             in     the

          tunnel       no     doubt          compounded      the     situation.               The

          signing arrangements and the design                            of     the    stadium

          are     in my       view       now recognisable as              serious          flaws

          although it can also be argued that                             the    turbulence

          of    the    crowd        itself      was    of    some    significance              in

          exposing these design faults.

10.24   The evidence overall                   allows    the    construction              that

        it     was      not        inevitable,          even        given         the     poor

        construction          of    the    ground,       that        once        the     gates

        were opener then the incoming crowd would flow into

        the     tunnel    with           disastrous       results.               There     was

        space     for    the        pressure       to     be        released        in     the

        concourse area             and    that    happened          to     some     extent.

        In the evert exactly the same sort of tumult built

        up in the tunnel as had built up                        at        the gates        but

        that it vis either inevitable or foreseeable is at

        the least oebateable.




10.25   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had only a limited

        knowledge        of    the        football       ground,            he     had     not

        previously policed the ground and had only visited

        it in the planning.                    It is unlikely that he would

        have been Eile             to    envisage       the     rear        of    the     West

        Stand    and     concourse             area,    and     his        knowledge        of

        policing      football           was    such    that        he    may     not     have

        seen     overcrowding             as     the     most            likely     serious

        consequence of the incursion.




10.26   Superintenient MURRAY was                  familiar          with the ground

        and     was       in        a      position            to         advise         Chief

        Superintendent             DUCKENFIELD.          Ke         did     not     do     so.

        and it could only be concluded that he did not do

        so for two reasons:             even at this stage overcrowding

        on the terraces had simply not been recognised;                               and

        because he could not or had not developed a mental

        picture     of    the    route       between       the    turnstiles          and

        access to the terraces so as to have recognised the

        danger.     In this regard it has to be said that the

        Hillsborough ground             is    a considerable edifice with

        many gangways,          gates,       tunnels,      entrances,         conduits

        and    so   forth      and    that     police      officers          visit    the

        ground only on occasion.                The ability of an officer

        to     recall     in    geographic           detail       any       particular

        aspect of the ground (when before he might have had

        no particular reason to do so) should not be taken

        for granted.




10.27   Regardless,       in my view           it    has   to     be    acknowledged

        that    there    was     some    error of          judgement         in taking

        the     decision         to          open      the        gates        without

        precautions.            Chief        Superintendent             DUCKENFIELD,

        given his limited knowledge,                  should have asked more

        pertinent        questions,          and     Superintendent            MURRAY,

        particularly        given       his     good       view        of    the     West

        Terracing,       should       really        have   asked       the    question

        "Where will this incoming surge be accommodated?"
                                           -144-




10.28     No particular effort was made to alert the officers

           already in the            concourse,           although it can also                     be

           said    that       they    were      there         to     deal       with    whatever

           proble-T.s arose.           The      difficulties                  must    have     been

           self-evident to            them and those in command may have

           thoucit a broadcast                 in general            terms          would     be    of

           little significance particularly as they would have

           heard    the order          to      open       the      gates        on    their        own

           frectency.




10.29      Their joint failure                 in this          regard,         whilst       it has

           to      be     acknowledged,                   can        be         substantially

           miticeted.          Neither         of       the     officers             foresaw       the

           possibilities             largely            because          neither         of        the

           officers      had    much        experience of policing capacity

           crovcs       but    most       of     all         because          they     took        for

           granted      the    false        premise          upon     which          this    entire

           tracefy pivoted            -     that        the     West          Terraces       as     an

           entity       were    certified            as       safe       to    accommodate           a

           ranc:n crowd of some 10,100 ticket holders.                                        Chief

           Superintendent            DUCKENFIELD               refers          to     perceiving

10.30      Equally, the human factor has to be weighed.                                       These

           two     officers          were       in       a      relatively            unfamiliar

           sit-ition      and       were       faced with            a    real       crisis        and

           conscious          too     that          a     great          many         eyes        were

           monitcring the conduct of this event.

    10.31   Taking       a    decision        in        a     crisis        is    never       easy

            particularly            when     the     consequences                of    decisions

            have    to       be    thought    through.              It    is difficult             to

            apply        a        criterion        of         reasonableness             against

            decision-making           in     a crisis             situation.           People      do

            their    best         or what     they think             is their best,               and

            sometimes they are wrong.




    10.32   Even if the            "right     connections"               had been made            by

            the     officers          they     would           not       necessarily         have

            foreseen the tragic outcome.                          At one level it could

            be    suggested         that     the    location          of    the fatalities

            indicates         the    collapse        of       a     crush    barrier         as     a

            significant cause              of death.              At another it was not

            necessarily the case that the vast rajority of                                        the

            incoming         crowd    would        make       for    a    relatively small

            tunnel       entrance,         already           overcrowded,             when   there

            were    quicker         and    easier           routes    to the terraces               -

            routes which would almost certainly have been known

            to many in the crowd as they had attended the same

            section of the ground at                        the corresponding fixture

            the previous year.




    10.33   It     would      not    necessarily              appear       inevitable         that

            having made towards the overcrowded tunnel a large
1

,               section     of     the       crowd       would continue to          force        its

                way into the tunnel even though conditions in there

                had become intolerable and obviously dangerous.




        10.34   In conclusion, having examined such evidence as has

                been    available              to me        and set     against           my     own

                knowledge        of policing             football     and what I believe

                to be prevailing standards at the time, I am of the

                view    that       the        South        Yorkshire       Police     prepared

                advisedly         for       this     match     given       the    short         time

                available         to    them       and     took    every    step     that        was

                reasonable in the circumstances.




        10.35   Planning      provides         a base        to     operate       from,        which

                does    not      and        cannot       envisage     every      contingency.

                Plans      for     policing           were     organised          within         the

                constraints            of     the geographical          position          of     the

                Hillsborough           ground        and    its physical         limitations.

                Arrangements           at     the Leppings Lane         turnstiles would

                have       been         sufficient           had      the        crowd         been

                reasonable.            They were not: and that was the first

                decisive element in this tragedy.




        10.36   The South Yorkshire                Police made        their      arrangements

                on   the    basis       that       the     crowd capacity limits were
                                             -147-



        safe     and        that        the      ground         was         safe.         Their

        participation             in the work of               the    Safety Committee

        as     far     as        these        aspects      were           concerned        were

        marginal.           All        the     evidence        is    that     professional

        engineers           and        professionals            within         the        local

        authority       advised          on     and determined              these matters

        throughout.              The     police      role           was     restricted       to

        explaining          the        implications            for        handling       public

        disorder.       This much was normal.




10.37   With hindsight it is now clear that the engineering

        failures,           in     particular           the inadequacy               of     the

        configuration             of     the     turnstiles           and     the    lack    of

        separation          between          incoming      sections          of the crowd

        constituted          the         second      decisive element               in      the

        tragedy.



10.38   So much of the debate has concerned police decision

        making that this rather obvious point seems to have

        been missed.              If     the alterations made                  in    1981 and

        1985 had       been        constructed            in    accordance           with the

        Green Guide          and in line with police and engineers'

        recommendations                then,    it   is    highly          probable       there
                                             -148-




          would      have         been    no    tragedy      -    indeed       it     is    most

          unlikely           that the build-up               in pens      3 and 4 would

          have occurred in the first place.




10.39     Whilst there his to be some criticism of the police

          command        in        falling       to   secure       the     tunnel         before

          allowing the cites to be opened,                          I do       not believe

          that     their failure in this regard was a blunder of

          the magnitude that has                      been    described.^Placed

          in context the disaster was not inevitable from the

          opening of the gates.




10.40     The      whole          b='*3iviour      of    the       crowd        itself        was

           throughout         ths dynamic aspect and it is simply too

          easy to rely -ton the evidence of                             those      individual

          witnesses          who     tlaim that amongst such a crowd they

          were     simply cirried along regardless                            of    their     own

          wishes.            On    tiis      interpretation every               crowd would

          become       a mindless              throng   lurching         with       dangerous

           and    unpredictiile                violence.         This    is    plainly        not

           the case.




10.41      In the perception of great events,                           those who figure

          most     prominently as the decision                          takers      are often

        seen to have had a much greater effect on the tide

        of events    than they     in     fact were      capable of.        In

        the   few minutes   which        elapsed    between      unbearable

        pressure    at   the turnstiles            and    the    fatal    and

        crushing pressure on the           terraces      events    unfolded

        catastrophically and generally outside                  the control

        of the police.




10.42   The only decision involved was the one to open the

        gates   which    was probably         inevitable,         tfcs   only

        indecision was the    failure        to    anticipate     sor.ething

        which   over     many years        neither       the     Clui,    the

        Football    Association,    the     engineers      orany    other

        members of the Safety Committee had ever raised as

        a possibility.

11     SUMMARY OF SECTIOKS




       PERSPECTIVE OF THE GROUND COMMANDER




11.1   The   typical     match    commander          has      many      and various

       command responsibilities other than football.




11.2   He will    rely on the experience of command                            and    on

       the    experience          of        advisors.          He       will         not,

       generally,        be   specifically             trained       in       policing

       football     as    such,       and     will     have      only     a    partial

       knowledge of safety issues.



11.3   He will regard the prevention                   of hooliganism inside

       and       outside         the          ground        as       his         major

       responsibility.           He    will     rely       principally          on     an

       existing     regime       which        will     have      been     tried       and

       tested.




11.4   He will    rely on the           Safety       Certificate          as    having
*

       determined the ground and its structure as safe for

       containing the crowd within its capacities.




11.5   Commanders will        usually,         but not always,             accept       a

       general responsibility to 'manage' the crowd.
CROWD BEHAVIOTTR



Impact Of Hooliganism




The     Police    only     attend        football        matches      in

large     numbers       with    complex            logistical    plans

because    of     the    history        of    and     potential      for

disorder.




Police responsibility for crowd management and

safety     ensues        from    their        prominent       role    in

policing         disorder.         Criticism            of      police

"pre-occupation"           with     hooliganism              fails    to

take account of why the police are there.




Fundamental         to     the      police            strategy        for

controlling        disorder        is        the     separation       of

opposing     supporters           and        the     containment       of

rival     factions       within     the        ground.        (By     and

large     football       crowds    know        the     grounds       they

11.9    The conduct of the crowd at Leppings Lane was

        exceptional,          unaccountable           and     unpredictable.

        Culpable late arrival of the crowd was coupled

        with     an    irresponsible            intent       to    breach          the

        turnstiles.




11.10   The      crush       at      the      turnstilewas           neither

        inevitable           nor       merely         the          outcome          of

        misbehaviour by a small rinority.




11.11   The     intense andsustained               pressure         of             the

        crowd         was         sufficient          to       overwhelm             a

        considerable police effort to restore order.




11.12   It is      a general proposition that whatever                             the

        queueing        strategy         adopted,        order       cannot         be

        achieved without some lev=l of co-operation.




11.13   Massive         crowd       misbehaviour             can      only          be

        controlled by drastic prlice                        action     which        in

        this case would have eniingered the crowd and

        was not a reasonable option.

     11.14   The   Safety Certificate             is crucial      in that      it

             sets crowd limits for particular parts                     of    the

             ground and allows          the inference that if those

             numbers    are not exceeded            crushing      should      not

             occur.




     11.15   The   police     role    in the certification process

             is advisory and generally has been                    restricted

             to making observations about the configuration

             and construction of grounds only in so                     far    as

             those arrangements         affect      their       strategies     of

             containment.        The police        role    in    the    Officer

             Working      Party      regarding           the     Hillsborough

             Safety     Certificate          was    no     different         from

             police     involvement          in    other       parts    of    the

             country.




     11.16   Calculations about capacities and the strength

             and    safety     of    structures          were     not    issues

             attended to by the police.




     11.17   Capacities are fixed for discrete parts of the

             ground and "crowd distribution" relates to
                                    -154-



        their    containment       within      these    areas.      There

        have never been police plans or operations                      to

        achieve even distribution within such discrete

        areas    which,    anyway,      would      be   impossible      to

        implement.        There has      always been an inherent

        assumption    that       the     crowd     would    "naturally

        distribute"       itself within a given area if the

        capacity was not exceeded.




11.18   Safety    committees         have      worked      within      the

        constraint    that       football        grounds    are     often

        badly    located     and    poorly       configured.        Their

        plans    based     on      experience       have    sought      to

        compensate         for         the       inadequacies          and

        inefficiences of grounds.




11.19   "Away    crowds"    often      have    a   knowledge      of   the

        ground, "home supporters" always do.                  There is

        a good deal of          co-operation generally between

        police, stewards and the crowd.




11.20   Semi-finals are unique because both crowds are

        "away crowds"       although         in this case many must

        have known the ground and its limitations.
                                            -155-



11.21   Police       planning          is    based       on       the    presumption

        thi"     the       crowd will            be     fairly      knowledgeable

        a=; reasonably co-operative.




11.22   Ax     all     ticket         fixture          allows       the       inference

        ti.it there should be                    no overcrowding,               only     a

        capacity            crowd.           Provided             there         is      no

        widespread          forgery         of    tickets          and       people     do

        net      get        in        without           tickets.             Turnstile

        pclicing           is    in    part       to        prevent          capacities

        being subverted in these ways.




11.23   The Safety Certificate                        fixes      crowd limits for

        different sections of                    the ground at capacity,

        hetce police plans do not entail strategies to

        prevent        overcrowding              within          ground       sections.

        As part of their general role in managing the

        crrvd        the        police      would           be     observant           and

        Ect-rally would                attend         to overcrowding if it

S X F E T Y C ERT IF IC ATE FOR H I L L S B O R O U G H




11.25     The      police        view    in     April          1981     after     the

           difficulties of the 1981                  semi-final          was     that

           radial fencing to sub-divide the Leppings Lane

           End     terraces        would      help        to       distribute     the

           crowd     and    they     recommended             that such        fencing

           be extended back             to    the    turnstiles.             Concern

           about      the        capacity,       the         need      for     safety

           expansion room and the need                         for any       separate

           sections        to be served by               their own entrances

           were    all     issues       discussed         at    this     time.    The

           Police      having       expressed            a     view,     the     more

           detailed consideration of                     safety properly          lay

           between       South     Yorkshire         County          Council,     the

           Fire Service, the Club and its engineers.




11.26      The failure to amend the Safety Certificate in

           1981    and 1985 was absolutely crucial and this

           was a matter which fell                  to       the responsibility

           primarily        of    the    Club    and         its    engineers     and

           secondly of the Certifying Authority.




11.27      It is clear and unmistakable from the Guide to

           the Safety at Sports Ground that the
                                       -157-




        responsibility           for        ensuring          the        physical

        infrastructure of the ground                     is    safe,       viable

        and meets        the standards          laid dovm,           lies with

        the management who must act on the advice                                of

        qualified engineers.




11.28   The    alterations       in 1981        and 1985           allowed      for

        the possibility that an                 influx        of    spectators

        opting     for     the        tunnel     route        to     the       West

        terraces     could       cause         serious        overcrowding.

        This major flaw was not noticed as such by any

        of the parties involved.




11.29   Turnstiles       act     as     a    drip      feed        and     police

        arrangements             are           based           upon            this

        consideration.           If    a gate       is    opened         and    the

        crowd    surge     in,        the   safety       valve      system       is

        removed.




11.30   Sign     posting       directing        the      crowd       from       the

        turnstiles at Leppings Lane was extremely poor

        and made the option of the central                          tunnel      the

        most likely.

    11.31   The tunnel entrance             is dark     and    has        a    sharp

            gradient    which might          have     had     the    affect of

            careering    the     crowds       towards       pens     3    and        4.

            This    faulty design feature may have had more

            to do with the impetus of                 the incoming crowd

            than the opening of the gates.                    (There is some

            evidence that the crowd entering from Gate                              'C'

            paused and "expanded"             in the concourse before

            proceeding).




    11.32   The    turnstile     configuration          at    Leppings             Lane

            was     inadequate        with    a     single     bank           of     23

            turnstiles    feeding       almost        half    the    capacity.

            However,    there was no evidence and nothing so

            obvious which would allow the Police                          to       take

            the view that the approach to these turnstiles

            was    sufficiently dangerous             that     extraordinary

            plans    needed      to    be     laid.      Police          planning

            recognised    it would           always    be     difficult             but

            manageable.




    11.33   Police      generally           only      become        aware            of

            dangerous    design inadequacies             as    a     result          of

            experience.        In     this    case,     they        had       little

            experience cf this ground at capacity - there

            had     been    c -ly     three        such    matches     in     the

            previous nine years.



            PLANNING




    11.34   All    the     evidence    was       that the     1988 plan had

            worked; deficiencies raised at the debrief had

            been     addressed,            and     it     would    have     been

            illogical not to have used it again.




    11.35   The    rules cf the competition entailed that                       a

            mere    17 woriing days              (less,    given that       there

            needed       to bs      time    to     print    the    orders     and

            brief     people)       were     available       for     planning,

            which represented a major constraint.




    11.36   In my    judge::-ent the plan was               no different       to

            the    sort of plan drawn by other police forces

            for other sirilar events.




    11.37   It is    not desirable to include                 in a    plan    of

            this sort cor-prehensive instructions as to the

            role of each officer deployed or                      action plans

            in the event of possible contingencies such as

            late arrival :f fans.
                                          -160-




11.38   The plan takes for granted that briefings will

        deal with many issues which were not stated,                                  I

        would judge this to be normal.




11.39   Whilst communications were overloaded and less

        than        perfect,        technical          constraints             meant

        there       were      few     options.             I    believe        there

        should have been a             'Command channel'                for Chief

        Inspectors          and     aJbove and         I would          fault    the

        plan for not providing one,                     (or an alternative

        system)       but    I recognise           lack of        space       in the

        control box was a major limitation.




11.40   In general          terms    the       only    other          criticism       I

        would       make     of     the       plan    is       that    there     was

        probably       an     insufficient            number      of     officers

        held    in     reserve.           I   should add that             this    is

        not untypical.

            have    applied       in     similar games               elsewhere.           It

            was         always          recognised              that             separate

            disciplined          queues          could        not     be     maintained

            given       the    geography.           The       presence           of    large

            numbers of people at the turnstiles is not of

            itself a cause for alarm.




    11.42   From 2.40 p.m. until the opening of the gates

            the     situation           became       critical              and        police

            resources           were         overwhelmed.                  Given         the

            circumstances              and        resources               available        I

            believe       the    police          deployed       in    the        only    way

            that was reasonable.                   I discount any notion of

            secondary          plans     to       contain           the     crowd       some

            distance          further        back.        (A        secondary           line

            would have split police resources and may have

            achieved          nothing;       a    secondary plan could not

            be devised quickly;                  late arrival of supporters

            is     of    itself     no       cause       to    either        delay       the

            kick-off or take secondary action.)




    11.43   From this point on, mounted officers were                                    the

            only        effective       police       response              and    in     the

            circumstances           I     believe             they        deployed        as

            sensibly and as well as was possible.

1.44   In the circumstances              the    request          to open       the

       gates     was     proper        and     the        only     reasonable

       course available.




1.45   Up     until     the     time     things           became     critical

       events    at Leppings           Lane     were       not    such as       to

       have    caused     the    commander           to    take     emergency

       acticn.         From     2.40    p.m.        onwards        there       was

       little that could be done that was not done.




       OVERCZTWDING IN PENS 3 and 4




1.46   The     rresumption        that        the     ground       had     been

       properly        engineered        to         safely        accommodate

       given     crowd    densities           allowed       the     inference

       that the crowd would distribute itself on the

       terra: ing        providing             nothing             unforeseen

       occurred.        The     presumption           of    officers       that

       the    crowd would        "find        its    own     level"      was     a

       direct extension of this argument and would be

       consistent with what applied elsewhere.




1.47   The    alterations        in    1981         and    1985     seriously

       underrined the logic upon which the capacities

       had been determined.              Responsibility for these

       design faults did not lie with the Police.
                                      -163-




11.48   The     police       in      the     control           box        did     not

        recognise      overcrowding           in pens 3 and 4 prior

        to the kick-off.             It is       conceivable that they

        might        have     done,         however,            it        must     be

        emphasised          that     it     is        very      difficult          to

        recognise       overcrowding             in     a     crowd       of    fifty

        thousand      where        there    is     so       much        exhuberance

        and excitment.             This is particuarly so without

        experience of watching capacity crowds.                                 It is

        the     case        that      no      one           else,         including

        experienced         commentators              like      John       Motson,

        recognised the problem either.




11.49   As      the     difficulties               in         Leppings           Lane

        intensified,         police        attention          in    the     control

        room was at the same time drawn to troublesome

        events on the Spion Kop and to a generality of

        responsibilities for the entire operation.




        THE VIEW FROM THE CONTROL ROOM




11.50   In the event Chief                Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

        and   Superintendent              MURRAY        had    little          option

        but     to    accede        requests          from         to     Inspector

        KAND-DAVIS and Superintendent MASSHALL in view
                                      -164-




       of their urgency.              Firstly they deployed what

       resources      they       could    from       2.40       p.m.    onwards

       and secondly       they    authorised             the     opening         of

       the gates when it became pressing.




1.51   The   most    critical         question        is    whether           there

       was negligence, once having decided the                                gates

       should        be    opened,        in failing        to     take        some

       steps    to   prevent       pens       3    and     4,    which        were

       already            over-crowded,               being              further

       overcrowded.         There are         a number of key issues:




       11.51.1       The    overcrowding in              pens     3      and     4,

                     although         evident        after        the     event,

                     had not been             noticed       up until           this

                     time.       This was because                they worked

                     on    the    principle          that        overcrowding

                     should not occur                if capacities were

                     not     exceeded         (which        is     the        whole

                     basis       of    the        Safety       Certificate),

                     because       they       were    monitoring              other

                     problems             and            because                the

                     overcrowding was not obvious                        to     the

                     untrained eye.                I do not see fault
                            -165-




          in     their       omission.            The     best        of

          experienced              commanders           may      have

          noticed it but these commanders were

          not used to capacity                   crowds        and    in

          my    view        it    is     excusable       that    they

          had not noticed it.




11.51.2   The     proposition            that    action        needed

          to be taken to secure the tunnel in

          part turns upon the presumption that

          those       in     the       control    box     would       be

          able        to     recollect           the     immediate

          geographical                 layout     between            the

          turnstiles             and     the     terraces.            If

          they     had       been        rehearsed       in     these

          details          they may have          insisted upon

          the opening of gates A. and B alone,

          which would have diverted the crowds

          to    the    North        Stand       and    pens     6 and

          7.     They clearly did not appreciate

          this.        Likewise           it    seems     they       did

          not recognise that if gate C was                            to

          be    opened           first     (which       they    could

          not     have       known)       there       would     be     a

          likely       surge           towards    the     tunnel.

                (In     fact     of    course        there       are     many

                turnstiles,                 several               tunnels,

                stairways,            entrances,             gangways,

                gates,     walls            and     fences        in      the

                entire                conglomeration                      of

                Hillsborough.               Immediately          prior    to

                this emergency              those    in the control

                box would have had no good reason to

                have     had     an    intimate        knowledge          of

                the     layout             behind the            West    End

                Terraces any better than other parts

                of the ground.)




      11.51.3   There     were        police        officers       within

                the area between the                 turnstiles          and

                the     tunnel         and        it may         have been

                proper         for          some       warning            or

                instruction            to    have been passed            to

                them     to . take           what      action           they

                thought        necessary.            This         did    not

                happen    and       maybe     should        have       done,

                however it can be                 argued    that their

                purpose        in           being there           was     to

                respond             sensibly                in           any

                             -1 6 7 -




              circumstances             and    they       should        have

              heard        the    order       to     open     the       gate

              over the radio.




    11.51.4   It has to be         acknowledged             that once

              the gates were             opened       a possibility

              existed       that the whole                area     of    the

              West          Terrace                might           become

              overcrowded          as    the       opportunity           now

              existed       for     people         without        tickets

              to     get     in.        To     this        extent        the

              police       dilemma       was       enlarged        and    on

              the face of it no                direct       action was

              taken       concerning          it.     However,           the

              Health and Safety Executive                        analysis

              suggests that the total crowd -within

              West Terraces did not in fact exceed

              the capacity.




    11.51.5   It     is      understandable                 that         the

              over-crowding             in    pens    3     and    4     had

              not been recognised and that neither

              Chief Superintendent                  DUCKENFIELD nor

              Superintendent             MURRAY       were        able    to

              directly recollect the layout behind
                         -168-




          the West Terraces so as to recognise

          the     danger       of     the      incoming          crowd

          making for the             tunnel with all              that

          followed.         Nonetheless,             because        the

          decision        was        a       crucial        one,      a

          greater     level         ofthought        as    to      the

          consequences              should       have        applied

          than     seems       to    have      been       the    case.

          The    very     best       of      commanders          would

          have     addressed          this      question          with

          more      tenacity.                That     said          the

          background        information              available       to

          the     officers          was      that,    in    general

          terms,     there          was      room     within        the

          West Terracing for                 a good many more

          spectators.




11.51.6   My     final     conclusion           would      be      that

          had      the         ground          been        properly

          engineered            the           consequence            of

          opening        the        gates      would        in      all

          probability          not       have been profound.

          There    was     no       uncontrollable              surge,

          the     crowd     took         a   second       breath     on
              -169-




entering the ground.              There was more

or    less    room    for    them    within        the

area    for       which    they    had    tickets.

The    problem      became   acute       and     fatal

because      of    design    flaws       which     had

not previously been exposed - design

failings      which       constituted      evident

breaches of the Green Guide.

FINAL CONCLUSICK




The South Yorkshire Police on the basis of the

evidence available to me planned                            the policing

of this       fixture in accordance with prevailing

standards         in   I?39 -      Events           at    Leppings           Lane

precipitated           a situation          they could not have

foreseen       and     i“ the        event          they    deployed           as

well    as    circurstances           allowed.             The    decision

to open the ga.es became inevitable and was                                     a

consequence of :ulpable crowd misbehaviour and

not of any failure in policing.




The     overcrowding          in     pens       3    and     4    occurred

because      of     fundamental design                   flaws    resulting

from     ground        alterations          in       1981        and        1985.

Responsibility           in   this        area       rested       primarily

with    the Club and its              engineers.              Whilst          the

police       were      reribers      of     the      Officer       Workimg

Party        their       role        was         marginal              as      to

engineering            ratters            and            restricted            to

commenting on h:w physical structures affected

their        strategies         in        containing             disorderly

crowds.

12.3   Because of the              comprehensive nature of police

       strategies to contain hooliganism, police have

       assumed a general responsibility to manage the

       crowd.        This function has to be understood                                in

       the     context            that      the           Safety        Certificate

       provides           reasonable                tolerance           for         crowd

       density within             specified parts                 of the ground.

       This     means            that     if         capacities           are         not

       breached,          overcrowding              should        not    occur        and

       this     is    the    pivot       on         which    all     else       turns.

       There     has        never        been        a      police       policy        of

       distributing              crowds             on      terraces           or      of

       monitoring crowds with the specific                                intention

       of     estimating          density.               Police    attention           to

       overcrowding              therefore           primarily          relates        to

       the control of turnstiles.




12.4   The decision to open the gates was                                inevitable

       and     taken        in     difficult              circumstances.              The

       sequence of events which ensued and which                                      now

       seems         so    inevitable               was     nothing           like     so

       obvious to those in police control.                                They        had

       not           recognised                the           pressures                and

       contradictions             that     the radial             fences       on     the

       West     Terracing           were            creating.           They         were
                                        -172-




       evidently           unable       to        recall        in     detail             the

       configuration behind the West Terraces.                                        It is

       understandable               that        they     did     not       make           the

       connection           which      would       have        caused           them       to

       have secured the tunnel entrance.




12.5   Whilst        the       most        experienced           and        best           of

       commanders may have                  sought       for     more       detailed

       information             before        taking        such        a         crucial

       decision,               on           the          evidence.                    Chief

       Superintendent               DUCKENFIELD          and     Superintendent

       MURRAY        took      the     decision          believing               it       was

       inevitable           but      presumably           in     the       knowledge

       that overall,            there was room for                   the    incoming

       crowd.        Any       fault       on     their        part    has           to    be

       considered against their lack of experience in

       handling             capacity              crowds             which                was

       unavoidable;            the    fact        that    policing          football

       in     all    its       complexity          was     a    small           part       of

       their    overall           responsibilities              and        that       they

       were         in     a      crisis          situation            with           poor

       communications.                In my        judgement          it        is    only

       with     hindsight            that    their       failure           to    secure

       the    tunnel        constitutes            negligence.              Whatever

       the degree          of fault falling to the police,                                 it
                                      -173-




       is my opi-ion the decision                    to open       the gates

       was   catastrophic because              of     serious      flaws    in

       the   design of          the   ground        and not because         of

       police failure to manage the crowd.




12.6   I believe this           rather obvious          truth has       been

       obscured       i-=cause    in     the       dramatic    moments      of

       tragedy ari their aftermath the police profile

       was   inevitably heightened.                   The   immediacy       of

       police     ccr-.and       to    the     incident        itself      has

       focused        intention         on     decisions        compressed

       within a frenetic time                 frame    and whilst       they

       stand     to be examined,              standing      back    in time

       from the incident,             cooler       deliberation allows

       the     interpretation           that       other      factors      and

       principally the structure of the ground itself

       had     set        the   stage        for     eventual       disaster

       whatever iind was at the helm.

Video and Transcript
PART ONE: INSIDE WEMBLEY



This    video clip,          a     police     video,         was     taken     at

Wembley Stadium on the 23rd March 1986, the match -

Chelsea       v    Manchester       City      in    a    Cup       Final.      It

demonstrates problems with overcrowding.




If you look at the early part of the video sequence

you will see a good view of -he crowd on terracing

at the side of the tunnel and also the crowd above

the tunnel.          It is       fairly clear        that      the   crowd on

the terracing to the left of the tunnel are not in

discomfort although fairly tirhtly packed.                             You see

from    their       response       to    events     on       the   field     that

most    people are able to clap,                  throw their hands            in

the     air.        There     is        no   sign       of     distress        or

difficulty.




As the camera pans to the                    rirht it is not           evident

to     the        casual     observer        c:     even      to     the     more

practiced eye that the level :f packing between the

two sections of the crowd is that different and yet

as you will see there is sericus overcrowding.




The    next       sequence       that    shows     an    officer      who     has

recognised         that     overcrowding          and obtains a ladder
                                        -2-



      which    he     puts        against       the        tunnel.            For       some

      considerable       length         of    time        people - are        evacuated

      from the crowd in a                fairly       precarious            fashion       as

      you see.        The point to be made,                      is   the     crowd who

      are     above     the        tunnel        are            clearly       in        some

      discomfort,      such        that       they        are    prepared        to     take

      some    level    of        risk    in    escaping           the    crush.         The

      crowd to the          left of the tunnel do not seem to be

      in any trouble or discomfort.




 .5   The question is whether those two groups                              of     people

      are     noticeably          different          to    an     observer         of    the

      crowd?     Were it not for the escapes                          being      arranged

      by the policeman on the ladder it is reasonable to

      suggest that these two sections of the                              crowd would

      not appear noticeably different.




1.6   It is also interesting that in a later sequence on

      this    video    you       will     see    whilst           some      people       are

      being evacuated down the ladder,                          other people above

      the tunnel are following the game with interest and

      feel    sufficiently unmoved by events immediately at

      hand    that    their       undisturbed             concentration           remains

      on    the match.           They    applaud,          throw up       their hands

      and appear to be enjoying themselves.                              Clearly they

      are net in any discomfort.                      Overall there are some

      similarities          to     events       at        Hillsborough           in     that

      respect.

1.7   Another point          that might be made from this general

      sequence of film is the sheer fatuity of                                      imagining

      that policemen,             or stewards for that matter, placed

      in and on the terracing could engage                                   in    some     kind

      of exercise to distribute the crowd.                                   The notion of

      "packing"          referred               to         frequently               in       the

      Hillsborough             Enquiry               is         not      a          realistic

      proposition.           It    is     difficult             to     see    how        anybody

      could    in     some     way       or other           distribute            evenly     the

      crowd we see here by activity on the terraces.                                        The

      only way that distribution could be achieved would

      be by controls at the point of entry to particular

      parts      of         the      ground               (as     per         the         Safety

      Certificate).           Looking at a crowd of that size,                               and

      an occasion of              this    sort,       the       idea of controlling

      the crowd on the terracing,                         packing them             into     safe

      cohorts       as   the      crowd builds up,                is         clearly not       a

      reasonable possibility.




2.    PAST TWO: STAMFORD BRIDGE




2.1   The next sequence of videois                         also         a police video

      and    it was      taken on the 10th February 1990 at the

      Chelsea v Spurs Derby game at Stamford Bridge.                                          In

      many    respects this is a typical piece of video and

      nothing untoward is recorded.                             The     significance          of

      this    video         however             relates         to     the        issues      of

      queueing        and    crowd        behaviour             when     the        crowd     is
                                         -4-



      somewhat frustrated by being unable to get into the

      ground at a key fixture                    as    and when        the kick off

      approaches.          You will            see    that     the    crowd outside

      the turnstiles is thickly congregated.                               There is no

      organised system of queueing and, as in many cases,

      rhe turnstiles are too close together to allow                                   for

      separate queues when there                      is a capacity,           or near

      rapacity crowd.




2.2   The police are visible amongst the crowd,                              there are

      ^o   signs     of trouble or              disorder       and     you will        see

      that    is    the     case     some       five        minutes        before     kick

      :ff.         At      that     time        there        are     still         several

      thousand       people        outside           the    turnstiles         and     the

      likelihood          that many        of    them       will     not     get    in on

      time.         Nonetheless                crowd         behaviour             remains

      reasonable.




2.3   If   you     look    at     this     piece       of    video    and     imagined

      that the crowd, for whatever reason, began to surge

      igainst       those       turnstiles,           you    will     see     that     the

      situation         would       quickly           become        untenable.          In

      particular          the   crowd      would       be    able     to    climb over

      the turnstile cabins which do not form a formidable

      terrier.       As it is the crowd are reasonably behaved

      =.-d reasonably co-operative.




2.4   isme two minutes before kick off time on the video

      --d there         are still visible on the police monitors
                                     -5-



      thousands      of     people       at    the     turnstiles            waiting       to

      get in.        It is significant that the match commander

      did not on this occasion take tie decision to delay

      the kick off,          and did vhat             is usually done, which

      is to rely on police tactics tc contain the                                    crowd.

      As the camera moves away and pars left you can see

      there    are       still    people        assembling            in     the     narrow

      main    road approach to                this grctr.d and you can see

      some    four       horses    who        are     able       to    forestall          the

      queue of several thousand people who are seeking to

      approach the turnstiles.




2.5   There    are    some       similarities          in       the     geography          of

      this configuration and the arr£"tements at Leppings

      Lane,    Hillsborough.             In     this       ci. 3 2    there        are    iron

      fencings       and     a    gate     and       you      vill     see         that    the

      police       horses    have        no    difficulty             containing           the

      crowd who are seeking to approach the turnstiles.




2.6   Less    than    one    minute        from       kick      tff     time       and    the

      crowd remain well behaved.                      Four torses             as    against

      the     13   that     were     deployed          at       Lappings       Lane        are

      sufficient to hold back a crowd cf several thousand

      people       who     are     still        unable          to     get     into        the

      turnstile area.




2.7   You will see in this sequence th=- police                                    officers

      and     stewards       are     able        to    close          the     gate,        not
        I
    I             different         from    the     gate     at        Hillsborough,         where

                  thirteen horses and all the police officers present
    I             were unable to close it or                 to keep           it closed.       Of


    ]             course      the    reason is,       that       the    crowd    are behaving

                  in a reasonable and co-operative fashion.

    I
            2.8                At kick off time,             still thousands of people at the

    I             turnstiles,        the match has commenced and this crowd

                  will have heard            the    roar     that       will    have    gone    up
    I             inside      the ground when the game has begun and yet,

    ^             despite      the    convergence           of     thousands       of    people

                  around the turnstiles,              there is no surging so as to

    1             cause danger or alarm to any of the police officers

                  who are there or any of the supporters themselves.

I           3.1                This       sequence of police             video    is    taken   at Wembley

                  and records crowds outside the ground at                             Liverpool
*                 and Everton Cup Final 1986.                     There are a number of

%                 significant        features        to    this        film    which    can     be

                  pointed out.            The first observation to make is that

*                 with    a   very    large        crowd    on    an     occasion       cf    this

                  kind,    the ability of the police to achieve any kind
■                 of formal, recognisable,                queueing is clearly out of

                  the question.            The police have to be content with a
■
                  considerable        presence,       the    use of many           horses      and

m                 an   attempt       to    influence       and control          the    crowd by
                                             -7 -




      being     amongst        them          and      by     talking      to    them.        The

      packing       outside              the         turnstiles          is      tight       and

      continues to be as kick off approaches.




3.2   The whole sequence will                         show the mounted               officers

      in   various       attempts             to      control the            crowd and you

      will see that the effectiveness of mounted officers

      at the rear of the crowd is to be questioned.                                         You

      will     also       see           as      the         video       progresses          many

      occasions         when        supporters               recklessly         invade       the

      stadium      and        this           indicates           something       about       the

      nature       of     the            crowd            and     the     difficulty          of

      policing.          On        few       occasions           are    police       officers

      able    to   get        to    people            who       are    climbing      into    the

      stadium in such a dangerous way.




3.3   As this clip reaches its finality you will see that

      conditions at the turnstiles themselves have become

      difficult if not fraught.                            Officers are standing on

      fencing      waving               at          the         Merseyside crowd             and

      exhorting         them       to     ease        back       with     little      evident

      result.




3.4   It can be       said         that       the sheer presence of a large

      crowd outside the turnstiles in this fashion is not

      unusual.     This        is a more difficult crowd to manage

      than most         crowds          as     is     witnessed         by     the   constant

      attempts     to     clamber              into          the      ground unlawfully.
Nonetheless   at no      stage   does       there    seem   to   be    a

sustained     momentum      by    the        crowd    towards       the

turnstiles      such        as        was         experienced         at

Hillsborough.       One is drawn to the conclusion that

if    there   had    have    been,          the     same    sort      of

difficulties would have been experienced -                   despite

the   considerable     rumber    of    mounted       officers      that

were available.

Greater Manchester Police Mounted Branch




EXPERIENCE




I am a     Chief      Inspector     in     charge      of   the   Mounted

Branch     of         the Greater        Manchester Police.            The

Branch maintains in excess of 40 operational horses

and is the      largest branch outside the Metropolitan

Police.     I      have 20 years          experience as        a mounted

officer,     all      that   time     policing         major      football

matches including such clubs                as Manchester United,

Manchester         City, Oldham,      Bolton     and others         and I

have     frequently      been      deployed       to     other      major

grounds    in Liverpool and on three occasions at the

Hillsborough Football Club.




Having considered the generality of                    events     outside

Leppings    Lane,       I make      the    following        observations

concerning      the     actions     of     the   mounted       officers.

These     observations       are     arranged       in      response    to

potential areas of criticism.
COMMUNICATIONS




Mounted officers              are     a mobile         deployment,      more       so

than r.ost other deployments                      in large crowds.                For

this     reason         as    well         as    the     obvious        need       to

commu'icate,            communications           systems       are important.

Having said           this,      a     number     of     issues       should      be

borne in mind.




Firstly      the      quality        of     equipment      available         in my

experience         across       several         police        force    areas       is

such t-iat communications                   systems are never entirely

reliable.         Whilst        this       issue has been raised               many

times,     technical          limitations         are a difficulty with

which rcunted officers have to cope.




Seconcl y,      in      any     crowd       background        noise     is   often

such " a t        whatever           radio      system you are using               it

becomes       relatively              ineffective.             If     the    crowd

becomes      agitated         and      excited        the background noise

can     heroine       deafening            to   the     officer       and    radio

communications            are    not       effective      whilst       he    is    in

that situation.



Thirdly,      a mounted officer has                     got    to     handle      his

horse              if    he   is      in    a   difficult position             this

will tire both his hands and all his                             concentration

and again it becomes difficult if not impossible to

corrjnur.i: i t e .

2.5   Having      said         radio        communications               in        crowd

      situations     are       somewhat          fragile,       mounted       officers

      have      learned    their        craft          and      generally          whilst

      within sight of each other they can interpret                                  each

      other's actions and co-ordinate their ciaoeuvres.




2.6   Loud    hailers     cannot        be       operated        effectively          by

      mounted     officers       due     to      the     need    to    be      able    to

      control     his     horse,        and       in     my     experience,          when

      crowds are restive, have little or no i-pact.



3     COMMAND




3.1    In    an ideal situation the mounted officer in charge

      might be     able    to take          up    a position          such     that he

      can monitor needs and direct affairs.




3.2    In    practice      this       rarely       appertains            at football

      matches and the mounted officer in cc~.and will try

      to be where his experience                   and expertise              are most

      needed,      and     because          horses        are     a      scarce       and

      valuable     resource,           will       always        assist      in      crowd

      control.




3.3    In    relation     to    the     developing            needs      at Leppings

      Lane      turnstiles,            my        interpretation               is     that

      Inspector      KAND-DAVIS             rightly       positioned             himself

      where the problems seemed to be the greatest.                                 That
                                                     -4-


      is     to    say,    having returned with                the     train escort,

      he      determined          to     stay       at      the      Leppings        Lane

      turnstiles.




3.4   From        the     film    it     is     evident        that        experienced

      mounted officers judged the situation prior to 2.30

      p.m. to be reasonably normal.




3.5   In    those       circumstances          and    given         that    there     was

      between 10 and 13 horses in this general area,                                     his

      position would be what I would have expected,                                   that

      is     to    say the crowd was               behaving normally               and    he

      was     "working"          amongst       other       mounted         officers       to

      prevent pressure and surging.




3.6   As the situation worsens and crowd pressure builds

      up,     my    interpretation            is    that his         need    to assist

      and direct in forming a line to counteract pressure

      at     the turnstiles was greater than a need to stand

      back and consider alternative overall plans.




3.7   In    this    context too it should be                      said      that    there

      were,        on     the    basis    of what          I   can    determine,          an

      insufficient              number    of       horses      at     this        critical

      juncture          - between        2.30      p.m.     and      2.45    p.m.    - to

      make        any other options than                  the plan         they    had    in

      hand a viable one.
                                                      -5 -


3.8   In    short,          had    he stood           back        to     consider       an

      alternative plan he would have                           lost    a horse        from

      the     line,    added       to    the    communication             problem and

      gained nothing.




4     ANTICIPATION




4.1   The    primary        purpose of         mounted         officers        policing

      turnstiles        is        to     prevent             crushing.        Generally

      mounted officers seek to achieve orderly queues                                   by

      pushing     the   crowd           into position            and   communieating

      with them.




4.2   Being    familiar       with       the    Leppings          Lane        turnstiles

      and     being     aware           of     the      problems         of    so     many

      turnstiles being close together,                          I would anticipate

      that for a large crowd orderly queues                               between the

      gate     and    the     turnstiles             would      eventually          become

      impossible, as such.




4.3   My experience has been that this area would simply

      fill, but       if order was maintained                     there would not

      be problems.




4.4   Ey reference           to the police            video       I interpret that

      the     mounted   officers             drew     similar         conclusions       up

      until 2.35 p.m.
                                                     -6-


4.5   Experienced          mo us ed      officers          at    this     stage      were

      showing no concern and they                        and their horses             were

      calm and at ease.




4.6   Given         that in tie previous                 year     and    on    previous

      occasions       the     situations         would          have    had    the    same

      appearance I carrot see grounds at that stage (2.35

      p.m.) for putting into effect a different plan.




4.7   It has       to be     saii that          crowds      at turnstiles            often

      present problems.                 They may arrive late on a train

      and break           ranks    *s    they       approach       the    turnstiles.

      Usually the crowding is momentary and officers are

      able to achieve s:r.a level of restraint.




4.8   My point is that looking                  at      the volume,           the sight

      of     the    crowd     at    one    stage         around        2.30   p.m./2.35

      p.m. shows nothing to indicate the events which are

      to   follow         and wc.ld       be    a       common     enough      sight    at

      many grounds.




4.9   In   all       my       experience            I     have never           received

      information that olia ground                       is only part          full and

      that     I must        therefore         anticipate a            late    surge    at

      the eleventh hour.
                                                   -7 -



4.10   I have never been given information about turnstile

       flows and I would find it almost impossible to ir.axe

       calculations as to the number of people present ard

       the time it would take to process them by referer.ce

       to calculations.




4.11   Many    considerations              come    into     the     plan:       ticket

       queues move more quickly; pricing                     in round          figures

       moves     the       crowd      more       quickly,        weather       has    an

       effect;    the       mood      of     the     crowd       itself        can    :e

       critical.




4.12   In short, it is not uncommon for there to be fairly

       large   crowds       outside        the     ground    until       'kick       off

       and    shortly afterwards             and    I would expect mounted

       officers       to    be     concerned       with     policing        what      is

       there at the turnstiles.




4.13   Late    arrivals          at   football       grounds       are     a    comrcn

       enough occurrence.              I have for example been                 at Old

       Trafford working crowds at turnstiles up until half

       time.     I have given consideration as to whether,                             if

       I was     aware that the             crowd could not possibly cjc

       in on time, there should be some kind of                            secondary

       plan.      I    do    not      regard       this     as    sensible.           The

       mounted officers view would always be that it takes

       time    and you       simply        have    to     stay    with the       crc-d

       until they have got in.
                                                             -8-


4 .1 4   Usually if a' problem of this kind occurs it will be

         at    one    particular         set       of        turnstiles.          It becomes

         problematic         at    and    after              'kick      off'    and     usually

         horses from other turnstile duties are available to

         assist.          I have not known a turnstile crowd behave

         as    they did at Leppings Lane twenty minutes before

         •kick off'.




4.15     In my experience overcrowding                             and    singing       outside

         turnstiles         happens      three           or    four       times    a season.

         It usually occurs when,                        as    'kick off'          approaches,

         those       at    the    back   realise              they      will    not get        in.

         The queues disintegrate and we end up with                                         a mass

         around       the    turnstiles.                On occasion numbers                  would

         be    similar       to    those       I    can        gauge      to be        from    the

         Police video at Leppings Lane.                                Then, the tactic is

         to get horses worked into the crowd wherever                                        there

         is    a space and then get a line formed and filter.

         The     turnstiles           themselves               relieve          the     forward

         pressure.          This is difficult because the horses can

         injure       people      and    frighten              the      crowd.        They     are

         resented by the crowd and the policeman himself                                        is

         reluctant because of                  fear          the horse might            trample

         someone.           Usually      this       works          -    I have        not    known

         circumstances             where           we        have        been      completely

         overwhelmed.

4.1t   I    have    never had        the        resources           to     undertake       a

       manoeuvre         designed    to        shave        off    sections        of    the

       crowd from the rear.                   For this tactic to work there

       would have         to be     two       operations:          one     to    peel    off

       sections of the            crowd;       and a second to corral the

       people separated from the main group.                               That problem

       would       become      progressively           difficult           as    more    and

       more people were removed and my thought is that                                    it

       would       be    too     complex        to     achieve.           I     take    into

       account that the crowd at that stage                              would already

       be    unco-operative         and        those    at        the    back would be

       precisely         those     being        most        boisterous           and,    not

       having      been       subjected        to crushing,             not     frightened

       by    the    situation.           It    is    perhaps            likely    as    well

       that I would need a third serial of horses to hold

       back emerging crowds               at    a point           further        back than

       the operation.            I have never known such a manoeuvre

       practised and I would                  regard it as              too   complex     to

       achieve.




5      DEPLOYMENT




5.1    There are two           issues     in respect of                 the deployment

       of mounted         officers        on    this        occasion.           The     first

       concerns         the    initial    disposition of the horses and

       the second concerns their later tactical deployment

       in     the       circumstances           which         appertain           at     the

       Leppings Lane turnstiles.
                                                -10-


5.2   Having examined           the    operational       order        and     in   the

      context of the previous year's experience I can see

      nothing which is not as I would expect.                           I have to

      say that all mounted officers spend a good deal of

      time policing football and know how to fulfil their

      role without detailed briefing.




5.3   In   short,    once given         the    general      designation that

      their job is to do a particular escort or police a

      particular forecourt or turnstiles, everything else

      goes without saying.              They wouli of course                need to

      be   aware     of     the   corrnnunicaticr.5         system      and    match

      information.




5.4   So far as I can judge,             the deployment of the horses

      on    this     date      prior    to     any   problems         arising      was

      normal       and    in    accordance       wivi    the     routine           that

      would be seen almost anywhere.




5.5   As to the tactical deplopymec" at Leppings Lane, it

      seems from 2.08 p.m. when the train escort arrived,

      there was some 13 horses at this point managing the

      situation.          Given       that    the    rlan    overall        was      to

      police       the    whole   of    the    appr:aches        to    the ground

      this seems a reasonable concentration at that time.




5.6   Ordinarily 13 horses would be sufficient to control

      queueing       at    turnstiles         in nurisrs     around         10,000.
This observation depends upon the fact that most of

the    time,     although          there      can be              surges    and        some

indisciplines,             the     bulk       of        the        crowd        will     be

reasonably co-operative.




I would       find great difficulty in determining what

level of resources would be necessary to control                                           a

crowd     of     many            thousands          who           were     absolutely

uncooperative.




By reference          to the        film,      up until             2.35        p.m.     the

deployment       at        Leppings        Lane         appeared           sufficient

even     if      more        were        to        be     expected              at       the

turnstiles.           There         is      always            a     limit        on      the

availability          of    horses        and       experience             has         shown

that    if    they     are       removed       from       other deployments,

problems       can     arise       which       will           rebound       upon         the

overall strategy.




By 2.40 p.m. according to the statements. Inspector

HAND-DAVIS       recognised          the need            for       more     resources

and     called       for    whatever          horses          and        foot    patrols

could be made available.                      By 2.52 p.m.                the problem

had so escalated that Gate                         'C' was opened and the

pressure at the turnstiles substantially eased.




The critical phase therefore consists of 12 minutes.
During      that    12 minutes         interpretation of             the    film

is    that    the    mounted      officers          near    the    turnstiles

recognised         they had      become        ineffective         and     moved

out to       form a line with other mounted officers to

defend       the    gates.        This       manoeuvre       took     several

minutes       to    effect      and    there     is clearly one             stage

when it starts to become valuable and                         some control

is gained.




Regrettably         for    reasons       I     cannot       determine,        the

line    is    broken      and    the     surge       resumes.        This    may

coincide      with     the opening of               the gates      but     it is

not clear from the film.




I    have     considered         three       options        available        from

sometime       after      2.35        p.m.     Firstly,        the       mounted

Inspector could have determined upon a plan to hold

back    the    crowd on both            flanks       of Leppings Lane on

the basis that any point closer to the gates would

have still produced a bottle neck.




This would have been a considerable change of plan

and    would       have   required           about    40     horses        and   a

considerable         number      of     foot    patrols       to    hold back

the    crowd.        It   would       have     to    have    been     effected

very quickly otherwise the bulk of the crowd would

already have been in the bottle neck.
                                                    -1 3 -


5.15   I do not consider this was ever a valid option.                                      By

       the     tirr.2 it became         remotely             possible         it   was     too

       late.




5.16   The secc^d option would have been                           for    the mounted

       Inspector       to   have       formed       a    line      in    front of           the

       gates       tr act   as     a    filter          cordon      at    that       point.

       Ideally ■this        should      have        come       into      effect before

       the     pressure     at    the       turnstiles          and      at    the    gates

       became intense.




5.17   In    the   event    the    need       for       that       option      was       only

        identified      when     the        crowd       pressure         built       up;     by

        then           mounted officers had great difficulty                                 in

       putting it into effect.




5.18   The     third    option         is     one       which       I     have        heard

       canvassei,       although not by mounted officers.                                  This

        is the rrtion of seeking to relieve pressure at the

        front          some kind of manoeuvre at the rear of the

       crowd.




5.19   In all ry considered experience                         I    regard         this     as

       wholly impractical.              To go to the rear of the crowd

       entails      that    every       effort          to     ease      the       pressure

       where it exists has to be abandoned in the hope of

        forestEliing further pressure.                        To have formed some
kind of line behind the problem would have achieved

nothing once          the problem existed in the proportion

it did.




I also    regard        it as   virtually       impossible       to    thin

the   crowd      by shaving off            sections of it from          the

rear.     The crowd's momentum is forward, and without

enough horses          to coral those removed from the back

of the crowd and keep up a continuous pressure,                          it

is just not practical.




The   only      realistic option once               the   crcvd pressure

became    evident,       was    to   form     some    kind cf    line    in

the centre       of     the crowd,         holding back one half of

the crowd       while     the    turnstiles         eased    pressure    on

the other.        On the basis of the film evidence this

is what the officers tried to do.



DIFFICULTIES




In    discussing        mounted      tactics         some   difficulties

need to be outlined:




6.1.1     Timid    by    nature,       a    horse    is a pack animal

          and likes to be lead.                It can be      frightened

          and      it     is     not        easily        controlled     in

          frightening situations;
                                             -1 5 -


       6.1.2   If the horse panics and kicks or rears in a

               crowd,       there     are     obvious         and     terriying

               dangers;




       6.1.3   All horses      and    riders have different levels

               of skills;




6.2    In summary,    managing       a horse      in a crowd situation

       requires    strength     and    skill      and    has    limitations.

       Difficulties can be compounded by lack of room for

       manoeuvre      and     inability         to      communicate.         My

       interpretation of the film is that mounted officers

       handled their horses well in an extremely difficult

       situation     and    tried     to    pursue      the    only     tactics

       reasonably available to them.

                    STATEMENT OF JOHN STALKER



I    am   51       years    of    age     and      an    author      and       journalist
specializing in policing and                        associated matters.                    For
over      30 years I was a police officer.                           I first          joined
the Manchester City Police, which in 1974 was greatly
enlarged        tc form          the     Greater        Manchester         Police.          In
1977 I transferred to the Warwickshire Constabulary on
promotion            to       the         rank          of        Detective           Chief
Superintendent,             and in 1980 I was                appointed Assistant
Chief      Constable        in the Greater Manchester                         force.        In
March     1984 I was appointed to the rank of Deputy Chief
Constable          cf     Greater       Manchester,           a    position       I    held
until my retirement from the police service in 1987.


Greater        Manchester         is     the       largest        provincial      police
force     in Er.gland and Wales,                   with a personnel             strength
of     almost        10,000       police        officers          and    other        staff
serving        a    population          of     2.6-million          people.           It    is
responsible for policing eight Football League grounds
as follows:


           Manchester United
           Manchester City
           Oldham Athletic
           Boltcn Wanderers
           Wigar. Athletic
           Bury ? C
           StocV.port County F C
           Rochdale F C


Only      Londor.'s        Metropolitan            Police     has       more    football
grounds within its policing area.


In     acknowledgement              of       its    experience           in     policing
football       grcunds,          including F A Cup                 Semi-finals,            and
indeed      Cup         Final     replays          and       internationals,               the
!•
          Association               of    Chief       Police     Officers             (ACPO)      several
          years         ago         appointed          the     Chief        Constable            and        an
          Assistant Chief Constable of Greater Manchester as the
          Chairman            and    Secretary          respectively             of       the    National
          Sub-Committee                  which        deals     with        the        planning            and
          problems of policing football stadia.                                      I was thus very
          close to the policy making centre for the policing of
          football            in     this       country.       On     my        retirement         I       was
          offered,           and     accepted,         an honorary membership of ACPO
          which I still hold.


     2.   During        my     seven       years       as     Assistant          and      then    Deputy
          Chief         Constable          of    Greater       Manchester             I    attended         at
          least         one    League           game    every       week        in     the      season       -
          usually,           but     not exclusively,            at either Maine Road or
          Old       Trafford             football       grounds.            I     am      a     committed
          supporter and spectator of the game and have been all
          my    life.         For two years as a player I was captain of
          the Manchester Police team.                          As Deputy Chief Constable
          I     had          overall            responsibility,             under          the     Chief
          Constable, for the way in which the force, specifically
          supervised                by        the       Assistant               Chief           Constable
          (Operations),              performed          its operational job.                    I took a
          very close interest in those duties.


     3.   Additionally              -     and     relevant       to    this          Statement         -    I
          should also add that during a period in 1983, whilst on
          a one-year study course at the Royal College of Defence
          Studies,           I travelled at Government expense through-out
          South America studying a range of social and political
          issues.        Included           in this study was the opportunity to
          take      a    first-hand             official        look    at       the      policing          of
          football            matches,           principally           in        Brazil         where        I
          witnessed stadium crowds of over 160,000.                                       I have made
          similar study trips to Europe as a police officer.                                                 I
          am    a    graduate            of     the    Senior       Command           Course      at       the
          National           Police        Staff       College,       Bramshill,              Hampshire,
          which I attended in 1979.

4.   Rather more         sombrely,            in relation to matters                               of major
     tragedy,       I have             been       involved                in,    or     in       charge         of,
     countless murder investigations, and in August 1985, as
     Deputy Chief Constable, I was in operational command of
     police actions for the first ten hours at the scene of
     the Manchester Airport disaster when 55 people died.                                                         I
     then    handed over               to an Assistant Chief                               Constable.             I
     have    significant               experience               of violent              and unexpected
     death,       and of the setting up of large                                       scale temporary
     mortuaries.


5.   Since    I    left       the       force          I       have       become        involved           in    a
     number of matters                  relating to sport and in particular,
     in February 1988,                  I was retained by Millwall F                                   C as       a
     consultant          on       policing             matters.                 Millwall          F    C    were
     members       of    the First                Division during                      seasons         1988/89
     and     1989/90.             I still         hold that                 consultancy               position
     and     am   therefore very                   familiar with                      current         policing
     strategies           and          day        to           day        operational              problems.
     Finally, I am regularly asked to comment or write about
     football       matters             and       have           done       this       for all         British
     national       TV        and       radio          networks                 and    for the          London
     Evening        Standard,                the               Daily        Express              and       other
     newspapers.             I have on a number of occasions in recent
     years        attended             big        games              at     Hillsborough                   as     a
     spectator,         and        I    have       visited                the     ground          since         the
     tragedy in April 1989.


6.   At the request of Davies Arnold Cooper                                            (solicitors)              I
     have     closely          studied            a        very        substantial               volume          of
     documents relating to the events of that day, including
     a large number submitted by the South Yorkshire Police
     and Sheffield Wednesday F C.                                 I have also read the full
     transcripts             of     the       evidence                 given          to     the       Inquiry
     conducted          by     Lord       Justice               Taylor,           of       the     following
     South Yorkshire police officers:




                                              -    3       -
                 Chief Superintendent Mole,                              Chief       Superintendent
                 Duckenfield,               Assistant Chief Constable Jackson,
                 Superintendent Marshall,                               Superintendent Murray,
                 Superintendent                   Greenwood,             Chief       Superintendent
                 Nesbitt,             Superintendent                     Brougham,        Detective
                 Superintendent                    McKay,              Inspector        Hand-Davis,
                 Chief        Inspector                Creaser,              Inspector        Darling,
                 Inspector            Bullas,               Inspector         Sewell,     Inspector
                 Calvert,             Constable               Ryan,           Sergeant        Goddard,
                 Constable Bichard and Constable Guest.


     I    had     already         studied              both        the        Interim    and       Final
     Reports      of the Rt. Hon.                      Lord Justice             Taylor's       Inquiry
     into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.


7.   In    preparing          this          Statement              I    have    made     deliberate
     efforts          not        to    be         influenced             by what we       now      know
     occurred at Hillsborough on the afternoon of                                             15 April
     1989 .       I     have          tried        to        exclude          the     advantage         of
     hindsight         from my opinions.                          I have attempted to look
     at the policing arrangements made for that day and the
     decisions          which          ensued,               with        a     professional          and
     objective          eye       and        with            an        understanding          of     the
     complexities                     and         imponderables                of    policing           a
     potentially volatile public                              event which            54,000 people
     attended.          I wholly recognize that the South Yorkshire
     Police       had       to    operate              in     an       environment        and      at       a
     stadium       not      of    their           making          or     design.        Having      said
     that,      any     police         force would                 have       been in     a    similar
     position.           Within        my         experience             no    football       stadium,
     with       the    arguable             exception              of    Wembley,       provides            a
     venue      for the unproblematic policing                                  of   large crowds.
     They all have inherent difficulties and it is fair to
     say    that       of        the    larger              stadia       atwhich a       Semi-final
     might be played, Hillsborough is no more difficult than
     the rest.

     8.    My views       are concentrated in three specific                                     areas and
           are     based    on    what         the    South          Yorkshire              Police       either
           knew     or    should       reasonably               expected          to    have       believed
           would be the problems facing them in policing a Semi­
           final     between the well supported First                                   Division teams
           of Liverpool           F C and Nottingham Forest.                                  Those       areas
           are:     the     planning            for,           the     implementation                of     and
           response to the events of the day.


     9.    South    Yorkshire          Police        has        enjoyed      a     good          reputation
           with     senior English policemen.                          From       its        inception in
           1974     it had a succession of highly professional Chief
           Constables,       one of whom went on to appointment as H M
           Chief     Inspector            of    Constabulary,                one       who       became      an
           Inspector        of    Constabulary                  and    one       who        is     the     only
           former Chief Constable to be elevated to the House of
           Lords.


           Its     Chief    Constable           at        the    time of          the        disaster,       Mr
           Peter Wright OBE Q?M (now retired), was regarded as                                                a
           tough-minded,              deeply         professional             policeman              with     a
           successful career pedigree of difficult postings.                                                The
           force overall was seen as a busy,                              medium-sized police
           force with        a demanding range of policing problems.                                          I
           base this opinion or. personal acquaintance of the Chief
           Constables I have referred to, and on a period of about
           eight         months       I     spent              working       in        the        force      in
           1981     investigating               alleged           disciplinary                matters        on
           behalf        of the then Chief Constable,                            Mr     James Brownlow
           CBE QPM. Assistant Chief Constable                                W Jackson was a man
           subordinate           to    me      for    over        20    years          in    the     Greater
           Manchester        Police,           and    I know him to                    be     a competent

     10.   The decision of Chief Superintendent Mole to accept the
            1989 Semi-final            at Hillsborough as                    a     'neutral'             ground
           was,     in my view, perfectly sound given                                   the experience
           of      the    force       of       policing           similar         events.            I     also

           believe       that     his     insistence          on     the     segregation             of
           supporters into the allocated areas of the stadium was
           the     right        one,     despite        the        imbalance          of       ticket
           allocation and the protests that brought froa Liverpool
           supporters       and        officials.           Not     to      attempt        a     more
           equable        split,        given      the        configuration                of        the
           accommodation          and     entry    points          was,     in     my      view,       a
           soundly based decision,                as was       the        plan to bring              the
           two    sets     of    supporters       from       different        directions              to
           their allocated areas.                I have given careful thought to
           Mr    Mole's     important          decision       to    close     the       Penistone
           Road turnstiles to Liverpool supporters using the North
           Stand, and I agree with the reasoning underpinning that
           decision.        It     made        operational          sense     to      bring          all
           Liverpool       ticket       holders    through          the     same end of              the
           stadium,       viz.     Leppings       Lane.           However,        there        was     a
           flaw:    nowhere       in the police          pre-planning documents                       is
           there    any     acknowledgement            that        this    would      inevitably
           throw    extra       strains        on the Leppings             Lane       turnstiles.
           Nor,    in the Operational Order prepared for the day,                                     is
           notice given to policemen working at Leppings Lane                                         to
           expect    probable,          or even possible,                 congestion        as       all
           the    occupants       of     the    North       Stand,        which    is      normally
           filled from both ends of the stadium, would be entering
           through Leppings Lane entrances.


     11.   Having     rightly           insisted       on     such         segregation,              the
           failure to highlight the probable effect of it by way
           of written notification, was, in my view, ar. avoidable
           operational oversight.                The Operational Order, although
           worded in almost exactly the same way as that prepared
           for the 1988 Semi-final between the same two teams, is,
           with     one     or     two     minor        criticisms,              an     otherwise
           comprehensive          document comparable with                   those         prepared
           by other police forces for similar events.                                   It is not
           unusual for police Operational Orders to closely follow
           the    format of        earlier       successful          arrangements.              There
           is     advantage      in     remaining       with       familiar        instructions



                                               - 6 -
      set out in recognizable style.


      I    am    slightly        critical,            however,             of      the      use    of     the
      titles       GROUND        CONTROL              to       describe             the      duties        of
      Superintendent Murray,                      and         GROUND COMMANDER for those
      of    Superintendent                 Greenwood.                The       nomenclature,              and
      indeed       the     printing          of       the          title      of      the    former        in
      capital          letters    in the Order,                     gives the unintentional
      indication that Murray was senior to Greenwood                                               in the
      chain of command.                    I personally found                       this misleading
      and       potentially        confusing                  in    an     emergency.              A    more
      descriptive          title       for        Murray           would        have       been        either
      Operational Co-ordinator or Deputy Overall Commander.


12.   I    was     surprised          at    the       uncommonly                large       numbers        of
      police officers required to perform duty at this Semi­
      final.       Obviously, the South Yorkshire force decided to
      err    on    the side of more,                      rather than               too     few     police
      officers,          and    that is not                   operationally              unusual,        but
      even       allowing        for       that,          a    number         in      excess       of     800
      police officers in and around the ground,                                            and a total
      of 1,122 police overall, is very high for an all-ticket
      crowd       of    54,000        at    a day-time               game.            Those       sort     of
      numbers would be unlikely to be exceeded for an F A Cup
      Final or other capacity game at Wembley Stadium.


      Within my memory and experience in Manchester,                                               at both
      Maine       Road     and     Old       Trafford               grounds,          it     was       never
      necessary to require more than 600 police officers for
      ground duty at capacity                         games         of 50,000            plus,     and it
      was       usually        less        than       that.           I       accept        that        local
      policing          decisions          take       account            of     the      proximity         of
      houses       and can        legitimately                  vary,         but     Maine       Road     in
      particular           is     surrounded                   on     all          four       sides        by
      residential property.


      I note from the papers that the numbers of police used
      in        1989     had     been        reduced                from        those        considered



                                             -    7   -
i


          necessary          the year before,             with an          acceptance         in the
          police    documents          that there had been                   too many          police
          officers      in     the wrong places                in    1988.        My opinion is
          that a similar critique could have                               been       applied in a
          debrief of the 1989 operation had it not been overtaken
          by tragic events.


    13.   Turning now to the policing of                            the    Leppings         Lane end
          and    the practical             implementation            of    that part of           the
          Operational         Order    relating to the                reception and entry
          into the ground of the Liverpool supporters.                                       It must
          be     said    that        the     allocated          number           of    290     police
          officers for that sole task should have been more than
          enough        to      cope       with          any    foreseeable                 problems,
          particularly             so when    those        officers          could      have     been
          supplemented at any time by reserves and/or specialist
          or    other    officers.           In     ordinary          policing         terms,     290
          police    officers          is considered             sufficient to               police    a
          busy urban area of about 180,000 people every minute of
          the day,       every day of the year.                       The     South Yorkshire
          Police    background             papers      indicate,           for    example,       that
          the entire          north and western areas of                      Sheffield,         with
          »11 its problems,                is policed round                the clock by only
          299 police staff,            of which only about 20 per cent will
          be on duty, on average, at any one time.


          But,    as in all resource matters, what is important is
          r.ot what you have but how effectively you use them, and
          I have        to    be    critical        of    the       overall       deployment         of
          those    police          officers       in     the    approaches             to    Leppings
          Lane in the one hour before kick-off.                               It was known in
          advance that             all 24,000 Liverpool                supporters would be
          converging on the ground along either Catchbar Lane or
          leppings       Lane,       and     it     should          have    been       anticipated
          that,    despite          exhortations to arrive                  from       12.00 noon,
          the great majority of them would be on the                                    approaches
          from 2.00 pm onwards.

Experienced          practical          policemen know that                   supporters,
other than youngsters,                   expect to be in place                     about 20
minutes or less before kick-off.                              The traditional kick-
off     time         of     3.00       p.m.        was     historically             set     to
accommodate           (a)       Saturday       morning         working        hours,       and
(b.) public house closing times.                              There is nothing new
about late arrivals,                   and the banning of alcohol inside
grounds has           tended       to make it worse.                  It is,        as many
South Yorkshire                policemen acknowledge,                 a fact        of life
and one they regularly recognize at Hillsborough.


For     some     reason          the    light       'spotter'         plane         used    so
successfully and highly praised in 1988 was considered
unnecessary           in       1989.     It may          be    that     expense       was    a
factor,        and         I     can     understand             that,        but     aerial
surveillance          is       irreplaceable             in obtaining         an overall
picture,       and its provision would have been valuable to
Chief     Superintendent                Duckenfield,            and     especially          to
Superintendent                 Marshall       in     better        appreciating            the
volume and distribution of spectator build-up.


Much has been said by many senior uniformed officers of
the      impracticability                  and           expense        of     providing
sufficient resources                   in Leppings Lane               (a)     to monitor
the numbers, if any, of non-ticket holders, and {b ) the
marshalling          and        filtering of         arrivals         to     impose       some
sort of order              before       they hit the bottle-neck of the
turnstiles and the surrounding area.                                 It was said time
and again to Lord                 Justice Taylor               that such       a process
was   considered               neither desirable              nor possible.               I do
not     agree.        The        1988     and       1989       Operational           Orders
frequently refer to the problems of non-ticket holders,
and     they    instruct           on     several         occasions          that    police
officers        working          well     away       from      the    ground         on    the
approaches          to the        City,       should      stop and check             buses,
coaches        and    private          carrier       vehicles         for     non-ticket
holders.        The        1989 Order even makes provision for such
vehicles       to     be       sent    back to the             motorway       and    denied
      access        to    South        Yorkshire          if     they       were        discovered.
      Leaving aside the debatable legal authority to do this
      - a reason frequently raised by senior police officers
      near to the ground for not doing it in an organized vay
      - it clearly illustrates that senior police thought had
      been given to the problems of non-ticket holders. Given
      that,    it is difficult to see why,                            if it was              important
      to give those instructions to                             remote police                officers,
      why     it     should       not        have     been       at        least        equally          as
      important           to     those        in     Leppings           Lane.              The        clear
      inference           is    that    if    non-ticket             holders           avoided          the
      wider        net,        they    were        free     to       get     as        far       as     the
      turnstiles.              That    was     a    half-hearted             approach.                 Such
      instructions             were    either        necessary or             they         were        net,
      and instructions and/or advice given to distant police
      officers       about people arriving without                            tickets             should
      have    been        consistently             repeated          to,    and        applied          by,
      officers working in Leppings Lane and Penistone Road.


16.   About    2.17        pm    Superintendent                Marshall       recognized                the
      need     to    close        Leppings           Lane       to     traffic.              This,        I
      believe,           could        have     been        foreseen          as        a     probable
      exigency           and     incorporated              into       the     written              plan,
      perhaps       from        2.00    pm    until        kick-off.              As    it       was,     a
      sensible move was implemented hastily by Superintendent
      Marshall at too late a stage. The 1.55 p.m.                                          arrival cf
      the special              Liverpool train at Wadsley                     Bridge             railway
      station,       some        800    yards       from the          ground,          was       a geed
      time to have marked the closure of the road,                                           the full
      width     of       which        would        then     have       been        available             to
      organize       an        effective       filter          and    waiting           system          at,
      say, 300 yard intervals using a combination of portable
      barriers,           police        horses            and        the     many           policecen
      available to do it. Having read the papers,                                          statements
      and    Inquiry           testimony,       I am at          a    loss        to    know where
      most of those extra officers were when the beleaguered
      Superintendent Marshall                      needed       them       so desperately at
      the    turnstiles           and close approaches.                       I    suspect            they

          were    in     largish       numbers        either       still       at    the    railway
          station,        at    Leppings          Lane    roundabout       or        standing    by
          barriers blocking off side roads long after the bulk of
          Liverpool fans had passed on the way to the ground.                                     A
          random       example        of    this     is    found     in    the       Operational
          Order     which        shows        that        Serial     36    (ten        men)     was „
          instructed       to     remain at Wadsley Bridge                      station       after
          the    supporters had left to be escorted to the ground.
          From     about       2.00    pm     those       officers       had    no     duties    to
          perform and yet were within a few minutes' walk of the
          turnstiles.           At     a    realistic       estimate       I        believe    that
          seven serials          (27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 36 and 37), i.e. in
          excess    of 60 police officers, were available                                  for more
          effective redeployment in the walk-up to Leppings Lane
          turnstiles from 2.00 p.m.


          Alternatively,          if only half of Leppings Lane had been
          coned     off    to     traffic          from     that    time       Superintendent
          Marshall could have better organized and controlled the
          heavy     stream       of        supporters       arriving       from        2.15    p.m.
          onwards.        They would not have been obscured by traffic,
          especially buses,                and he would also have been able to
          pick     out     his       policemen        better       and     from       a     further
          distance.


          Instead, his problems were on him before he could plan
          what     to     do.         He    had     no     time     for    strategy,           only
          reaction.        I do not believe it unreasonable to say that
          this was        foreseeable,            either at the planning                   stage or
          by flexible management on the day when good weather and
          slow arrivals were obvious.


    17.   A 'filter out' system of non-ticket holders and drunken
          or over boisterous fans could, and in my view should,
          have been written into the Leppings Lane instructions.
          In my experience a no-nonsense,                      non-belligerent police
          style,       using     concerted         police      resources,            gives    clear
          signals to potential trouble-makers and achieves a good

          deal. There is a significant amount of evidence in the
          individual      reports           from    police        officers          in    Leppings
          Lane    that    seriously          anti-social,          obscene          and       drunken
          behaviour       was    tolerated          by     police,       which       must           have
          encouraged      the      continuance            of    that     behaviour             to    the
          turnstiles,       albeit by a relatively                     few offenders.                 It
          seems that few, if any, arrests were made.


    18.   The lack of direction of those police officers outside
          the ground in Leppings Lane by those within it who were
          in    possession       of    crucial       statistical             information            has
          been     acknowledged            and     dealt        with     by    Lord           Justice
          Taylor. Nevertheless,                  an experienced police officer in
          charge cf a football ground must use all information he
          can    get.     The     flow       rate    of        supporters          into       various
          areas    cf the       stadium is vital                information          in       judging
          where tc deploy police officers,                        especially in respect
          of    segregation and the use                   of pens.       A wise policeman
          uses sue* information constantly.


          In this instance it should have been obvious                                    that the
          turnstiles      could        not       accommodate       the       entry        of    those
          still    outside       the       ground    before       kick-off.              It     was    a
          matter     cf   simple           arithmetic,          but     even       without          the
          turnstile       flow         rates,        visual        evaluation              of       the
          terraces,         plus           information            from        Superintendent
          Marshall's      sector        and       video    evidence,          made        it    clear
          that there were too many arriving,                            too late,          for too
          few     turr.-stiles.            It    would     have       been     a    simple          and
          unremarkable police decision to request a delayed kick-
          off.     This should always be done, if possible,                                    before
          the    teaxs    come       out    to warm up.            My    view       is     that       Mr
          Duckenfield should have realized before 2.45 pm that he
          needed     time       to     sort        out    Leppings           Lane,        and       the
          practical decision made to delay kick-off and to tell
          the crowds outside.


          In an operational sense I believe it helpful for me to


                                             -    12 -

          say that, on balance, Chief Superintendent Mole should
          have     been      in     overall         command                that    day,           with Chief
          Superintendent            Duckenfield               as        an    observer.               That     is
          what     I    would       have done           in        Greater         Manchester.                 The
          latter's          lack    of    recent             experience             at       Hillsborough
          Stadium was known to more senior officers, and I do not
          believe his operational credibility would have suffered
          by taking a passive role on this occasion.                                              I believe
          that the senior management of the force - in particular
          the     Assistant             Chief       Constable                 (Operations)                  might
          reasonably have anticipated this.


    20.   Once     the       unpoliceable               situation              developed               at     the
          turnstiles         -     and    the      reasons              are       now    well         known     -
          Superintendent            Marshall            was           right        to    ask          for     the
          opening           of      the gates.                    I        would             expect           any
          superintendent            to     have         done          the     same.           It       is     old
          territory         now    but    I       can    add          my     opinion         to       those    of
          others that there was ample time to arrange a cordon of
          police       officers         and/or      temporary                barriers         across          the
          mouth of the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4 on the West
          terraces.          It     was a         simple          and       obvious decision                   to
          make,    either          by    Chief      Superintendent                      Duckenfield            or
          Superintendent Murray, and could have been accomplished
          in about two minutes at the most.                                   A fundamental tenet
          of policing is to evaluate the probable effect of any
          course       of    operational            action,                especially             where       the
          safety of the public is involved.                                   It didn't happen on
          this     occasion         and       must           be       regarded          as        a    serious
          operational            failure          given           the       senior       rank          of     the
          officers involved.


    21.   Neither police nor stewards were physically present on
          the terraces            at Leppings            Lane and I do not criticise
          this.        It accords with practice in other stadia within
          my    experience         except         where           gangways         have      to       be    kept
          clear.        Individual        police             officers or            stewards caught
          in a dense crowd are rendered useless and are in real



                                              -    13    -
danger    of     isolation            and    assault        in    some    cases.        The
constant        monitoring            of     the    physical        packing       of    the
terraces        is,     in    my        experience,         a     joint    police       and
stewardship job, but at Hillsborough it seems clear the
police had taken on the leading role.                              Broadly, this is
consistent            with        a     police        officer's           common         law
responsibility to protect life and                              'property'       whether
in public or private places.


I found it hard to                    fully understand what many police
officers meant when expecting the Leppings Lane terrace
crowd     'to    find        its own         level'.       Crowds    just       don't     do
that    without        help or direction                  from     officials.          Those
who arrive early and obtain better positions will                                        not
move     in     order        to       accommodate          the    comfort        of     late
comers.        In the Leppings Lane pens it was impossible to
move    sideways beyond the                   limits       of    the radial           fences
and    outside        help        was      essential       in     redistribution          of
supporters from one pen to another.


Police control boxes are deliberately sited in football
stadia in positions where they can closely watch crowd
responses and behaviour,                     and it is an accepted part of
a policeman's job either to help stewards or personally
initiate measures to improve safety and comfort. Police
officers        at    stadia within my               experience           are    expected
to, and often do, relieve pressure by opening perimeter
gates     in    order        to       move    fans    to    other        areas    of     the
ground.        It is a common occurrence, usually designed to
protect youngsters at the front of pens, and one which
I have supported at Old Trafford and Maine Road on many
occasions.            In     fairness                to     the     South       Yorkshire
Police,       who decided against                   this    practice,       I can        say
that     such problems                rarely       occur    at     all-ticket          games
where crowd distribution can be better anticipated and
provided for.


Operationally I was very surprised to learn there were
      no     binoculars       in     the           Police          Control           room.      The
      introduction of         zoom camera lenses was                           never    intended
      as    a replacement          for       human        evaluation.            The     lack    of
      binoculars was a mistake.


24.   The serious inadequacy                  of        police radio communications
      did not surprise me.                   Many forces have recognized the
      relatively       inferior              quality          of        some     Home        Office
      equipment      such as that in use in South Yorkshire,                                    and
      have    purchased       from           private         suppliers          to    their     own
      technical       specifications.                    I   cannot          say,     given     the
      extraordinary demands placed upon the network that day,
      whether any equipment would have been an improvement.
      Based on my experience prior to 1987 I do not blame the
      South    Yorkshire       force           for        the      problems          with     their
      radios.


25.   When    the    extent    of    the           disaster          became      obvious,       the
      Operational Order was of course superseded by the Force
      Major incident Plan.                   I have studied this and accept it
      as a well-written comprehensive outline of action to be
      taken at a major incident.                        All police forces have them
      and they       are    usually          prepared           to      a    similar    pattern.
      Some    police       forces write             into them               contingency       plans
      for particular local problems, such as an explosives or
      chemical plant,         or a major airport.                           None, as far as I
      am aware,       before April             1989, made any special mention
      of football grounds,                   although post-Popplewell                    in    1985
      all    police    forces within my knowledge                              reviewed       their
      stadia        procedures       and            those          of        other     emergency
      services.


      Given the special nature of                         the Hillsborough              tragedy,
      which occurred in the presence of over 50,000 people, I
      doubt     whether       any        other           police         force        could     have
      improved much on what South Yorkshire did.                                      There were
      some mistakes - for example, in the early direction of
      ambulances and fire engines - but my experience is that



                                         -    15    -
      there usually are mistakes brought on by confusion. The
      sudden transition from peaceful normality to a state of
      high    emergency can never be                          achieved          without          initial
      fleeting       disbelief       followed                by    duplication              of    effort
      and confusion.                The skill of any police force is in
      managing the situation in as short a time as possible
      with    the human resources                      and accommodation available,
      and I think South Yorkshire Police achieved that fairly
      well.


26.   This sympathetic opinion extends only to the actions of
      the     Police       once      the          extent           of     the        disaster           was
      recognised and the Major Disaster Plan implemented.                                                 I
      have     to     be        critical          of         slow        operational              Police
      response       to the early stage of the                            unfolding tragedy.
      Emergency         procedures                 for         organising                  the      rapid
      evacuation       of ar.y part of                     a football           stadium are the
      firm     responsibility            of        the        Police.           They         have       the
      training,       discipline and resources with which to do it
      safely.        In the instance of the Leppings Lane terraces
      there appear to have been no plan available - at least
      none    which was known to the constables                                      and     sergeants
      whose    job it would be to implement it.                                      Evacuation of
      the     crowd    back       through          the        tunnel           in     order (a)          to
      relieve       pressure within                the pens;             and        (b),    to    remove
      casualties       was       the obvious                and    sensible           measure,          but
      there was no effective Police direction or coordination
      in carrying it c.t.


      It is an inescapable axiom that                                  emergency evacuations
      must     be    planned       for       at     large          gatherings              of    people,
      especially           at     football                 matches,        and        that        Police
      Officers       are aware of those plans.                             Putting aside                the
      unforeseen       exter.t of this                     tragedy,       incidents              such    as
      bomb    scares,       large scale fights                         (even    sudden illness)
      are     not    uncommon       at       football             matches           and     can     cause
      panic    and    affect the safety of tightly                                  packed crowds.
      In      this     case,        the           lack            of     clear             contingency

          instructions               and     the poorly directed                          response            to    the
          difficulties                once       they            did        become      obvious           must       be
          regarded as a serious operational failure on the                                                         part
          of a professional Police Force.


    27.   The    swift setting up and                             organization of a                     temporary
          mortuary          is        always            a     harrowing              job, and            I      think
          Detective             Superintendent                    McKay handled              it as           well    as
          possible              in    view        of         the        problems             of     bewildered,
          distraught and angry relatives and friends.


    28.   I    have        to    be    operationally                        critical         here       of     Chief
          Superintendent                   Duckenfield's                     decision         not        to        make
          Tannoy announcements about what he knew hat happened in
          case        it        created          problems                   for     emerger.oy            services
          arriving at the stadium.                                    I believe the crowd,                    not to
          mention other policemen whose radios were useless, were
          entitled to be told officially at an earlier stage what
          they     in       fact           could            see        was       happening.             The     Chief
          Superintendent's                       decision                   to      say       r.othing              was
          operationally                    risky,            and            but      for          the         shocked
          realization and good sense of the crowd it could                                                         have
          made matters worse.


    29.   In    conclusion             I    say     that,              in    my    opinicr.,        the        South
          Yorkshire             Police       approached the policing of                                  the       1989
          Semi-final with a certain lack of vision: this comment
          is    not     made         in the knowledge                        that    things         went        badly
          wrong.        My professional impression is that they thought
          a combination of very substantial manpower and                                                       strict
          segregation of fans, written into a repeat of the 1988
          Operational                Order,        was            sufficient            to        see     the       day
          through.              In     the        main            their           plans       vorked            well,
          especially in relation to the movement of traffic,                                                        the

          reception             of    the        Nottingham                  supporters.            In        failing
          apparently to consider                             the possible,                indeed probable,

              Leppings Lane entrances the police made an operational
              mistake.        This       in    turn          led       to   confused,       chaotic       and
              eventually       unmanageable                  policing problems in                  Leppings
              Lane for which contingency plans should have been made.
              The    result       was     the       best           efforts      of        Superintendent
              Marshall      and     of    the mounted police                    officers were            not
              enough.       The     bulk       of       spare policemen were behind                       the
              crowd ’'father than between it and the turnstiles.                                         Once
              that    had     happened         the       need to open               the    gates     became
              almost     inevitable.                The       problem         was     foreseeable         and
              avoidable by better management of the crowd route along
              Leppings Lane.


        30.   Despite the relative operational successes in previous
              years Leppings Lane should have been closed to traffic
              from    2.00     pm        Similar          closures           occur     at    many     other
              grounds and the reasons are simple:                               to provide room, a
              line     of     sight,          operational               options       and     to     remove
              confusion       and    danger             to    large         crowds    milling        around
              moving     vehicles. The                  fact       that     such     closure       was    not
              considered,         even        as    a     set      option       for       Superintendent
              Marshall until the situation forced itself on him, was
              a major cause of his subsequent difficulties.


        31.   That,     and    the       lack       of       police         deployment       across       the
    I         mouth of the terrace tunnel, were, in my view, the two
              serious flaws in the South Yorkshire Police operation.

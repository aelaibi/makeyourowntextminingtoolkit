                 1       A summary of the evidence on this charge was not attempted in the substantial
                         Representations of 24* September 1998. The tfvidcnw of this charge against Mr
                         Duckenlicld i&compelling. and much stronger, it is submitted, than was presented to
                         the DPP by West Midlands Police in i 990. The lact that previous inquiries were
                         .seriously misled about this aspect by Mr Duckcntieid, South Yorkshire and West
                         Midlands policc, appears from the facts h*i out below.

                 2       Lord Taylor found, at page >6 , paragraph 98 of his Interim Report, thai Mr
                          Duckeiitictd misled Graham Kelly and Glen Kinon of the I'. A. und Graham Mackrcll
                         o f Sheffield Wednesday. at a time when he knew there were fatalities (and that there
                         would therefore be an inquest aud no doubt other forma! irujumvs). Duekcnfiekl
                         indicated that a gate had been forced and there had been an inrush of supporters, and
                         pointed out to them the gate allegedly forccd on ihc screen.

                 .>      Kelly gave this cvidencc or Day 25, page 58 and p *3. Kiru>n on Day 26. page 53.
                         Kinon's statement make* il clear that deaths had occurred fhe time of this
                         convention which .took place ill the Control Box, and that this was obvious from the
                         Control Hox. Neither was in any doubt about the cuftvetsation. Mackrcii could not
                         remember details of the conversation at the Taylor inquiry. ( A h may nc imagined,
                         neither Kelly nor Kirton was called at the Inquest.)

                 4       When Mr Dyson for the Football Association put to Duckeofield that he hud told this
                         He (25“' May, p i 12), there v*as a half-hearted admission from Duekcnfield. but a
                         denial of an intention to deceive, aild-Mr Ducfccnfield claimed u> have been in a “state
                         of shock*.

                  The. transmission o f the Ik to fhe Fire Brig/atk

                 5       Andrew Collins QC spoke in his Opening to the Taylor Inquiry on 15,h May 19X9 of a
                         record of the Fuc Brigade received at 3.14 pm;

                                 ■nhere has been a rmyor accident at Hillsborough Football ground, fhc
                                 crowds have forced their way in. They haw broken fences und the gate down,
                                 i don't know exactly what it is but there are people trapped."

                                                                      I

                  Mr Collins did not question Mr Dueker.fidd about this lie, which was not in itself, and
                  without limber information, attributable to him. However, DuckeriJlcld w:ts asked in
                  cross-examination by Mr liytner about it. He replied at plages 94-5 (same day) “i
                  have never heard of that”, and. wheti asked if he could help as io the “genesis of ihe
                  beliefs}' a police officer that there had been a breaking down of a gate by fans', said
                  “No". (95C). This wa»i a lie* its bis later admission.* in the course- of evidence

           The (ransmistsion ttf the lie to the Ambvtmce Service

           X      To Mr Kallipcti-s, representing the Ambulance Service. DuekeniicUl replied that he
                  hud asked Is,C. Bichard to call for ambulances (115D). ami thai Bichard had contacted
                  Snig lliii Police Station. Mr Kaliipetis disclosed that die ambulance service had
                  received a telephone call from Snig liiil at 15.06 pm saying, inter alia. “Apparently at
                  one off he gates they have been pushing, pushing and shoving. I understand one of
                  the *>fites has collapsed or broke." (same day. p 121 C-0 )

           9      Duckenfusld could not explain that message, but accepted that Ik had asked Hichard in
                  the Control Room to telephone Hnig Hill (121 li-F). Duckeniicld did. however. say
                  that the otiicer at Snig Hiil was Chief Inspector Edmondson (llQli). Obviously that
                  officer had relayed the message, or causod it to be relayed. u> both I'iiv and

                  apparent that Ians were said Hj have broken down a door or gale, (statement of 4lWMay

           1!     Duckeuiicld accepted the questions put by Mr Glasgow on bchal f of the club that “he
                  witliltekl the information that the decision to open the gates had been u police one
                  from “everybody on the afternoon in question * (26/5/8l>. 24F-< i> and allowed the elub

             14     Furtiicr reluctant evidence o f the lies told by Duckenfield comes from Assistant Chief
                    Constable Jackson, who said, when asked about conversations in the presence of
                     Kelly and Makrell. “I nave a feeling that somebody mentioned something about
                    storming the gates". (30/5/89, page 7 ,7A-B). “I have a feeling ii whs somebody in the
                    1Jox that said that. In feet 1think it may have been Mr Uui^enHeld*. he was able to
                    recall. Jackson said he learned the true facts only from Superintendent Marshall at
                    about 4.15 (70), Until then he believed that the supporters had forced the gate. <p46),

             15     At die Inquest, although Jackson sad that Ouckcnfield was “doing u superb job*, at
                    about 3.12pm (Day 63, page 14), he repeated that he “thought* it was Duckeniield
                    who iiad told Keliy that the gates had been “atartncd*. adding mysteriously that "in a
                    way that would be right because I think there weni two gates stormed." There is no
                    evidence to support this extraordinary assertion.

             id     On 25ll>April 1089, DS Carr reported on the internal investigation into ilic policing of
                     the march being conducted by South Yorkshire police, apparently in parallel to the
                     similar investigation allegedly being conducted by West Midlands police. !Us
                     statement* are at Annex K of ihe file of 24* September. Page ? refers :« notes of the
                     Chief Constable's Briefing with Operational Staff of lb1**. 17L'‘ and i ^ April. These
                     notes, presumably, remain in the exclusive possession of South Yorkshire Police, and
                     have not been disclosed. DuckenfiekTs uwuribution to one of these meetings is
                     recorded at the foot of page 8 , but it is concluded towards the foot of page 10 that “H
                     is not known whether it (Gufce C}was opened as a result of pressure (mm fans or in
                     response to Superintendent Marshall's earlier request, or otherwise." Ihere is a
                     strangely imprecise reference on the next page, in the context of gates in general, that
                     "In the briefing notes Chief Superintendent Duckentield and SuiKrinicndent Marshall
                     speak of an acute situation and opening gates to relieve pressure fearing loss of life “

             17      'these briefings and assertions surely intensified the need for South Yorkshire and
                     West Midlands police to record and investigate die dissemination of Duekcnficld'*
                     lies. West Midland* police appear to have left South Yorkshire almost entirely to their
                     own devices to *orfc out their approach to this thorny question.

                   the responsibility o f trying to contact Lock o f Sheffield Wednesday, (page 1 0 - 1 1 ). He
                   also told Lord Taylor that he knew when Gate A opened that a serial o f officers
                   formed a funnel to divert them from seeking to enter the stands, where entry was by
                   special ticket. There were no such arrangements for the tunnel. This important
                   evidence shows forethought about the consequences of opening t he gates,               triad?
                   the possibility o f crushing even more obvious.

         40       The prosecution will invite a court to conclude that these admissions show gross
                   negligence, causative of death; and furthermore, they will submit that they disclose a
                   wanton and perhaps angry disregard for the safety of people in the pens, when other
                  people, whom Duckenfield regarded as of the same ilk, were causing him a serious
                  problem outside the ground.

         41       If, alternatively, these facts suggest incompetence, and a very bad or crass attempt to
                   avoid an already dangerous situation, attention is drawn to R v. Bateman (1925) 10 Cr.
                   App. R. 8 , approved by the House of Lords in R v. Adomako, in which incompetence
                   in a person exercising specialised or expert functions was held capable of amounting
                   to gross negligence (in that case the defendant was a doctor)


                              Evidence against Murray on Manslaughter and Misfeasance

         42        It is submitted that the responsibility of Murray for manslaughter and misfeasance is if
                   anything greater than Duckenfield’s. The following extracts from his evidence to the
                   Taylor Inquiry and Inquest are relied on for the purposes of the present review, as
                   evidence o f these two offences.

         43      Murray had occupied the same role in 1988 and 1989 and had written a report on the
                 match afterwards, in May 1988. He had taken a leading part in policing a
                 Hillsborough game between Sheffield Wednesday and L iverpool in January 1989.
                 (Taylor Inquiry, 31/5, p 63). ( His involvement was well summarised in cross-
                 examination at 1s* June 1988, page I, by Mr Woodward: he had been involved in the
                  1998 semi-final; the review of the 1988 semi-final; and the planning and preparation
                 for the 1989 semi-final. A copy ofhis review in May 1988 of the 1988 game was read
                 out at to him at the Inquest (Day 67, page 140)).

         44      The pens were often filled up in accordance with directions from the Control Box.
                  Officers would direct fans down the tunnel. This did not apply to the semi-final,

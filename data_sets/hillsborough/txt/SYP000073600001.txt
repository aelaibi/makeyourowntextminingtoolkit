              I live at the above address with my parents and I have lived there for

              the past 21 years.


                        cl /\~r
          S   I have supported Liverpool                 since I was 9,years of age and have been a

              Season Ticket holder for the past 12 months.



              On Saturday 15th April,                  198,9 (15Q589) about a quarter past seven (0715

              h r s ) my friend,                          pi cfcre        up at my home address and we went

              by               car to Chepstow where we picked up a supporj^rs coach to

              take us to Sheffield.               We got onto the coach abouty© o ’clock              (0800

              hrs),     the coach had been hired from T h o m a s ’s Co^^ies in Rhondda. We

              stopped to pick up other supporters,                        the last Tbeing about a quarter to

              ten (0945 hrs)          in Gloucester.            I was sitting on the coach with

                                                                            k   !q £ > i   dob'ili:
        and two of our other friends.                                  and Mike KJ2LLY were sitting

        a couple of seats behind us.



        The coach travelled along the motorways and we stopped on the M1

        motorway service area, just prior to the turn off for Sheffield we

        must have stopped there for 15 minutes to half an hour.



        Just after we had continued our journey and turned off the motorway

        the coach had to stop because it was filling up with diesel fumes,                                    the

        driver checked the coach and we continued our journey,                              it would

        have been about         1.30 (1330 hrs)         in the afternoon.             We then carried on

        to the ground,        it must have been about £ o'clock                    (1400 hrs) when we

        got to the road where the coaches were being parked.                               The driver

        stopped the coach at the junctions near to Leppings Ln and m y s e l f ,

                                            and Mike KELLY got off the coach together.                         We

        all walked down towards the ground it must have been abtfut half past
                                                                ^<&G> 1  e o m l L
        ’two (1430 hrs) when we arrived. When we got off theyfcoach Mike KELLY ...

        wandered off on his own and I never saw him ag



        When we a r r i v e d at t h e t u r n s t i l e s t h e r e w a s j us t a s o l i d m a s s of

        people    and   I t e m p o r a r y lost sig ht a n d c o n t a c t w i t h P        and

        I was waiting        in the queue but it was so hot and oppressive and I was

        being crushed,        that    I ducked under the barrier and made my way to the

        side as you look at the entrance it was the right handside.                                  I jumped

        over a low wire fence,            that goes down to the river,                  to avoid the

        crush, after a few minutes, when I had recovered,                            I climbed back over

        the fence and about the same time someone opened the large concertina
OVT
        gates from the inside.              Just p r i o r A o   the gate being opened I noticed
OATfc
        a couple of Policemen apparently /alking on their radios.                                  The gate
'O'
        opened a couple of yards <|.nd was/ closed a g a i n , a few minutes later the
                                                                                         PAGE      3
                                                                                         S1786

 Q t v l£s   gate o pened again and there was/a surge of people through it, and I
   o     *
             was carried through with thar surge.        Once through the gate the crowd
C<2_o^/|)
   IN/'      dispersed but there was s/ill a large number of people just milling

             around.     I looked across towards the turnstiles and saw               and

             and one of them shouted to me,      so I made my way across to join them.

             I d i d n ’t notice any Policemen or s tewa rds .     I would add that just

             prior to opening of the gate yKe Policeman and stewards,            outside the
  CAT
             gate were arguing and the >lst of the argument was whether to open the
(jprrfc
    I
 vc          gate or n o t .   And as I went through the gate a Police Officer said,

             words to the effect,     "D on ’t run, slow down,    t h e r e ’s plenty of time".

             He was stood to my right as I went through the gate.



             With the other      two we joined the cro^d and w a l k ed down the tunnel

             towards the area behind the goal          As we got down we realised that it
 erp-Wb      was full so we      turned round, ai>6 went to the left of the stand, and

             went into the enclosed area T h e r e .    Looking to my right I could see
5 1 7
             that the central area was absolutely packed solid.            It would have been

             between five to three     (1455 hrs) and three o ’clock (1500 hrs),         because

             the players were out on the pitch, warming up.



             The neKt thing I can clearly remember was seeing a Police Officer run

             onto the pitch and speak to the referee and a couple of supporters

             also run onto the pitch.      I looked towards the goal and could see

             people spilling onto the pitch the volume gradually built up until               it

             appeared that hundreds of people were on the pitch.             I lost sight of

                      but I can remember sitting on the terrace.         At first I thought

             it was just a pitch invasion,      but after about a quarter of an hour          I

             realized that it was a lot more serious.            I cou ld n’t get on the pitch

             to help so          and I remained where we were until we were asked to

             leave.    At one time I can remember seeing              walking slowly around
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      S17S6

           on the pitch,    he appeared to be dazed.        We shouted to him but he

           d i d n ’t appear to hear us.



           When we left the ground we made our way back towards the coach.              On

           the way we were stopped by a lady who offered to let us use her phone,

           but we were unable to get through.



           We eventually made our way back to the coach and everyone was there

           except for Mike KELLY,     but this w a s n ’t unusual as he often didn't

           travel back with us because he visited his Mother          in Liverpool.



           I would like to add that there was a photographer who was only

           interested in taking photographs of the dead and injured.           He could

           have helped the Police and Emergency services          instead of hindering

           them.     In fact the Police had to escort him from the ground for his

           own safety as the fans and relatives w^rtild have seriously injured him

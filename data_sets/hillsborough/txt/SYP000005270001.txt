problem           of    big        grounds          like         Hillsborough                  or     Old      Trafford                having          to

literally              swallow           35,000        fans           in    35    minutes             through            90       turnstiles.

Many        of    the      advisors,               including               ministers,               have       no     personal

experience              of      the      problems            or       dangers          of      adding          to     the         delay       at       a

time        when       the      crowd         is   anxious             and       travel         weary          and       kick          off    time          is

10      The       quickest              simplest            solution             to    the      problem             is       to    insist          that

all     big       games         where         tickets            are       in    short         supply          should             be    played             1 iv

on     television               preferably             on        Sunday          afternoon             where          the         traffic          does

not     clash          with        shoppers,.              This        is       one    of      the     reasons               why       there       is

little           trouble           at    televised               games          from      Wembley.

on     the       ground            is    difficult                  to    recoup           unless           the      team        does        well          and       i

a    much        more        speculative                    venture.

19       While          the     Football                  Trust          does       an     excellent              job       in     helping             clubs

pay      for         ground         improvements,                        the     government                 still       takes            42%      of       the

20       Undoubtedly                    big       grounds             like       Hillsborough                  have         a    staff           with       a

            discriminate            against          away    supporters                by    often     limiting         them        to s u b ­

            standard          accommodation            at    higher          prices          than    those       charged       to     the

            I    am    sending       you    a        copy   of    the        evidence         I have       submitted          to t h e

            enquiry        into      the    tragic          events           at    Hillsborough.              I think         it is in       the

            interests          of   all    of    us    who       love    football             to    make    sure       this    is     the

            last       investigation            to    be    carried          out       and    that    from       now    on    politicians

            and       administrators            alike       can    agree          on    a    workable       solution.

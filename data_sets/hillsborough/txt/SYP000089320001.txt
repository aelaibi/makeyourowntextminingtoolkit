            supporter and am a season ticket holder.                  I attend all the home game

            and important away games.            I obtained my ticket for the semi final

            football match which was to be played at Hillsborough Sheffield

            between Liverpool and Notts Forest on Saturday 13th April                         1989

            (150489)     from Anfield ground.

            I travel 1 ed        fotKq round bn match day in a carr- d ^ v ^ r' Kw mw Kl*^ther

            i n 1aw                   also in the car w&s                         and                          We

            drove strak/ght to Sheffield without a r ^ h o l ^ ^ a n d                  arrived/at about

            11.30 am (1130),          We all had something to eat and was told that it

            would take five minutes to walk to the ground.                    At about 2.15 pm

             (1415) we started to walk to the- ground which took us longer than we

           "had been tordToStrcrtrt twenty five minutes.               I did not see any disorder
                                                                                          PAGE      2
                                                                                          S3358

              on the way to the ground everyone was walking orderly to get to the

              ground.

              On reaching the Leppings Ln end of the ground I saw a large crowd of

              people there was no queues just a mass of people all trying to get i n .

              We joined the crowd and moved towards the turnstile/s and the outer

              iron gates were being opened and closed to allowysome people through

              to the turnstiles before they were closed agayfyt         Even when it was

   o(5        opened only half was being opened.         Everytime the gates were opened

              you were being jostled as people tried to get in,

              At about five minutes to t h ree <1455) a Poli cemai/ on a horse told us
ffeuol
              to go around to a side gate which had been openyed.         He told people not
  j   p   c
              to run or rush everyone would get in.         At this

                        or     there was just myself and              We walked aroundt to a

              gate on the right hand side and walked into the ground and no
 Ga t
              checked my ticket.       There was a mass of people entering through the
Q ? T v£
              open gate.     Once   inside we were told by a Police Officer toVgo towards
CfiQvyj}
              a tunnel ahead of us into the terrace.         I went   into a tunnel and on
      IN
              looking through I could see the players on the pitch they had not

              kicked off.

              On entering the tunnel      I was pushed ail along t h^ funnel    by the large
~JDuti£L
n £ + T       crowd even if you wanted to you could not stop and go back because of
•St a m D
              the crowd,            and myself were together until we reached the end of

              the tunnel when we were separated.         I was pushed to my left f s      I left

              the tunnel and-dow«-towards the f ront of the terrace.          I wa^ pushed

              down the terrace uhtil      I got caught   in a crush barrier by /frny leg,    this

              turned me around and I was facing away from the pitch.           $ managed to

              free my leg by dragging      it out.   I was pushed a little further and

              then stopped, after this the crush got really bad to the point I

              thought    I was going to pass out.     I d i d n ’t panic and took small

              breaths this prevented me from passing out and the crush went on for
                                                                        PAGE      3
                                                                        S3358

    several minutes.     I would estimate the crush from the time I entered

    the ground to the relief to be about ten minutes,       I could hear people

    screaming down at the front.    Because of the situation I was    in I did

    not see any of the play on the pitch,    I did not see what happened on

    the pitch at all.    My arms were trapped one across my chest the other-

    down by my pelvis.     I could see one or two policemen standing on the

    perimeter fence shouting for people to move back but there was no way

    you could move because of the pressure against you from the rear.

    After about 3,15 pm (1515)   to 3.HO pm (1320)   the pressure eased off a

    little and it was after this I saw my brother in law            to my right

    I made my way towards him to see if he was alright.       I reached him and

    found out he was alright because the crowd had eased.

    As we stood together I saw a young girl being carried out by a group

I      people I am not sure if it was Policeman or Fireman.       I think she

    had blond hair but j could not describe her further because her

    clothing was disturbed and I did not look aj/y further.     She was not on

    a stretcher she was being carried bodily.

          and myself made our way back alone/ the tunnel and into the area

    at the rear of the terrace and before^the turnstiles,      the tunnel was

    clear when we made our way out.

    Someone brought us a drink which/we had I saw several bodies on the

    ground near to the exit from Xhk tunnel,    I knew the people were dead

    because they were covered ovet/.

    We saw one body lying there and the clothing was similar to

    our friend,   he was wearing blue jeans red crown paint shirt.

    Because of this I asked a young policewoman if I could see the face of

    the body and she lifted the cover off the face and I saw it was not

    my friend.    I could not describe this body,    the only thing I can

    remember the face was marked as if it had been crushed.

    We then decided to make our way back to the car and ____ and
                                                                                                             PAGE    4
                                                                                                             S335S

          were there.          On our way to the car I used a phone at a house and rang

          rny wife.

          After this we made our way home,                    leaving at about twenty past four

          (1620).          We were not interested whether the match was going on or not

          we were too sick and not interested in the game anymore.                                   On the way

          home I heard on the radio of the deaths and could not believe it.

          It appeared to me t h ^             the trouble all started really with the lack of

               control outside the/ground, when there were no proper queues just a
C 0 H K 6 J T ------------------
              mass of people allr trying to push in.  Also I do not think that the

          Police really realised for some time how bad the crush was                                   in the

          terrace.
                       f

   S '    I think I was standing              in pen four at the time of the crush but I did

          not see any fence when I came out of the tunnel.

                                 - DRAFT-
    1 INTRODUCTION

    Following an incident on 15 April 1989, staff of the Health and Safety
    Executive visited Hillsborough Football Ground on 17 April 1989 at the
    request of Mr Paul Jackson, Sheffield Environmental Health Department.
    The crush barriers in Pens 3 and 4 (central pen), at the Leppings Lane
    end of the ground, were examined and identified with a paint marker in
    accordance with a drawing supplied by Mr Jackson. On each barrier the
    support locations were numbered sequentially from left to right when
    viewed from the pitch.

    Barrier 124A appeared to have collapsed and a length of the horizontal
    tube had become detached. This detached length of tube had been found on
    the pitch in front of gate 3 in the perimeter fence at the Leppings Lane
    end on 16 April 1989 by Dr C Nicholson’ Deputy Director, Sheffield
    Laboratory, Health and Safety Executive. It was kept in a secure place
    by Club Officials and was placed in Pen 3 op 17 April 1989 so that it
    could be examined in conjunction with the rest of the barrier.

    On 24 April 1989 the damaged parts of barrier 124A, consisting of two
    lengths of tube and two supports, were removed from Pen 3, under the
    supervision of the authors of this report, and taken to the Sheffield
    Laboratory of the Health and Safety Executive for metallurgical
    assessment. The remainder of barrier 124A was removed by Mr P F Heyes
    and HSE staff on 7 July 1989.

    This report contains details of examinations performed both on site and
    in the laboratory. The work was carried out by the authors and by other
    staff of HSE working on their instruction and under their general
    supervision.

    2 ON SITE EXAMINATION

    2.1 BARRIER 124A

    Barrier 124A was located on the seventh, eighth and ninth steps of Pen 3
    adjacent to Pen 2. The overall length of this barrier before collapse
    was estimated to be 7.5m including a tube overhang of 0.6m near the
    radial fence adjacent to Pen 2. The horizontal distance from this
    barrier to the perimeter fence at the front of Pen 3 was approximately
    3.5m, and the distance of the tube end from the radial fence, separating
    Pens 2 and 3, was 28mm. There were no other barriers between barrier
    124A and the perimeter fence. A sketch of this barrier, showing our
    opinion of its appearance before the incident, is shown in Figure 1.

    The evidence suggested that, prior to the collapse, barrier 124A had
    consisted of four vertical supports with a horizontal tube between them.
    HSE staff numbered the supports 1,2,3 and 4, beginning at the end nearer
    Pen 2.




                                      -1 -
                              - DRAFT-
Each vertical support had consisted of two lengths of 52mm wide metal
angle, having a thickness of 6mm, inclined at an angle of 20 degrees to
one another. During manufacture each front support leg had been curved
near the top to form a horizontal surface and had been joined to the
rear support leg by a triangular gusset plate. The latter had been
rivetted to the two lengths of metal angle. The horizontal tube had been
made from hollow circular section metal with an outside diameter of
60mm. An inverted U-shaped strap, approximately 50mm wide, had been
bolted to the top of each support, and this was presumably intended to
retain the horizontal tube.

Figure 2 shows barrier 124A viewed from the pitch as it appeared on the
morning of 17 April 1989. The detached length of tube had a transverse
fracture at either end. One of these fractures matched the fracture on
the length of tube in contact with support 2 and the other matched the
fracture on the length of tube in contact with support 3. Hence it was
possible to locate this detached length of tube in the correct
position between supports 2 and 3. This detached length of tube had
been bent symmetrically about its mid-point where the maximum deflection
was 133mm.

Support 4, shown in the foreground of Figure 1, had been moved forward
and twisted towards the front left-hand corner of Pen 3, viewed from the
pitch. The lower portion of the front leg had remained straight,
although by comparison with the front legs of other barriers, it
appeared to have moved forward through an angle of 25 degrees
approximately. In so doing the front leg had broken away from the edge
of the concrete step in which it had been supported. Several pieces of
detached concrete were observed nearby, two of which matched the
fracture on the step, shown in Figure 3. The upper portion of the front
leg had suffered localised bending and it had been twisted inwards with
respect to the other supports on this barrier.

The rear leg of support 4 had been deformed and kinked at the lower end
near the junction with a piece of reinforcing steel angle which had been
bolted on top of the original angle section. The latter had been thinned
by corrosion in the area where this deformation had occurred. The rear
leg also exhibited localised deformation and cracking in the vicinity of
the lowest gusset plate attachment hole. The gusset plate appeared to be
relatively undeformed but had been moved inwards towards the other
supports. The tube retaining strap appeared to be intact and still in
position.

Support 3 had been deformed extensively and flattened so that it was
almost horizontal. The general direction of deformation was towards the
front left-hand corner of the pen, viewed from the pitch. At its lower
end the front leg had been deformed adjacent to a piece of reinforcing
angle, but both the latter and the surrounding concrete were
undisturbed. The rear leg had been bent forward and the majority of the
deformation had occurred at the junction with the concrete step. The
step itself was intact. The gusset plate was undeformed but it had been
torn from the upper part of the rear leg and moved forward. The strap
retaining the tube at support 3 had been straightened partially but the
tube appeared to be captive at this position. A transverse fracture of
the tube, in the vicinity of some tube wall corrosion, was visible under
the strap.

                                 - DRAFT-
    The length of tube in contact with support 3 had been bent by 200mm at
    midspan and it had a ragged fracture in a corroded region near the end
    further from support 3, i.e. the free end. The latter had presumably
    been located under the strap on support 4 before collapse occurred. The
    fracture in the tube corresponding with support 4 was partly transverse
    and partly longitudinal, the original manufactured end being deformed
    but not fractured. At some stage the tube had also been partially
    crushed at this location.

    During the visit on 17 April, a small piece of metal, roughly
    semi-circular in section, was found in Pen 3 by Dr C Nicholson amongst
    the debris near gate 3 in the perimeter fence. The fracture on this
    small piece matched that at the end of the tube corresponding to support
    4. This end of the tube had apparently moved a distance of 1.4m in the
    horizontal plane before coming to rest on the steps. In total, the
    collapsed part of barrier 124A occupied an area measuring 4m along the
    terrace and 1.6m down the terrace in Pen 3.

    Supports 1 and 2 were free from damage and the length of tube between
    them had not been deformed significantly. This length of tube contained
    two circumferential welds positioned as follows when viewed from the
    pitch side: one approximately 0.2m left from the strap on support 2; the
    other 0.05m right from the strap on support 1. The tube had fractured
    transversely under the strap on support 2 and a smaller diameter tube
    insert was observed protruding a distance of 25mm from this fracture.
    There was evidence of considerable corrosion of the original tube under
    this strap. The tube insert appeared to be approximately 150mm in total
    length. The strap on support 2 had been welded to the tube on the left
    side only. This was the only location on barrier 124A where a strap had
    been welded to the tube.

    Support 1 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to each foot and the
    rear leg had been braced by an additional piece of angle acting as an
    outrigger. Support 2 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to the
    front foot only with an outrigger on the rear leg.

    2.2 OTHER BARRIERS IN PENS 3 AND 4

    The remaining barriers in Pen 3 and those in Pen 4 were examined. The
    layout of all the barriers in Pens 3 and 4 is shown schematically in
    Figure 4. On each barrier the supports were numbered sequentially from
    left to right as viewed from the pitch. Several barriers had been
    fabricated with rectangular hollow section supports and these appeared
    to be somewhat newer than the rest. Most of the old-style barriers had
    been modified in some way, for example by reinforcing of the support
    legs and welding of the horizontal tubes. Corrosion was evident at all
    joints and intersections, and rust "jacking" had occurred at many of the
    gusset plate/support leg junctions.

    Most of the horizontal tubes on the older barriers were open-ended and
    in two cases (barrier 125 near support 1 and barrier 128 near support 1)
    holes in the tube wall, caused by corrosion under the support strap,
    were clearly visible. An example of this is shown arrowed in Figure 3
    which depicts the end of barrier 125 adjacent to barrier 124A in Pen 3.
    The hole is approximately 25mm in diameter and its centre is 60mm from
    the end of the tube.

                                 -DRAFT-
    2.3 EXCAVATION OF BARRIER 124A SUPPORTS 3 AND 4 ON 24 APRIL 1989

    It was agreed by the Inquiry that supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A could
    removed for laboratory examination. Three cylindrical cores, measuring
    0.1m in diameter and 0.4m in length, were cut from the concrete steps at
    positions specified by Mr C Pertee, a Principal Specialist Inspector in
    the Technology Division of HSE, before excavation of the supports
    commenced. These cores, from steps 7, 8 and 9, were identified by the
    letters P,Q and U respectively. After cutting, core P was found to
    contain a piece of the front foot from support 4 and core U was found to
    contain a piece of the rear foot of support 3.

    It became apparent during excavation that each support leg had been
    flattened and shaped to form a foot which had been positioned
    horizontally in the ground and bolted to a base plate. The supports were
    freed by unscrewing, or grinding off the nuts in contact with the feet
    of the supports. In all cases the boundary between the support and the
    concrete was marked using yellow paint.

    When the front foot of support 4 was exposed, considerable thinning and
    loss of metal was observed in the vicinity of the bend between the
    upright and the foot. This area was further weakened during core
    drilling and the remaining ligament of metal, approximately 5mm wide and
    0.8mm in thickness, became detached during removal of the support. Part
    of the front foot was found to be in contact with a reinforcing wire in
    the concrete and a length of this wire was removed for possible future
    examination.

    The pieces of reinforcing angle, noted previously on the rear leg of
    support 4 and the front leg of support 3, were observed to extend below
    the surface of the concrete to the bend at the  start of the foot.

    The length of tube remaining in contact with support 3 slipped out of
    the strap during lifting of the support. It was apparent that this
    length of tube had not been fixed intentionally to the strap and it had
    been held temporarily in position by accumulated rust and debris only.

    2.4 REMOVAL OF INTACT PART OF BARRIER 124A ON 7 JULY 1989

    The feet of supports 1 and 2 were excavated to a depth of 50mm
    approximately and subsequently cut using an angle grinder. This
    permitted both supports, and the length of tube between them, to be
    removed in one piece.

3.2 CONCRETE CORES

The three cores are shown schematically in Figure 6. They were taken at
different positions along the terrace but, for convenience, they are
shown here in the same plane. Core P was extracted in three pieces: a
cylindrical upper piece, approximately 85mm in length, which was
composed of an upper layer (27mm in thickness) containing relatively
fine aggregate, typically a few millimetres in section and a lower layer
(52mm in thickness) containing coarser aggregate, typically 5 -10mm in
section; an irregular shaped intermediate piece, with a maximum length
of 120mm, which contained the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in
section, and bore an impression of a section of barrier support foot; a
cylindrical lower layer, 180mm in length also containing the coarsest
aggregate (20-30mm in section)

Core Q was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
approximately 138mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer (23mm
in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a few
millimetres in section, a middle layer (65mm in thickness) containing
coarser aggregate, typically 5 -10mm in section, and lower a layer, 50mm
in thickness, of loosely bound coarse material; a lower piece, 245mm in
length containing the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in section.

                                 -DRAFT-
    Core U was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
    approximately 141mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer
    (26mm in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a
    few millimetres in section and a lower layer (115mm in thickness)
    containing coarser aggregate, typically 5 -10mm in section; a lower
    piece, 200mm in length, containing the coarsest aggregate, typically
    20-30mm in section. The lower layer contained a slice through a barrier
    support foot consisting of, in descending order, a nut, a piece of foot,
    a piece of bolt and a piece of base-plate.

    3.3 LENGTHS OF TUBE FROM BARRIER 124A

    3.3.1 Visual examination

    The two detached lengths of tube (CEN/2 and PFH/1) are shown in Figures
    7 and 8 respectively. The length of tube which had been between supports
    3 and 4 was designated "tube 3/4" by the authors and the length of tube
    which had between supports 2 and 3 was designated "tube 2/3". Each
    length measured 2.3m and had an external diameter of 60mm. The length of
    tube between supports 1 and 2 was designated "tube 1/2" and its overall
    length was approximately 3m. The outside diameter of this tube was 60mm.

    Bottom dead centre of tube 2/3 and 3/4 was located by examination of
    paint runs and an accumulation of dried paint. It was deduced that both
    lengths of tube had been deformed towards the pitch in a horizontal
    plane.

    Visual examination of the fractures indicated that in general the
    failure of the tube had occurred in a fibrous, ductile manner. On the
    two matching fractures which had been coincident with support 3 there
    was however a region of bright crystalline fracture, shown arrowed in
    Figure 9, consistent with a more brittle failure mode. This crystalline
    fracture had occurred where the remaining wall thickness of the tube was
    at a maximum.

    In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
    iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode.
    Fracture of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on
    the uphill side of the barrier at a position at right angles to top
    dead centre. The other tube fractures had suffered some post-failure
    damage and the origins were not readily identifiable.

    At all the fracture positions much of the wall thickness of the tube had
    been reduced, mainly by external corrosion. The corrosion had occurred
    under the locating straps in areas, approximately 65mm wide, which were
    unpainted. The end of the tube at the position of support 4 had been
    open to the environment and additional corrosion at the internal surface
    of the tube had occurred. This had resulted in the formation of two
    holes through the wall approximately 10 and 20 mm in diameter under the
    strap. One of these holes, shown arrowed in Figure 10, appeared to have
    initiated the fracture and led to the detachment of the small piece of
    tube (arrowed in Figure 11) found on the steps, item CEN/1. These holes
    were location at the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions and thei^ centres
    would have been approximately 50mm from the open end of the tube at
    support 4 before failure.

The extent of corrosion of tube 1/2 under the strap at support 2 was
disclosed when the strap was removed (Figure 12). Tube 1/2 was removed
subsequently from supports 1 and 2 to permit closer examination. This
revealed that two pieces of tube had been joined beneath support 2 by a
part circumferential weld which also served to join the strap to the
tube at this support. A 150mm long tubular insert (arrowed in Figure
12), with an outside diameter of 49mm and a wall thickness of 5mm, was
located inside the main tube at a position corresponding with support 2.
This reinforcement was retained by means of a tack weld on the inside of
the main tube between support 2 and the adjacent circumferential weld in
the main tube, which had been noted on site. Hence, neglecting the
insert, the tube between supports 1 and 2 apparently consisted of three
pieces joined by: a circumferential near support 1; a circumferential
weld near support 2; a part circumferential weld beneath support 2.

An oval hole, shown in Figure 13 and measuring 35 x 15mm, was revealed
in the tube under the strap on support 1, at the 4 o'clock position when
viewed from the end nearer support 1. This hole had apparently been
formed by external corrosion of the tube under the strap.

A rolled-up newspaper was found inside tube 2/3. This was part of a copy
of the "Yorkshire Telegraph & Star", dated Saturday 24 October 1931. A
piece of another newpaper, "The Star" dated Saturday 26 September 1959,
was found in tube 1/2. Various other items of debris were found
elsewhere in the lengths of tube.

3.3.2 Tube wall thickness measurements

The wall thickness of the tube at the fracture positions was measured at
various locations around the circumference. The thickness range recorded
at each fracture is shown below:

Support 2       0.4 to 4.4   mm

Support 3       1.6 to 4.5   mm

Support 4       1.1 to 4.5   mm (ignoringthe edges   of the   holes)

Measurements taken along the lengths of tube using anultrasonic
instrument showed that the wall thickness remote from the fractures was
in the range 3.2 to 4.9 mm. Corrosion was confined to regions about
70-75mm wide, centred on the support straps, and there were no areas of
pronounced thinning elsewhere. The ultrasonic thickness reading was
5.0mm throughout the length of tube between the circumferential welds on
tube 1/2.

3.3.3 Microstructural examination

A transverse ring section was cut from tube 3/4 at a distance of 65mm
from the fracture corresponding to support 3. Microexamination showed
that the tube had been manufactured from wrought iron and that it
contained a longitudinal, forged lap weld.

A microsection of a sample of paint removed from a similar position
showed that the paint consisted of 13 coats plus an initial metal loaded
primer coat. The total thickness of these coats was approximately 0.5 mm.

                               -DRAFT-
Various microsections from tube 1/2 indicated that this length of tube
consisted of both wrought iron and low carbon steel as follows: the
length between the end nearer Pen 2 and the circumferential weld near
support 1 was wrought iron; the length between the circumferential welds
was low carbon steel; the length between the circumferential weld near
support 2 and the part circumferential weld beneath the strap on support
2 was low carbon steel; the length between the part circumferential
beneath the strap on support 2 and the fracture was wrought iron.

3.3.4 Tensile tests

Two longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T343/1 and T343/2,
were machined from tube 3/4 near the end corresponding to support 3. Two
further longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T1221 and T1222,
were machined from the central portion (low carbon steel) of tube 1/2.
In order to minimize the effects of previous work hardening, all test
pieces were taken as near as possible to what would have been the
neutral axis during bending.

These test pieces were tested in accordance with BS 18:1987 "Method for
tensile testing of metals (including aerospace materials)", and the
following results were obtained:

None of these test pieces exhibited a yield phenomenon.

3.3.5 Hardness testing

Hardness tests were carried out on the ring microsection from tube 3/4
and on the microsections from tube 1/2 in accordance with BS 427:Part
1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers hardness test: Testing of metals". The
following results were obtained:

Tube 3/4,   wrought iron                 142   - 145   HV 10

Tube 1/2,   low carbon steel             146   - 152   HV 10

3.4 SUPPORTS FROM BARRIER 124A

3.4.1 Visual examination

Supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed. Supports 3 and 4 are shown after
excavation in Figures 14 and 15 respectively. Although the extent of the
deformation of supports 3 and 4 was noted on site (see section 2.1 of
this report), a number of additional features became apparent in the
laboratory.

The legs of supports 3 and 4 had been corroded, particularly at the
junctions with the concrete step and/or additional reinforcing angles.
At these locations the residual thickness was in the range 3.1mm to
5.9mm, compared with a nominal thickness of 6.3mm elsewhere. A
considerable amount of metal had been lost by corrosion from the
sub-surface region of the supports. For example, on the rear leg of
support 4, a ligament of metal 8mm wide and 2mm in thickness was all
that remained of the original nominal 50 x 50mm angle section at a
distance of 150mm below the surface.

The front leg of support 3 and the rear leg of support 4 had been
reinforced with additional sections of steel angle. Both these
reinforcements spanned areas of corrosion on the sub-surface region of
the supports. In general on the collapsed supports, the most severe
sub-surface corrosion was located at a distance which varied from 50mm
to 170mm below the surface depending on which step the barrier had been
located.

3.4.2 Dimensions

In general, the width of the steel angle from which the support legs had
been made was in the range 49 - 52mm and the thickness remote from
corroded regions was in the range 6.0 - 7.4 mm. In some above surface
regions of supports 3 and 4 the thickness of the angle had been reduced
by corrosion and buckling had occurred during collapse. This can been
seen in Figures 14 and 15 in which the thickness of the angle at the
positions indicated was:

           Support 3       (a)            4.6   to 5.9 mm
                           (b)            5.9   mm
           Support 4       (c)            1.5   mm
                           (d)            5.6   to 5.8 mm

The thickness of the steel angle in the sub-surface regions of supports
3 and 4 varied from zero, where through-thickness corrosion had
occurred, to 6.4mm.

3.4.3 Microexamination

Microsections were cut and prepared for examination from each of the
legs on supports 3 and 4 only. The following microstructures were
observed:

    Support 3   Front leg - 100% ferrite
                Rear leg - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.

                                      - DRAFT-
    Support 4   Both legs - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.

These microstructures were typical of low carbon or rimming steel.

3.4.4 Tensile tests

One tensile test piece was machined from each leg of support 3. The test
pieces were identified FL3 and RL3 and were tested in accordance with BS
18:1987 " Method for tensile testing of metals (including aerospace
materials)", and the following results were obtained:

                         ReH                    Rm   A%

    FL3                267 MPa           343 MPa     32
                       17.3 tsi           22.2 tsi

    RL3                308 MPa           376 MPa     31
                       19.9 tsi           24.3 tsi

Both test pieces exhibited yield phenomenon and hence the upper yield
stress (ReH) was determined.

3.4.5 Hardness tests

Vickers hardness tests were carried out on the microsections taken from
the support legs. These tests were conducted in accordance with BS 427:
Part 1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers Hardness Test - Testing of
metals" and the following results were obtained:


    Support 3   Front leg   105        - 109 HV
                Rear leg    113        - 125 HV

    Support 4   Front leg   112        - 140 HV
                Rear leg    121        - 141 HV

These results are typical of low carbon steel.

4 ASSESSMENT

Barrier 124A had consisted originally of a horizontal tube and four
vertical supports. The barrier had failed apparently by partial collapse
and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the horizontal tube
at supports 2, 3 and 4. The length of tube which had been located
between supports 2 and 3 (tube 2/3) had been bent uniformly to give a
maximum permanent deflection of 133mm at midspan. The portion of the
tube which been located between supports 3 and 4 (tube 3/4) had been
bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
midspan. Tubes 2/3 and 3/4 had been deformed in a horizontal plane
towards the pitch. Tube 1/2 and supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed.

Laboratory examination showed that most of the tube had been made from
wrought iron and each support had been made from two lengths of steel
angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset plate.  Part of the
original wrought iron tube between supports 1 and 2 had been replaced at
some time by a 2m length of low carbon steel. In addition, the tube had




                                  -     / Q -
                             - DRAFT-
been strengthened at support 2 by insertion of a internal tubular
reinforcement. Thus tube 1/2 was probably stronger than the rest of the
tube and this may, in part, explain the lack of deformation in this
region. In addition, supports 1 and 2 had been strengthened by
reinforcement with angle section at three of the four feet and by
bracing of the rear legs with outriggers.

The tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under
the metal straps designed, presumably, to retain the tube. The tube wall
thickness, nominally 4.5mm, had been reduced significantly by external
corrosion under each strap. In some cases holes had been present in the
tube at these locations before collapse occurred. Corrosion here
appeared to be a highly localised phenomenon which was confined to a
distance of 30mm to 35mm either side of the centreline of the strap.

In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of ductile
failure of wrought iron in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. The
region of brittle fracture, noted in the tube near support 3, was the
last part of the tube to fracture at this location. The change in
fracture mode can be explained in terms of increased constraint as the
fracture entered thicker material and an increase in strain rate as the
fracture propagated round the tube. Both these factors would tend to
promote brittle fracture.

Corrosion at the tube/support junctions was predictable because liquid
would have been retained in crevices under the strap and the surface of
the tube under the strap had not been painted. At the open end of the
tube, near support 4, internal corrosion had also contributed to
deterioration of the tube since there was access for rainwater. Here the
tube wall had been perforated by corrosion under the strap at two
locations producing holes which we estimate would have been
approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before the collapse. The centres
of these holes would have been located approximately 50mm from the open
end of the tube at support 4. They would have resembled the hole in the
tube on barrier 125 (Figure 3) and, in our opinion, they would have been
readily visible to the naked eye.

The direction of collapse of supports 3 and 4 appeared to be towards the
front left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch. For the most
part the supports had been buckled and bent at locations which had been
weakened by corrosion. Although there was considerable sub-surface
corrosion of these supports, this played no part in the collapse. The
concrete which broke away at the front foot of support 4 did so because
this support had been positioned along the riser of a step in the
terrace.

In all cases the most severe sub-surface corrosion on the feet of
supports 3 and 4 had been located near the lower end of the region of
concrete containing the coarser aggregate. One possible explanation for
this could be that the height of the terrace had been raised at some
stage and the sub-surface corrosion may have occurred at or near the
original junction between the support feet and the terrace. This would
have reduced the effective height of the barriers.

    The use of wrought iron tube, and the method of tube fabrication,
    suggests that barrier 124A was many years old. British Standards
    governing the use of wrought iron tube were in use in the 1920s and
    1930s but are now obsolescent. The discovery of dated sections of
    newspaper in the tube indicates that parts of barrier 124A were at least
    58 years old, although clearly this barrier had received several
    modifications during its lifetime.

    5 CONCLUSIONS

    5.1 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had been made from
    wrought iron.

    5.2 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had fractured at
    supports 2, 3 and 4 in regions where considerable localised corrosion
    had occurred.

    5.3 The legs of supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A had been made from low
    carbon steel angle section which had been corroded in some areas.

    5.4 Two other barriers in Pens 3 and 4 contained tubes which had been
    perforated by corrosion at support locations.

    In our opinion,

    5.5 The general direction of collapse of barrier 124A was towards the
    lower left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch.

    5.6 Two holes, caused by corrosion, had been present in the tube of
    barrier 124A at the junction with support 4 before the collapse
    occurred and these would have been visible to the naked eye.

1 INTRODUCTION

Following an incident on 15 April 1989, staff of the Health and Safety
Executive visited Hillsborough Football Ground on 17 April 1989 at the
request of Mr Paul Jackson, Sheffield Environmental Health Department.
The crush barriers in Pens 3 and 4 (central pen), at the Leppings Lane
end of the ground, were examined and identified with a paint marker in
accordance with a drawing supplied by Mr Jackson. On each barrier the
support locations were numbered sequentially from left to right when
viewed from the pitch.

Barrier 124A appeared to have collapsed and a length of the horizontal
tube had become detached. This detached length of tube had been found on
the pitch in front of gate 3 in the perimeter fence at the Leppings Lane
end on 16 April 1989 by Dr C Nicholson, Deputy Director, Sheffield
Laboratory, Health and Safety Executive. It was kept in a secure place
by Club Officials and was placed in Pen 3 op 17 April 1989 so that it
could be examined in conjunction with the rest of the barrier.

On 24 April 1989 the damaged parts of barrier 124A, consisting of two
lengths of tube and two supports, were removed from Pen 3, under the
supervision of the authors of this report, and taken to the Sheffield
Laboratory of the Health and Safety Executive for metallurgical
assessment. The remainder of barrier 124A was removed by Mr P F Heyes
and HSE staff on 7 July 1989.

This report contains details of examinations performed both on site and
in the laboratory. The work was carried out by the authors and by other
staff of HSE working on their instruction and under their general
supervision.

2 ON SITE EXAMINATION

2.1 BARRIER 124A

Barrier 124A was located on the seventh, eighth and ninth steps of Pen 3
adjacent to Pen 2. The overall length of this barrier before collapse
was estimated to be 7.5m including a tube overhang of 0.6m near the
radial fence adjacent to Pen 2. The horizontal distance from this
barrier to the perimeter fence at the front of Pen 3 was approximately
3.5m, and the distance of the tube end from the radial fence, separating
Pens 2 and 3, was 28mm. There were no other barriers between barrier
124A and the perimeter fence. A sketch of this barrier, showing our
opinion of its appearance before the incident, is shown in Figure 1.

The evidence suggested that, prior to the collapse, barrier 124A had
consisted of four vertical supports with a horizontal tube between them.
HSE staff numbered the supports 1,2,3 and 4, beginning at the end nearer
Pen 2.
                              - DRAFT-
Each vertical support had consisted of two lengths of 52mm wide metal
angle, having a thickness of 6mm, inclined at an angle of 20 degrees to
one another. During manufacture each front support leg had been curved
near the top to form a horizontal surface and had been joined to the
rear support leg by a triangular gusset plate. The latter had been
rivetted to the two lengths of metal angle. The horizontal tube had been
made from hollow circular section metal with an outside diameter of
60mm. An inverted U-shaped strap, approximately 50mm wide, had been
bolted to the top of each support, and this was presumably intended to
retain the horizontal tube.

Figure 2 shows barrier 124A viewed from the pitch as it appeared on the
morning of 17 April 1989. The detached length of tube had a transverse
fracture at either end. One of these fractures matched the fracture on
the length of tube in contact with support 2 and the other matched the
fracture on the length of tube in contact with support 3. Hence it was
possible to locate this detached length of tube in the correct
position between supports 2 and 3. This detached length of tube had
been bent symmetrically about its mid-point where the maximum deflection
was 133mm.

Support 4, shown in the foreground of Figure 1, had been moved forward
and twisted towards the front left-hand corner of Pen 3, viewed from the
pitch. The lower portion of the front leg had remained straight,
although by comparison with the front legs of other barriers, it
appeared to have moved forward through an angle of 25 degrees
approximately. In so doing the front leg had broken away from the edge
of the concrete step in which it had been supported. Several pieces of
detached concrete were observed nearby, two of which matched the
fracture on the step, shown in Figure 3. The upper portion of the front
leg had suffered localised bending and it had been twisted inwards with
respect to the other supports on this barrier.

The rear leg of support 4 had been deformed and kinked at the lower end
near the junction with a piece of reinforcing steel angle which had been
bolted on top of the original angle section. The latter had been thinned
by corrosion in the area where this deformation had occurred. The rear
leg also exhibited localised deformation and cracking in the vicinity of
the lowest gusset plate attachment hole. The gusset plate appeared to be
relatively undeformed but had been moved inwards towards the other
supports. The tube retaining strap appeared to be intact and still in
position.

Support 3 had been deformed extensively and flattened so that it was
almost horizontal. The general direction of deformation was towards the
front left-hand corner of the pen, viewed from the pitch. At its lower
end the front leg had been deformed adjacent to a piece of reinforcing
angle, but both the latter and the surrounding concrete were
undisturbed. The rear leg had been bent forward and the majority of the
deformation had occurred at the junction with the concrete step. The
step itself was intact. The gusset plate was undeformed but it had been
torn from the upper part of the rear leg and moved forward. The strap
retaining the tube at support 3 had been straightened partially but the
tube appeared to be captive at this position. A transverse fracture of
the tube, in the vicinity of some tube wall corrosion, was visible under
the strap.
                             - DRAFT-
The length of tube in contact with support 3 had been bent by 200mm at
midspan and it had a ragged fracture in a corroded region near the end
further from support 3, i.e. the free end. The latter had presumably
been located under the strap on support 4 before collapse occurred. The
fracture in the tube corresponding with support 4 was partly transverse
and partly longitudinal, the original manufactured end being deformed
but not fractured. At some stage the tube had also been partially
crushed at this location.

During the visit on 17 April, a small piece of metal, roughly
semi-circular in section, was found in Pen 3 by Dr C Nicholson amongst
the debris near gate 3 in the perimeter fence. The fracture on this
small piece matched that at the end of the tube corresponding to support
4. This end of the tube had apparently moved a distance of 1.4m in the
horizontal plane before coming to rest on the steps. In total, the
collapsed part of barrier 124A occupied an area measuring 4m along the
terrace and 1.6m down the terrace in Pen 3.

Supports 1 and 2 were free from damage and the length of tube between
them had not been deformed significantly. This length of tube contained
two circumferential welds positioned as follows when viewed from the
pitch side: one approximately 0.2m left from the strap on support 2; the
other 0.05m right from the strap on support 1. The tube had fractured
transversely under the strap on support 2 and a smaller diameter tube
insert was observed protruding a distance of 25mm from this fracture.
There was evidence of considerable corrosion of the original tube under
this strap. The tube insert appeared to be approximately 150mm in total
length. The strap on support 2 had been welded to the tube on the left
side only. This was the only location on barrier 124A where a strap had
been welded to the tube.

Support 1 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to each foot and the
rear leg had been braced by an additional piece of angle acting as an
outrigger. Support 2 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to the
front foot only with an outrigger on the rear leg.

2.2 OTHER BARRIERS IN PENS 3 AND 4

The remaining barriers in Pen 3 and those in Pen 4 were examined. The
layout of all the barriers in Pens 3 and 4 is shown schematically in
Figure 4. On each barrier the supports were numbered sequentially from
left to right as viewed from the pitch. Several barriers had been
fabricated with rectangular hollow section supports and these appeared
to be somewhat newer than the rest. Most of the old-style barriers had
been modified in some way, for example by reinforcing of the support
legs and welding of the horizontal tubes. Corrosion was evident at all
joints and intersections, and rust "jacking" had occurred at many of the
gusset plate/support leg junctions.

Most of the horizontal tubes on the older barriers were open-ended and
in two cases (barrier 125 near support 1 and barrier 128 near support 1)
holes in the tube wall, caused by corrosion under the support strap,
were clearly visible. An example of this is shown arrowed in Figure 3^2?
which depicts the end of barrier 125 adjacent to barrier 124A in Pen 3.
The hole is approximately 25mm in diameter and its centre is 60mm from
the end of the tube.

         2.3 EXCAVATION OF BARRIER 124A SUPPORTS 3 AND 4 ON 24 APRIL 1989

         It was agreed by the Inquiry that supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A could
         removed for laboratory examination. Three cylindrical cores, measuring
         0.1m in diameter and 0.4m in length, were cut from the concrete steps at
         positions specified by Mr C Pertee, a Principal Specialist Inspector in
         the Technology Division of HSE, before excavation of the supports
         commenced. These cores, from steps 7, 8 and 9, were identified by the
         letters P,Q and U respectively. After cutting, core P was found to
         contain a piece of the front foot from support 4 and core U was found to
         contain a piece of the rear foot of support 3.

         It became apparent during excavation that each support leg had been
         flattened and shaped to form a foot which had been positioned
         horizontally in the ground and bolted to a base plate. The supports were
         freed by unscrewing, or grinding off the nuts in contact with the feet
         of the supports. In all cases the boundary between the support and the
         concrete was marked using yellow paint.

         When the front foot of support 4 was exposed, considerable thinning and
         loss of metal was observed in the vicinity of the bend between the
         upright and the foot. This area was further weakened during core
         drilling and the remaining ligament of metal, approximately 5mm wide and
         0.8mm in thickness, became detached during removal of the support. Part
         of the front foot was found to be in contact with a reinforcing wire in
         the concrete and a length of this wire was removed for possible future
         examination.

          The pieces of reinforcing angle, noted previously on the rear leg of
          support 4 and the front leg of support 3, were observed to extend below
          the surface of the concrete to the bend at the start of the foot.

         The length of tube remaining in contact with support 3 slipped out of
         the strap during lifting of the support. It was apparent that this
         length of tube had not been fixed intentionally to the strap and it had
         been held temporarily in position by accumulated rust and debris only.

          2.4 REMOVAL OF INTACT PART OF BARRIER 124A ON 7 JULY 1989

         The feet of supports 1 and 2 were excavated to a depth of 50mm
         approximately and subsequently cut using an angle grinder. This
         permitted both supports, and the length of tube between them, to be
         removed in one piece.

Core U was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
approximately 141mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer
(26mm in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a
few millimetres in section and a lower layer (115mm in thickness)
containing coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in section; a lower
piece, 200mm in length, containing the coarsest aggregate, typically
20-30mm in section. The lower layer contained a slice through a barrier
support foot consisting of, in descending order, a nut, a piece of foot,
a piece of bolt and a piece of base-plate.

3.3 LENGTHS OF TUBE FROM BARRIER 124A

3.3.1 Visual examination

The two detached lengths of tube (CEN/2 and PFH/1) are shown in Figures
7 and 8 respectively. The length of tube which had been between supports
3 and 4 was designated "tube 3/4" by the authors and the length of tube
which had between supports 2 and 3 was designated "tube 2/3". Each
length measured 2.3m and had an external diameter of 60mm. The length of
tube between supports 1 and 2 was designated "tube 1/2" and its overall
length was approximately 3m. The outside diameter of this tube was 60mm.

Bottom dead centre of tube 2/3 and 3/4 was located by examination of
paint runs and an accumulation of dried paint. It was deduced that both
lengths of tube had been deformed towards the pitch in a horizontal
plane.

Visual examination of the fractures indicated that in general the
failure of the tube had occurred in a fibrous, ductile manner. On the
two matching fractures which had been coincident with support 3 there
was however a region of bright crystalline fracture, shown arrowed in
Figure 9, consistent with a more brittle failure mode. This crystalline
fracture had occurred where the remaining wall thickness of the tube was
at a maximum.

In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode.
Fracture of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on
the uphill side of the barrier at a position at right angles to top
dead centre. The other tube fractures had suffered some post-failure
damage and the origins were not readily identifiable.

At all the fracture positions much of the wall thickness of the tube had
been reduced, mainly by external corrosion. The corrosion had occurred
under the locating straps in areas, approximately 65mm wide, which were
unpainted. The end of the tube at the position of support 4 had been
open to the environment and additional corrosion at the internal surface
of the tube had occurred. This had resulted in the formation of two
holes through the wall approximately 10 and 20 mm in diameter under the
strap. One of these holes, shown arrowed in Figure 10, appeared to have
initiated the fracture and led to the detachment of the small piece of
tube (arrowed in Figure 11) found on the steps, item CEN/1. These holes
were location at the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions and their centres
would have been approximately 50mm from the open end of the tube at
support 4 before failure.

The extent of corrosion of tube 1/2 under the strap at support 2 was
disclosed when the strap was removed (Figure 12). Tube 1/2 was removed
subsequently from supports 1 and 2 to permit closer examination. This
revealed that two pieces of tube had been joined beneath support 2 by a
part circumferential weld which also served to join the strap to the
tube at this support. A 150mm long tubular insert (arrowed in Figure
12), with an outside diameter of 49mm and a wall thickness of 5mm, was
located inside the main tube at a position corresponding with support 2.
This reinforcement was retained by means of a tack weld on the inside of
the main tube between support 2 and the adjacent circumferential weld in
the main tube, which had been noted on site. Hence, neglecting the
insert, the tube between supports 1 and 2 apparently consisted of three
pieces joined by: a circumferential near support 1; a circumferential
weld near support 2; a part circumferential weld beneath support 2.

An oval hole, shown in Figure 13 and measuring 35 x 15mm, was revealed
in the tube under the strap on support 1, at the 4 o'clock position when
viewed from the end nearer support 1. This hole had apparently been
formed by external corrosion of the tube under the strap.

A rolled-up newspaper was found inside tube 2/3. This was part of a copy
of the "Yorkshire Telegraph & Star", dated Saturday 24 October 1931. A
piece of another newpaper, "The Star" dated Saturday 26 September 1959,
was found in tube 1/2. Various other items of debris were found
elsewhere in the lengths of tube.

3.3.2 Tube wall thickness measurements

The wall thickness of the tube at the fracture positions was measured at
various locations around the circumference. The thickness range recorded
at each fracture is shown below:

Support 2       0.4 to 4.4 mm

Support 3       1.6 to 4.5 mm

Support 4       1.1 to 4.5   mm (ignoringthe edges of the   holes)

Measurements taken along the lengths of tubeusing an ultrasonic
instrument showed that the wall thickness remote from the fractures was
in the range 3.2 to 4.9 mm. Corrosion was confined to regions about
70-75mm wide, centred on the support straps, and there were no areas of
pronounced thinning elsewhere. The ultrasonic thickness reading was
5.0mm throughout the length of tube between the circumferential welds on
tube 1/2.

3.3.3 Microstructural examination

A transverse ring section was cut from tube 3/4 at a distance of 65mm
from the fracture corresponding to support 3. Microexamination showed
that the tube had been manufactured from wrought iron and that it
contained a longitudinal, forged lap weld.

A microsection of a sample of paint removed from a similar position
showed that the paint consisted of 13 coats plus an initial metal loaded
primer coat. The total thickness of these coats was approximately 0.5 mm.

    Various microsections from tube 1/2 indicated that this length of tube
    consisted of both wrought iron and low carbon steel as follows: the
    length between the end nearer Pen 2 and the circumferential weld near
    support 1 was wrought iron; the length between the circumferential welds
    was low carbon steel; the length between the circumferential weld near
    support 2 and the part circumferential weld beneath the strap on support
    2 was low carbon steel; the length between the part circumferential
    beneath the strap on support 2 and the fracture was wrought iron.

    3.3.4 Tensile tests

    Two longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T343/1 and T343/2,
    were machined from tube 3/4 near the end corresponding to support 3. Two
    further longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T1221 and T1222,
    were machined from the central portion (low carbon steel) of tube 1/2.
    In order to minimize the effects of previous work hardening, all test
    pieces were taken as near as possible to what would have been the
    neutral axis during bending.

    These test pieces were tested in accordance with BS 18:1987 "Method for
    tensile testing of metals (including aerospace materials)", and the
    following results were obtained:

    None of these test pieces exhibited a yield phenomenon.

    3.3.5 Hardness testing

    Hardness tests were carried out on the ring microsection from tube 3/4
    and on the microsections from tube 1/2 in accordance with BS 427:Part
    1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers hardness test: Testing of metals". The
    following results were obtained:

    Tube 3/4, wrought iron                     142 - 145 HV 10

    Tube 1/2, low carbon steel                 146 - 152 HV 10

    Tube 1/2, weld metal at support 2          161 - 171 HV 10

3.4 SUPPORTS FROM BARRIER 124A

3.4.1 Visual examination

Supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed. Supports 3 and 4 are shown after
excavation in Figures 14 and 15 respectively. Although the extent of the
deformation of supports 3 and 4 was noted on site (see section 2.1 of
this report), a number of additional features became apparent in the
laboratory.

The legs of supports 3 and 4 had been corroded, particularly at the
junctions with the concrete step and/or additional reinforcing angles.
At these locations the residual thickness was in the range 3.1mm to
5.9mm, compared with a nominal thickness of 6.3mm elsewhere. A
considerable amount of metal had been lost by corrosion from the
sub-surface region of the supports. For example, on the rear leg of
support 4, a ligament of metal 8mm wide and 2mm in thickness was all
that remained of the original nominal 50 x 50mm angle section at a
distance of 150mm below the surface.

The front leg of support 3 and the rear leg of support 4 had been
reinforced with additional sections of steel angle. Both these
reinforcements spanned areas of corrosion on the sub-surface region of
the supports. In general on the collapsed supports, the most severe
sub-surface corrosion was located at a distance which varied from 50mm
to 170mm below the surface depending on which step the barrier had been
located.

3.4.2 Dimensions

In general, the width of the steel angle from which the support legs had
been made was in the range 49 - 52mm and the thickness remote from
corroded regions was in the range 6.0 - 7.4 mm. In some above surface
regions of supports 3 and 4 the thickness of the angle had been reduced
by corrosion and buckling had occurred during collapse. This can been
seen in Figures 14 and 15 in which the thickness of the angle at the
positions indicated was:

           Support 3       (a)            4.6   to 5.9 mm
                           (b)            5.9   mm
           Support 4       (c)            1.5   mm
                           (d)            5.6   to 5.8 mm

The thickness of the steel angle in the sub-surface regions of supports
3 and 4 varied from zero, where through-thickness corrosion had
occurred, to 6.4mm.

3.4.3 Microexamination

Microsections were cut and prepared for examination from each of the
legs on supports 3 and 4 only. The following microstructures were
observed:

    Support 3   Front leg - 100% ferrite
                Rear leg - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.

    Support 4   Both legs - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.

These microstructures were typical of low carbon or rimming steel.

3.4.4 Tensile tests

One tensile test piece was machined from each leg of support 3. The test
pieces were identified FL3 and RL3 and were tested in accordance with BS
18:1987 " Method for tensile testing of metals (including aerospace
materials)", and the following results were obtained:

                         ReH              Rm     A%

    FL3                267 MPa       343 MPa     32
                       17.3 tsi       22.2 tsi

    RL3                308 MPa       376 MPa     31
                       19.9 tsi       24.3 tsi

Both test pieces exhibited yield phenomenon and hence the upper yield
stress (ReH) was determined.

3.4.5 Hardness tests

Vickers hardness tests were carried out on the microsections taken from
the support legs. These tests were conducted in accordance with BS 427:
Part 1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers Hardness Test - Testing of
metals" and the following results were obtained:


    Support 3    Front leg     105 - 109 HV
                 Rear leg      113 - 125 HV

    Support 4    Front leg     112 - 140 HV
                 Rear leg      121 - 141 HV

These results are typical of low carbon steel.

4 ASSESSMENT

Barrier 124A had consisted originally of a horizontal tube and four
vertical supports. The barrier had failed apparently by partial collapse
and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the horizontal tube
at supports 2, 3 and 4. The length of tube which had been located
between supports 2 and 3 (tube 2/3) had been bent uniformly to give a
maximum permanent deflection of 133mm at midspan. The portion of the
tube which been located between supports 3 and 4 (tube 3/4) had been
bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
midspan. Tubes 2/3 and 3/4 had been deformed in a horizontal plane
towards the pitch. Tube 1/2 and supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed.

Laboratory examination showed that most of the tube had been made from
wrought iron and each support had been made from two lengths of steel
angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset plate.  Part of the
original wrought iron tube between supports 1 and 2 had been replaced at
some time by a 2m length of low carbon steel. In addition, the tube had




                                   /Q -
                              - DRAFT-
 been strengthened at support 2 by insertion of a internal tubular
 reinforcement. Thus tube 1/2 was probably stronger than the rest of the
 tube and this may, in part, explain the lack of deformation in this
 region. In addition, supports 1 and 2 had been strengthened by
 reinforcement with angle section at three of the four feet and by
 bracing of the rear legs with outriggers.

 The tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under
 the metal straps designed, presumably, to retain the tube. The tube wall
 thickness, nominally 4.5mm, had been reduced significantly by external
 corrosion under each strap. In some cases holes had been present in the
 tube at these locations before collapse occurred. Corrosion here
 appeared to be a highly localised phenomenon which was confined to a
 distance of 30mm to 35mm either side of the centreline of the strap.

 In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of ductile
 failure of wrought iron in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. The
 region of brittle fracture, noted in the tube near support 3, was the
 last part of the tube to fracture at this location. The change in
 fracture mode can be explained in terms of increased constraint as the
 fracture entered thicker material and an increase in strain rate as the
 fracture propagated round the tube. Both these factors would tend to
 promote brittle fracture.

  Corrosion at the tube/support junctions was predictable because liquid
  would have been retained in crevices under the strap and the surface of
  the tube under the strap had not been painted. At the open end of the
  tube, near support 4, internal corrosion had also contributed to
  deterioration of the tube since there was access for rainwater. Here the
  tube wall had been perforated by corrosion under the strap at two
  locations producing holes which we estimate would have been
  approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before the collapse. The centres
  of these holes would have been located approximately 50mm from the open
  end of the tube at support 4. They would have resembled the hole in the
' tube on barrier 125 (Figure 3) and, in our opinion, they would have been
  readily visible to the naked eye.

 The direction of collapse of supports 3 and 4 appeared to be towards the
 front left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch. For the most
 part the supports had been buckled and bent at locations which had been
 weakened by corrosion. Although there was considerable sub-surface
 corrosion of these supports, this played no part in the collapse. The
 concrete which broke away at the front foot of support 4 did so because
 this support had been positioned along the riser of a step in the
 terrace.

 In all cases the most severe sub-surface corrosion on the feet of
 supports 3 and 4 had been located near the lower end of the region of
 concrete containing the coarser aggregate. One possible explanation for
 this could be that the height of the terrace had been raised at some
 stage and the sub-surface corrosion may have occurred at or near the
 original junction between the support feet and the terrace. This would
 have reduced the effective height of the barriers.

                              -DRAFT-
The use of wrought iron tube, and the method of tube fabrication,
suggests that barrier 124A was many years old. British Standards
governing the use of wrought iron tube were in use in the 1920s and
1930s but are now obsolescent. The discovery of dated sections of
newspaper in the tube indicates that parts of barrier 124A were at least
58 years old, although clearly this barrier had received several
modifications during its lifetime.

5 CONCLUSIONS

5.1 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had been made from
wrought iron.

5.2 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had fractured at
supports 2, 3 and 4 in regions where considerable localised corrosion
had occurred.

5.3 The legs of supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A had been made from low
carbon steel angle section which had been corroded in some areas.

5.4 Two other barriers in Pens 3 and 4 contained tubes which had been
perforated by corrosion at support locations.

In our opinion,

5.5 The general direction of collapse of barrier 124A was towards the
lower left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch.

5.6 Two holes, caused by corrosion, had been present in the tube of
barrier 124A at the junction with support 4 before the collapse
occurred and these would have been visible to the naked eye.

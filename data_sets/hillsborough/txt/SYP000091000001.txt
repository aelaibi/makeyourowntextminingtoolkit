                At    0930 am         (0930)         with    other         officers        a t t e n d e d at M i d i M        Station

                As    fans,       supporters           arrived            they were        escorted       on P S V ' s    to    the

                football          g ro u n d .




                I m a d e two f u l l / t r i p s w i t h s u p p o r t e r s to the                    ground     in    company       with

                Leppings          Lrane w i t h       the     second        bus    coach        of    supporters.
                                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                                S352&

As    the    bus       stopped           in L e p p i n g s         Lane     directly across               from     the    Main

g a t e , there          wa s     a mass           of    supporters           outside        the     gate,       w h i c h was

closed.           Th e      mass        of    supporters             which        I would       estimate         at a b o u t     3,000

were       Liverpool             fans.         They       extended           from     the    gate       area and       out      into

Leppings          Lane       in     places          completely              blocking        the     road.




I also       sa w      numerous              groups       of    s u pp o r t e rs between Hillsborough                       Shopping

Centre       and       the       stadium.               They    all       appeared       to ire m a k i n g        their     way      to

the    ground.                                                                          /




A    lot    of    the       supporters              were       car rf/i ng /tans         and      there     wa s    several

groups       of       three       persons           where       the       m/'adle     one    ha d    to    be    supported         by

the    outer          two.




I w o u 1d say           that       a    large          portion       of     these      supporters          were     either

dr u n k,    or       the    worse           for    drink.




As    the P S V        arrived           at    Leppings             Lane     I saw      that      the     both     sides     of    the

bridge       in t h a t          r o a d wa s       covered with              beer      cans.        After       dropping

off    the       fans       we    were        told       to    go    into     the m e s s       room where          we w o u l d      be

provided with                te a       or    coffee          and    probably a m e a l .




The    time       was       shortly after                 3.00       pm     ( 1500)     after       a short        t i m e , probably

10 m i n u t e s       a Police              Inspector          shouted,           "I w a n t     everybody         out    t h e r e ’s

trouble          at    the L e p p i n g s          Lane       end."




With       everyone          else        in the m e s s             r o o m we    all    made       our w a y      around       the

pitch       towards          the        Leppings          Lane       en d    of   the    g r o un d .      The     football

players          were       s t ill      on the          pitch       b ut    I also      sa w     several        supporters

running          onto       the     pitch          from       the    Leppings         Lane      end.       I could        not     see      at

this    time        where     the      fans       were     coming       from.




I then       followed         other         officers        diagonally            across       the     playing       a r e a at

the L e p p i n g s     Lane      half       of    the     pitch.




I s a w at       this    t i me     two      fans        shouting       to   players,.         " Y o u ’ve    got    to    get

the    g am e    stopped."




As    I approached            the      Leppings          Lane     fencing         I was    still       unsure        as    to

what    was      happening,            and     1 initially            stood       in a    line       with     other

officers         facing       the      crowd.



I would         estimate         the    time       as a b o u t   3.15       pm    <1515)        and    I could       then

hear    people         shouting         from       behind       the     fencing,         "There"s          people     getting

crushed         in h e r s . "    and       “C a n ' t   you    get     us   out    there's          too     many    in."




I then       sa w     officers         at    the     fence a s s i s t i n g       people        who w e r e    climbing

over.




I went       towards        the     fence         and assisted           in t h i s      for     a time.



I was     then aware             that       a sm all      wicket        t y o 4 gate      h ad    been       opened and          I

went    to      the    gate      and assisted              fans    through and            onto       the     playing

surface.

    Dur ing this time several fans came to us pleading with us to keep on

    trying.



    We must have been trying for about 5 minutes but the re was no signs of

    life.



    The man would have been about 23 yrs to 25 yrs, white, stocky bu i l d .



    St Johns ambulance staff then came to ^     and took over.



    I then went into the lower area through the gate and assisted fans

    through



    After a short while, with the assistance of Liverpool f a n s , used

    hoardings as makeshift stretchers to get fans onto the pitch.



    The injured or dead were placed on the playing s u r f a ce , and I saw what

V   appeared to be about 20 persons covered by Clothing, obviously dead.



    During the time I1 was attending to people on the playing surface coins

    were landing on the\grass around me,    but I did not have the time to
                         \                                 '
    see where they were coming.



    I also saw that the male   person who w l had trip.d to revive was now

    covered with either a coat or a jumper



    At approximately 4.00 pm il&OQ?, I went through tfye small gate to

    assist other injured and a surge crushed me agajmst the fencing I was

    totally out of breath and gasping for a i r .

I walked        back       onto    the       playing         area,       and     sa w     that    officers          were         lining

up    on the       centre       JrTVte.




I made       rror w a y    to    the    centre         of    the        pitch,       a n d as    I did,          I sa w a

A    sergeant       w ho     was   at      the    door       at    the     mortuary          instructed            me    to      stand

friends       with        enquiries.




I s t a y e d at     this        location         till      about        5,15       pm    (1715),       the      same       day,

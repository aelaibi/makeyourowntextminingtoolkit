                F A Cup Semi-Final                - S at u r d a y   15 April,       1989     ( 1 5 0 4 8 9 ) .On the above

                date     I commenced duty at 8 . 00a m                  (0800)     at F 2 .

                Fol lo wi ng       the morning         briefing       I cleared my desk             then a c c o m p a n i e d

                ground,          for the briefing at             IQ.QOam       (1000).

                I was     to work with S up er i n t e n d e n t C H A P M A N on Sector 3                    (Nottingham

                Forest) , being              in charge      of Sector 3A,          Serials 52 to 5 h            inclusive.

                f o llowing            the briefing      I had a discu ss io n wit h S u p e r in te nd ed , C H A P M A N ,

                then spoke to several                  Officers       in the serials and,                 shortly before         11.

                QOa m    ( 1 1 0 0 ) went       to my area of r e s p o n s i b i 1 ity.         This are a       included

                Herries Rd S, Herries Rd and that stretch of Pen is to ne Rd joining

                those     two          r d s . There   is a traffi c island s it ua te d                 in P e n i st on e Rd at

                its     junction with He r r i es Rd.                The other        road    leading       to this     island

                                                                                                     S1916

o pposite Herries Rd         is Leppings L n , w hich           is the       road where           the W

S t a n d of the ground      is s it uated and also where               entrance          to the N S ta nd

is gained.        Both these stands        being    the Liverpool            supporters.

Looking along Leppi ng s Ln from Pen is to ne Rd/He rr ie s Rd                        it is not

possible    to see the N and W Stands               or the      entrances       to same,          because

of the turns        in L ep pings    Ln.

I was on the side of the             ground where the N o t t i n g h a m supporters                     were

expec te d to arrive.        In     fact the m aj o r i t y of        coaches,       over    eighty,

carrying    these fans       parked     in the S h e f f i e l d T ransport D e p a r t m e n t / B u s

Depot,    w hich    is s it uated    in Herries Rd near              to P en istone        Rd. Qme

task    for the Serials       e mp loyed    in this are a was to direct                    tjye

N o t t i n g h a m Fans along Herries Road,         away from Pe ni st on e S^oad.                  These

fans were     then direc te d       by other Officers           to turn       right down Herries

Rd S,    towards     that   part of the ground that              had been a l l o c a t e d to them.

That    is the Hop an d the S stand.The              idea,      of    course,       was    to direct

the N o t t i n g h a m fans awa y from the Liverpool                fans,   many of whom w ould

approach    the ground from the Wads 1ey Bridge                      side,    that    is down

P e n i s to ne Rd and   right along Leppings Ln.               The Liverpool             fans    using     the

special    train stopping at W a d sl ey Bridge Station,                      would also           use    that

route.    This was the same          plan as the       previous year.The N o t t i n g h a m

coaches    started to arrive around noon.                 The    system was working well

'                                    hat a few      coaches had unloaded                  prior     to

a rr iv in g at    the bus da pot     but ste'ps were        taken to put a stop to thi£.

It is true to say the m aj or i t y of the fans were                      in a buoyant moo d and

c omplied with Police         requests as to their a p p r o a c h to the groufnd.                         In

a d d i t i o n to the serials at this         point,     there were two P o l i c / h o r s e s ,

these    played a most       useful     part by pointing             the fans       in tjne right

direction.        One of their      tasks was to ensure              the Liverpool          fans     did not

e nc ro ac h onto this area         but this never        occurred.          Many    private        vehicles

carrying N o t t i n g h a m fans were also         parked      in this area.
                                                                                                 P AGE         3
                                                                                                 SI 916

As the build up continued                 it was obvious m an y supporters            had been

drinking,       as dozens were           obliged to relieve          themselves     in a small

w o o d l a n d area opposite         the bus depot.        I gave    instructions     that      this

was    to be permitted,          as     there was       no public    toilet   in that area.         I

w i sh to emphasise         that      even at this        stage    the moo d was   still       g enerally

buoyant and a wor d from a Police Officer                         to the occasional

t r a ns gr essor     had the desi re d effect.

I had w al ke d aro un d my area and spoken to m any Officers,                        there were          no

serious       problems and the atmos ph er e was as one w o ul d expect                    on such an

occasion.

I saw there were           no   problems at the           turnstiles      on P enistone R d , which

gives access          to the Hop and everything              seemed to be proceeding             to plan.

I remember about g .O Q p m             (1400)    hearing    on my personal        radio   that     the

Special       T rain from Liverpool          had a r r iv ed at U a d s l e y Bridge Station.             I

believe       this    had a r r iv ed    early.                                                           /

As the fans          from the Special        T rain w o ui 4 be e sc orted along Pen is to ne

Rd,    pass    the junction w ith Herries R c ^ I made my way to that                          j un ction

to await       their arrival.           So far as       I recall^it was ar ou nd this           time,     or

s ho rt l y after,      there were        radio m e s s a g e / directing     transit mobiles

to areas where          fanswere         causing    trouble.      These    included Kilner

just above Wads 1ey S t a t i o n , the 2s.rse and Jo ck ey on Wads 1 e y

                  ie^d
l\oyal on Penistone/Rd.

The Liverpool          fans,    with Police        escort,    came from the S t a ti on and

turned    right       into L ep pings Ln.         They were       boisterous,   as one w ould

expect,       but there was        no    cause    for    concern so far as       could be seen at

that    time.                                                                              /

heavy.    These       fans were       prevented from continuing along Pen is to ne Rd or

turning       into Herries       Rd,     as they were Liverpool            supporters.

I recall          that about 2 . 2 0 p m       ( 1420)   an order        came over the       personal

radio for Leppings Ln to be closed to vehicular                                traffic      because     of the

build up of            pedestrians.       I particularly          recall     this    because       I was

i nstructed to              inform a S h e f f i e l d Trai/s po r t Depa rt me nt Officer            (iir

m   Id D u P t ON)    of this and       inform him yfiat service             buses w ould have          to be

diverted.            I del iv er ed this mess'a/e within two minutes and                      informed

control.          I returned to the            traffic    island at the Pen is to ne Rd end of

L e p pi n gs Ln.          There was no     congestion of L ep pings Ln by pedestrians at

that end,            but    I did notice       there were a large           number and m any of these

s ee me d the worse            for    drink.

1 w o ul d     like to emphasise           these     fans were       not fighting        drunk or        in an

ugly mood,            they were       just what     I w ould describe as            being    s tu pidly

drunk,        in fact many were           still     a ct u a l l y drinking.      1 clearly        remember

thinking          I had never         seen so man y       in such a state         before.

The P ol ice Officers                on Leppings Ln and Pen is to ne Rd at this                    time were

coping a d e q u a t e l y and,         after    speaking wit h the Officers                on duty at         the

         d e D o r r i> wa lk ed along P en istone Rd towards                 the ground.       I had

         sion to speak           to two young fans outside an off                   licence     near    the

epN^lnd, who a p o l o g i s e d as some drunks               do for their          behaviour.         1 then

g nt er e d the ground via the gate                  leading to the sports              h^ll.      It was at

this       time      I heard     radio m es sages about           gates    being jypened/at Lep pi ng g

L n . I am sure this was after                   I had heard the           roar of t ) ^ c r o w d,

s ign al li ng        that    the teams     had come onto          the    playing f/ea.       I d i s t in c tl y

remember          there was an extreme             urgency    in the voice or

voices        passing        the messages.

I d e fi ni te ly heard            ’Gate C ’ and e ither          ’a g a t e ’ or / Gate t ) / .      My first

thought was            they were       to open the        gate or gates        to a l l m / people       out

because         of the       crushing,     but    I quickly       realised this /as          not the         case.

B efore       I a ct ua ll y     reached the       playing area,          I heard Isl m e s s a g e

an   instruction for O ff ic er s               to    comply w ith the        radio message atyl then

ran to the             playing ar/a,

1 ooking         towards

perimeter           f e n c e onto the      playing area and some             scrambling      from the

terrace          up into the S t a n d / I took             this   in as    I was    running across            the

p ressed a gainst            the fence.        I quickly helped another youth from the top

of the fence and then                 ran to the e mergency e;-;it gatar in this

fence,      w h ic h     leads from the terrace               to the    playing area.         I was within

a few feet             of this     in any    case.     For    some   reason    I thought      the Police

O ff ic e r at this          gate were       not     removing      people from the terrace            -f^ast

enough.          I a c tu a ll y   remember     pushing one Officer aside and shifting

words      to the effect            "Get them out." The Officer                replied tha^y were

trying      but were         unable       to do so. There was a tremendous                 a r ush   of

people at that             g a t e . One    reason for        this was      the drop o / about        two

feet from the             perimeter        track to the floor          of the terrace.            People were

a c tu a l l y    bent over        this    in a pile.

I took ho 1d of a young man by the arms a t te mp ti ng                             to p u l 1 him out and

then     realised what             the Officer        had meant.       I found      it impossible         to

move him.           I then realised he was dead.

I then took hold of the arms                       of another young man and tried to pull

him out          but    I felt     him slip away and           could not m ai nt ai n my hold on

him.     The      crush seemed to           increase.        We m a n a g e d to ass ist a few out over

the others and              I then saw a man           in absolute         panic,    he was    literally

throwing          himself      in the      backs     of other      people and       I shouted at him to

were    dead or seriously           injured.

vented their anger           o x y m e . It           about    this    time     that Chief

this a sensible move as the N o t t i n g h a m fans had                      initially jeered and

cheered,      not    realising what           had taken       place and from their                  stand   it no

of Polic e Officers            outside        the    ground,      for     public order            purposes,

   ente re d the sports              hall.   By this        time the        injured had been removed

and    I saw many bodies              on the floor of the Hall.                    A line of Police

Offic er s     were    preventing members                of the     public entering               the area of

Every th in g a pp ea re d       in order,          in fact    everyone          seemed stunned.            I only

remained outside a few minutes and then                             returned to the sports

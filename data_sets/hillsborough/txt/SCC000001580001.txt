108         REGION 10 SCIENTIFIC ADVISERS' STUDY WEEKEND
            A report by the Director of Emergency Planning referred to the recent
            Region 10 Scientific Advisers' Study Weekend.
            Apart from two general presentations on nuclear weapons effects and
            radiation, the main part of the study consisted of a number of
            exercises for the Scientific Advisers present.
            The remainder of the weekend however departed from    Home Office
            guidance in that it concentrated on the threat from chemical and
            biological weapons. The exercises were based on various procedures
            for predicting the dispersal of chemical and biological     agentsand
            the effect of this dispersal on gas concentrations    and lethality
            downwind of targets. These procedures were similar to those used by
            NATO forces and the techniques were intended to allow rapid and easy
            calculation of the threat to people from attack by airborn chemical
            and biological weapons.
            RECOMMENDED:-
            1    That the Authority again request the Home Office to make
                 guidance on the effects of chemical weapons more widely
                 available to local authorities.
            2    That the Chief Fire Officer be requested to report on the
                 equipment available to American Firefighters, to deal with
                 chemical incidents, compared with that available for UK
                 Firefighters.

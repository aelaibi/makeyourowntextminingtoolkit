                         was    a    public          order          situation.
H lL             l L "
                         Myself          and    three          of    the       other          special           constables             then       began       to m a k e

                         our    way       back       towards             the    ground             ir/case          we     were      required.             The

                         airwaves           were         very       busy       at    thisXitage                 but a f t e r        a f ew m i n u t e s          they

                         calmed          down and          returned             to w h a t          I would          term        "no rm al" .

                         We     continued           to m a k e our w a y / t o w a r d s                      the      ground        and     1 then        heard

                         S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M A R S H A L L spla4k on the                            radio.           He    f ir s t     asked       for      the

                         gate       at    Leppings             Lane       to    be       opened          but     got       a negative             response            from

                         control.              Very       shortly            after        this        I again            heard Superintendent

                         MARSHALL           speak         on    the       radio,          I remember                him       saying       something           to      the

             )           effect          that       people          were       going          to    be      crushed           and    said words            something

                         like       " T his      is a d i r e c t            or der ,         get     this       g at e       opened"       I c a n ’t be             exact

                         as    to    his       wording          but       I got          the       impression              he was       very       "keyed          up".

                         The     r a di o      calmed          down a          bit       and       the      next       thing        I can d e f i n i t e l y

                         recollect             is    the       message          coming             o ve r    about         there       b e in g    eight       bodies

                         longer          than       normal          as    we    were          continually                stopped        by d i s t r e s s e d         fans.

||j |         Dear Mr Pyne

              Thank you for your letter dated 27 February 1998 addressed to the Chief Commander
              regarding the Hillsborough Scrutiny. (Received on 5th March 1998).

              The Chief Commander is currently out of the office until Wednesday of next week, but
              in the light of the urgency of this matter, I have sent your letter to his home requesting
              a quick response.

              Thank you for your patience.

              Yours sincerely

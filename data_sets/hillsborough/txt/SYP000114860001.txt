l o cal     public          houses          were       all      f ull    with      supporters             from         both       c iti es .

The     public         houses          were       so      full    that        supporters            were       standing            outside

the     premises            drinking             intoxicants             on    th e    footpath.               From      time        to      time

it    became          necessary             to    instruct          the       supporters            to    keep         footpaths

dear       a?     they were             causing            an    obstruction.                Where        possible            I

instructed             people          to    go     inside        t he    public           house and           consume            the

drinks          in t h e     bar.           However,            in m a n y     cases        t he    bars       were      too       full         and

people          were       asked       to    drink         up a n d      take      glasses          b a ck     inside         t he      bar.

I noticed             that    a    lot       of     the      young       male      supporters             appeared            to     be

very       merry       at    this       stage,            which was           shortly after               midday.




At    approximately                1.35pm           (13 35),        our       patrol        attended           the R o y a l         Hotel

Public. H o u s e ,          Penistone              Road,        Sheffield.                On arrival             at    this       location

I saw a          very       large       number            of N o t t i n g h a m      supporters             outside          t h is

public          house.        I saw          that         most     of    these        people        were       consuming             drinks

whilst          standing          on    th e      footpath          and       that     inside        the       bar      area       was       very

f u l l.        Other       Police          units         had    responded            to    t his    location            due       to a

call       made       by    staff       at       the      premises        to    t he       effect        t hat     a number             of

youths          were       deliberately                causing          damage        to    glasses          and       property

inside          the    bar    a r ea .




 On     questioning               people          outside          the    premises,            they       confirmed               t ha t

approximately                four       youths            who    appeared          drunk       began         to    smash          glasses

inside          the    bar    and       then        left        prior     to    Police         arrival.




The     footpaths            outside             t h is    public        house        had    a very          large       number            of

pi nt      glasses          just       strewn about.                    I saw      empty Pils             lager         bottles,

empty wine             and    cider          bottles            also     discarded           onto        the      footpath.                As

some       of    the       supporters             began         to m o v e     off     towards           the      football           gr o u n d ,

these       glasses          and       bottles            were    being        kicked        and     tripped            over,        which
                                                                                                                                  ■PAGE
                                                                                                                                   R 4 13

in t u r n    caused        them      to     sma sh.            I saw        some      of     these       supporters             stumble

o n the      bottles        and      due     to      the    obvious              danger,         staff       inside        the    public

houses       were       requested          to a t t e n d        outside           and      clear       up     the       debris.

Three       members        of   staff        complied with                   this       request         and       went     outside

With    cardboard           boxes         and      bin     sacks       and        set a b o u t        clearing           up the

broken       glass.          I understand                 the    bar        was    then asked             to      cl ose .       At    this

point       people       then       began asking                myself           and    other         officers           where    they

could       find       another       public          house       w h i c h was          being         used     by N o t t i n g h a m

supporters.              I was       not     giving         them        any       replies         to    this        question and

told     them,         in v i e w    of    the       time,       that        they       should         be a t t e n d i n g      the

ground       to    start        finding         their       gate        entrances             and      standing           in the

queues.           As    they     began       to w a l k         of f    in       the    direction            of     the    ground,          I

saw a       lot    of    young       men     carrying            cans        of    l a ge r      in    packs        of    four.        I

would       describe         these        f a ns     as    very        boisterous             but      manageable.




From     this      location          we    then       returned              to    patrolling            the M i d d l e w o o d        Road

and Langsett             Road



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y     2.05pm         (1405),          we     attended            at    the H o r s e          and Jockey

Public       House,        Wad sl ey Bridge,                Sheffield.                  On arrival             at    these

premises          othe P o l i ce         units       were       already           in a t t e n d a n c e .          I saw a v e r y

large       number       of L i v e r p o o l        supporters              outside          the      premises           drinking

intoxicants.               These      supporters                were        both       standing         and       sitting        in a n

area which             forms     part      of      the     car     p ar k        for    the      premises.               Inside       the

bar    area       again      it w a s      very       full.            We    had       responded          to      this     location

as    the    result        of a      call       or    complaint              from a         local       resident           about       the

behaviour          of     certain         fans.



Again       I s a w the         footpath and               parking           area       was      strewn with              litter       such

as    half    eaten        sandwiches,               fish and           chips          wrappers         and       numerous        lag er

bottles         and    pint       glasses.            These         vessels            were       again       being        kicked          o v er

and      tripped       over       by    fans,       causing          them         to    smash .           The      staff      at      this

public         house       were       requested          to a t t e n d        outside            and     clear         up t h e m e s s,

which         they    did.        A    lot    of    these        fans       were        in m y         opinion          dru n k ,     but

due      to    the, l a r g e P o l i c e      presence,             were         reasonably              orderly.




Whilst         walking       through          the     crowd         of    people            outside          the    public house,

I was         pointing       out       that    they        had a         fiar      walk       to       the    ground and              that

they      should       be m o v i n g        off.        My    comments            were       ignored and                 s om e

Liverpool            fans    r e m a r k e d to       me      that       " T he    game       would          not    be     started

until         they    were       all    inside".              I pointed            out       to    them       that        they       could

not      be    sure    of    that       and again             told       them      to       start       making          their        w a y to

th e     stadium.           Some       fans    did       eventually               drink       up a n d        begin        to w a l k        in

the      direction           of       the    stadium, ma ki ng             comments               to    the      effect       t h at       the

Police         should        drive          them    to     the   g r o u n d in        the    Police             van s.




I noticed            that    a    number       of     f ans      were       carrying              bottles          of     ci d e r    or

c an s    of     lager.          I stopped          some       of    these         f ans      and       told       them      they would

not      be a l l o w e d    into       the    stadium           carrying              alcoholic             drinks.          Th e

replies         from       some       were    to    the       effect        they w o u ld              have      drank       it by         the

time      they       reached          the    ground.           Some       of      them       even went             onto      parking

area      and     started         to    drink       the       contents            of    the       cans       and    bottles           ra the r

than      risk       having       the       drink     confiscated.




As     the     Liverpool          fans       slowly        started          to     drift          down W a d s l e y         Lane

towards         the    ground,          our    serial          moved        off        to    the       bottom       of W a d l s e y

Lane      and     stopped         outside          the P a r k       Hotel         Public          House.           These          premises

were      again       full       of    Liverpool           fa ns,        many      being          outside          th e    building

 arresting         officer            to     the    Police          r o o m at      the        stadium.           The

 circumstances             leading            to    the a r r e s t           of   this        youth       I am    not       familiar

 Police        v-anand         opened         the       rear       doors       to a l l o w      entry       for       the    officedr,

 Police        van,      I was        surrounded              by a p p r o x i m a t e l y       fifteen          to    twenty

 Liverpool          fa n s ,     some        carrying          opened          cans       of    beer/lager,             some       with

 p int    glasses         of     beer/lager              which       had       obviously          been       purchased             from

 the P a r k      Hotel.            Those         fans     began         to    p r o d me       a n d at     first       I thought

 they     were      going        to a s k         w h y we     had       just       placed       the       youth       in the        van

 obviously          under        arrest.Instead                 they were             pleading              with        me    to a s k

 t he    youth      in    th e      van      to      give       up h is       ticket,          stating that             many       of     them

 had     not     got     tickets           for     the     football            match.           I told       them       the       t ic k e t ,

 if     the y o u t h     had       one,      was       his     property           and     not     for      me    to d i s p o s e        of.

 They      then a s k e d        me     if    I knew anywhere                      they    could       obtain          tickets,           to

 which      I told        them        "No” .             I t h e n g ot       i nto    the      Police van and                the y o u t h

 was     conveyed         to     the       Police        r oom      for       processing.              My serial             then went

 back      onto     patrol.




 At     2.50pm      (1450)          that      day       were       patrolling             Langsett          Road and          I noticed

 that      football        fans        were        st ill       in the         vicinity making                   their       way

 towards         the     stadium,            although           I am      unaware          which       team       they were

 supportersof.



 At     approximately               3.05pm         ( 1 5 05),       as    a    result          of a    radio       message           from

 the     ground        control          room,        our      unit       attended          the L e p p i n g s         Lane       e n d of

 the     stadium.          On       our      arrival          we    set       about       crowd       control          duties        a

^large      numbers        of       people         of    both       sexes,          including          children,             were        n ow

 spilling         out     of     the       stadium         exits         and       beginning          to    congregate              on    the

  ro a d a n d    footpaths             immediately                outside          the    stadium..             I saw       that        s o me

of these          people          looked            very       dishevelled,             some,        including          young    men,

were     crying,            some        bad        no    shoes       on    their       feet.         As m o r e    and more       f ans

spilled          from       the       stadium            I realised          that       something           very     serious      must

have     taken         place          inside            the    stadium.




I had       no    personal              radio           and Sergeant             J o h n s o n was      the    only      officer        in

our    serial          with       radio            communication,                but    he was        now     some      distance

away    f r o m me          as    we       had      spread          ou t   trying       to    usher      the      crowd away          from

the m a i n       gates          of     the        stadium.           More       and    more     people        were      leaving        the

stadium,          these          al l      Liverpool            supporters.




I approached                a youth             of a b o u t        eighteen          years    who     wa s    very      pale    in

colourand             appeared             to    be      staggering.              I took       hold      of    his      and asked           if

he w a s     alright.                 He     seemed           not    to    know what          wa s    happening          or w h e r e       he

was    and       he    virtually                fainted         into m y         arms.        I dropped           the    youth    to

on e   side       of       the    entrance               gates       and    sat       him    down.




I was       then       joined           by      othey youths               who    i n f o r m e d me     he w a s       their    friend

and    he    had       travelled                with      them       to    the    ground.            These     youths      spoke

with Liverpool                   accents,             they were            angry       using    obscene           language       and

screaming             about       the        allocation              of    standing          areas     for     Liverpool         fans.               |

he w a n t e d        to    go    to       hospital,           he     declined         and asked          his     friends        to     get      i

him    away       from       the        a r ea .




The    crowd          by    now was            massive.             Other        officers       had arrived             and were

trying       to       control           t he     crowd.

these      were      obviously             dead.         I now        knew    that       the    situation            I thought

         I am a Police Constable                                                      presently                       attached           to the Serious Crime Squad,

         Police Headquarters.

         At 9.30 am on Saturday 15 April 1989»                                                                               I paraded in full uniform at the

         North Stand, Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield.                                                                                                             My duties were in

         connection with the football                                                              semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham

         Forest.

         On attendance at the ground I was assigned to Serial number 63 which was

         to be supervised by Sergeant 2777 Johnson.                                                                                  At approximately 9.^5 am, all

         the           Police                    units                were       briefed                   by Chief            Superintendent                                     Duckenfield     and

         Superintendent Murray.                                                On completion of the briefing, together with other

         officers in my serial, we then began a mobile patrol in a marked Police

         transit                    van,              patrolling Middlewood Road                                              and Langsett Road.                                       The mobile

         patrol                  commenced                            at   approximately                              11.00    am          and            large                   numbers   of   both

         Liverpool                            and               Nottingham                      supporters                    had             already                        arrived        in     the

        Whilst patrolling Middlewood Road and Langsett Road, I saw that the local

        public houses were all full with supporters from both cities.                                   The public

        houses     were    so   full    that   supporters       were   standing outside            the premises

        drinking      intoxicants        on    the    footpath.        From    time     to      time    it   became

        necessary to instruct the supporters to keep the footpaths clear as they

        were     causing an obstruction.               Where    possible      I instructed people to go

        inside the public house and consume the drinks in the bar.                                     However,     in

        many cases        the bars were too full and people were asked to drink up and

        take glasses back inside the bar.                  I noticed that a lot of the young male

        supporters        appeared     to be    very merry        at   this    stage,     which was          shortly

        after midday.

        At approximately 1.35 pm,               our patrol attended at the Royal Hotel Public

        House,      Penistone    Road,       Sheffield.        On arrival at this location I saw a

        very large number of Nottingham supporters outside this public house.                                        I

        saw that most of these people were consuming drinks whilst standing on the

        footpath and that inside the bar area was very full.                              Other Police units

        had responded to this location due to a call made by staff at the premises

        to the effect that a number of youths were deliberately causing damage to

        glasses and property inside the bar area.

        On       questioning     people        outside     the     premises,        they        confirmed       that

        approximately four youths who appeared drunk began to smash glasses inside

        the bar and then left prior to Police arrival.

        The footpaths outside            this public house had a very large number of pint

        glasses just strewn about.              I saw empty Pils lager bottles, empty wine and

        cider bottles also discarded onto the footpath.                        As some of the supporters

        began to move off towards the football ground,                        these glasses and bottles

             were being kicked and tripped over, which in turn caused them to smash.                                I

             saw some of these supporters stumble on the bottles and due to the obvious

             danger, staff inside the public house were requested to attend outside and

             clear up the debris.                Three members of staff complied with this request

             and went outside with cardboard boxes and bin sacks and set about clearing

             up broken glass.             I understand the bar was then asked to close.                       At this

             point people then began asking myself and other officers where they could

              find another public house which was being used by Nottingham supporters.

              I was not giving them any replies to this question and told them, in view

              of the      time,    that    they should be attending the ground to start finding

              their gate entrances           and standing in the queues.                   As they began to walk

              off in the direction of the ground, I saw a lot of young men carrying cans

              of lager in packs of four.               I would describe these fans as very boisterous

              but manageable.

              From      this   location     we   then returned          to    patrolling Middlewood       Road    and

              Langsett Road.

              At      approximately       2.05   pm,   we   attended         at    the Horse   and   Jockey    Public

              House, Wadsley Lane, Sheffield.                 On arrival at these premises other Police

              units were already in attendance.                   I saw a very large number of Liverpool

              supporters        outside    the premises        drinking        intoxicants.     These supporters

              were both standing and sitting in an area which forms part of the car park
                                    I

              for the premises.             Inside     the bar area again it was very full.                   We had

              responded        to this location as the result of a call or complaint from a

              local resident about the behaviour of certain fans.

              Again I saw the footpath and parking area was strewn with litter such as

              half eaten sandwiches, fish and chips wrappers and numerous lager bottles

        and pint glasses.                These vessels were again being kicked over and tripped

        over by the fans, causing them to smash.                                 The staff at this public house

        were requested to attend outside and clear up the mess, which they did.                                           A

         lot of these fans were in my opinion drunk, but due to the large Police

         presence, were reasonably orderly.

        Whilst walking through the crowd of people outside the public house, I was

         pointing out that they had a fair walk to the ground and that they should

         be moving off.             My comments were ignored and some Liverpool fans remarked

         to me that "the game would not be started until they were all inside".                                            I

         pointed out to them that they could not be sure of that and again told

         them to start making their way to the stadium.                                     Some fans did eventually

         drink      up       and   begin    to    walk       in    the     direction        of   the   stadium,     making

         comments to the effect that the Police should drive them to the ground in

         the Police vans.

         I noticed that a number of fans were carrying bottles of cider or cans of

         lager.          I    stopped      some   of   these        fans and        told them they would not be

         allowed into the stadium carrying alcoholic drinks.                                     The replies from some

         were to the effect they would have drank it by the time they reached the

         ground.         Some of them even went back onto the parking area and started to

         drink      the contents           of   the cans and bottles rather than risk having the

         drink confiscated.

         As      the Liverpool        fans slowly started to drift down Wadsley Lane towards

         the ground, our serial moved off to the bottom of Wadsley Lane and stopped

         outside      the Park Hotel Public House.                         These premises were again full of

         Liverpool fans, many being outside the building drinking.                                           An officer at

         this      location        had   arrested        a   Liverpool          supporter        and   our    transit    was

required to convey this supporter and arresting officer to the Police room

at the stadium.        The circumstances leading to the arrest of this youth I

am not familiar with.          On seeing this officer with his prisoner, I got out

of the Police van and opened the rear doors to allow entry for the officer

and prisoner.       As this youth was being placed into the rear of the Police

van, I was surrounded by approximately fifteen to twenty Liverpool fans,

some   carrying     opened     cans       of     beer/lager,           some      with   pint    glasses    of

beer/lager which had obviously been purchased from the Park Hotel.                                      Those

fans began to prod me and at first I thought they were going to ask why we

had just placed the youth in the van obviously under arrest.                                   Instead they

were pleading with me to ask the youth in the van to give up his ticket,

stating that many of them had not got tickets for the football match.                                        I

told them the ticket,          if the youth had one, was his property and not for

me   to dispose of.        They then asked me if I knew of anywhere they could

obtain tickets, to which I told them 'No'.                          I then got into the Police van

and the youth was conveyed to the Police room for processing.                                    My serial

then went back onto patrol.

At 2.50 pm that day, we were patrolling Langsett Road and I noticed that

football    fans    were   still     in    the      vicinity making              their way     towards     the

stadium, although I am unaware which team they were supporters of.

At approximately 3.05 pm, as the result of a radio message from the Ground

control room, our unit attended the Leppings Lane end of the stadium.                                      On

our arrival we set about crowd control duties as large numbers of people

exits and beginning to congregate on the road and footpaths immediately

outside    the     stadium.      I    saw        that      some      of       these   people   looked     very

        dishevelled, some, including young men, were crying, some had no shoes on

        their      feet.     As more and more            fans spilled from the stadium I realised

        that something very serious must have taken place inside the stadium.

        I had no personal radio and Sergeant Johnson was the only officer in our

        serial with radio communication, but he was now some distance away from me

        as we had spread out trying to usher the crowd away from the main gates of

        the      stadium.      More    and more people were leaving the stadium,                          these all

        Liverpool supporters.

        I approached a youth of about eighteen years who was very pale in colour

        and appeared to be staggering.                   I took hold of him and asked him if he was

        alright.        He seemed not to know what was happening or where he was and he

        virtually fainted into my arms.                       I dropped the youth to one side of the

         entrance gates and sat him down.

        I was then joined by other youths who informed me he was their friend and

        he       had   travelled      with    them      to    the    ground.            These   youths   spoke    with

        Liverpool          accents,    they    were          very   angry       using      obscene   language         and

         screaming about the allocation of standing areas for Liverpool fans.                                         The

        youth I had sat down appeared to be conscious and I asked him if he wanted

        to go to hospital, he declined and asked his friends to get him away from

         the area.

        The crowd by now was massive.                    Other officers had arrived and were trying

        to control the crowd.

        I could hear much abuse being hurled at the Police Officers by young men

        leaving the ground.

        As I helped the youth I had tended to his feet, having leaned over him to

        pick him up,          I was punched in the back by a youth running past from a

        section of the crowd.              I got the youth I was tending to his feet and on

        turning saw some youths struggling with each other.                             One of these youths

        was trying to break free of two other youths who were restraining him.                               He

        was looking at me and shouting you murdering bastards have caused this,

        repeating        these   words    over again.         Other members of the crowd began to

        shout similar comments and obscenities at myself and other officers.                                The

        youth I had tended shouted back to someone in the crowd that it wasn't my

        fault (the fault of myself).

        The crowd around me were becoming increasingly more hostile.                                I saw more

        and more people limping and being helped out of the ground exits, by both

        Police and other supporters.               I knew the situation in the ground must have

        worsened.        I tried telling people in front of me to get away and make room

         for other people to leave and for ambulances to be allowed in.                               I was met

        with      further hostility,        both verbal and physical.                  I was punched at by

        another youth and blocked the punch by placing my forearms in front of my

         face, then beer cans were being thrown from other members deeper into the

        crowd, but fortunately I was not struck.                       I kept pleading with them to get

        well away and make room for the injured to be ferried away.                                 Some people

        just ignored me, others shouted obscenities and threats of violence.                                  By

        now      ambulances      were    beginning    to    arrive       but     the crowd were     still very

        hostile.

        During what I could only describe as mayhem, I had people running up to me

        and expressing their concern about telephoning home to let relatives know

        of their safety.           I told them to get well away from the ground and to go

        to       local   residents'       houses     and     ask     their        permission   to    use   their

         telephones.        I had numerous people making this request as to the location

        of telephones.            I aftffised all of them the same as they would obviously

A   * ‘                                                 STATEMENT OF WITNESS

                                    {CJ Act, 1967, s.9: MC Act, 1980, s.102: MC Rules, 1981, r.70)

                  eventually        find     telephones      and also            it was    a way of getting people               to

                  leave the area.

                  I was then asked by a uniformed Police Inspector to go and join a number

                  of other officers who were lined up on the service road inside the ground

                  area which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road.                                      I did not know

                  the Inspector but I had now become detached from my serial and joined the

                  other officers who had formed a line.                            On joining the line I saw a number

                  of bodies, approximately eleven people, and these were obviously dead.                                          I

                  now knew that the situation I thought to be a serious matter, was now a

                  terrible      tragedy.         As    more    and          more    ambulances        arrived,    so     did   fire

                  engines.      Metal barriers were placed behind the line of Police Officers I

                  was standing in and these were covered over by canvas sheeting to form a

                  more private screen.

                  The ambulances began taking injured people away as medical staff tended

                   the bodies behind me.              A number of Police Officers were then released from

                  screening the bodies, myself included.

                  Some officers were sent back to crowd control duties at Leppings Lane and

                  I and three or four other officers were instructed to go further along the

                  service     road      to   where     the    BBC       television        vans       were   parked.      At    this

                  location we joined a number of other officers forming a barrier to stop

                  people walking from the Penistone Road entrance of the service road to the

                  Leppings     Lane     end of the        service           road,    thus allowing better access for

                  ambulances to leave.

                  I was      also    instructed by        an Inspector whom I did not know to cover an

                  entrance/exit         gate    which     gives         access      onto      the    Leppings     Lane    terrace

                  preventing anyone without authority onto the terrace.                                     From that position

        I   could   see   the   emergency   services     working       frantically   carrying   away

        injured and what appeared lifeless bodies from the terrace areas.

        The rest of the stadium was by now emptying with some sections virtually

        empty.

        I remained at that position for quite some time until being briefed in the

        North Stand much later that afternoon.               After this briefing and taking a

        short break,      I regrouped with the rest of my serial, this being at about

        6.30 pm.    We then resumed mobile patrol of the Hillsborough area.

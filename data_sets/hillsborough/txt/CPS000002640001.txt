                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - JUSTICE CAMPAIGN


Mr David Alton M.P


I am writing to ask for your support for the campaign mounted by
the Hillsborough Family Support Group for the justice and
accountability which we believe has so far been denied to us by
the complete failure of the judicial system in the aftermath of
the Hillsborough Disaster.

You should be aware that following the broadcast on Independent
Television on December 5th 1996 of the drama/documentary
"Hillsborough", the Home Secretary is presently considering
whether, on the basis of the new and unused evidence which
emerged from the programme, there are grounds for him to order a
fresh Inquiry into the Disaster. Mr Howard in fact spoke
personally in the House of Commons adjournment debate which was
held about Hillsborough on 17th December, 1996 and he later met
privately with the many family members who had travelled to
London to be present at the debate.

The Hillsborough Family Support Group is hopeful that the Home
secretary will order a fresh inquiry, particularly in the light
not only of the new evidence but also of overwhelming public
support we have received - people from all walks of life from
right across Britain have written to us and telephoned to express
their outrage and anger at the treatment of bereaved families.
However, regardless of the decision of Mr Howard, the families
have also separately instigated the following legal actions to
take forward our quest for justice

i) a complaint to the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking a
criminal investigation into possible misconduct in the way
evidence was or was not presented to the Inquest jury. This
action is based on the evidence which has now come to light of
video- technician, Roger Houldsworth, who was not called as a
witness to either the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest and whose
existence was not known to the families until the TV programme
was made. The new evidence directly contradicts what some South
Yorkshire police officers told the jury and Taylor inquiry.

ii) an application to the Attorney General under section 13 of
the coroners act asking the High Court to consider quashing the
inquest verdict and ordering a fresh inquest.


CHAIRMAN                         SECRETARY                  TREASURER
T. Hicks                         P. Hammond                 Mis. J. Traynor
Liverpool City Council, at an extraordinary meeting held on 19th December 1996, have
already pledged their unanimous support to the families in our campaign. With the
assistance of the City Council, the campaign is now being taken out across the country
where it is our intention to seek the support of local authorities in all areas of Britain in
response to the massive public disquiet which has emanated from the television
programme (the "Daily Mirror", for example, has received a huge response to the
petition it launched in december, on behalf of the families, supporting the call for a new
inquest into the Disaster.) The response to the programme clearly indicates this is a
matter of public intrest and should be dealt with accordingly.


The Bereaved families of Hillsborough will forever be in debt to writer Jimmy McGovern
and to Granada Television for bringing the tale of our fight for justice into homes and
consciences of the British people. However, in some ways the story told on television
could not truly reflect the scale of what we have been made to endure by having the
absolute grief of losing our loved ones compounded by what can only be described as
the biggest farce and cover up in British legal history. As if this was not enough of a
burden, the families, despite the unequivocal findings of the Taylor Inquiry, have also
had to fight to counter a concerted and seemingly intentional campaign by certain public
and media figures to scar the reputation and memories of our loved ones by blaming
them, and their fellow supporters, for causing the Disaster.


The "Hillsborough" television programme seems at last to have washed away the
cartload of lies about the Disaster which have stood as a barrier to the reaching of a fair
and just conclusion about the needless deaths of 96 people. On behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group I would now urge you to help us go one step further
and establish as a matter of public record for all time the truth of what did happen on
that dreadful day of 15th April 1989. Only if that can be done may the bereaved families
be able to put our loved ones finally to rest.

Your: faithfully




Phil Hammond
Secretary - Hillsborough Family Support Group.

Dear Madam,


I enclose herewith a letter which I sent to Mr Howard. As most of the points I am concerned
about are contained in this letter; I would like you to consider what I have to say, and perhaps
let me have your comments.




Yours faithfully



R-ose Robinson
                 A




24th December 1996


Dear Mr Howard,

I am writing as one of the families who you were kind enough to see in the House of
Commons. May I say, I felt you were very sincere in what you said to us. I thank you for this.
I would identify myself to you as the lady who first spoke to you regarding police investigating
police.

I took careful note of your speech in the house, when you rightly said we had already had four
enquiries. You said at one point, that all the evidence was available to all the bodies concerned
during those enquiries. Our argument is, that although it was available it wasn't all used in
those enquiries. The police carefully selected what was used, and did not bring all the evidence
forward. Likewise with the coroners inquest, He said to me on a local radio phone in; he had
thousands of witnesses to call on, but he selected the witnesses to be called, ( possibly under
police pressure), and most of the witnesses were pro-police. One particular witness (the so
called land lord) who wasn't a land lord at all, was found to be a complete liar, and the jury
were told to dismiss his evidence at a later date. A few fans were called to give their evidence,
mainly young lads (my sons friend amongst them) they were systematically tom apart by a
team of barristers, as if they were on trial, many were in tears, as they felt they had let the
victims down. This was supposed to be a inquest, not a trial. I knew of many professional
people, who swore statements to the police, but were never called to give evidence at any of
the enquiries.

Talking about the inquest, yet again, the cut off time of 3.15 was totally inappropriate,
therefore invalidating the inquests. How can an inquest be legal, when many of the victims
were still alive up to 4 pm (evidence can be supplied)
Talking about the disaster itself, how can the police justify stopping ambulances and
paramedics to reach dying people. The police said they were fighting yes - fighting for their
lives, why were they denied help ?

Whilst this was going on, lines of police officers were on the pitch doing nothing - or
according to them separating the supporters. It was the supporters who saved lives, and
sprang into action immediately to help. How dare the Sun newspaper say otherwise,but then
the evidence for those reports came from the police..

Are you also aware that when some of the perimeter gates burst open under pressure, the
police offers pushed the people back in again, and locked them in. How many died because of
this ? One man, pleading for help as his young son died in his arms, was ignored.

As the disaster unfolded, the police realising their complete lack of control, immediately began
to shift the blame. Alcohol tests were taken on all of the victims, even children. Why weren't
the police tested for alcohol? It might have explained their incompetence. Many were known
to be in the hospitality suite, and one particular senior officer was thought to have a drink
problem. (Check this out) In a car accident, who do they breathalise, the driver or the victim?
Later on, about 5 p.m. many of the people searching for their loved ones (knowing they were
dead in the gym) having been told this by fans who had carried them there, were sent on a wild
goose chase to hospitals, mortuaries etc.; this gave the police time to get their 'stories straight,
and to make sure nothing derogatory was put in their notebooks. Our loved ones were just
laid on the floor without dignity. Why were they not sent to hospital, or the new health centre?
Why was a disaster plan not put into action? Could it be that it would have uncovered the
truth. Within minutes of identifying my sons body, my husband and I were interrogated by the
police. We had committed no crime, neither had my son. The only kindness shown to us on
that terrible night was from a social worker, and the ordinary citizens of Sheffield. How can
you call this British Justice, it makes me ashamed to be British. In what other occupation can
people be so negligent, as to cause the death of 96 people, and be allowed to retire to avoid
disciplinary action, plus to get their full pension and walk into another job.My son was a 17
year old hard working apprentice,he had never been in trouble, and we loved him dearly along
with our four other lovely children. His death was not an accident, and I will never accept it
was. My son was in the care of the South Yorkshire police, and through recklessness they
failed in their duty of care to my son, and the other 95 victims.

I would like you to acknowledge you have read this letter, because if you read it, you cannot
possibly say there is to be no further enquiry. I do have faith in you, because you came across
as a very sincere gentleman. There have been many miscarriages of justice during the last
decade, mainly caused by police perverting the course of justice, this is just one more. Please
see that it is put right

               I look forward to your reply


                                                       Mrs R Robinson

     Dear Madam.

                   Re        Hillsborough Disaster

      It is with great concern that we write to you regarding the evidence of criminal misconduct
      in the suppression of evidence arising out of the contents of the affidavit of Roger
      Houldsworth of 25th November 1996.
     W e call upon you to commence criminal proceedings on the basis that the statement of
     Roger Houldsworth contains allegations that material evidence was destroyed or
     concealed.
      He directly contradicts what some of the South Yokshire police told the jury. W e have no
     need to remind you that a person who destroys or conceals evidence knowing it may be
     material to legal proceedings, commits the offence of attempting to pervert the course of
     justice, it is on this point we call upon you to set up a criminal enquiry
     Our son died on that terrible day 15th April 1989. we shall not rest untill every answer to
     every question is given TRUTHFULLY.

     Yours,Sin<5enely

    Barbara Mills QC
    Director of Public Prosecutions
    50 Ludgate Hill
    London EC4 M7EX


    Dear Mrs Mills,

    We, the family of Graham John Roberts, killed at Hillsborough, 15
    April 1989 - aged 24 years, are writing to you to ask"if you will
    reopen the inquiry into this disaster? We feel that so far there
    has been no justice.  As well as the concerns already highlighted
    by the TV programme ''Hillsborough'1, and the comments expressed by
    Mr Trevor Hicks, Chairman of our Support Group, we have a number
    of further points we wish to bring to your attention.

    The first information we received in April 1990 regarding Graham
    was "A Report into the death of.." which states Graham died at
    16.25 hours - the 3.15pm cut off time for information would mean
    that Graham was not dead for his inquest.  We received two
    conflicting reports from police constables who thought they dealt
    with Graham.  One stated Graham was wearing a sleeveless T shirt,
    the other that Graham had no shirt on at all.  Neither of these
    descriptions fit with the clothing Graham was wearing on the day.
    We have no information what-so~ever regarding what happened to
    Graham on that day once he had been forced apart from his
    friends.

    In spite of phoning the emergency numbers continually, and,
    although Graham was identified by one of his friends at 2.00am on
    the Sunday, we were not informed of Graham's death until tris
    friends had driven back from Sheffield at 6.00am.   In fact it was
    Graham's friends who had to break the tragic news to us, even
    though they had pleaded with the Sheffield police to let us know,
    as they did not feel able to do so themselves.

    Prior to the first inquest we sent two questions to the coroner
    (copy attached) however, he refused our wish for these questions
    be asked.  Please, please will you allow us and all the other
    bereaved families to find out what happened on that day?
    sure you can understand why we need to know the truth.   If it is
    within your power to insist on the reopening of the inquiry, we
    all sincerely hope and pray you will do so.

    Thanking you in anticipation for your attention to this letter.

    Yours sincerely.

                           GRAHAM JOHN ROBERTS

              INQUEST ; MONDAY 30th APRIL, 1990 at 3:30pm


 Questions arising from Summary - Reference Number 79


 1.    In paragraph 16 of the Summary it is stated that Police

 Constable 1715 Best hepled to carry Mr Roberts into Leppings Lane

 and at the time believed Mr Roberts to be breathing.       Despite

 this, he left Mr Roberts to assist others.      Why was no basic

 first aid carried out by the Officer , and why was Mr Roberts

 left without attention?

 Did the lack of provision by the Officer of essential first aid

 such as placing Mr Roberts in a recovery position,     loosening his

 clothing and providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, contribute

 to Mr Roberts' death?

 2.   Police Constable 620 Yates in paragraph 15 of the Summary is

 stated to have formed the view that when he saw Mr Roberts at the

 rear of the West Stand, he had formed the opinion that Mr Roberts

 was dead, and therefore left him where he haid found him.

 However, Police Constable 1715 Best has stated that when he found

 Mr Roberts at the rear of the West Stand, he believed him to be

 breathing.    These statements are clearly in conflict.    What steps

 were taken by the two officers in question to ensure that they

 reached the correct assumption as to Mr Roberts1 state at that

 time?

               I live at the above a d dr es s with                                  and we have   lived at this

               address       nearly         years.

               On Saturday          15th April       1989 at about          11.15am I attended She ffield

               Wednesday,          H i l l s b o r o u g h Football   Ground.        At about   12 mid day      I was

               sec on de d         to a gate      to collect the        tickets from No ttingham Forrest

               fans.     I         was on a gate        in the sixties         I cannot     remember the exact

               number.        When you go to the ground to work on the turnstiles you are

               given an identify              card with a photograph of yourself and you are

               given a number.              My number       is    |   a nd my pass book which          is     also

               number                 I have wo r k e d at        the         ground for over         years. Whe n yoi

               go to the ground to work you                      can be placed on any turnstile.                The

               turnstile which             I was    placed on the S pi on kop End of the ground.                      Tt

               ma jo r i t y of the N o t t i g h a m fans were           inside the ground a good ten

               minutes       before      the kick off.            I never saw any of them causing any
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          S512

             trouble        there was a Police Officer at evry turnstile and the Officer

             outside my turnstile was                collecting      beer    cans off the fans.       The

             Police do not allow any fans                 to take     cans    in of any type.       The    last

             10 minutes        before     the kickoff       there was just the stragler            coming to

             the ground.            From my turnstile        I allowed 214 Nottingham Forrest               fans

             into the ground.             When I f i nn is h I had to count the tickets              I took

             which were        blue    in clour.        In normal     football matches the tunstiles

             is normally open to about                 10 to 15 minutes after the kick-off.                 A fe

             people     tried to get          into the ground without tickets.                At about 3.05p

             the Police Officer              told me to close the turnstile which I did so.

             The   next      thing that       I heard was a message over the Tanoy telling

             Suppo rt er s     to get off the          running track.         I thought      that there was Â£

             fight.         I did not know what          had happened but when I closed up I

             wal k e d betwe en the Spion Kop and the South Stand.                        I saw Police and

             fans on the        pitch and some          of the fans were          lying down on the       pitch.

             I still        thought    it was     possibly a fight.           After   I saw what was

             happening        I took my tickets          to the office underneath the South Stanc

             and got        paid.     I then    left    the ground and went home.              I left the

             ground with my father and my brother who was on the same stand as

             myself.                         lives at                                  and
                                                                                                            }lve
             at an address which              I cannot     remember at the minutes.             I was to. far

             away to see what was              happening.

             A person who works

                                told me that         there was a number of Liverpool Su pporters

             still    drinking        in S t o c k i n g b r i d g e at 2.30pm.   They could never of got

             to the ground for 3.00pm.

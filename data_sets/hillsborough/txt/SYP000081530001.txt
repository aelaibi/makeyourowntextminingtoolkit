             <1445) a disturbance occurred in the car park of the ’Gat« Inn’ and

            with other officers we ushered a group of about 12 Liverpool

            supporters away from the premises.            Apparently ayGisturbance had

            occurred in the pub between locals and the Liverpool          lads who were the

            worse for drink.         No complaints from the Ldfndlord or other customers

            The atmosphere however was       'simmering’ ami the landlord was asked to

            close the bar.       This he did and the ypxih was closed without further

            incident.     Resumed static points           Halifax Rd, there seemed to be a

             last minute rush of supporters yfiany running just prior to 3pm <1500).

             because of the amount         of people milling about ,in the area.           Insp.

             Townend then directed         us onto the pitch where a cordon of officers

             stretched from one side to the other.               I could see hundreds of

             Liverpool supporters milling about on the pitch.                  A lot appeared

             dazed and many were in tears, anger and frustration caused them to

             direct verbal abuse at us.            We joined the cordon and a fight started

             in the Cantilever stand with 3 other officers a group of Liverpool

             supporters were ushered back behind the              cordon.



             3.50pm <1550) a group         carrying the body of a whij^e male on a board

             still appeared chaotic. No tannoy            announcement was      made to the

             crowd.    I got the feeling that         had an announcement been made

             explaining the gravity of the situatLertl, the Liverpool supporters may

             have cleared the pitch and giveir^he emergency services a clear run.

             Finally an announcement was trade to the effect that the match had been

             abandoned.      Then Kenny Djylglii^fi appealed to the fans to co-operate,



             I waited for a P o 1i c w announcement but it never came

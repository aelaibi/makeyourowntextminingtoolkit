               w i t h my h u s b a n d ,

               My h usband was born               in                          but his father                o ri gi n at e s    from

                             C^rT
               suppo rt er s of Liv er po ol Football Club.

               W h e n we       realised that Liv er po ol          were to       play N o t t i n g h a m F o rr e s t         in the

               F.A.        Cup semi-final         at Hillsbo r ou g h,      my h us b an d a r r a n ge d to o b ta i n two

               t ickets         from his     place of employment.

               All        I can state about            the manner    in w h ic h these          tickets were o b t a i ne d

                is that         they were from N o t t i n g h a m F o r r e s t ’s allo ca ti on ,              they cost

               £ 6 . 0 0 and were for the S p i o n K op end of the H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground,                              they

               were m a i n l y y el lo w         in colour.

               On the day of the match,                   Saturday    15th April           1989     (150489),          m ys el f and

          got on a coach at the                 central             bus s t at i o n in                               it

11.00        am     (1100).      I do not know the name of the coach                               firm.

Our    j ou rn ey    commenced sh or tl y after                     we b oa r de d a nd we then t r a v e l l e d

to G r a n t h a m Bus Station,           where     the        rema in in g      passengers were              picked

up;    following       this we t ra v e l l e d along a m o t o r w a y to S he ffield.                           We did

not stop at any time during                     the j ou r n e y a n d         I did not w it ne ss a ny on e

c onsuming alcohol             on our     coach.

Although          no-one on the        coach was       drinking,             I did see other               football

s upporters         on the way d rinking            from /b ee r          cans a nd glasses.

The    s upporters         I saw,    I re co gn i se d /a s N o t t i n g h a m F o rr e st            fans    from the

scarves       that    they were wearing?              I saw some             in motor        cars as they

drew a lo n g s i d e our       coach;      they were           d ri nk in g    from cans and also,                  I saw

fans    outside       public      houses a long        the          route who were drin ki ng                 from

glasses.

Due    to the fact          that we      live qui/te close                to N o t t i n g h a m    it was easier

for us to o btain N o t t i n g h a m simport er                     tickets;       however,         as we are

          f ailed we      intended to go to the other                     end w it h the N o t t i n g h a m fans.

          not wi tn es s any P olice             or s tewar d d i r e c t i o n w hilst           entering.

          The only a ccess            points that        I saw open were               the turnstiles;            I did not

         was s cr e am i ng at          people on the other side of the fence to help me out,

         these were            camera men,        steward s a nd the odd P oliceman.                     They just

I w o u ld   consider        that     the     cause of the deaths was                  the     intense      pressure

from the back.

It a p p e a r e d to me that           the a rr a n g e m e n t s    for taking            people    to the

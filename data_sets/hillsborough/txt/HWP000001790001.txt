Dear Mr. Bounds,

Hillsborough Inquiry

On 19th February 1998, the Council debated the Hillsborough issue and came unanimously to the
conclusion that the Home Secretary should be asked to reconsider his decision not to hold a
further Inquiry.

They asked that I should write to the Home Secretary, conveying this view (copy letter enclosed),
and that an approach should be made to the other Merseyside Local Authorities, asking them to
support this view.

I should be grateful if you would let me know in due course whether your Authority agrees to
make similar representations.


Yours sincerely,




Director of Legal and Administrative Services

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough Inquiry

On 19th February 1998, the Hillsborough issue was debated at a full meeting o f Sefton Council,
whose Members represent communities immediately to the north o f the City o f Liverpool. Many
o f the 96 people who died at Hillsborough were residents of Sefton.

The Councillors expressed the unanimous view that a further Inquiry is required and resolved that
I should write to you, asking that further consideration be given to this issue.

The point was clearly made that the call for further consideration is not intended as a challenge to
the detailed findings o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, nor as a criticism o f your acceptance o f his
Report. The Council’s view is that the need for a further Inquiry arises from the application o f
democratic rather than judicial principles. Put simply, the communities o f Merseyside are still
without an explanation as to the circumstances surrounding the deaths o f so many members o f
those communities. They know, and it has been acknowledged, that the initial Inquiry was
inadequate, and there is an awareness that a fuller explanation is available which could be secured
by a further Inquiry.

It is the Council’s view that, in such circumstances, government, be it local or central, has no
option but to use every endeavour to produce the fullest explanation available. We trust that you
share this view and that you will establish a further Inquiry to provide the explanation to which the
people o f Sefton, and Merseyside in general, believe they are entitled.

Yours faithfully,




Director of Legal and Administrative Services

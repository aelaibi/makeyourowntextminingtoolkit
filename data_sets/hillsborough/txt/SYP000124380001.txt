 BEING PLAYED.

 I HAD TO PUT MY HANDS ON THE BARRIER AND PUSH MYSELF BACKWARDS TO STOP BEING

 CRUSHED AGAINST THE BARRIER,   I WOULD SAY I HAD TO DO THIS FOR A PERIOD OF AT

 LEAST TEN MINUTES UNTIL THE PRESSURE FROM BEHIND ME DECREASED.

 THE CRUSH WAS STILL EXCESSIVE UP UNTIL AT LEAST 10 MINUTES AFTER THE GAME HAD

 BEEN STOPPED.

 Q47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 THERE WAS A YOUNG BOY I SAW HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 10 OR 12 YEARS OLD, HE

 HAD A LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL SHIRT ON, HE HAD SHORT DARK HAIR,          I SAW A

 POLICEWOMAN LEANING OVER THE PERIMETER FENCE STEADYING HERSELF WITH ONE HAND

 AND TRYING TO PULL THE BOY UP WITH HER OTHER HAND.          IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE

 BOY WAS DEAD, HIS BODY WAS LIMP.

  #,
 TfflT BOY WAS POSITIONED BELOW THE OVERHANG OF THE PERIMETER FENCING AND TO THE

 LEFT OF OUR POSITION OF THE TERRACE I THINK ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH THE RIGHT

 HAND GOAL POST AS YOU LOOK AT THE GOAL FROM THE TERRACES.

 I DIDN'T ACTUALLY WITNESS THE BOY BEING CRUSHED AND DYING BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS

 TO ME AS THE POLICEWOMAN WAS LEANING OVER THE FENCE TRYING TO PULL HIM OUT OF

 THE TERRACES THAT HE HAD DIED.

 Q 48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,         IF SO BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO.

 849

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 ONLY THAT THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY TOO MANY PEOPLE GOING INTO THE TERRACES.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 3.25PM (1525)

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 oflbuR OWN ACCORD WE LEFT THE TERRACES THROUGH THE TUNNEL AT ABOUT 3.25PM

 <1525) I NEVER SAW ANY BODIES LYING IN THE TUNNEL AT THAT TIME.


G18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I ® I A S APPARENT THAT THE POLICE LEANING OVER THE PERIMETER FENCE KNEW WHAT

 WAS OCCURRING IN THE TERRACES BUT THOSE OUTSIDE OBVIOUSLY DIDN’T KNOW EITHER

 THROUGH LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS OR WHATEVER BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUS THE POLICE

 OUTSIDE WERE STILL ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ENTER THE TERRACES THROUGH THE TUNNEL.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                                             /

 ON ENTERING THE GROUND IT WAS NOTICEABLE THAT THERE WERE/VERY FEW POLICEMEN

 VISIBLE BUT AFTER THE DISASTER WE LEFT THE GROUND THROUGH THE LEPPINGS LANE

 ENTRANCES AND THERE WERE NUMEROUS POLICEMEN IN THE ^RE A ,   I WAS SURPRISED WHERE

 ALL THESE POLICEMEN HAD COME FROM BECAUSE THERE feSKMED TO BE SO FEW

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.    I THINK IT ONLY WAS USED TWICE.    I COULD HEAR   IT

       EVERYONE.

 033

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE D I D N ’T DO ENOUGH TO H E L P . THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE A LINE ACROSS

 THE PITCH. AT ONE STAGE THE GATE AT THE FRONT WAS OPENED BY THE FANS AND THEN

 THE POLICE COME & LOCKED IT.     THERE WERE NO STRETCHERS & THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH

 AMBULANCES OR FIRST AID EQUIPMENT.

 034

 I ^ T H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IT WAS BAD THE WAY THE POLICE CONTROLLED, IT.     INSTEAD OF OPENING THE GATE &

 LETTING PEOPLE OUT, THEY CLOSED THE GATE AND THREW PEOPLE BACK.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF FIRST AID FACILITIES.

 THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION.    THE FANS WERE NOT INFORMED ABOUT WHAT WAS

 GOING ON.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF POLICE AROUND THE GROUND, & THEY WERE NOT CONTROLLING

 THEM.

       PED THE INJURED.      THERE SEEMED TO BE M L A C K    OF ORGANISATION.   THE FANS DID

 MORE TO ASSIST THE INJURED THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ON THE REAR OF MY TICKET THE FOLLOWING WORDS ARE PRINTED,*             "YOU ARE REQUESTED

 TO TAKE UP YOUR POSITION 15 MINS BEFORE KICK OFF".               THIS WOULD TEND TO MAKE

 PEOPLE TURN UP TO THE GROUND L A T E R .      IN MY EXPEjjMHrNCE TICKETS REQUEST THAT YOU

TAKE UP YOUR POSITION "AT LEAST 1/2 (HALF)                  HOUR BEFORE KICK OFF
                                         5EM \
 WHEN I ATTENDED THE MATCH LAST Y E A R , MY/TICKET WAS CHECKED BEFORE I REACHED

        GROUND.   THIS DID NOT HAPPEN \TH 1ST YEAR .     WHEN I ENTERED THE INNER YARD

 FROM THE TURNSTILE I COULD NOT T U * / LEFT TOWARDS THE NORTH WEST TERRACE

 BECAUSE THE LARGE BLUE GATE IN THE YARD WAS CLOSED.               I THEREFORE HAD TO ENTER

 THROUGH THE T U N N E L .

 THE SIDE FENCES AT PENS 3 AND 4 STOPPED THE CROWD SPREADING ALONG THE TERRACES

 AND IN MY OPINION WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE DEATHS OF SUPPORTERS.

 THE FRONT FENCE STOPPED PEOPLE FROM ESCAPING ONTO THE PITCH.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THE GATES TO THE PENS TO BE OPENED BOTH AT

 THE FRONT AND THE GATES IN THE SEGREGATING FENCES.         THERE WAS A POLICE

 OFFICER UP IN THE WEST STAND WHO WAS TRYING TO STOP FANS CLIMBING UP FROM THE

 TERRACES INTO THE STAND.         IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO HIM THAT THEY WERE

 ONLY TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE CRUSH ON THE TERRACES.         THE POLICE

 THEI^jjE BEST THEY COULD UNDER/fHE CIRCUMSTANCES ITS JUST THEY S^EME^D SLOW TO

 REACT TO THE SITUATION                                 O D M ( ^    ^

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

I THINK THAT THE CROWD SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONTAINED J tk THE AREA AT THE REAR OF
                                                              c o m M
THE STAND WHEN THE GATE WAS OPENED.  IF THEY HAD JUST PREVENTED THE FANS

FROM RUSHING ONTO T H E TERRACES THERE WOULD J4AVE BEEN NO PROBLEM.        THERE

SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INFORMATION G I ^ N ^ T O THE SUPPORTERS TO CALM THEM
                                          \
DOWN.  THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED LONG ENOUGH FOR SUPPORTERS TO ALL

GET IN.       THE GATES IN THE FENCING WERE TOO NARROW THERE W E R E N ’T ENOUGH

TURNSTILES TO COPE WITH THE LARGE NUMBER OF FANS.          I CAN'T SEE THE POINT OF

Tij^^SEGREGATING FENCES WHICH I BELIEVE WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE DISASTER

AS THEY PREVENTED THE SUPPORTERS FANNING OUT TO THE WINGS OF THE TERRACING AS

MORE PEOPLE CAME IN.        THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ORGANISATION OF THE QUEUES

WAITING TO GO THROUGH THE TURNSTILES.         FANS ENTERING THE GROUND BY ABOUT

2.15 PM (1415) SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO THE WINGS OF THE TERRACING AS PENS

THREE AND FOUR WERE ALREADY FULL AT THAT TIME.          THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CHECK

OF FANS OUTSIDE THE GROUND (SOME DISTANCE XWAY) AND ANY FANS WHO DID NOT HAVE

TICKETS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM' GETTING TO THE GROUND.

 LIFELESS.       HE WAS I THINK    WEARING A RED ’T' SHIRT.

 WITH SO MANY PEOPLE REQUIRING ASSISTANCE I THINK THE POLICE OFFICERS                (THOSE

 NOT DOING SO) SHOULD HAVE         BEEN EMPLOYED HELPING THOSE IN NEED           BECAUSE EITHER

 THOUGH THEY ARE NOT EXPERTS IN FIRST AID MATTERS THEY WOULD HAVE HAD MORE

 TRAINING THAN THE AVERAGE SUPPORTER.        THE FIRE OFFICERS APPEAR MORE

      1ANISED AND HELPFUL.

SOME TIME AND THEY WERE PUSHING PEOPLE BACK IN THE PEN.

HOP.

JUDICAL INQUIRY?

  WERE DISORGANISED AND ONLY 5-6 WERE INVOLVED IN PULLING FANS OUT.

  AND DID NOT WORK AS A TEAM.


 G19

  G54

f if^THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH      YOU FEEL IS

  VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

i IN MY OPINION PENS SHOULD BE REMOVED, AND IN ORDER FOR THE        CROWD   TO SPREAD

  OUT.

  FANS SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR VALIDITY OF TICKETS SOME WAY AWAY FROM THE GROUND.

  I FEEL THAT EVEN WITH THE REMAINING SPACE IN THE OUTER WINGS,        SUPPORTERS WOULD

  STILL BE TOO MANY FOR THE PENS TO HOLD.

  FINALLY,      I THINK STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON HAND TO DIRECT PENS AWAY FROM

  FULL PENS TO AVOID THIS TRAGEDY.

  NO AUDIBLE COMMUNICATION WAS HEARD. THEY WERE TOO LATE. THERE WAS NO LIAISON

    1SELVES A FEW POLICE WERE GIVING THE KISS OF LIFE BUT THE MAJORITY WERE

STANDING AROUND IN GROUPS TALKING.       THEY COULD HAVE DONE A LOT MORE.

 G54

 IS     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHICH END OF THE GROUND SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO WHO.             I THINK LIVERPOOL

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OTHER END.       THIS WAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS LAST YEAR.

 I DID GO TO THE MATCH LAST YEAR,     I DID GO INTO THE CENTRE PENS VIA THE TUNNEL

 AND THAT WAS PACKED THEN AND I EVENTUALLY MOVED TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE PEN (7)

     Dear Chris

     With reference to the enclosed correspondence from Superintendent Hepworth:

      1.    Video Evidence

     Superintendent Hepworth refers to videos RJH1, RJH2 and MAP9 as being property o f
     Sheffield Wednesday and the BBC respectively. However, these items were exhibits at Taylor
     and the Inquest and I cannot understand why he will not release copies to the Group upon an
     undertaking not to breach any copyright which might exist. Are you able to persuade him on
     this?

     2.     The Phillips Report

     Would it be possible to copy pages 41, 56 and page 102 from your edition o f the Phillips
     Report and forward them to this office?

     Thank you for your help

     Yours faithfully

                     RE: VIDEO EVIDENCE

                     I refer to your letter dated 12 October 1997, faxed to my office on 13 October 1997, In which you
                     ask for copies of videos, references RJH1, RJH2 and MAP9. I am sorry but I am unable to
                     supply you with a copy of any of the three, without the consent of their owners, as they are
                     subject to copyright

                    RJH1 and RJH2 are the property of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, whilst MAP9 is the
                    property of the BBC. In the first instance you should approach the two organisations to ascertain
                    whether they are able and willing to supply you with a copy.

                    Alternatively, if they are unable to supply a copy but are willing for you to be provided with one,
                    then you will need to obtain their written authority before South Yorkshire Police can supply you
                    with a copy on their behalf.

                    In the latter case, there will be a charge for each video supplied.

               RE: PHILLIPS REPORT

               I refer to your letter dated 12 October 1997, faxed to my office on 13 October 1997 and headed
               "Video Evidence", in the second paragraph of which you ask me to forward page 104 of the
               Phillips Report, which was missing from the original copy which I supplied.

              I really cannot understand this for when I received the copy correspondence from the
              Assistant Chief Constable, Ian Dairies, in which he undertook to supply the report, just over a
              week had passed from him writing to you. In order to save time I forwarded to you my personal
              copy of the report, without the appendices. I can assure you that the copy of the Phillips Report
              which I forwarded to you was complete at the time it left this office.

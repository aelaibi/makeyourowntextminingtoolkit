and    lifting        them    into     the     refrigerators.              I am unable      to say exactly

how m any bodies were                  brought        to the m o r t u a r y but       I am aware        that    one

The    body was        prepared and at               this      point                        who    is a

i do    not know who was               present.          I am aware         tht she was       posi t i v e l y

identifi ed as being one                    of t he H i cks s i s t e r s .      The    body was         labelled

as    i u was      r e uur ne d .

I do    recall        that one        body a rr i v e d at the m o r t u a r y some           considerable

time after          the others.              I am unable         to assist with the           id e n t i f i c a t i o n

of this       body to the best                of my    r e c o l lection     I think we       received this

body at a p p r o ;■<imate 1y 2 030 hours.

As each       body arri v e d at the m o r tuary                  it was a c c o m p a n i e d by a property

bag as stated before and                      I believe         the medical      records a p p e r t a i n i n g       to

that    person.           There was a number                of majax      number w r i t t e n on the           leg of

each body.            I cannot        recall     any of these            numbers.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report must contain a list o f the people
whom he has seen or who have ‘representations’ to him writing.
This will include all the families with whom he has had contact
during the scrutiny - both those whom he met in private at the
Maritime Museum or in London, and those who have written to
him.

It seems rightfor this list to give the names o f the family members
who died. Otherwise it is not clear to a reader who comes new to
the subject that the people it mentions are bereaved relatives.
Mentioning the victims by name also underscores the gravity o f
what we have been about over the lastfew months.

/ attach our list. I should be gratefulfor your advice on whether
we have the victims*first names right andfor any other thoughts
you might have. We don Hwant to upset anybody.

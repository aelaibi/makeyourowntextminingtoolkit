    wiped      the   blood off my face w i t h / S            cloth w h i c h        I kept.     We then wa l k e d

    up the      tunnel      into the y a r d area,           where      there were         hundreds       of Police

    just      standing about,,          gett i m g a lot of a buse             from    people.       We    then   left

    the    ground of our           own a / c o r d t h r o u g h an open gate at twenty                   past

    three.       I did not w i tn es s any actual                    deaths    in the ground and            I did

    not as s i s t anyone          who was        dead or    injured.          I did not see a n y t h i n g        of

    a crimina 1 riature .

    We went      to a nearby side                road where we had all a r r a n g e d to meet after

    the    game.        Whe n   e v e ry bo dy    came back we w e n t .

    1 did      not a t te nd hospital             in Sheffield




    At ( t h e match       I was w ea r i n g      dark blue         jeans,    a green and blue            tracksuit

    top and training             shoes.

    It is my opin i o n          that      the Police were            very    inadequate at the game.

    T h ey seemed to have             no    proper    communication.                They handled      the

    s i t u a t i o n badly outside an d            inside    the ground,            by opening      the    gates     to

    a ll ow    people      in causing       the     crush    inside      the       pens,   and their       poor

    o b s e r v a t i o n and   response         to what was         going    on    in the   pens w hen the

    di s aste r was hap p e n i n g an d after              it happened.

    I did      not at t e n d    last years         semi-final         game at Hillsborough.

9th May 1989.

Liverpool Football Club,
Anfield Road,
Liverpool.4.


Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough.

I attended the match in the company of my son and my
colleague, ____________ and his friend,
We went in my car and we arrived in Sheffield at approximately
1.30 p.m. We parked approximately 1^ miles away from the
qround and we walked down the hill together. My colleague,
        Jand his friend were to occupy standing room in
the Leppins Lane end and my son and I had tickets for the
north stand.

My son and I got mis-directed and went to the wronq entrance,
so we were approximately 10 minutes b e h i n d H a n d his
friend in reaching the correct entrance, but we arrived in
our seats just before 2.15 and at the time of going
through the turnstiles there was no crush at all.

My son and I occupied seats 151 and 152 fairly near the
back of the grandstand. We were quite a long way from
the Leppins Lane end, but it was quite noticeable at
a very early stage that the centre section of the Leppins
Lane end was very crowded,and there was a lot of room,
m fact, gaps in both wing areas.



                                                            continued..

 I commented on that fact to my son.

 Even up to the time of the kick off and the horrific
 minutes after there still seemed to be plentry of room
 in the two wing areas. I would guess that we stayed in our
 seats until approximately 3.30 and by that time there
 were several people obviously dead laid out on "stretchers"
 on the grass in the corner of the pitch in front of us.

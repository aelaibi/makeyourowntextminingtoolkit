                                On Saturday 15 April    1989 (150489) we left

            I*m not really sure if 1 can remember the time now actually would

           have been relatively early in the morning, and arrived in Sheffield

           and about 2*3Q pm <1430)„            We did stop about two o r three miles

           outside of Sheffield for some lunch and alcohol refreshment and then

           made our way into Hillsborough.             Although I have been to the ground

           many times I d o n ’t recollect the name of the roads but we parked in
                                                                                 PAGE    2

one of the side streets near to the. gr                    w^s as I say 2*30 pm

(1430) when we finally got to thef grquj^j o r^fnar i ly we would normally
                                 \      —
have got their earlier for that ty^e^^f^match but we made a mistake

and went to the Forest end first and as a result had to make our way

back to Leppings Lane„

There was a police presence when we parked and also on the way to the

ground but once we realised we had gone wrong* we managed to find our

own way alright there was certainly sufficient            police about to ask*

We had about a fifteen minute walk to the ground,              1 did not witness on

this       route any disorder or obvious drunkeness      in this time*        When we
                                                                               /
arrived at t\y&. entrance there was a mass of people going towards the

pe r ime t e
           _r7 /&&&&?/
                    “ t he other side of the gate there was some s p r t         of

resemblance of queues going towards the turnstiles, a m o o t e d               police

officer was trying to separate the mass of people              p-rio        go i ng

through the gate but this appeared to be causing a thicker- wedge, as

more and more people arrived X was stopped by the officer from going

forward.

This would have been about twenty to three            (1440)   1 waited some

minutes       before being allowed to go forward once I was the other side
     /
jf       the mounted Police   1 realised that something was not- altogether

wrong but strange as we all seemed to be going through a large blue

 oncertina gate I co ul dn 5t understand why 1 d i d n ’t have to hand my

 icket in„        1 did not see who opened the gate, the crowd going through

gas a steady stream as opposed to a crush-             1 recollect seeing what I

believe to be a police in spector, purely because of his dress saying

or requesting for the gate to be closed,,            1 walked straight in I was

not stopped or searched and no one re qA e sJred mv ticke                 At this time

I was with            a.nd another lad cal l i d /                     The three of us
                                                       / Ail!k
decided that because we had been the year b G f & i / m fc we would head

for the wings of the terrace there were no signs or at least none that
                                                                                                   P AGh     C

IN^   1 saw       We walked over to the right of the terracing-                            When we got to

      the wing the players were already on the pitch but had., not kicked off

      I was stor'd at the back of the wings which^I                          be 1               £ ? I did

      not b ^ c ^ m e ^ ^ k r e of a n y t h i n g   for some t i m e C ^ I    recollect seeing

          BEL^J^roking              behind him all the time which was funny for a goal

       keeper? and then I saw some one running on to the captain Alan
      a/(t,30
       HANSQWjrffl then became aware of a young lad being put onto a stretcher

      on the'-'pitch.         I saw his arm fall to the side as ha was being carried

      off and realised there was a problem                                           wandered off, a few

      minutes later I decided to go and look for him,                               this would be about ;

      30 pm (1530)        I came out to the area at the back of the stand and Irhe

      tunnel,, here I saw a number of people                      possibly about a dozen persons

      lying on the ground-               I then realised more so there was a major

      problem..      All I wanted to do was to get out.,                      I made my way towards

      the concertina gate*             there was a young           lad inside the gate near the

      caught hold of me?            I tried to help?            I knelt down and put my hand under

      his head undid the belt on his jeans and the button and also his shirt

      buttons.        I noticed that his face was changing                     colour and also a

      discharge       coming from his mouth.               1 am not      a first aid person?       I

      looked around I saw a young                    lad who seemed to be going around all the

      people who were lying there                    he appeared to be profficient in his

      administering first aid and                    mouth to mouth and cardiac massage ha came

      over to me and administered mouth to mouth but aft/er a few minutes
                                                                                      /
      left him and went onto someone else*                        I cannot^/eally describe him all

      I know is that he was wearinq jeans and brown boots.
                                                                                     f«!
         I stayed with the young lad I cannot -say at that time whether he was

         dead or not.

         There were a lot of police officers              in the area?       the lad was still

         hysterical and I was just trying to do what was best*                      I caught hold of

         a police Inspector to gat some help for the young lad as I thought

         the injured person or deceased was his brother*

         The    Inspector came cvar the injured p/rson and rolled his shirt up and
                                                               ji
         over his face and ushered me gut                 th ejway ,      I tried to explain but
                                                   /"      /      -'V?
         it was f u ti l e «   1 then lef^ via/ the ^'qn »;gr't ina gate ? 1 became worried

         about the young       lady   I went fiack t ^ f i n ^ h i m     but co uld n’t.

         In my own opinion it took an interminabls time for people to realise

         the gravity of the situation,            for a major incident it appeared to me

         that no one in seniority co-ordinated the professional? services,

         either on the pitch or at the back of the goal? and that is my main

         criticism of the day*           ^   1'

         The casualty that I dealt with I am almost certain that                      I would be

         aMe    to identify him again.                                                                i

     .FFAXRS        Boose of Ocsmions in the following week.

                     THE f&LME MINISTER, said that, while the Heave Secretary1s
                     statement earlier in the week on the disaster at the Sheffield
                     Wednesday Football Club Ground at Hillsborough had recognised
                     that it would be seeraly to allcw a short delay in proceedings on
                     the Football Spectators Bill, which currently awaited its Hurd
                     Reading in the House of lords, the Government was now caning
                     under pressure to drop the Bill or to postpone it to the
                     following session. She had discussed this matter earlier that
                     learning with the Ministers most closely concerned. There ted
                          been four decades of cra*i trouble and, more recently,
                         liganism at football matches, which had led to nearly 300
                             if the Beysel Stadium disaster was taken into account,
                            numbers of police were new routinely diverted from other
                                maintain order at major Hatches and arrests for
                                connected with football were now running at about
                              year. As for hooliganism, a national membership scheme,
                     whidtf had originally been reccxmsended by Mr Justice Pcpplewell's
                     Ccnmittee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
                     Grounds,               the only comprehensive approach that had
                     been devi:      2he Government's aim had been to obtain Royal
                    Assent fo:       “ '*1 sufficiently early to enable the aembership
                     schesne to             ition in the Spring of the following year.
                     One advanrt           .t tirsetsble was that it would make it axil
                    more difficult               hooligans to obtain tickets for the
                    World Cup na-                place in Italy in June 1990, since the
                    allocation of ti            r these matches was carried out. by the
                     Football Association          would be able to refuse tickets to
                    people who had been               from the national scheme. The a m
                    did not itself                    scheme, which would have to be
                    approved by an Order                 Barliamentary debate under the
                    negative resolution p:              and the scheme was not to be run
                    by the Government; moreovi            Government had given an
                    undertaking that it would                the scheme at football
                    grounds without a proper tri;               was clearly room in these
                    procedures for taking account'            interim recosnmendations by
                    Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry,               Government had given
                    urd.erta)dLngs that it would not            with the scheme if Lord
                    Justice Taylor should reccraaend              it, thought that was not
                    in any way expected. If the Gwi            it now retreated from the
                    Bill, support would also fall away even fran the less
                    controversial proposals such as those for all-seated
                    accamaodation. The situation on crowd sa                 hooliganism at
                    football mtches cried ait for action,                   it would foe
                    appropriate to allow a short period of re:                   hew test to
                    proceed, it was for the Government to take                  prevent
                    further injury and death at football matches                .their
                    supporters prevented the necessary steps to                   Lon to be
                    taken in time for next season, they would bear a
                    responsibility.

                    In discussion the following main points were made -

                       a.   lord Justice I&ylor's present intention was to k
                       an interim report on physical measures by June or July*?
                       that it could be taken into account by clubs in pie
                       their arrangements for the following season. That interi

                                                                     1

report might also include scene ccaranents on administrative
arrangements, such as ticket allocation. Wiile the Gwerrment
could clearly not dictate to lord Justice Taylor how he
should proceed, it vreuld be perfectly proper to indicate to
him that if he had any recccsnendations to mafce about early
legislation, then they should be submitted in time to enable
the Goverrsnent to act on than.

b.    The sain reason for the current signs of faltering
 support for the Football Spectators Bill among Government
backbenchers was that proceeding with it at a rapid pace
 appeared to pre-esqpt the findings of lord Justice Taylor's
 inquiry. In fact, the disaster at Hillsborough appeared to
3 g largely attributable to basic design characteristics of
     stadium and the nature of the surrounding spaces.
           these points might seem clear with hindsight, it had
        recognised that Hillsborcwgh had generally enjoyed a
         sly good reputation hitherto. Hie problem was a
    _5lex one that merited a full analysis, and the analysis
 might make it difficult to justify a requirement for all-seat
 grounds     the incident proved to have been caused by factors
 outsi                 in question. In any event, those hostile
 to t             Spectators      Bill would certainly give evidence
 to Lo:           Taylor's     inquiry  and this would receive much
 public!           .gh.fc be difficult to prevent the inquiry
 becoming a          of the Bill, and this could be very
 difficult to            if the Bill was simultaneously going
 through the              Ccraroons.

c.   It had new           >lished that it would be possible to
add to the                itors Bill a provision enabling an
all-seated                ,be added to the Bill's licensing
provisions.                     all-seated arrangasents oould
be made pending a staf         squiresaent, however, by issuing
guidance to the local ^        ^ies that were responsible for
the licensing of football              Sarae football clubs had
in any event made known                :icn of moving towards
all-seated arrangements               liJcely that a good deal of
progress could be made wit            slation.

 d.    On the other hand, all-sea^d arrangements, like a
 ffisafoership scheme, would cost money that football clubs would
 be very reluctant to provide. On the whole, football clubs
 were wedded to the idea of lew erc              and high
 attendances and the football authori             weak and
 unreliable. It was unlikely that dela;             weal any
 consensus about measures to be taken and             be unsafe
 to have confidence in the football ^                 ises or in
 offers of support frcro the exposition

 e.    The football culture had changed ccnsiderabl;
 last 20 years or so. Ihere was new a strong lin*
 excessive drihkii^, and very often an atmosphere
 violence at major matches. No other sport required
 supporters to be segregated as did football. It was
 in sane quarters that neither a membership sdherae nor
 spgitPcI arreUWQBsnts wcsiM roaJce any difference to the 1

   entitlement to be regarded as a sport, and should be judged
   sickly as a public order problem, „

   f, in any event, it would be paradoxical if, in response to
   a major disaster, the Gwernment were to suspend action
   designed to prevent further disasters. One approach might be
   to give more esphasis to the safety aspects of its proposals,
   for exasfjl© by re-titling the Football Meafcership Authority
   as the Football Safety Authority.

THE HUME MINISTER, suntrdng up the discussicai, said that the
1fjotball Spectators Bill was based on the recrasaendations of the
      Judge - Mr Justice Pqppieweil -      had considered the
     leas associated with football. There was a very strong
       or making progress with it to provide the Goverrsoent with
        ie for carrying any urgent reocsrcae-ndations that might now
        kby lord Justice Taylor. Without such a vehicle, there
       be no way of taking any legislative action an lord
         Taylor's reocsnmandations until at least next session.
Furthermore, delay in enacting the Bill would inevitably lead to
                 the National Membership Scheme which had been
reca               Justice Pcfplewell as long ago as January
1986.               amounted to a most powerful case for
pressing an           Football Spectators Bill this session.
Although in              hi^ily charged atmosphere it would be
ri^rt to allow        od for reflection, the Government should do
all in its pcwer*            that its case was fully laTderstood.
Those      argued        ay had put forward no alternative
proposals and the            Spectators Bill offered the only way
of taking action on          tion that had becone intolerable.

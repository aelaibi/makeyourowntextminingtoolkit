                   THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
                                 BY MR TREVOR HICKS


  On 7 February 1990 Mr Hicks wrote to South Yorkshire Police Authority detailing a
  number of complaints against the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Mr P eter
  Wright.

  The allegations made by Mr Hicks, relate to press interviews given by Mr Wright about
  the Hillsborough disaster. Mr Hicks alleges th a t Mr Wright abused the privilege of his
  position, by suggesting th a t information would come to light during the inquests tha t
  would present a different picture from th a t portrayed by Lord Justice Taylor's report of
  the incident. Mr Hicks alleges tha t these comments are outside Mr Wright's jurisdiction
  and could prejudice the verdict of the coroner and inquest jurors. Mr Hicks further
  alleges th a t by inferring th a t there is additional information available which was not
  presented to Lord Justice Taylor during the public enquiry, Mr Wright seeks either to
  deliberately mislead, or failed in his duty to provide Lord Justice Taylor with such
  information.

  On 22 M arch 1990 th e South Y o rk s h ire P o lic e A u th o r it y d e c i d e d to r e c o r d th e

  decided to supervise the investigation under Section 89(2)(a) of the Act. The Authority
  approved the appointment of Chief Constable Mr Leslie Sharp of Cumbria Constabulary
  as Investigating Officer.

  The Investigating Officer's report was received by the Authority on 25 April 1990. The
  report was accompanied by 7 statem e n ts and 16 other documents including the record of
  interview with Mr Wright

  The m a tte r has been thoroughly investigated to the satisfaction of the Police Complaints

  Mr Devonside wrote to South Yorkshire Police Authority on 3 March 1990 detailing his
  complaints against the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Mr P e te r Wright.

  The allegations made by Mr Devonside relate to press interviews given by Mr Wright
  about the Hillsborough disaster. Mr Devonside alleges th at, by insinuating tha t additional
  evidence, not revealed to Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry, will show th a t alcohol played a
  major part in the tragedy, Mr Wright was apparently attem pting to protect both his
  officers and his own reputation. Mr Devonside further alleges tha t making sweeping
  statem e n ts both in and out of the press, Mr Wright was apparently attem pting to
  influence either public opinion or the minds of potential jurors.

THE COMPLAINTS
The    three      complainants      made     their      complaints   by   letter    to    the
South Yorkshire Police Authority in February and March 1990.                              The
complaints were referred to the Police Complaints Authority and on
2 April 1990 I was appointed investigating officer.


 I subsequently           saw all   three complainants          and recorded written
 statements from them in which they repeat the allegations made in
 their letters        to the South Yorkshire Police Authority.                   It should
be    noted       that    whilst    making        his    statement     of complaint         Mr

                        DEVONSIDE was accompanied by a Mr Ian HARRIS who was introduced to

                        me as a solicitor.


                 4. 3   Mr HICKS makes        seven specific complaints.                He    alleges       that Mr
                        WRIGHT has abused his privileged position as Chief Constable by
Statement File
Pages 1-5               making    public      statements,     which       have    been       reported       in    the
                        Sheffield Star newspaper, concerning the Hillsborough disaster and
                        the enquiry and reports by Lord Justice TAYLOR into that incident.
                        He also alleges that Mr WRIGHT is attempting to pervert the course
                        of justice,       particularly with        regard    to    the       pending    Coroner's
                        Inquests, by making such statements.


                 4.     Mr DEVONSIDE makes two specific complaints.                      He also alleges Mr
                        WRIGHT has abused his privileged position as Chief Constable by

Pages 6-8               making    such     public     statements     and    that    by       doing     so    he    has
                        attempted to exert persuasive influence on the judicial system.



                 4.     Mr HAMMOND makes        two    specific complaints.              He    alleges       that Mr
Statement File          WRIGHT's statements could affect the impartiality of jurors in any
Pages 9-11              related     judicial    proceedings,        and    that    by    making       such    public
                         statements      the Chief Constable has abused the privilege of his

                         rank.


                         It    should    be   noted    that   the     complaints         made    by     the       three
                  4.
                         complainants are remarkably similar in content.

d)      Abuse of Authority.


CIRCUMSTANCES
I have conducted the investigation into the complaints made by Mr
HICKS, Mr DEVONSIDE, and Mr HAMMOND with the following in mind:-


(1)     Did Mr WRIGHT make public pronouncements in line with those
        alleged to have been made?


(2)     If he did make such pronouncements, what did he say exactly?


(3)     By saying those words did he commit any criminal offence?


(4)     Also,    by    saying     those       words,    did      he    commit      a    police
         disciplinary offence?


(5)     In saying those words did             he act in any way injudiciously?


(6)     In publishing Mr WRIGHT's             words, did any other person commit
         a criminal offence?


I will       discuss   each question in turn and                 in so      doing,      I have
repeated and duplicated many of the quotations and extracts                                   for
the convenience of the reader:-


Did     Mr   WRIGHT    make    public     pronouncements          in   line     with     those
alleged to have been made?


That Mr WRIGHT was interviewed by press reporters on 5 February
 1990    is beyond     any    doubt.      There      is written evidence               from Mr
WRIGHT       himself   and    from Mr     HANNA      that   on    that      date   at    South
Yorkshire        Police       Headquarters,          Sheffield,        Mr     WRIGHT          was
 interviewed      by   Mr     HANNA    with    the     intention       of   both       that    an
 article,      based   upon    the    interview,       would     be    published        in    The
 Sheffield Star newspaper around that date.                      Further corroboration
 is supplied by Superintendent PRATT, South Yorkshire Police, who
 was present at the interview.

                It was the intention of both Mr WRIGHT and Mr HANNA to cover in
                the   interview   and    subsequent      newspaper   article,   Mr    WRIGHT's
                previously announced retirement but both knew that the subject of
                Hillsborough inevitably would be raised.


                Although neither Mr WRIGHT nor Mr HANNA say so expressly,                   they
                must be   taken to know that the subjects of the interview were
                likely to be of such public interest that other newspapers and
                media would    seek to use      the   information published     through      the
                normal press and media network for communication of information.
                In fact this proved to be the case and articles appeared later in
                other newspapers, eg The Guardian.


                The only other newspaper interview given by Mr WRIGHT on that date
Document File   was to The Times newspaper in which an article was published based
Page 29
                upon the interview with The Times reporter.            Because that article
                is not mentioned by any of the complainants, I have confined my
                investigation to the interview with The Sheffield Star and                   the
                subsequent article in that newspaper.


                If Hr WRIGHT did make such pronouncements what did he say exactly?


                Evidence is available as to the exact words used by Mr WRIGHT in
                the interview with Mr HANNA of The Sheffield Star because Mr HANNA
                made a tape recording at the time.          That tape has been transcribed
                and reveals most of the exact words used by both Mr WRIGHT and Mr
Document File
Pages 16-23     HANNA.    Some few parts of the tape are difficult to hear but no
                material part of the interview is missed because of that.                    The
                article which appeared in The Sheffield" Star oti 5 February 1990
                has   been   copied,    the   copy has    been acknowledged by        the   three
                complainants, by Mr WRIGHT and by Mr HANNA.              The Sheffield Star
                newspaper has a circulation of about 140,000 copies daily, mainly
                 in the Sheffield area.

6. 3   By saying those words did Mr WRIGHT commit any criminal offence?


 (A)   The first offence to be considered is that of Contempt of Court
       both at Common Law and in the Contempt of Court Act 1981.


       A useful definition of contempt of court is that of Lord DIPLOCK
       in Att.    Gen v Times Newspapers                (1974) A.C.           273;    (1973) 3 W.L.R.
       298; 117 S.J. 617; (1973) 3 All E.R. 54:-


                    "The due administration of justice requires first
                    that all citizens should have unhindered access to
                    the         constitutionally              established            courts     of
                    criminal           or     civil           jurisdiction             for     the
                    determination of disputes as to their legal rights
                    and    liabilities;        secondly,          that      they      should    be
                    able     to    rely upon        obtaining          in   the      courts     the
                    arbitrament of a tribunal which is free from bias
                    against any party and whose decision will be based
                    upon those          facts only that have                  been proved        in
                     evidence adduced before it in accordance with the
                     procedure adopted in courts of law;                             and thirdly
                     that,      once    the dispute has been                  submitted to a
                     court of law,          they should be able                    to rely upon
                     there being no usurpation by any other person of
                     the function of that court to decide it according
                     to law.        Conduct which is calculated to prejudice
                     any     of    these    requirements          or     to    undermine        the
                     public confidence that they will be observed is a
                     contempt of court."


       Xn the Contempt of Court Act 1981 at Section 1, there is a strict
        liability rule whereby conduct may be treated as contempt of court
        regardless of intent.


        The     strict     liability        rule    applies        to       any      speech,     writing,
        broadcast,       cable     programme       or    other     communication              in whatever
        form,    which     is     addressed    to       any    section        of     the   public.    The
        "comma" after the word 'broadcast' is omitted in the Act.
                            Continuation Form                                     Page No 8




In Mr WRIGHT's case the giving of the interview to The Sheffield
Star newspaper reporter using the words he chose to use, seems to
be covered by the strict liability rule.


For the rule to apply, however, there has to be a substantial risk
that   the    course       of    justice     will       be      seriously         impeded    or

prejudiced.


             "the risk that has to be assessed is that which
             was    created by the publication of the allegedly
             offending      matter     at        the     time     when       it     was
             published.         The public policy which underlies the
             strict    liability      rule       in    contempt       of   court     is
             deterrence.          Trial     by        (media)    is    not    to     be
             permitted in this country.                 That the risk created
             by the publication when it was actually published
             does    not    ultimately       affect       the    outcome      of    the
             proceedings is neither here nor there.


             Evening Standard Co. Ltd (1954) 1 Q.B. 578, 582.


 The proceedings       alleged to have been prejudiced can be                             in the
 criminal court or coroner's courts, but those proceedings must be
 "active" for the strict liability rule to apply, and the accused
 must know that these proceedings are "active."


 For criminal proceedings to be "active" the criteria in Schedule 1
 of the Act require specified initial steps to have been taken:-


 a)     arrest without warrant;
 b)     the issue of a warrant for arrest;
  c)    the issue of a summons to appear;
  d)    the service of an indictment or other document specifying

        the charge, or
  e)    an oral charge.
                                    Continuation Form                                   Page No 9




In     Mr        WRIGHT's      case     it    cannot      be     said     that    any     criminal
proceedings             were    "active"      so    as    to   create      strict       liability.
However,          the Coroner's         Inquests into the 95 Hillsborough deaths
were      "active"        in that the Inquests had been opened on 19 April
1989       and adjourned on 20 April 1989 and Mr WRIGHT knew that.                               I do
not       need     to    consider       any    civil     actions        which    may    have    been
commenced or stayed except to say that the definition of contempt
is wide enough to embrace improper interference with negotiations
between          parties       to   a   pending      cause       (see    Att.    Gen.     v    Times
Newspapers          (1974) A.C.         273 ante).         Section 2 of the Act limits
strict liability by reference to:-


     i)     the nature of the conduct complained of;
 ii)        the risk of interference with the course of justice;
iii)        the seriousness of the interference if it was to occur, and
 iv)       the stage reached by the proceedings.


To these I would add that there is an element of public interest
in general discussion being permitted.


The       "substantial          risk"    that      the    Coroner's        Inquests      would    be
"seriously" impeded or prejudiced does not mean that the risk must
be    weighty,          but    rather    "not      insubstantial"         and    "not    minimal."
Perhaps a more useful explanation would be that if there was a
reasonable possibility that Mr WRIGHT's pronouncements might have
seriously          impeded      or prejudiced            the verdicts       of    the    Coroner's
Inquests, then his intention one way or the other is irrelevant.


At this stage then, it seems that:-


     i)     The Coroner's           Inquests were         "active” , and Mr WRIGHT              knew
            that fact;
 ii)        Mr    WRIGHT       published      words      about     the    business       of    those
            Inquests;
iii)        If    that    publication         created     a substantial          risk    that    the
            business       and verdicts         of the Inquests would be                 seriously
            impeded or prejudiced, then Mr WRIGHT is guilty of contempt
            of court irrespective of his intention.

Because of Mr WRIGHT's national and local position and standing,
it     is    likely           that     anything      he    says     publicly       will    be     of
considerable public interest.                      The public are likely to believe
that any Chief Constable has access to,                            and knowledge of, much
information not generally known to others.                               This is particularly
so in Mr WRIGHT's                case in respect of Hillsborough.                       He is the
local       Chief    Constable.              His   police      force     had    dealt with        the
tragedy and both he and his force had been consistently in the
public spotlight throughput Lord Justice TAYLOR's enquiry, in the
Interim Report of                    the enquiry and indirectly            in the Final Report
of that enquiry.                     So clearly,     by using the de minimus rule                    of
strict        liability          for     contempt,        it      can    be     said     that     the
"substantial risk" element of contempt is present.                                 He would know
of the        substantial            circulation of The           Sheffield       Star    to whose
reporter he was speaking.                    He must have known that his words would
be read avidly by a large number of people, words which would be
repeated          in various media even though outside                         of The     Sheffield
Star        and    The    Times        the   words    published         would     be    hearsay      of
hearsay.          He would also know that some of the readers of his words
would eventually be empanelled as members of the Inquest juries.
But     whether          or      not the      substantial         risk     of prejudicing         the
 Inquests amounts to serious impediment or prejudice needs to be
 considered.             If Mr        WRIGHT's     words    were        uttered    as    part   of      a
 discussion in good faith or matters of general public                                     interest
 then they cannot                    be treated as a contempt of court under                       the
 strict liability rule if the risk of impediment or prejudice ‘to
 the Inquests is merely incidental to the discussion.


 For the strict liability rule to apply there must be proved a real
 threat to the fair conduct or outcome of the Inquests.                                     In this
 regard it has to be borne in mind that a jury is more likely to be
 swayed by prejudicial matter than a Coroner.                                  So it is always a
 serious matter to utter words publicly which may prejudice a jury
 towards a particular verdict.                       But this does not mean there should
 be no discussion,                   publicly or otherwise,             when it is simply the
 continuance             of     public       discussion        already     begun       provided      the
     continued discussion               is not used as a vehicle                  to prejudge        the
                                                                               \«

                cause.     Prejudgement      may    occur    by   a   direct        assertion   that   a
                particular verdict will be reached,               or by stating a conclusion
                about a particular issue in a case, or by making a statement which
                might make the Inquest reach one conclusion rather than another.
                The Inquests,      of course, are not adversarial so there can be no
                question, in Mr WRIGHT's case of defaming, dissuading, persuading
                or     deterring    any    particular       individual    juror,         witness,      or
                plaintiff.       The question is a difficult one which perhaps is best
                addressed by considering whether or not Mr WRIGHT's words were
                fair and accurate.


                In order to do this it is necessary to consider the exact words
                used by Mr WRIGHT to Mr HANNA,              the Sheffield Star reporter on 5
                February 1990, and not what the reporter chose to publish in the
                subsequent      newspaper article.          Although Mr WRIGHT has stated on
                more     than one occasion that the quotes directly attributable to
                him in the article are a fair reflection of the comments he made,
                they are not in the order that he made them.                   From a study of the
                full transcript of the interview it is also clear that the direct
                quotes are not in the context they were made.


                From the transcript the following matters can be confirmed:-


                         The    interview was called as a result of Mr WRIGHT's pre-
                         announced retirement from the Police Service on 1 May 1990;


                 ii)     That both he and the reporter knew that Hillsborough and the
                         Lord    Justice   TAYLOR    Interim      and   Final        Reports    would be
                         raised;


                iii)     That both Mr WRIGHT and Mr HANNA were aware of the legal and
                         other constraints acting upon them both.                    In respect of Mr

Docunent File            WRIGHT I draw attention to Home Office Circulars 79/1981 and
Pages 56-65              115/1982 which were addressed to all Chief Constables                         and
                         which relate to the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and to the
                         strict liability rule which is within it.

                 iv)   Understandably           Mr     WRIGHT          saw     a     need     to    explain          any
                       relationship between his forthcoming retirement and the Lord
                       Justice TAYLOR enquiry reports.


                  v)   Mr WRIGHT made it clear that he would go as far as the legal
                       and   other      constraints               would      allow        in respect        of       the
                       Hillsborough tragedy.                 He even drew attention to advice he
                       had    received          from       the     Police          Authority       solicitors         by

                       saying:-                  ...


                             •>....    I've          got     a    letter       from       our solicitors
                             saying that I must not discuss the detail or pass
Docunent File
                             opinions       where          under       different      circumstances             I
Page 17
                             would    like      to be        open about            it but     I can t so
                             you'll have to understand that."


                 vi)    In the interview (and in his letter of retirement) Mr WRIGHT
                       made it clear that all material and information likely to be
                        relevant      to    theTaylor              Enquiry had            been passed       to       West
                        Midlands      Police which               was    investigating          the       matter       and

                        servicing the enquiry:-


                             ".       every item of                evidence         that was available
                             was put in - and it was all brought out in the
                             open and that's what the purpose of the enquiry
Docunent File
Page 17                      was


                 vii) When        questioned           during          the     interview           he     speculated
                        reasonably         about       the       performance         of     some    of    his       senior
                        officers at the Enquiry without naming them:-


                                       I've tried to put myself in their position
                              where they were, the senior officers who'd taken
                              action       on    the        day,       being       questioned       in    great
                              detail about             the events            that took place             in ten
 Document File
 Page 18                      minutes,       quarter of an hour over a period of six
                              weeks    nearly          and not just                that but barristers,
                                         Continuation Form                              Page No 13




                           highly    trained barristers,        following each           other
                           picking and probing         for   any factors         that would
                           help their case or reduce their responsibilities
                           and officers under those circumstances naturally
                           were perhaps not themselves."


                        It is worth recalling here that the evidence given at the
                        TAYLOR Enquiry was unsworn and not subject to the rules of
                        evidence applied b.y^.the courts.


                viii)   Mr WRIGHT asserts that he was not launching an attack on
                        Lord Justice TAYLOR, choosing to refer to the Interim Report
                        rather than Lord Justice TAYLOR himself.


                 ix)    He defended his senior officers further when he said:-


                             n       Perhaps if you've made decisions,                 or taken
                             action or made decisions to take action, or made

Docunent File                decisions    not   to   take     action    and      ninety-five
Page 18                      people had been killed would you not feel a little
                             inhibited in terms of answering questions.                  But we
                             all had,    I don't know whether you can see,                 this
                             feeling of incredible sense of guilt merited or

                             not."


                   x)   An important piece of dialogue ensued which requires careful
                         scrutiny    because    it   not     only   appears       in    part     in    The
                         Sheffield   Star   article,    but    also    is   at    the    core     of   the
                         complaints against Mr WRIGHT:-


                             Mr HANNA     - "Do you feel        that    the      Sheffield or
                             Sguth Yorkshire public was as critical if you like

Document File                 as Lord Justice TAYLOR,         or do you feel that their
Page 18                       public support is not .... "
                                    Continuation Form                             Page No 14




                    Mr WRIGHT - "It's difficult isn't it.                  I mean you
                    can only go off what people tell you whether they
                    tell you one thing and someone else another but
                    there seems to be a broader understanding                       you
                     see Lord Justice TAYLOR was dealing with evidence
Docunent File
Pages 18-19          and    he    was    emphasising   the   evidence       that    was
                     available and one wouldn't expect him to do other
                     than that.         What I found difficult to understand
                     was    the    finding that      there was     drink amongst a
                     percentage of         the fans,   and that they were under
                     the    influence of drink,        but it had no        effect on
                     the    events.         I could just find       that     a   little
                     difficult to come to terms with, but that was Lord
                     Justice      TAYLOR'S     findings.      And    I     accept      his
                     findings.          He had the responsibility of coming to
                     conclusions from the evidence that was given and
                     those were the conclusions he came to.                      I think
                     his final report is a superb document.                 I think he
                     recognises all the ills that are part of football
                     and in fact were present on the day."


                  At this juncture it is worth noting that the manner in which
                  The Sheffield Star article reports this statement presents a
                  much     more provocative meaning than the reasonable words of
                  MrWRIGHT present when set out in                full.     Of course it        is
                  only the article to which the complainants had access.                       The

                  dialogue continues:-


                         Mr HANNA - "• ••• is there - I'm not trying to read
                         something you're not saying.             Is there then some
                         evidence   which     with   the   best    will    of    all    the

  Document File          parties involved was not available at the enquiry
  Page 19                on drink which might have been available or which
                         may be available in any other forums if it does
                         come to a civil case?"
                         Continuation Form                                     Page No 15




This    is an important question because                          the response          could
indicate whether or not the additional                            information,          which
the complainants allege Mr WRIGHT mischievously claimed to
have, related to the effects of drink on the fans, deceased
or otherwise.


       Mr WRIGHT replied - "I don't know."


       Mr   HANNA         -    "You've        not    been     in     charge       of
       collecting the evidence obviously."


       Mr WRIGHT - "No we've not - but - there will be
       another       hearing       and      that     will     have       been    the
       Coroner's         hearing      and     I     think it       will     be    a
       different hearing and I think a lot of evidence
       that        perhaps     -    Lord      Justice        TAYLOR       was    not
       concerned with the rules of evidence, that enquiry
       was not concerned with the rules of evidence.                             The
       Coroner's          enquiry        to       some      extent       will     be
       constrained by the rules of evidence and I think a
       different picture will emerge.                       What I'm anxious
       to     do    is    to   make      sure       that    all    the    evidence
       whatever          whether    it's      for     the    police       or     it's
       critical of the police,                    goes forward because             if
       things have been done wrongly then they must never
       happen again."


At this point Mr WRIGHT was clearly uphappy with his answer
because he next said:-


       "No.         It's not come out as I wanted to say it.
       It's almost as though - It's almost an admission
       that        they were       though I wasn't wanting                 to     say
       that."


       Mr HANNA - "Do you want the question again?"

Document File           Mr WRIGHT          - "What       I want          to    say    is    that Lord
Page 19                 Justice TAYLOR's enquiry is finished.                               It is the
                        Coroner who is now going to conduct a different
                        enquiry.           He's       going    to    go       into   detail.            The
                        Coroner's          enquiry      will        go    on     for       months       and
                        perhaps a different picture will emerge from the
                        Coroner's enquiry than emerged from Lord Justice
                        TAYLOR's enquiries."


                  It is worthy of note that this correction by Mr WRIGHT is
                  not reflected in The Sheffield Star article.                                  The dialogue
                  continues:-


                        Mr        HANNA     -    "Is    it     true       that       he     will        have
                        additional evidence?"


                  Until now there has been nothing to suggest that Mr WRIGHT,
                  by referring to additional evidence,                              is referring to fans,
                  deceased         or     otherwise,      affected by               drink.         In    fact,     Mr
                  WRIGHT's responses thus far in the interview suggest just
                  the    opposite.              The    reply    to       this    question       is       therefore

                  important:-


                        Mr WRIGHT          - "Yes there will be a lot of evidence
                        presented          to the Coroner's enquiry that                        was not
                        presented          to Lord Justice TAYLOR's enquiry which
                        mav        put     a different          complexion             on     the        end
                         product."


                  It is important to note at this point that the complainant,
                  Mr HICKS, uses part of this quotation as it appeared in the
 Document File
 Pages 4, 7, 19   Sheffield Star article.                     Although Mr WRIGHT and the article
                  use tTie word "may" , Mr HICKS ignores it in his complaint and
 Statement File   had        to     be    corrected       when       he       was      making       his        written

                   statement.

                       There is nothing in Hr WRIGHT's reply, or elsewhere in                                 the
                       transcript            of      the    interview,     which suggests            that     the
                       additional evidence would or might relate to drink but the
                       manner in which the article is presented in The Sheffield
                       Star       could      be      interpreted      that    way by     selectivity          and
                       juxtaposition in respect of the quotes.                            On the contrary
Document File
Pages 13-15            there is good evidence as to what Mr WRIGHT believed the
      30-37
      48-52            additional evidence would be in his letter dated 23 February
                       1990       to    his        Police    Authority;       in   his      prepared        typed
                       statement handed to me when he was interviewed; and in his
                       answers          to    me     at     interview.        The additional           evidence
                       referred to by Mr WRIGHT appears to be:-


                        i) the cause of the collapse of the crush barrier in Pen 3,
                       ii) the specific places where the deceased fans died,


                        - but he also has made it clear that he has no knowledge of
                       what the additional evidence might be or what effect it may
                       have on the outcome of the Inquests.                        That may not be clear
                        to a reader of The Sheffield Star newspaper, but that cannot
                       be the fault of Mr WRIGHT who has no editorial control or
                        influence over what that newspaper publishes.


                 xi)    The interview then continued as a dialogue about the Final
                       Report and Mr WRIGHT made                      it clear that he welcomed the
                        Final         Report,       specifically        correcting       the    reporter,        Mr
                        HANNA,         who lumped the Interim and Final Reports together.
                        Despite this correction,                    the article and the editorial                in
 Document File
 Page 20                The Sheffield Star newspaper do not make                            it clear to the
                        reader that Mr WRIGHT's reactions to the Final Report differ
                        understandably from his reactions to the Interim Report.

                        Whatever impression the newspaper article may leave with the
                        reader,         there       should     be    no   doubt      that      Mr    WRIGHT    has
                        reservations about the Interim Report but regards the Final
 Document File
 Pages 3, 19            Report as a "superb document".                       The complainants accuse Mr
                        WRIGHT         of    "double       standards"     because,     from     the newspaper

                     article,       they believe he describes the Lord Justice TAYLOR
                     Report        as   a   "superb   document"       but     then       criticizes     the
                     findings.          That is not the case and their misunderstanding
                     arises because of the rather sensational manner in which the
                     newspaper has used the various quotes by Mr WRIGHT, and in
                     their overriding interest in, and emphasis on, the Interim
                     Report which is the one which specifically criticizes South
                     Yorkshire Police.


                 xii) As the interview comes towards its end, Mr WRIGHT returned
                      to the constraints which are upon him:-


                             Mr WRIGHT - "I only wish that I could be more open
                             in what I've said about Hillsborough because in a
Dociment File                sense I am constrained by the legal situation that
Page 21
                             I'm    in.     But    what     I would    want    to     say      about
                             Hillsborough are those comments I would want to
                             make on Lord Justice TAYLOR's report but in the
                             circumstances I can't."


                             Mr HANNA - "I am grateful for what you have said
                             so shall we leave it at that I think."


                             Other voice - "I think you've said a lot more than
                             you've previously said about the - nothing to keep
                             you awake at night."


                      The other voice             is believe    to be       that     of Superintendent
Statement File        PRATT,       the South Yorkshire         Police Press          Officer,      who was
Page 14
                      present throughout the interview.


                 xiii) The    interview continues about Mr WRIGHT's history                            in the
                       police       service    and    his    future   plans        but    it    returns     to
                       Hillsborough as the interview concludes:-


 Document File                Mr WRIGHT - ".... please I would like to project
 Page 22                      an optimistic and positive note about Hillsborough
                                        Continuation Form                                 Page No 19




                   if you could do it that way.                          If I've not been
Document File             J
Page 22             able to deal with some of the issues in the depth
                   I would have               liked    to    and    to    say    some    of    the
                   things as strongly as I would like to it's because
                   of the constraints we're under."


                And again:-


                    Mr HANNA - "What about the possibility of a three
                    or        four   cornered     fight      as     it were       between          the
                    Council, Club and ..... "


                    Mr WRIGHT - "Well we'll certainly agree to that.
                    There'll          either     be     an    amicable          acceptance          of
                    responsibility or there will be an action - but
                    there's a lot of information to come out that's
                    not already come out."


                An explanation is provided in Mr WRIGHT's prepared statement
                and his letter dated 23 February 1990 to the South Yorkshire
                Police Authority.             He comments:-


                    "Furthermore the West Midlands enquiry on behalf
                    of H.M. Coroner has continued since Lord Justice
^feunent File       TAYLOR's enquiry concluded on 29 June                            1989,         and
 Pages 13, 31       following           the   publication          of    the    Report        on    4
                    August           expanded     to    include          enquiries      for        the
                    Director of Public Prosecutions.                           These enquiries
                        are     still    ongoing       and    may       also    produce       fresh
                        evidence.        Indeed it would be surprising if nine
                        months additional investigation did not."

                    -    %

                 Here--Mr WRIGHT must be referring to Lord Justice TAYLOR's
                 Interim Report which was presented to the Home Secretary on
                 1 August 1989 and to Parliament later that month; but Lord
                 Justice       TAYLOR's       enquiry       continued until          18 January          1990
                 when the Final Report was presented to the Home Secretary
                                        Continuation Form                                       Page No 20




                    and    to   Parliament      later    that    month.             Consequently,        any
                    relevant     evidence      coming    to     light    could          have     been   laid
                    before Lord Justice TAYLOR up to 18 January 1990.                             However,
                    between 1 August 1989 and 18 January 1990, it is true to say
                    that     Lord    Justice    TAYLOR    would         not        be    concerned      with
                    evidence coming to light in respect of individual cases, and
                     it was     in respect of those that the West Midlands Police
                    were accumulating information and evidence.


                    I conclude, therefore, that the Coroner's enquiries and the
                    criminal investigation would have uncovered evidence which
                    was not laid before Lord Justice TAYLOR between 1 August
                    1989 and the press interview on 5 February 1990.


                xiv) The final quotation which needs to be considered is almost
                    at the end of the interview when Mr WRIGHT commented upon
                    Lord Justice TAYLOR's Interim Report


                           Mr WRIGHT    - "....    I found Lord Justice TAYLOR's
                           comments about the evasion of chief officers just
Docunent File              a little harsh.        I thought it was             - some of his
Page 23
                           comments were savage, I thought, but that's how he
                           saw it.     But I think they were harsh under the
                           circumstances that the officers found."


                     That was reported in The Sheffield Star:-


Docunsnt File              "Mr WRIGHT said he thought some of Lord Justice
Page 4
                           TAYLOR's comments were "harsh", and "savage".


                     The words published in the newspaper do not do justice to
                     the actual words used by Mr WRIGHT and by their ambiguity
                     present a danger of misinterpretation among readers.


                     Clearly there are dangers inherent in press interviews under
                     these      circumstances,      particularly              as        there    has    been
                     continuing       intense     interest        in      connection             with    the
                       Continuation Form                                      Page No 21




Hillsborough tragedy.            To be absolutely safe from committing
a    contempt     of    court    the       interview       should        be    framed          as
broadly as possible and in such a way that the public and
the courts would not regard it as improper or irresponsible
behaviour.         When       proceedings         are    not     only     "active"            but
imminent     the       only    way    to     be    sure     of      being      safe          from
accusations       of contempt would be                  to avoid' any          interviews
where any matter subject to the proceedings is likely to be
raised.      If pressed,         then perhaps            a short prepared press
statement could be issued with no opportunity for questions,
supplementary          or otherwise,         to be       asked.          As    to whether
proceedings        are imminent        the    only       guidelines           of    a        legal
nature     seem     to be      the     view of       the    Director           of        Public
Prosecutions        who has      in    mind a period of about 24                         to 48
hours,     and     the    case       law     which      seems       to     suggest            that
proceedings         10 months          away would          not      be     sufficiently
proximate.        When Mr WRIGHT gave his interview on 5 February
1990 he was under the impression that the Coroner's Inquests
would not be           re-opened until            the    summer of         1990         or    even
early in 1991.


During the interview he neither identified nor referred to
any individual except perhaps Lord Justice TAYLOR and even
then only by reference to his                      Interim and Final Reports,
both of which are public documents.                             The      information and
opinions expressed by Mr WRIGHT were neutral to the extent
that no individual was referred to by name,                               and no direct
implication as to the guilt or blame of anyone was made.
Neither     can    it be       said that Mr WRIGHT                  commented upon or
discussed        the     evidence      which       will        be     laid     before          the
Coroner, other than in very general terms.                            There is nothing
 in the words used by Mr WRIGHT which can be construed as
 inaccurate, unfair, irresponsible or unjust.


 I am firmly of the view that the strict liability rule does
not apply in this case and there is therefore no requirement
    for the papers to be submitted to the Attorney General.                                     If
                              Continuation Form                                     Page No 22




       that be so, then for Mr WRIGHT to be guilty of a contempt
       under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, or at Common Law,                                    it
       will be necessary to prove an intention or calculation on
       his    part     to     impede      or   prejudice        the       administration          of
       justice.          Outside         of    the     strict       liability            rule    the
       proceedings likely to be prejudiced or impeded could include
       any    criminal        as     well      as     civil    proceedings,              including
       Coroner's Inquests.               Although the contempt alleged against
       Mr WRIGHT is not caught by the strict liability rule of the
       Contempt of Court Act 1981 because it cannot be shown that
       the course of justice in question will be seriously impeded
       or prejudiced, that does not mean that Mr WRIGHT cannot be
       liable for contempt of court in respect of conduct intended
       to     impede     or    prejudice        the     administration              of    justice.
       Indeed, Section 6(c) of the 1981 Act expressly provides so.
       The court has           the power to commit for contempt where                            the
       intention         is    specifically            intended        to     prejudice          the
       administration of justice.                     In Mr WRIGHT's             case no         such
       intent has ever been expressly avowed or admitted, so if it
       is present it has to be inferred from all the circumstances,
       including       the     foreseeability          of     the     consequences          of    the

       conduct.


       Finally,        the    contemptuous           intent     need       not     be     the    sole
        intention of the contemnor.


There are a number of established facts from which we can deduce
the intention of Mr WRIGHT when using the words he did during the
interview with Mr HANNA on 5 February 1990:-


  i)    The    interview           was   ostensibly      in    respect        of    Mr     WRIGHT's
        recently announced retirement                    on 1 May           1990,       and not    in
        respect of Hillsborough.                    However, as discussed previously,
        Mr WRIGHT must have known that Hillsborough would almost
        certainly be raised during the interview.                             Indeed it seems
        clear     that       one    of   the motivations            was     for Mr WRIGHT           to
        explain the relationship between his retirement and the Lord
        Justice TAYLOR Report.

                ii)   During the interview with Mr HANNA it was made clear by Mr
                      WRIGHT that he was constrained as to what he could say about
                      the Hillsborough tragedy;                  the Lord Justice TAYLOR enquiry;
                      the Interim and Final Reports; and the Coroner's Inquests.
                      That    is not       conclusive         of innocent        intention,          of course,
                      because Mr WRIGHT did, in fact, discuss all of those issues
                      with    Mr     HANNA.            Superintendent PRATT,                present        at    the
Doconent File         interview,         spontaneously remarked               that Mr       WRIGHT had said
     21               more    than he had. ever said before about Hillsborough but
                      nothing to keep him awake at night.                             However,        Mr WRIGHT
                      would be       aware       of    the Home        Office    Circulars       79/1981         and
 rwxment File         115/1982;      he confined himself to                   general       comments without
      56-65           mentioning any specific evidence,                       additional or otherwise;
                      he   identified no              individuals by name             or otherwise             except
                      Lord Justice TAYLOR; and when he speculated,                             gave opinion,
                      or put forward possibilities, he made this clear by using
                      words       like    "may"       or   "I've      tried     to put      myself        in    their
                      position ..." or "perhaps".                       On the other hand,            there are
                      two examples in the interview where the reporter seems to
                      have    finished        with         Hillsborough       and     the     possibility          of
                      additional evidence being available at the Inquests which
                      was not available to Lord Justice TAYLOR, and yet Mr WRIGHT
                       for no apparent reason returns unprompted to these issues



Jkcunent File                Mr     HANNA    -    "You've             not   been      in     charge        of

                             Mr WRIGHT - "No we've not - but - there will be
                             another       hearing         and     that •will        have     been        the
                             Coroner's       hearing         and       I    think     it will        be     a

                             was not concerned with the rules of evidence.                                The
                             Coroner's        enquiry            to    some      extent       will         be
                             constrained by the rules of evidence and I think a

                    things have been done wrongly then they must never
                    happen again."


                    Mr HANNA - "Moving on from that."


                    Mr WRIGHT - "No it's not come out as I wanted to
                    say it.        It's almost as though - it's almost an
                    admission that they were though I wasn't wanting
                    to say that."


                    Mr HANNA - "Do you want the question again."


                    Mr WRIGHT        - "What      I want       to     say   is    that Lord
                    Justice TAYLOR's enquiry is finished.                         It is the
                    Coroner who is now going to conduct a different
                    enquiry.        He's going to go into the detail.                      The
                    Coroner's        enquiry      will    go     on     for      months    and
                    perhaps a different picture will emerge from the
                    Coroner's enquiry than emerged from Lord Justice
                    TAYLOR's enquiries."


                 These answers gave the reporter the incentive to pursue the
                 "additional evidence" question,               which was reasonable under
                 the circumstances.        And again:-


                     Mr HANNA - "The football authorities.have perhaps

                     Mr WRIGHT - "That's a matter                   for football and if

                    matters is Hillsborough.             Can't escape it can I."


                    Mr HANNA - "No.            On the other hand,         I think this
                    morning I wanted to look at Hillsborough,                    I mean

                    other aspects."


                    Mr WRIGHT      - ” I only wish that I could be more
                    open in what I've said about Hillsborough because
                    in a sense I am constrained by the legal situation
                    that I'm in.            But what I would want to say about
                    Hillsborough are those comments                 I would want to
                    make on Lord Justice TAYLOR's report but in the
                    circumstances I can't.”


                 Once again the opportunity is given for the reporter to re­
                 open his questioning on the "additional evidence" issue.


                 And finally:-


                     Mr HANNA - "Just quickly looking through.                       I mean
       it File
                     I didn't particularly want to go over the miners'

                     Mr WRIGHT - "Whatever you want                 ... What I'd like
                     to   do    ....    please        I would    like   to    project    an
                     optimistic and positive note about Hillsborough if
                     you could do it that way.                  If I've not been able
                     to deal with some of the issues to the depth I
                     would have liked to and to say some of the things
                     as strongly as I would like to it's because of the
                     constraints we're under."

                Here    the    reporter has          moved      on to    other matters         but     Mr
                WRIGHT's response re-opens the Hillsborough issues.


                However, when asked directly by Mr HANNA if there was some
                evidence of drink which was not available to Lord Justice
Document File
Page 19         TAYLOR but would come out subsequently, Mr WRIGHT replied:-


                       "I don't know."


                That is not the answer of someone who has a malicious intent
                to prejudice the Inquest verdict.                      It is questionable as to
                whether Mr WRIGHT would have allowed Mr HANNA to tape-record
                the    interview        if    it was      his    intention      to    influence        any
                subsequent proceedings, and similarly it is unlikely that he
                would have       allowed Superintendent PRATT to be present                             to
                witness it.       Those acts seem to indicate quite the contrary,
                i.e. no criminal intention.


                There    does     not      appear     to be      any    evidence      of a     specific
                intention on Mr WRIGHT's part to prejudice any proceedings.
                But     should he have foreseen that consequence as a result of
                his     interview?         He is    a very experienced police officer and
                Chief     Constable          of    long-standing.         He    must be        taken    as
                having        knowledge       of      Home      Office    Circulars       79/1981 and
                 115/1982.            He      is    aware       that     in    his     position        his
                pronouncements and opinions are of wide public interest.                                He
                 must have known that whatever reason was given for a press
                 interview,      Hillsborough was certain to be raised and that
                 any    response,          statement      or     opinion       in    respect    of     the
                 disaster, the enquiry, the Interim and Final Reports, would
                 be     read     avidly       by      a   considerable          percentage       of the
                 population and that some potential jurors                           at the Inquests
                 were likely to read the newspaper reports of the interview.
                 Such was the weight that would be put on what he said that
                 there     was    a     likelihood        that     it    could       influence       their
                 decision as jurors.                I put this to Mr WRIGHT at interview

                 and he replied:-

     "I    don't think having regard to what I                       said that
     it fell     into       any       of those        categories.         I    have
     simply     said        that       additional        evidence        may        be
     forthcoming       and        that     I    hoped       it   would        put     a
     different complexion on the public perception.                                   I
     have not said what the additional evidence will be
     and I     think       it    incredible           in the     light of           the
     weeks     of discussion and public                     statement during
     the TAYLOR enquiry, media and individual comment
     afterwards        in       the    press     and    the      First    Tuesday
     television        programme,              that    my     reasonable            and
     necessary statement could possibly influence the
     course of any judicial proceedings."


     Mr SHARP - "Why did you regard it as necessary?"


      Mr     WRIGHT    -    "As       a   Chief       Constable     during          the
      course of these events I have been unable to avoid
      press questions and in addition to all my other
      responsibilities there is one of maintaining the
      morale of the South Yorkshire Police.                              The views
      expressed are the views held within the Force and
      it is right in my view that the public should be
      aware of them."


      Mr SHARP - "Even if the effect of these statements
      may be      to    influence people within                    the    judicial

      process."


          Mr WRIGHT - "I don't see how they can"


It    is worth        repeating           that Mr WRIGHT had no                     control    or
influence over what was printed in The Sheffield Star.                                        One
can speculate that he should have realised or expected that
The Sheffield Star would not print everything he had said
and would present the words in the most sensational manner
possible.        That is no more than speculation.

From    a    close    study       of   the    full    transcript there is           no
evidence       that    Mr    WRIGHT     was    intending       to   influence      the
Inquests or any other proceedings; there is no evidence to
show that he should have foreseen that any proceedings would
be influenced;         and indeed in view of the wide coverage of
Hillsborough          on    television,        radio,    national      and        local
newspapers, there is no evidence that any proceedings would
likely,      or even possibly, be influenced by what Mr WRIGHT
said at the interview.


Idraw       attention to the           submission made         to   LordJustice
TAYLOR by Mr WOODWARD Q.C.                   during the Public Inquiry,              on
behalf of the South Yorkshire Police.                     It appears on pages
28 and 29 of the evidence and was made on 14 July 1989.


Although the following extract                  is out of any context               the
words stand alone, were known to Mr WRIGHT, and are relevant
to what he        said during the             interview with Mr HANNA on 5
February 1990;-


       "CRUSHING
       Given the propensity in                the terraces for fans          to
       sway, surge and move and that such actions are,                       it
       is    arguable,       in    themselves        potentially      highly
       dangerous (whether or not any barrier fails should
       anyone    lose       their footing or          faint) , it may be
       difficult to form any reliable view as to how and
       when any particular injury or death was in fact
       caused.        The situation may be simple or may be
       highly complex, but the substantial injuries and
       death would appear to have been sustained in Pen 3
       and below the area protected by barrier 124A.                         To
        arrive at a view that because people went into the
        tunnel   upon       the    opening     of Gate     C    injuries     or
        death were thereby caused would require a detailed
        investigation the like of which has not,                      on the
        occasion of this Inquiry, been attempted.                     Whilst
                               Continuation Form                                     Page No 29




              perhaps        convenient        and        for    certain           purposes
              attractive such a simplistic view would not, it is
              submitted be justified.                This has not been a trial
              nor   is       there,      it    is     submitted,        the        material
              available upon which such conclusions might even
              be tentatively based.                 Whilst it may be considered
               that notions such as the burden and standard of
               proof may impede the enquiry process, the fact is
               that they have not featured and that what has been
               done has been done whilst                    evidence         and    further
               material       are     still    being       sought       and    gathered.
               Speculation will not suffice although                           it may be
               interesting          to    ponder          what        satisfactory or
               sufficient          explanation        or    explanations            can   be
               given for, as appears to be the case, some deaths
               having occurred to individuals who may have come
               in at the second opening of Gate C.                            The enquiry
               cannot it is submitted permit the conclusions post
               hoc ergo propter hoc.


               As to the positions in which people may have died
               we urge that,           as has been indicated will be the
               case,     there        should    be     taken          into    account the
               material supplied by the South Yorkshire Police in
                relation to Pen 3."


      The words          are different from those used by Mr WRIGHT but
      they certainly seem to be a basis                                for what hesaid on             5
      February 1990.


          I   therefore       conclude        that    there      is    no     evidence        that   Mr
      WRIGHT has             committed any contempt of court,                         either under
          statute or at Common Law.


It   is       necessary       to    consider        the    Common       Law    misdemeanour          of
attempting to pervert the course of public justice.                                  There is some
overlap with           the    contempt        of court      offence but             the perversion
                             Continuation Form                                  Page No 30




offence can be separate and distinct.                   It amounts to the wrongful
obstruction of the course of justice; defeating the due course of
justice; interfering with the administration of justice; defeating
the ends of justice; but since 1975 the offence has been known by
one title, perverting the course of justice.                       It is indictable as
is an attempt to pervert the course of justice.                            In Mr WRIGHT's
case, because the proceedings have yet to take place                                    it is an
attempt to pervert the course of justice that we must consider.


The word attempt in this context is misleading but is convenient
to use in a case where it cannot be proved that the course of
justice is actually perverted.               The real offence here is the doing
of some act which has a tendency and is intended to pervert the
administration        of   justice.          However,       to   do   an      act       with    the
intention of perverting the course of justice is not enough,                                    the
act must also have that tendency.


It is not necessary to assess the conduct of the accused in terms
of proximity to an ultimate offence (as is generally necessary in
respect of criminal          attempts), it is necessary to consider                             the
tendency of the conduct and the intention of the accused.                                       The
prosecution     does       not    have       to     prove     that      the     tendency         or
possibility in fact materialised but there must be a possibility
that what      the    accused      has      done    "without     more"        might      lead    to
injustice (R v MURRAY (GE) (1982) 2 All E.R. 225CA).


 The offence is wider than the contempt of court offence already
 considered because it includes police investigations in progress
 which might bring proceedings                about.        (R v      SELVAGE and MORGAN
 (1981)   73   Cr.    App.      R333    C.A.).       However,      the question            of   the
 imminent nature of those proceedings is relevant.                             The position,
 status   and        influence         of   the     accused      is     also        a     relevant
 consideration        as   to    whether       an    offence      has      been         committed.
 Although there is some suggestion that in cases which involve the
 publishing of matter likely to interfere with the fair conduct of
 a trial it may be that ignorance of the possible consquences is no
 excuse and intention is irrelevant (see R v ODHAMS PRESS LTD ex.p.
                             Continuation Form                               Page No 31




Att.-Gen. (1956) 3 All E.R. 484), the position is not clear so the
Contempt of Court Act test presumably would be applied.


The considerations          in respect of this offence are no different
from those considered previously in respect of contempt of court.
There is no       evidence that Mr WRIGHT intended to pervert the course
of justice,       and there is no evidence that his conduct might have
perverted the course of justice.                   That is so in respect of the
Coroner's       Inquests,     the     criminal      investigation       or     any     civil
actions laid or stayed.


The     final     offence         to be   considered        is   that     of    culpable
malfeasance.          Everymalfeasance         or culpable       non-feasance         of an
officer of justice, which includes a police officer, in respect of
his office, is a misdemeanour at Common Law.                     The case-law arises
predominently from very old cases which arose out of failure to do
things required to be done because                     of the accused's      office,     (see
CROWTHER's CASE (1593) Cro. Eliz. 654                    andR v WYAT (1705) 1 Salk
380).     The cases indicate there is an offence of a public officer
wilfully neglecting to perform a duty which he is bound to perform
by common law or statute but the neglect has to be wilful and not
merely inadvertent.           It has to be culpable in the sense of being
without     reasonable       excuse       or     justification.         In     this    sense
culpability is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty but has
 to be of such a degree the misconduct impugned is calculated to
 injure the public interest.               It would be for the jury to decide
whether the evidence revealed the necessary degree of culpability
 in performing a duty badly which would include "neglect of duty".
 (R v DYTHAM (1979) 2QB 722).


 It does not appear to be necessary                    to prove that by so doing, or
 not doing, ^fhe accused intended to gain some personal benefit or
 advantage      But    it   may     be    that    in    appropriate     cases,        e-g-   a
 Registrar, there must be a beneficiary to whose interest there has
 been no proper regard.

From the evidence and discussions earlier I conclude there is no
evidence to prove culpable misfeasance or malfeasance against Mr
WRIGHT.


Conclusion of investigation into criminal allegations


From my investigation and consideration of the criminal matters
which arise from the complaints against Mr WRIGHT I am satisfied
that    there     is no       evidence       that he has        committed any                criminal
offence     and      there    is   no    reason       to    submit    the     report          to    the
Attorney General in respect 6f strict liability under the Contempt
of Court Act 1981, nor to the Director of Public Prosecutions in
respect of general criminal matters.


In saying those words, did he commit a disciplinary offence?


The    relevant        regulations           are     the    Police        (Discipline)(Senior
Officers)       Regulations        1985.           By virtue    of    Section          105    of    the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, all police officers and the
Police Complaints Authority are required to have regard for the
Home Office Guidance to Chief Officers on Police Complaints and
Discipline        Procedures          1985.          Regulation       4(1)        of     the        1985
Regulations        has       the   effect      of     applying       to     senior       officers,
including       Chief        Constables,       the     Discipline          Code    set        out     in
Schedule 1 of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.                                       Because
there     is    no     special        provision       within     that       Code       for     senior
officers,       clearly        some     of    the     disciplinary         offences          are     not
applicable to a Chief Constable or are inappropriate.


Section 84(5) of the Police                    and Criminal Evidence Act                       1984makes
 it clear that the complaints system is not applicable to matters
affecting       the    direction        or     controlof       the    force by          the        chief
 officer.         It is the conduct of the chief officer which can be
 reviewed not the exercise of the wide discretion vested in him.


 The    disciplinary          authority        in Mr       WRIGHT's       case     is the          South
 Yorkshire Police Authority which is required by Regulation 7(1) of
                                             Continuation Form                                Page No 33




                 the 1985 Regulations on receipt of my report, to consider whether
                 disciplinary proceedings need to be taken.                       Such a decision will
                 be dependent upon a statement from the Police Complaints Authority
                 that my investigation has been conducted to the satisfaction of
                 the    Police    Complaints    Authority      and     specifying      any    respect     in
                 which it was not so conducted.


                 In the case under discussion the following complaints have been
                 made against Mr WRIGHT:-


Statement File     i)    Abuse    of    the privilege       of his     position.        (Mr HICKS,       Mr
Pages 1-11               DEVONSIDE and Mr HAMMOND);


                  ii)    He   publicised       information which           was     confidential     until
Document File
Pages 7-10               deemed otherwise by H.M. Coroner.                 (Mr HICKS);


                 iii)    He prejudges the verdict of the Coroner which is outside his
                         (Mr WRIGHT's) authority and insults the jurisdiction of the
                         Coroner's office.          (Mr HICKS and Mr DEVONSIDE);


                  iv)    He   could     prejudice     the    Inquest       jurors.      (Mr    HICKS,     Mr
                         DEVONSIDE and Mr HAMMOND);


                   v)    He has failed to do his duty by failing to make available to
                         Lord     Justice    TAYLOR    all    material        information       about    the
                         Hillsborough tragedy.          (Mr HICKS and Mr HAMMOND);


                  vi)    He has    withheld     from   "us" material which             relates    to     the
                         consumption of intoxicating drink by football spectators at
                         Hillsborough.        (Mr HICKS and Mr DEVONSIDE);



Statement File   vii)    He deliberately misleads when he says that there is new or
Pages 1-11               additional       information which          was    not    considered     by    Lord
Document File            Justice TAYLOR,        an offence      under the          discipline    code,     or
Pages 7-10
                         worse.        (Mr HICKS and Mr HAMMOND);
                             Continuation Form                               Page No 34




viii)   He   is    guilty    of    double   standards        by   referring      to     the
        findings      of the      Lord Justice     TAYLOR     report     as a    "superb
        document"      yet    persisting     in    a     claim    that    the    primary
        conclusion was wrong.           (Mr HICKS);


  ix)   He devalues trust and faith in the judicial system.                             (Mr
        DEVONSIDE);


   x)   He has made statements which are derogatory to those who
        lost their lives at Hillsborough.                (Mr HAMMOND);


  xi)   He   has   deliberately        attempted    to    distort      the    course     of
        justice.      (Mr HAMMOND).


 The disciplinary offences which have to be considered in respect
 of these complaints are as follows:-


   i) Discreditable Conduct
        Being a member of the South Yorkshire Police Force acted in
        a    manner    reasonably       likely     to    bring    discredit        on    the
        reputation of the force or the police service.
        Contrary to Regulation 5, Schedule 1 - Paragraph 1, Police
         (Discipline) Regulations 1985.


  ii) Falsehood or Prevarication
         Being a member of the South Yorkshire Police he knowingly or
         through neglect made a false, misleading or inaccurate oral
         statement required for police purposes.
         Contrary      to    Regulation     5,    Schedule    1   - Paragraph           5(a),
         Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.




  iii) Improper Disclosure of Information
         Being     a member       of   South Yorkshire        Police     without      proper
         authority communicated to any person, any information which
         he had in his possession as a member of a police force.
                           Continuation Form                         Page No 35




       Contrary    to    Regulation    5,   Schedule   1   -   Paragraph   6(a),
       Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.


iv)    Abuse of Authority
       Being the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police and in
       the execution of his duty did publish words without good and
       sufficient cause in such a way as to be oppressive, abusive,
       or uncivil to any member of the public.
       Contrary    to     Regulation   5,   Schedule   1   - Paragraph     8(c) ,
       Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.


I will consider each of those disciplinary offences in turn:-


  i)   Discreditable Conduct
       Proceedings for such an offence should be brought sparingly
       and whenever possible a more specific charge should be laid
       under one of the other paragraphs of the discipline code.


       The facts in Mr WRIGHT's case are not distinct from those
       underlying any other possible charges so it should not be
       additional to any of those other charges.


       The offence is committed where an officer acts in a manner
       likely to bring discredit on the reputation of the police
       force or service.         Clearly Mr WRIGHT's action in giving the
       press interview to The Sheffield Star (and other interviews)
       was known about outside the force and at least some of his
       words      used     in   the    interview   were     public     knowledge.
       Consequently it would be necessary only, to show that his
        giving of the interview and the words used were reasonably
       likely to bring discredit.            Because    the complainants have
       personal knowledge of The Sheffield Star interview, although
        the re"'are passing references to other media and The Guardian
        newspaper,       I do not consider that        the alleged misconduct
        consists of a continuing state of affairs and have confined
        my consideration to the single action of The Sheffield Star
        interview and subsequent publication.              Although I am aware
                     Continuation Form                                     Page No 36




that       Mr    WRIGHT     addressed        the     South        Yorkshire          Police
Federation Meeting on 4 April 1990 and used words similar to
those used in his interview with The Sheffield Star, at the
time I interviewed the three complainants none of them were
aware of what he had said at that meeting and none of them
made any complaint about it. I am unaware of any complaints
made by anyone about the meeting on 4 April 1990.                                Neither
am I aware of any complaints made about the Sheffield Star
interview on 5 February 1990 and subsequent article other
than those of Mr HICKS, Mr DEVONSIDE and Mr HAMMOND although
Mr HICKS inferred that some of the other bereaved relatives
shared his concern about Mr WRIGHT'S actions.


It is not easy to see how Mr WRIGHT'S giving of an interview
on     5    February       1990     can   be      proved     to    be     in    any     way
discreditable.            Mr WRIGHT has been at the forefront of the
Hillsborough tragedy since it occurred on 15 April 1989, and
particularly         so     since     the      publication         of    Lord        Justice
Taylor's Interim Report in August 1989.                           He has been asked
questions in the public part of the South Yorkshire Police
Authority         Meetings;       the       First    Tuesday        documentary             by
Yorkshire        Television was broadcast                on Tuesday         6 February
1990;       national       and    local        newspapers         have     consistently
reported and discussed the facts and issues surrounding the
tragedy;         there     have   been      numerous       television          and     radio
broadcasts         about the matter, and most of this before                                the
 Sheffield Star interview on 5 February 1990.                              Although it
was subsequent to this event, the BBC television documentary
 broadcast on Tuesday,              10 April 1990 ,presented a frank and
 fairly         detailed     picture        of     the     West     Midlands          Police
 investigation            including         the     relationship         between            the
 football supporters and alcohol.


 Mr    WRIGHT      had     announced      his      retirement       from       the    police
 service and it was a natural consequence of that for media
 interviews to be sought.                   As discussed previously he would
 have      known    that Hillsborough would be                    raised at          such    an

                interview,    but    that    is   not   to    say     that       he   should      not,
                therefore,    have given the interview.                Again,         as discussed
                previously, he would have known that reports of interviews
                by Chief Officers       can be presented              in such a way            as   to
                distort the meaning of the interviewee, but that is not a
                reason to avoid the interview at all costs.                           Provided the
                words are chosen carefully by the interviewed Chief Officer
                there    should be     nothing     to   fear.         Mr WRIGHT         is   a very
                experienced Chief Constable and from a study of the complete
                transcript he was circumspect enough to justify his giving
                of the    interview.         It could be          argued that a much more
                misleading picture would have emerged if he had refused to
                participate in the interview or had answered the questions
                about Hillsborough with           "No   comment” or similar words                    to
                that effect.


                Additionally,       it must be said that as Chief Constable                          of
                South Yorkshire        Police he has          a     duty    to    respond      on   its
                behalf.      In the words of Mr WRIGHT:-


                        "It is essential for the well-being and morale of

Docunent File           the Force that officers see someone giving public
Page 32                 expression     to     their     views,        and        it    is    my
                        responsibility as Chief Constable to do so.


                And again:-


                        "Given that additional evidence will be produced
                        and having regard to my role as spokesman for the
                        South Yorkshire       Police,    I see nothing wrong in
                        expressing     the     belief        that     this        additional
                        evidence may put a different complexion on the
                        end product"


                 And again:-

                   Mr WRIGHT       - "As       a Chief         Constable       during       the
Document File
                   course    of    those       events     I have       been     unable       to
Page 51
                   avoid press questions and in addition to all my
                   other     responsibilities                  there      is        one      of
                   maintaining       the      morale      of    the    South Yorkshire
                   Police.        The views expressed are the views held
                   within the Force and it is right in my view that
                   the public should be aware of them."


                   Mr    SHARP      -       "Even    if    the        effect    of        these
                   statements may be to influence people within the
                   judicial process."


                   Mr WRIGHT - "I don't see how they can."


                   Mr SHARP - "Would you go so far then, with the
                   benefit of hindsight to say perhaps your comments
                   were injudicious."


                    Mr WRIGHT - "No.             I don't withdraw any of them.
                    I cannot be responsible for leaps of imagination
                    of those who choose to misinterpret what I said.


                    Mr SHARP - "So everything you said to The Star
                    was either true fact or true opinion."


                    Mr   WRIGHT         -    "Yes.      What     I     said    in    all     the
                    interviews          I    gave    represented          my    views        and
                    opinions       as       spokesman     for    the- South Yorkshire
                    Police."


                It is my view      that by agreeing to, and giving theinterview
                with Mr HANNA of The Sheffield Star, even though                              Mr WRIGHT
                must have known Hillsborough would be raised and that the
                press do not always print what was actually said, he did not
                act in a manner likely to bring discredit upon the force or
                the police service, neither did he "abuse the privilege of

                his position."
                   Continuation Form                                    Page No 39




Bearing in mind Mr WRIGHT had no editorial control of what
was printed, a study of the complete transcript of what was
said at the interview by Mr WRIGHT indicates he chose his
words carefully.         When the full context and order of the
words used are compared with the quotations in the newspaper
article it becomes understandable as to how the complainants
misinterpreted Mr        WRIGHT's      meaning.          Anyone     with       just    a
passing knowledge of the Hillsborough tragedy who read the
published article j.s likely to interpret the reference made
by Mr WRIGHT to "additional information", to mean that the
additional evidence referred to alcohol consumed by those
who died at Hillsborough.             When bereaved relatives read the
words the misunderstanding becomes even more acute.                             From a
detailed study of the transcript it becomes clear that Mr
WRIGHT said no such thing.                   I have already discussed the
precise nature of the "additional evidence" earlier in this

report.


It is difficult to see how the actual words used can be seen
as prejudging      the verdict          of      the   Coroner.      As     discussed
previously,     there     can    be    no       doubt    that    information          not
available to (or required by) Lord Justice TAYLOR will be
presented at the Inquests.              It follows, therefore, that the
 outcome of the Inquests will be in doubt until the final day
but that would be the case with, or without any "additional
 information."     Certainly I cannot find any prejudging of the
 Inquest verdict by Mr WRIGHT.                  He did express an opinion at
 the interview when he said:-


      Mr   HANNA     -    "You've       not       been    in     charge       of
      collecting the evidence obviously."


      Mr WRIGHT - "No we've not - but - there will be
      another    hearing        and    that       will    have    been        the
      Coroner's     hearing       and       I    think    it     will    be     a
      different hearing and I think a lot of evidence
      that    perhaps      -    Lord     Justice         TAYLOR    was        not
             Continuation Form                                     Page No




concerned     with        the    rules       of     evidence,           that
enquiry     was    not     concerned         with    the        rules     of
evidence.     The Coroner's enquiry to some extent
will be constrained by the rules of evidence and
I think a different picture will emerge.                            What
I'm anxious to do is to make sure that all the
evidence whatever, whether it's for the police or
it's critical of the police goes forward, because
if things have been done wrongly then they must
never happen again."


Mr HANNA - "Moving on from that."


Mr WRIGHT - "No it's not come out as I wanted to
say it.       It's almost as though,                 it's almost an
admission that they were though I wasn't wanting

to say that."


Mr HANNA - "Do you want the question again."


Mr WRIGHT         - "     What I want to say is that Lord
Justice TAYLOR's enquiry is finished.                          It is the
 Coroner who is now going to conduct a different
 enquiry.     He's going to go into the detail.                           The
 Coroner's        enquiry       will    go    on     for    months        and
 perhaps a different picture will emerge from the
 Coroner's enquiry than emerged from Lord Justice
 TAYLOR's enquiries.


 Mr   HANNA       -       "Is    it true that             he will        have
 additional evidence."


 Mr   WRIGHT          -     "Yes, there will              be a     lot     of
 additional        evidence       presented         to    the    Coroner's
 enquiry that was not presented to Lord Justice
 TAYLOR's         enquiry       which    may        put    a     different
  complexion on the end product.

                  but     those        words    cannot      be     interpreted             as     being    a
                prejudging of the Inquest verdict.


                Whether    or not       Inquest     jurors       could be        influenced by            Mr
                WRIGHT's words has been addressed earlier in this report.
                Bearing in mind the televising of the tragedy itself;                                     the
                public    nature          of Lord       Justice        TAYLOR's        enquiry;           the
                publication       of    the    Interim      and        Final    Reports;           and    the
                intense     media      coverage     which     followed         the    event        and    the
                enquiry; all of which occurred prior to the interview on 5
                February 1990,         it is difficult to see how Mr WRIGHT could
                prejudice or influence the Inquest jurors, none of whom had
                been     selected         at the     time     the words          were       uttered        or
                published, and          many of whom had already been subjected to a
                barrage of information, findings, opinions and speculation.


                On numerous occasions, including at the interview and in the
                published     article,         Mr   WRIGHT       has    asserted           that    all    the
                evidence     in the possession of South Yorkshire                               Police has
                been handed to West Midlands                  Police       for the Lord Justice
                TAYLOR's     enquiry,         for the    Coroner's         Inquests         and for       the
                 criminal    investigation.             For      the     complainants             to   allege
                otherwise is due to their mistaken belief that Mr WRIGHT at
                 interview with the press gave the impression that there was
                 "additional        information"         which         related        to        drunken     or
                 intoxicated            football        supporters             at          Hillsborough,
                 particularly those deceased.                 Enough has already been said
                 in this report to indicate that was not the case.


                 The full transcript reveals no evidence that Mr WRIGHT tried
                 to mislead deliberately, just the opposite.                           Neither should
                 he be accused of double standards.                      At interview he clearly
                 referred to the Final Report of Lord Justice TAYLOR as a
                 "superb document" in that it clearly and fully analyses and
Docunent File
Page 19          addresses the so called ills of football.                           He has never made
                 any secret of the fact that he has reservations about the
                 findings of Lord Justice TAYLOR in his Interim Report which
                     Continuation Form                                     Page No 42




criticises South Yorkshire Police.                      As Mr WRIGHT said in his
prepared statement:-


       "There is nothing inconsistent in accepting the
       conclusion             of     judicial       proceedings          without
       necessarily being in agreement with all the views
       expressed         or    the     weight      given   to     the    various
       factors involved."


The views of Mr HICKS that Mr WRIGHT was "guilty of double
standards" is based upon the newspaper article, a view which
is completely dispelled by a study of the full transcript of
the press interview.


The newspaper article, written by Mr HANNA the interviewer,
created      in    the    minds       of    the    three    complainants          a    false
impression:-


i)     That Mr WRIGHT claimed to have additional evidence not
       available to Lord Justice TAYLOR which would indicate
       to     the        Coroner's          Inquest        that     many         fans     at
       Hillsborough,               including      the deceased,         were under       the
       influence of intoxicating drink to such an extent that
       they played a much more significant role in the tragedy
       than Lord Justice TAYLOR had reported;


 ii) That         evidence          had    been    withheld       from    Lord        Justice
       TAYLOR.


From a reading of the article it is possible to formulate
 those opinions, but that is not so in respect of the full
 transcript of the interview.


 The full transcript makes it clear:-


     i) Mr    WRIGHT          justifiably          presumed       that     the        ongoing
        investigation              following      the   publication        of    the     Lord
                           Continuation Form                          Page No 43




           Justice TAYLOR Interim Report would produce additional
           information.


       ii) He did not know what that additional information would
           be but he had no reason to believe it would relate to
           intoxicating drink.


       iii) That he       had    not withheld   any    information        from   Lord
           Justice TAYLOR.


           The complaints arise from the manner in which Mr WRIGHT
               is quoted in the newspaper article.


               I am satisfied that in giving the press interview to Mr
               HANNA of The Sheffield Star, and by using the words he
               did, Mr WRIGHT did not act in a manner likely to bring
               discredit upon South Yorkshire Police,               or the police
               service.    He cannot be held accountable for the manner
               in which his words were presented              in the      subsequent
               newspaper article because he had no editorial control
               and limited,      if any,   influence over the words printed
               as attributable to him.


ii)    Falsehood or Prevarication
       It is not certain that this particular disciplinary offence
       applies    to   the      circumstances   of    this   case   but    there   is
       nothing in the full text of the interview to even suggest
       that Mr WRIGHT either knowingly or through neglect made any
       false, misleading or inaccurate statement.                   The manner     in
       which the interview is presented in the subsequent newspaper
       article could mislead a reader to believe that Mr WRIGHT had
       said something he did not say, or mean something he did not
       mean.


iii)   Improper Disclosure of Information
       There is nothing in the full transcript, or in the article,
       to show that Mr WRIGHT disclosed any information which was
                    Continuation Form                                  Page No 44




confidential to the Coroner or to anyone else.                             The words
used are    in generalities       and opinion         - opinions which Mr
WRIGHT    genuinely    holds.       He       did    not     require         anyone's
approval to give the interview or use the words he chose,
the necessary authority and discretion is vested in him.


Abuse of Authority
There is nothing to indicate that Mr WRIGHT w as, or intended
to   be   oppressive,t abusive         or    uncivil       to    anyone,       or     to
influence    any    juror    or   proceedings.             If        the    newspaper
article had set out the full text of the interview,                               there
would have been no question arising that Mr WRIGHT was being
derogatory to the deceased,            or anyone else,               an allegation
based upon the misinterpretation set out above.


Insofar as Mr WRIGHT is alleged to have withheld information
from the complainants, I would be surprised if that was not
the case, whether or not it related to intoxicating drink or
otherwise.        From my interview with the complainants it was
apparent     that    they    believe        the    Interim       Report      by     Lord
Justice TAYLOR is the definitive document for fixing blame
 on the South Yorkshire Police, and exonerating the football
 supporters,      particularly the deceased,              from the stigma of
 intoxification.        Anything       which       might        be    perceived       as
 tending to throw doubt on the Interim Report findings they
 see as an attack on their bereaved loved ones.                        They believe
 they have a right to all such material.                   Whilst at interview
 I was     able   to create a better understanding of the                           true
 position, but they had framed their complaints after reading
 The Sheffield Star article, which is all they had to go on,
 and they continue to base their complaints on that.                                They
 have no     grounds    for believing that            they       are       entitled    to
 receive information of the nature about which they complain.


 Mr WRIGHT did not require authority to give the interview or
 use the words he chose.               He did not reveal any detailed
  information which         could be     described as            confidential         and

          there       is     nothing         to    indicate        that      he    intended        to    be
          oppressive, abusive, or uncivil to anyone,                               or to influence
          any juror or proceedings.


Conclusion of Investigation into disciplinary matters


I    find       all     of    the      complaints         to     be    unsubstantiated          and       no
disciplinary offences have been commited by Mr WRIGHT.


In saying those word did he act in any way injudiciously?


In the present context the queston as to whether or not Mr WRIGHT
has acted injudiciously is one of fact, not of law.                                          Within the
law and without breaking the discipline code,                                     a Chief Constable
has to use his own judgement as to whether he will do this or
that.           Advice from circulars,                  colleagues,         subordinates,      experts,
police authorities, Government Departments and many other sources,
is available but at the end of the day it is a personal decision,
authority          and       discretion           for    which        is    vested      in   the        Chief
Constable.            The consequences of the decision rest with the Chief
Constable and by taking                       it he      is    solely responsible             for       these
consequences.                His judgement may be criticised but it is he who
has        to      balance             the     various           responsibilities,            sometimes
conflicting,            which         are borne         by his        office.      An    Inspector         of
Constabulary or a police authority may say "I would not have done
 that", or even "I would not even consider doing that", but those
are words of advice.                    The Chief Constable has to do what is best
 for his Force, subject only to the constraints, of the law and the
 discipline code and in so doing he stands alone.                                    An exception may
be        the    case        of   a    Chief      Constable           who    commits     a    series       of
    injudicious acts whereby the efficiency and effectiveness of his
    Force suffers to such an extent that the Inspector of Constabulary
    or the Police Authority feel obliged to intervene, but that is not
    the    position          in   Mr    WRIGHT's         case.         Mr    WRIGHT     justifies         his
    decision to give the press interview in several ways:-

                     "As you know        it had always been my               intention to
Docunent File
Pages 6, 29          leave the force on reaching 60 years of age, but
                     my personal        resolve was      overtaken by             the    tragic
                     course of events at Hillsborough.                    It seemed to me
                     the proper course of action would be to await the
                     outcome      of Lord Justice Taylor's                inquiry and        to
                     deal, as I thought appropriate, with what emerged
                     from the findings.           Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry
                     is     now   complete      and   all      the    necessary          police
                     actions from it have been commissioned and largely

                     concluded."


                And then:-


                      "Fortunately or unfortunately policing is day to
Document File
Page 29               day,    minute     by minute      work    and       there    are    other
                     problems.         You can only devote            so much time          and
                      thinking     to Hillsborough.           I have       been    trying     to
                      say to my men that Hillsborough is over,                          so long
                      as we are sure that what we do takes account of
                      the    lessons.      We    have    to    go    on    policing        South
                      Yorkshire     in    the manner        in which        we    did before

                      Hillsborough happened.


                      I think a new Chief, unconnected with Hillsborough
                      will come in and it is a natural move forward for
                      the force.        The best thing for the force is for me
                      to go at the right time and not hang on too long
                      or go too soon.           1 think 1 -have got it right.


                      While I am here Hillsborough will remain.                          I think
                      I am doing the best for the force in going now at
                      what I see to be the right time for an end and the

                       right time for a beginning."

Page 29              people there,          the families,          who were coming in,
                     and at my officers.             They were down, there was not
                     one    there who was           not    deeply      and     traumatically
                     affected by what they were having to deal with.
                     The    questioning that was                taking place             in their
                     minds then was the questioning that took place in
                     my mind.         What went wrong,             what      could we have
                     done, what should we have done?                       What didn't we
                     do?


                     That period lasted right                    through and after               the
                     inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor and I have to say
                     now that the feeling in my force of the Taylor
                     inquiry is one of injustice.                      Officers feel they
                     have         carried       a        much      larger       burden             of
                     responsibility for the event than was their due.
                     I am not seeking to say we were perfect or that
                     things       couldn't have           been    done    differently             and
                     perhaps       had   a    different          end   product.            But     no
                     decisions        were    taken with          malice       or    that        were
                     demonstrably wrong,             it is just that they turned
                     out    in     the   event      not    perhaps       to have          been     as
                     effective as other decisions might have been.                                But
                     we don't know."

                On 4 April     1990 at the South Yorkshire                        Police       Federation
                Meeting referring to The Sheffield Star interview, he said:-


                      "I would make it                clearto you that in saying what

                      apportioned."


                And finally


                      MR SHARP       - "You must be aware                   that you in your
                      position       carry        a    lot        of     weight            and   your

                      pronouncements and opinions are given due weight
Page 50
                      because of your position.                        Bearing in mind that
                      you    realised         when     you        agreed     to    do       the Star
                      interview that Hillsborough would come up you must
                      have realised that               any responses you made would
                      have been read with              avid interest.


                      It     can    be     argued       that       you     must        have      known
                      potential jurors           for the inquest were                      likely to
                      read the article.                It could be argued therefore
                      that your reponses in the newspaper are likely to
                      sway their judgement and perhaps influence their
                      decision as jurors at the inquest.                          That it could
                      be    argued       is    perhaps        a   contempt        of       court,    an
                      attempt to pervert the course of justice at common
                      law, or a very old common law offence of culpable
                      malfeasance.            Have you any response to that."

Mr WRIGHT - "I don't think having regard to what I
said that it could possibly be argued that it fell
into any of those categories.          I have simply said
that additional       evidence may be        forthcoming and
that I hoped it would put a different complexion
on the public perception.            I have not said what
that additional evidence will be and I think it
incredible in the light of the week of discussion
and public      statement during      the TAYLOR enquiry,
media   and     individual comment         afterwards in      the
press and the First Tuesday television programme,
that my reasonable and necessary statement could
possibly      influence     the   course    of   any   judicial
proceedings."


MR SHARP - "Why did you regard it as necessary."


MR   WRIGHT       -   "As   aChief   Constable     during the
course of these events I have been unable to avoid
press questions and in addition to all my other
responsibilities there is one of maintaining the
morale of the South Yorkshire Police.                  The views
 expressed are the views held within the force and
 it is right in my view that the public should be
 aware of them."


MR SHARP - "Even if the effect of these statements
 may be    to    influence people within          the judicial
 process".


 MR WRIGHT - "I don't see how they can."


 MR SHARP -"Would you go so far then,                  with   the
 benefit of hindsight to say perhaps your comments
 were injudicious."

      MR WRIGHT - "No I don't withdraw any of them.                           I
      cannot be responsible for leaps of imagination of
      those who choose to misinterpret what I said.”


      MR SHARP - "So everything you said to the Star was
      either true fact or true opinion."


      MR   WRIGHT        -    "Yes.      What   I     said    in    all      the
      interviews     ‘I        gave   represented        my     views        and
      opinions      as       spokesman    for   the     South      Yorkshire
      Police".


      MR SHARP - "With the benefit of hindsight would
      you change anything you said."


      MR WRIGHT - "No."


      MR SHARP      - "Is there anything elseyou want                         to
       say. "


       Mr WRIGHT - "No."


My   investigation has revealed nothing                  to make        Mr    WRIGHT
answerable to his Police Authority or to anyone else.                                He
has properly     considered whether             or not he          should     give    a
press interview and has properly exercised his mind as to
the words used.              Whether or not some other person,                    Chief
Constable or otherwise, would have agreed to the interview
and answered in the way Mr WRIGHT did, -is irrelevant.                               As
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police he chose,                                after
due deliberation, to            act in the way that he did for proper
reasons of directing and controlling his                      Force. Even with
the benefit of hindsight he would not change his words.                               He
has not breached the law or discipline code and if anything,
he has lifted the morale,             and consequently the efficiency,
of his force.       He is clearly a caring and sensitive man with
a keen sense of fairness and justice, deeply moved and hurt

                                   There      is nothing which suggests             that Mr WRIGHT has         acted
                                   injudiciously or unwisely.


                6   .   6   In publishing Mr WRIGHT's words did anyone else commit a criminal
                            offence?


                            The only other matter to consider is the criminal liability of The
                            Sheffied Star newspaper.              The     article    published on 5 February
                            reports the interview with Mr WRIGHT conducted earlier that day by
                            Mr HANNA.


                            Clearly     the    quotations      used     in the    article     are    incomplete    and
                            sometimes out of context,             but Mr WRIGHT has confirmed,                and the
                            transcript of the full interview verifies, that they are a fair
                            representation of what Mr WRIGHT said.                   From a comparison between
                            the full transcript and the whole article, the reported indirect
                            speech and other paragraphs are also a fair representation of the
                            interview.        That it misled the three complainants also seems clear
                            but    from       listening     to   the     tape-recording        and    studying     the
                            transcript there was certainly no malice or bad intent on the part
                            of Mr HANNA.         He did not press Mr WRIGHT            to answer his questions
                            and heeded the cautionary words of Mr WRIGHT.                      The same arguments
                            already rehearsed in respect of contempt of court and attempting
                            to    pervert      the    course     of     justice     apply     in    respect   of   the

                            newspaper.


                            I am satisfied that no criminal offence has been committed by The

                            Sheffied Star.

 Thank you for your letter of 25 November to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The Judge found the
 information you provided very useful and has asked me to thank you for it.

        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is coming to the end of his scrutiny and it would be very
helpful if you could let us have, as quickly as possible, a few other pieces of information.
First, you say that the contribution proceedings against Sheffield Wednesday FC and
Eastwoods concluded with their agreeing to pay the sum of £3 million. Who was this sum
to be paid to - the police authority, the Chief Constable, or someone else? Was it in fact
paid?

3.      Your letter confirms that Sheffield City Council paid the £1 million to which they had
agreed, but whom did they pay it to?

4.     As we understand it Sheffield Wednesday and Eastwoods agreed their joint settlement
in October 1990, during the hearing of the contribution proceedings in Court. What was the
estimate at that time of the total liability which would fall on the police?

5.     Finally, it would be helpful if you could let us know how much compensation has
been paid out in total as a result of Hillsborough, and what the current estimate is of the total
compensation which remains to be paid.

6.       I look forward to hearing from you.                     As I say a speedy reply would be particularly
helpful.

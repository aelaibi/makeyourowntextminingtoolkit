HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

Further to our telephone conversation this morning, I am writing to confirm
that at the request of Lord Justice Taylor we have now instructed a second
junior, Bernard Phillipps, to assist Andrew Collins QC, as Counsel      to the
Inquiry.  Given the scale of the Inquiry and volume of evidence we are going to
have to sift through, and mindful of the time constraints against which we will
be operating, Lord Justice Taylor considered that it would be absolutely
essential in this Inquiry for there to be   two junior Counsel. This is a view
with which I would respectfully concur.

Bernard Phillipps is in the same Chambers        at 12 Paradise Square in Sheffield as
Alan Goldsack (who, as you know, had             already been instructed as junior
Counsel).

I understand that the Attorney General is content for Lord Justice Taylor's
wishes to be accommodated in this way,    but as a matter of courtesy I was
naturally concerned that you should be kept informed of the action we have
taken.


                                        'JU

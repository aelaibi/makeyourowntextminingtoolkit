It w o u l d          have       been about                3 . 1 0 pm (1510) w h e n I saw the c r o w d s t a n d i n g

on    the        terraces             on       the       West       Stand           surging           forward.           The m o v e m e n t

stemed           from          the    rear       of       the       crowd           towards           the    front.       I d o n ’t k n o w

what    caused                 the    movement.

I did           not       receive          any       injuries                myself         from       the    football           match.           The

next       thing        I saw was             that          p e o p l e in the           t e r r a c i n g were          being       1 ifted

into       the     seating

People        were       also          c limbing

                                                                                                                    + of„ the

terracing           onto          the    p i t c h area.

It a p p e a r e d       to       be at       this          time       that     the      terracing            was       too    overcrowded

and    people           were       escaping             the       crush.           A number           of     people were             being

carried           away       on    stretchers                from       the     p i t c h area.

As a       result        my         two c o l l e g u e s          and myself             went down           to the          rear    of t h e

North Stand              to         see if we               could assist            with        anything.               This     w o u l d be

On arrival              at      the     rear       of       the    North        s t a n d we         spoke        to a P o l i c e

Officer           and    having          told          h i m we w e r e         Doctors          we       were     told       to go

downstairs,              w h i c h we         did.           Here       we    spoke        to a n         officer        with a       r a dio

and again           told          him    that          we    were       Doctors.            This          officer        showed       us    into

the    gymnasium,                 w h i c h was         being          used     for      a makeshift               casualty          centre.

Dr                       went          towards          the       playing          area whilst               Dr                  and

Inside        the       gymnasium,                I saw        tj^o ^ d e a d^ ho di e_s on the                   floor.       I felt       for

a    pulse        on t h e s e         two    people           and      there       was     not       one.

Lying       on the           ground          at    the       same       p o in t    wa s    another           man^ag^ed a b o u t

tjni rJ-'£, He w a s              c ^ n ^ c | o us a n d a p p e a r e d            to     be    in shock.               I got       h i m up

and    sat        him    down.           Two       more        bodies         were       then        brought         into      the    a r ea.

I checked             them again              and       confirmed              that        they were              dead.

At    t his       stage         I heard another                    p e r s o n was         in    pain.            This    man was

behind        a    p a r t i t i o n w h i c h wa s               inside        the      gymnasium.                He    complained             to

me    of    injuries              to    his       legs.

This       man was           with a friend and                         I asked        him       to    rip the m a n s           trousers

so    I could           examine          him,          which       he    did.         1 saw          t hat    the       leg w a s     blue

from       the     t o p of        his       left        leg      to    his     toes.

There       was      no m e d i c a l         equipment                available           and       so    I just        told    him       to
                                                                                                                                           PAGE         4
                                                                                                                                           S36

t ak e     deep        breaths.

Next       to    hi m was             another            m a n wh o     had          been     brought         in,     he     had      crush

injuries           to       his       c h est        and   he was        'blue5 through                      lack     of     oxygen.            He

was       pointing              out    that          his    c h est     wa s         inj u r e d .       1 s a w that           his    chest

was       blue.            There       was       nothing          that       1       could     do      e x c e p t talk         to him,

until       help arrived.

During          this        time m o r e             bodies       were       being           brought         in on the            other     side

of    the       partition.

I went          b ac k      over       and       saw       that      there           were    another          three        or     f our    more

bodies          who        were       dead.

1 returned                 to    the       man       with      the     chest           injury?         w h i l s t I was          talking

to h i m        firemen            came         in    carrying           oxygen.                 I t ook       one a n d          gave     it     the

man       with     the          c h es t    injuries             and    left          him     in the         care     of     the      fi^reman.

I then went                 to     see      another            man who           was      l y ing      on    the    ground who             wa s

in    pain.            This        man      had         injuries        to       his      left       shoulder         but       otherwise

he w a s a 1 r i g h t .

It w a s        about           this       time         that     a team          of     paramedics            arrived           from

At a bout          4       pm    (1600)           I was approa ch ed                    by a n       I n s p e c t o r who        asked     me

present          in the            gymnasium.

We    took       a section                 of    the.bodies             each and              certified            t h eir      deaths.           A

I c a n' t       remember              how many             people       I certified                   as    dead     but it       was      at

I do       not     have          any       details          of    the    dead            peo p l e ,    the i r d e t a i l s a r e         with

             observations              are     that    medical       assistance          should        have     been      requested

             on     the    l oud      speaker        system    immediately           casulties          were       no t i c e d . Up     to

             the     time       that     I entered       the    gymnasium          no    request        had     been made          on    the

             public        speaker           system.

             There        was    no    first     aid    equipment        available           inside       the      gymnasium.            It

             is m y       opinion        that    at    such    stadiums       as     Hillsborough             where       Lange?

             attendances              ar e    frequent, a       room should             be   set a s i d e      equi ped      to     deal

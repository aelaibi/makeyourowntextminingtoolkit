                   I am a Police            Inspector         of the South Yo r k s h i r e Police,                     currently

                  s t a t i o n e d at Maltby.

                  O n Saturday,            9th Apr i i f •198S__lQ 9 0 4 8 8 ) I was                   onjckfty at H i l l s b o r o u g h

                  Liverpool          and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.                M y ^ u t i e s involved the           sup                on

                  of officers                      e manning              the      barriers which had beej>^set up at the

                  mouths       of    the    junctions         of    Side          roads   which        form         T junc t i o n with

                  these minor           r.tlads where         they formed a T junction with Pe n i s t o n e Road.

                  Two      or three        officers     manned each barrier,                       and     it was     their      duty to

                   prevent      non     residents       from going                 into    these minor and            residential

                   roads     thereby        prevent i ng any nui sance                     to   r es idjM'rt s .

                  Most       of my time was          spent         patrolling             roX^ra the block,           visiting          the

                  officers          on these      barriers.               At no tdfme did              I see any      b a r r i e rs

                  at     the Lepp i n g s Lane        end of t . h ^ f l r o u n d . ^ ^ ^

                  Groups      of officers were                deployed along                the    length of Lepp i n g s Lane

                  Srtd I often saw them searching                              fans    for weapons and alcohol.

             ver y quiet,       and    some    10 minu te s after         kick     off,    I was able        to release

                SUBJECT:   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER ENQUIRY - DUTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1988
                           SiMI FINAL ON SATURDAY 9th APRIL 1988


                  I am a Police Inspector of the South Yorkshire Police, currently stationed at
                  Maltby.
                 On Saturday 9 th April 1988, I was on duty at Hillsborough Football Ground in
                 connection with the FA Semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
                 My duties involved the supervision of officers who were raarming the barriers
                 which had been set up at the mouths of the junctions of side roads which
                 formed a T junction with Leppings Lane* Barriers had also been set up at the
                 other end of these minor roads where they formed a T junction with Penistone
                 Road.
                 Tw^ or three officers manned each barrier, and it was their duty to prevent
                 non residents from going into these minor and residential roads thereby
                 preventing any nuisance to residents.
                 Most of ray time was spent patrolling round the block, visiting the officers on
                 these barriers. At no time did I see any barriers erected across Leppings Lane,
                 nor did I see any fora of cordon used to filter non ticket holders, prior to
                 them reaching the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
                 Groups of officers were deployed along the length of Leppings lane, and I often
                 saw them searching fans for weapons and alcohol.
                 As kick off time drew near, I was not aware of any build up of late arriving
                 fans. In fact at 3.Opm that day, Lepping^ Lane was very quiet, and some 10
                 minutes after kick off, I was able to release officers to go to Claywheels
                 Lane garage for a meal.
                 I returned to Leppings Lane prior to the finish of the match, where I remained
                 with the officers on the barriers, watching the crowds as they left the ground.
                 My main recollection of that day was the good behaviour of the fans, both before
                 and after the match, and there was certainly no trouble on the sector that I was
                 given to supervise.
                 The officers on the barriers that day were from A Division, and I am unable to
                 say who they were.
                 I was not on duty at the 1989 Semi-final.

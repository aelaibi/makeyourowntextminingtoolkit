            My fu l 1 name is Sandra Fairclough,             Pol ice Constable 3170.               I am

            currently stationed at Hackenthorpe Pol ice Station,                       Occupation L a n e ,

            Sheffield.      I am a Community Constable for the Gleadless Valley area

            of my Sub-Division.           I have seven and a half years service with South

            Yorkshire Police.

            On Saturday,        15th A p r i l , 1989,   I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe

            Police- S t a t i o n at 8:-30 3:1 : for d u t i e s m     c o n n e c t i o n w i t h the    v-. A   t

            be held at Hillsborough Foot bal 1 Stadium.

            Along with other officers I was transported from Hackenthorpe to the

            foot ba l1 ground where upon my a r r i v a l , I attended a briefing in the

            North S t a n d .    At 10 a.m.     that date we were spoken to by Chief

            Superintendent Duckenfield,            who was    in overall command of the m a t c h .

            My duties on this date were those employed by serial                         13 under the

            direct supervision of Pol ice Sergeant 2001 B u r m a n .                  Our duties were

            the supervision of Liverpool supporters                  in the West S t a n d , this is

            situated off Leppings Lane.

            Inspector Builas was in overall command of our section of the stand.

At 11.50 a.m.          in company with Police Constable 1618 Shearwood,                  I was

directed by Police Sergeant Burman to supervise the South entrance

The entrance to the stand consists of two swing metal gates which                                    j

upper seated level of the West Stand.                        Seven stewards employed by              j

the club were also present.

We were instructed by Inspector White to remain in the enclosed part

of the stairwell           on the middle level           in order to stop fans running up

and down the stairs to enable free access.

For a long period of time very few fans entered this particular gate

and we chatted with fans and s t e w a r d s .                At this time the fans were

very jovial and obviously very excited about the forthcoming m a t c h .

There were a large amount of families e n t e r i n g .                    These fans were well      j
                                                                                                     i

                                                                                                     I
At one stage a fan did enter the seated area without a t i c k e t , but                             j

was seen by a steward and ejected by Pol ice Constable 1618 Shearwood

and m y s e l f .

At approximately 2.30 p.m. as the fans entered in a steady stream,                              we   i

were beckoned by one of the stewards at the base of the stairs who                                   J

Several officers at the turnstiles were requesting them to come down                                 I

but   t h e y w o u l d n ’t a n d   they   remained    on   the w al l.                             3

By this time the rear of the West Stand was heavlly congested with                                   j

At 2.40 p.m. my attention was drawn to a group of approximately six                                  I
                                                                              PAGE    3
                                                                              R114

men,    they were stood urinating against the outside walls of the

toilets at the rear of the West Stand near to the tunnel.              Police

Constable Shearwood and I approached the group,          several on seeing us,

stopped urinating but one continued.          Together with Police Constable

Shearwood,    I took hold of                     born           of

                          Liverpool.   He was taken to the Police detention

room.                  began to struggle en route to the detention room and

was placed in an arm lock by Police Constable Shearwood,             this caused

some of the fans to use foul language towards the officer and myself.

Once at the Pol ice Room,       the circumstances were outlined to the

Custody Officer and it was decided to eject                    from the

ground.     Together with Pol ice Constable S h e a r w o o d , I began to return

to the West S t a n d .    As we walked near to the turnstiles off Leppings

L a n e , there was a noticeable difference     in the atmosphere,     the area

inside the ground was co n g e s t e d , we saw approximately 30 men standing

along the walls urinating.         Because it was   impracticable for the two

of us to arrest e v e r y b o d y , we split up and approached all those

urinating threatening to evict them from the ground if they d i d n ’t

stop.    Most d i d , it was blatantly obvious that most had been drinking.

As we passed the turnstiles we were approached by fans who were

demanding something be done about the crowd outside as             they had    just

pushed their way through into the g r o u n d .

We returned to the bottom of the steps         leading to the upper     level of

the West S t a n d .    It was obvious that the stewards were struggling

because of the sheer number of f a n s , rather than argue about the

validity of the t i c k e t , they were allowed to enter the s t a n d .      Some

of the fans were obviously drunk and arguments took place between

fans,    stewards and ourselves.       Due to the congestion and the pushing

it was impossible to physically stop the fans from           climbing the stairs

Due to the congestion one of the metal         swing gates   was   shut and

Those with blue and white tickets were directed to the t e r r a c e s .

Whilst at this e n t r a n c e , I was suddenly aware of a large amount of                         j
                                                                                                   ■i
fans surging towards u s , both Police Constable Shearwood and myself                              ;

were pinned against the metal gates and it became impossible to                                    i

restrict access to the upper l e v e l .                                                            ,

We then tried to restore normality to the en t r a n c e .                     A middle aged

man approached us shouting words to the e f f e c t , 'THERE ARE PEOPLE

DYING IN THAT STAND BEING CRUSHED WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT I T ? ’                            j

At this point both Pol ice Constable Shearwood and myself were still

pinned against the gates and were unable to m o v e .                        Pol ice Constable

Shearwood indicated to approximately eight officers and a supervisory

officer who were stood in a group near the turnstiles and asked that

he go and explain to them.              He continued to shout at Pol ice Constable

Shearwood,         'ONE SIX ONE EIGHT I WANT YOU TO DO S OM E T H I N G . ’

Several minutes          later the number of fans depleted near our entrance

and together with Pol ice Constable Shearwood, we were able to move

and we approached the man again and asked what the specific problem                                 J

was.     He complained of people pushing and shoving and I said I would                            '

h e l p , he apologised to us for s h o u t i n g .         H o w e v e r , on looking down the    j

tunnel at the rear of the West S t a n d , I saw some fans milling a b o u t ,                     j

I had heard nothing on my personal           radio and I assumed that fans were

fighting.      Both Police Constable Shearwood and myself remained near

the tunnel and we were approached by a teenage fan who complained of

chest pains.       We took the fan to the first aid room near the gym,

left him and returned to the rear of the West Stand.             On our return

the whole area behind the stand was           littered with casualties lying on

the floor,     there was a large amount of other people and Police

supporters were helpful but others were directing obscene language

towards other officers and m y s e l f .

I rendered first aid to the injured which were laid in the alleyway

at the rear of the West S t a n d , Inspector Sykes and his men were

moving dead people and officers were stood in front of them so the

injured could not see the d e a d .

          Several first aiders attended at the g a t e , they were directed to the

          Once the fans had left the g r o u n d , we went to the North Stand for a

through          an    open       gate.          This       must    have       eased      some      of     the       pressure            that

h ad    built       up o u t s i d e       by    the     turnstiles            because        prior        to      going       through

the     gate     I had       seen       people         climbing          over      the    walls         into       the    ground.

Some     d id    this       of    their         own accord,             others        were    held       up.         It w a s n ’t as

if t h e y w e r e         trying       to      get    in for       nothing           it a p p e a r e d      to     be as      if       they

were     getting           out    of    the      crush.           There      was      nobody       inside          the    gate

collecting            tickets,          so      I kept       mine.         I d i d n ’t h a v e m u c h            choice       where          I

was     going.         The       crowd       forced         me    towards       the      tunnel,         which        I went

through         quite       easily and            I ended          up    in P e n 3.         I cannot           re ca l l      seeing

any Police            and any          stewards          controlling            the      entry      vi a      the     tunnel         and

I could         feel       the    pressure            building          up f r o m      behind,         with       everybody

pushing         to get a g o o d             view.          Everybody          was      s t ill    behaving           themselves.

I d i d n ’t e v e n        see a n y o n e       drinking          from       cans.       I got        into P e n 3 at              about

2 . 5 0 p m and was          standing            with P                            1 quite         clo s e      to    the      b ac k     of

4 minutes           after        the    g am e    around about               the      time

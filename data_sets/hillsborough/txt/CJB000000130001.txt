             Hillsborough Family Support Group

             As you may know after the last      Police Authority meeting I had some discussions
             with this group, who were very      anxious to meet with Sheffield Members and
             expressed their concerns about      the way that the situation has been handled so
             far by the Police.  The date I      have provisionally booked in Clive Betts' diary
             is Tuesday, 19th December 1989      at 11.30 a.m.

             I hope that the families can all be present on that day, but am waiting to have
             confirmation from them.  Perhaps in the meantime you would pencil this into your
             diary.

             Perhaps the best arrangement would be if we could meet at 11.00 a.m. for an
             informal chat, say about an hour, and then I will arrange for some food so that
             they can stay on for lunch.  If you can find the time to spend with them for
             this period it would be most appreciated.

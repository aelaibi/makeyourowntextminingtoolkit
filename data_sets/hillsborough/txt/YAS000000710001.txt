LEADING AMBULANCEMAN                - MIDDLEWOOD STATION


Vehicle 101 - Duty 1400 - 2200


Crewed with Aabulanceaaa


At (*) we were at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.     I was aware of something
happening at the Hillsborough Football ground.    Upon radioing green we were
directed by control to attend at Sheffield Wednesday Football ground.


We proceeded to the gymnasium at the Penistone Road entrance of the
Football Ground.   We switched the radio channel to ERC.


On arrival at the main gate to the gymnasium entrance we were confronted by
a group of people carrying a victim on an advertising board.    We were
unable to make any further progress.


We were forced into loading him and almost immediately we were in the
position of having to accept another victim as a result of frantic fans
trying to do what they thought best for the victim.


The first man was dead, the second alive, but displaying symptoms of brain
damage, probably as a result of Hypoxia - dilated pupils and twitching,
indicating cerebral irritation.    He was breathing, had a pulse, but was
unconscious.


We were forced to abandon our intentions of reporting to the gymnasium and
left the scene for the Northern General Hospital Accident and Emergency
Departments.


At the Hospital we were met by Doctor Jim Wardrobe and Charge Nurse Ian
Batty.   They directed us to admit the live patient into the Resuscitation
room and the second victim into a temporary mortuary in what is normally
the Orthopaedic Clinic.    Other bodies were already there.

We returned to the ground and were met by Station Officer P. Eason, who
directed my driver to a specified location.     I leftthe vehicle and was
directed by Station Officer Eason to the gymnasium.     I took my infusionand
intubation box and assisted a number of Doctors as they treated the
injured.   The gymnasium was being used as both treatment centre and
temporary mortuary.


I also assisted them with the evacuation of casualties from the gymnasium
helping to load them onto ambulances.


Once all the casualties had been cleared, I toured the gymnasium,
collecting contaminated Sharps, discarded by the Doctors, and placing them
in my "Sharp Case" for proper disposal later.


During this time I was working mostly on my own initiative, a suggestion I
had put to Control O f f i c e r a s     we returned to the ground, and
which he approved and authorised.


As far as I am aware, I was the only para-medic deployed in the Casualty
Clearing Area.


Once the casualties had been cleared I attended a briefing conducted by
Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer Jones who was deploying staff.


I reported to control and was instructed to return to station.     By this
time I had rejoined my original partner on our original vehicle.

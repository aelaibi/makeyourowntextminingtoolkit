Mr. R.l. Whalley,
Secretary to the Inquiry,
Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

Dear Mr. Whalley,
                Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry.

With reference to your letter dated 22nd ultimo for which I wish to
thank you.

Same was the subject of discussion at a meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Sheffield Trades Union Council held on 20th instant
when disappointment was expressed that opportunity is not to be
given for the Sheffield Trades Union Council to make a detailed verbal
submission to the Inquiry.

However, the decision was reluctantly accepted and I was instructed
to communicate with you again with a view to ascertaining the time-scale
for a written submission.

  GETTING ONTO THE PITCH. THIS WAS FOR APPROX. 45 MINS AND IT

  WAS OBVIOUS AT THIS TIME THERE HAD BEEN SERIOUS INJURIES,NO

- EFFORT WAS MADE TO DEPLOY THOSE POLICEMEN TO HELP WITH THE

  SITUATION



  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

  VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

  1. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN G R E A ^ R EFFORT MADE TO CONTROL THE CROWD

  OUTSIDE THE GROUND,    AND I f A MORE ORDERLY FASHION.

 I ATTENDED THE SEMI FINAL AT HILLSBOROUGH LAST.YEAR.   AS I APPROACHED THE

 GROUND,   I WAS STOPPED BY THE POLICE AND ASKED TO SHOW MY TICKET.    THIS

 WAS ABOUT 50 YARDS AWAY FROM THE GROUND.      IF YOU HADN’T GOT A TICKET, YOU

 COULD NOT GET NEAR THE GROUND.     LAST YEAR THE POLICE GOT EVERYONE INTO

 THE GROUND EARLY.

 THE TICKET ALLOCATION BY THE F.A.    IS UNJUST AND EVEN FOR THE FINAL THE

 ALLOCATION IS WRONG.

On our arrival                at     the gymnasium,               the    scene    that    greeted       us was      totally

unexpected.                  On half       of    the     gymnasium         seemed     to be full         of dead

toadies and several                   Po l i c e O f f icers        there were working              hard       to organise

someone          to ensure          that all         of the bodies              in the ygymnasium

were     examined by a doctor                      for     any signs of           lyre. Later a do ctor

a r r i v e d and another               officer        accompanied          hyrff.       I   also recall         two other

doctors          arriving          in the       gym n a s i u m    to q i y e    assistance;           one was      a

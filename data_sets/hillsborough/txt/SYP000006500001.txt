  SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989s
  FA CUP - SEMI FINAL

  Liverpool FC v Nottingham Forrest at Hillsborough. Sheffield.
  On Saturday 15th April 1989 the Semi Final of the FA Cup will
  be played between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forrest. The
  kick-off time is 1500 hours and a capacity crowd of 54,000 is
  expected.

 In the event of a draw at the end of full time, thirty
 minutes of extra time will be played.

 A number of BR sponsored trains have been arranged and it is
 expected that they will be full. It is anticipated that
 supporters will also travel by service trains into Midland
 Station, Sheffield.

 On both the inward and outward movements the special train
 from Liverpool will use Wadsley Bridge Station and the trains
 from Nottingham will use Midland Station. The Liverpool
 supporters at Wadsley Bridge will be walked to and from the
 ground by the South Yorkshire Police.

 Nottingham supporters and Liverpool supporters at Midland
 Station will be segregated and bused to and from the ground
 under the supervision of South Yorkshire Police.

 Platform 1 at Midland Station will be used to deal with the
 special trains from Nottingham and the supporters will leave
 by the North gate to buses which will be standing in Sheaf
 Street. The entrance/exit ticket barrier will be cordoned off
 and Liverpool supporters will be channelled via the South
 Luggage entrance to buses which will be standing on the
 Station approach road and leave via Cross Turner Street.
 It is the intention of this operation to convey a large
 number of football supporters to and from Sheffield as
 quickly and efficiently as possible and to ensure that public
 order is maintained.

u             Sir,


             I arn the Of fi c er at Liverpool responsible for roster* ing

I         of Officers in connection with football duties.
              I have been aware since approximately March 18/19th that
         Liverpool Football Club would meet Nottingham Forest at

I        Hillsborough, Sheffield the F. A. Cup Semi-Final on Saturday
          15/04/83.
             Ar ra n gements were put in hand between this force and the


I        British Rail Area Managers' office at Liverpool to cover
         the c on v eyance of fans to Sheffield.
              It was decided for various reasons i.e. shortage of
         stock due to o t h e r committments - Everton v Norwich at

I        Witton, lack of nu mber to venues for the 6th round etc.
         that only one B.R. sponsored train would run to Wadsley
         Bridge for Liverpool fans.


I            I made arr a ng e me n ts accordingly rostering 1 sergeant
         plus 3 PC's to travel on that train. Additional cover of an
         Inspector plus 3 PC's detailed to cover £ service trains

I        well in advance.
             On Friday the 14/04/89 I was advised by B.T. Police
         Sheffield that £ relief service trains would run from


I        Liverpool to Sheffield at 09£5 hrs and 1128 hrs.
         my first n o t i fi c at i on of these trains and Acting
                                                                  This was

                      F. A. Cup Semi Final match.


I                     The train departed with some four hundred fans on
                      board.  The journey to Sheffield was uneventful
                      arriving at about 1400 hours, minutes prior to the

1                     actual booked time.

                      U pon arrival the fans were marshalled and handed to

I                     the South Yorkshire Police within minutes the fans
                      were marched by that force to the ground.

I                     the ground where a meal was provided by the South
                      Yorkshire Pol ice.

                      We arrived at the ground at 14£5 hours and we were

t                     fed and refreshed.  At 1500 hours a Chief Inspector
                      came into the feeding area mustering a number of
                      serials.  I was aware that a Public Order situation


I                     had arisen somewhere in the ground.

                      Once out of the messing area life seemed "normal".


I                     S erials were stood about in apparent "stand down".

                      I stood my serial down PC's
                      the Leeds Officer PC
                                                                      and
                                                  elected to remain at the

    PC                 arid PC       |werit arid stood at
    the gated area leading to the pitch in the area of
    the Nottingham Forest enclosure.    They became
    involved in an incident at that end of the ground
    assisting the South Yorkshire Police, they became
    separated from PC

    PC       and I returned to the Station in doing so we
    passed a number of serials walking to the ground.
    Everything appeared normal.

    ft few moments later Fire Engines and more Police
    V e h ic l es passed us or could be heard approaching the
    ground.

    in possession of a multi-channel radio.    It became
    apparent that a large scale operation had been
    mounted at the ground.

    P     '    C     f      later ascertained performed
    First Aid and Public Order duties until recalled to
    me.

    P C a n d         the Dog Handler then went to the pround
    by vehicle and I followed on foot rejoining Pel
    at the Lepping Road end of the ground.       The South
    Yorkshire Police were at that location in force so by
    m eans of Radio <BTP') I recalled the team to the
    messing area.       I was unable to make contact with P‘C
               but I was aware he had a South Yorkshire Police
    r a o 1 o.   We then saw a number of dead bodies.  We
    assisted Police Officers and fans alike in moving the
    dead to the temporary mortuary.       We then went onto
    the pitch to assist in whatever way we could.       Onc-e
    on the pitch we joined a line of Police Officers
    across the pitch slowly pushing the Liverpool Fans
    back to the half way line, we then held that
    position until 1££5 hours when a directive was given
    to reassemble on Pennistone Lane.

    Once at that location then the team then returned to
    Wadsley Bridge.  At Wadsley Bridge there was no
    communication with Sheffield BTP except for a
    temperamental "BR" radio telephone that was totally
    useless and the Sergeant operating it had great
    difficulty with it.  We had been reported by that
    Sergeant as "missing in action" for at least a couple
    of hours yet no Senior Officer had attended the scene
    from Sheffield and at 1700 hours PC       oas st- i 11

                        Just prior to departure time my serial was further
                        strengthened by two Liverpool BTP Officers who had
                        travelled being it would appear reluctantly released
                        from Sheffield.

                        The train departed some ten minutes late at about
                        17S0 hours with approximately 450 fans.  The .journey
                        again was uneventful other that verbal abuse to the
                        Officers a matter that was not pursued in an effort
                        to dampen a potentially explosive situation as the
                        fans believed the Police to be responsible for the
                        now well publicized events of that afternoon.

                    REPORT BY     Police Constable

     SUBJECT         LIVERPOOL -V- NOTTINGHAM FOREST : FA CUP SEMI-FINAL
                     SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL, 1989 AT HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD.


 Sub-               Sir,
 Divisional
 Commander          With regard to the above, I signed on duty at lOOO
 Eastern &          hours on Saturday 15 April 1989 I travelled together
 Anglia             with PC                  in Police Vehicle Charlie 62.
 Division
                    Upon our approach to Wadsley Bridge Station as we
                    turned onto the Barnsley Road which leads to

If                  Hillsborough Football Ground, I could see about 200 to
                    250 football supporters gathered outside and around an
                    Off-Licence which was on a parade of shops a short
                    distance from Wadsley Bridge Station.   They were very
                    boisterous and shouting loudly.  Nearly all of them
                    were drinking from cans of beer that they had in their
                    possession.  At approximately 1150 hours the vehicle
                    was parked by Wadsley Bridge Station and I met
                    PS       from British Transport Police, Sheffield. We
                    then awaited the arrival of the Football Special from
                    Liverpool.  As it got closer to the expected arrival
                    time of the train I went onto the railway track and
                    from the position I took up I could clearly see the
                    supporters on the grassy slopes leading to the
                    shopping parade, they had grown a lot louder than when
                    I had first seen them, they were singing and shouting
                    and you could clearly hear them above the noise of the
                    vehicles passing underneath the Railway.

                    The special train then arrived at Wadsley at

t                   approximately 1355 hours and the supporters
                    disembarked and made their way towards the Bridge Inn
                    Public House where the South Yorkshire Police Escort
                    was waiting.  The supporters numbered 430 in all and
                    they were held there until the last of the supporters
                    from the train had joined them, the escort then made
                    its way towards the ground.  I then, together with
                    four officers from Liverpool BTP, walked down to the
                    ground in order to get a pre-arranged meal.

     As I walked down to the ground I could see large
     groups of supporters drinking beer and generally
     waving their arms about and shouting.  Upon arrival at
     the ground I was directed to the gymnasium where I was
     provided with a meal. After having been suitably
     refreshed I, together with two of the Liverpool
     Officers, made my way towards the Spion Kop, I stood by
     the Corner Flag near to the entrance/exit which leads
     to the gymnasium, the match was in progress at this
     time and after a few minutes a Senior Officer of the
     South Yorkshire Police requested us to take up the
     positions of his contingent in front of the Nottingham
     Forest Supporters as he wished to take his contingent
     to the Lepping Lane end of the ground.

     Upon looking towards the Lepping Lane end I could see
     people climbing over the fencing and jumping down
     onto the perimeter track behind the Liverpool
     goalmouth.   At this time it appeared to be a pitch
     invasion.   I then turned back towards the Forest
     supporters.   The players then went off the pitch and
     the Forest supporters were becoming incensed towards
     the Liverpool supporters.   I then turned to look at the
     Lepping Lane end and I saw that people were being
     laid on the ground and assistance was being given by
     Police Officers, St John's Ambulance Personnel and
     supporters alike. People were now beginning to tear
     advertising hoardings down and started using them as
     stretchers to ferry the injured and dead. As the
     First Aid Post was positioned in the gymnasium the
     supporters had to run past the Spion Kop. As the
     injured and dead passed the Spion Kop, a small section
     of the Notts Forest supporters were spitting at the
     helpers and bodies as they passed, then one Forest fan
     in particular kept shouting, "ANOTHER FAT BASTARD
     SCOUSE IS DEAD”, and laughing.   This incensed the
     Liverpool supporters who were carrying the dead and
     injured to the gymnasium and every time the helpers
     came back the were treated to a torrent of abuse and
     spat upon by the Forest fans so much so that a few of
     the Liverpool supporters had to be dragged away from
     the Spion Kop fencing.

     As the situation worsened and more and more people
     were lying down on the pitch, I saw that towards the
     middle of the pitch supporters were running towards
     the Spion Kop end of the ground and the South
     Yorkshire Police were trying to hold them back. I ran

                                   Cont

                       -   3-




     across to assist and we managed to turn the supporters
     back towards the Lepping Lane end.  I returned to my
     original position in from of the Spion Kop and a short
     while later I was approached by a South Yorkshire
     Police Officer and upon request assisted with the
     removal of a youth's dead body.

     Whilst attempting to get to the youth's body I had to
     push a photographer out of the way. Upon arrival at
     the gymnasium the youth's body was placed in the
     temporary mortuary and I was approached by a South
     Yorkshire Superintendent and asked to stay with the
     youth's body, which I did.

     At l&OS hours this day life was pronounced extinct by
     Dr REDGRAVE.  All officers who were in the temporary
     mortuary were then instructed to remain with their
     bodies until they had been identified by the next of
     kin.

     At 0430 hours on Sunday IS April 1989, the youth's body
     was identified as a Keith McGRATH, age 17 years, of
                    LiverpoolQ

     Details were then taken of the youth and at 0445 hours
     I went with the body of Keith McGRATH to the Medico
     Legal Centre, Sheffield where the body of Keith
     McGRATH was handed over to DC WIGOLD of the South
     Yorkshire Police. I then returned to Leeds by Police
     vehicle and signed off duty at 0630 hours this day.

       Or. Sunday, April 16th, 1989, at 1730 hours I called
       at the Police Office, Liverpool and saw:-

                                                  )
                                                  ) LIVERPOOL

                                                  )
       All four Officers, had travelled to Wadsley Bridge on
       the B. R. Sponsored Special Irain and for refreshments
       availed themselves to the South Yorkshire Police
       Mobile canteen at Hi IIsborough Football Ground.

       The Officers told me how they had assisted in
       rendering first aid and perforrning public order
       duties inside the stadium.  They had been in the thick
       of the action and saw supporters die in their
       presence.  They recounted their experiences and all
       appeared stressed.  In view of the situation I sent
       the Officers home at 1800 hours, they were working
       1400/2200 hours.

       At 1000 hours Monday, April 17th, 1989, I saw the
       Officers on their taking up duty at Liverpool.    I
       instructed Sergeant-I    ~|to submit a Duty Report and
       that he and the other 3 Office r s submit full
       statements on their actions in respect of the
       incident.

      I also availed the services of the Welfare Officer of
      South Yorkshire Police to the Officers if they
      required counselling for post trauma stress.   All
      declined but I have arranged for a mindful eye to be
      kept on them should stress manifest itself in any of
      the Officers.

      Also I have arranged reports to be submitted from:-


       (1)     Inspector 3011 BROWN:   Duty Inspector,
                                       L iv e r p o o l .

      The Sub-Divisional Commander, has been advised of
      all my actions and I have kept close liaison with him
      throughout the period contained in this report.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

CPS QUESTION AND ANSWER BRIEFING

LINE TO TAKE:

The CPS considers that the material so far presented to it would not justify fresh criminal
investigation. However the CPS will reconsider the position if the scrutiny identifies any
evidence that might be relevant which has not previously been considered.

Question
What is the CPS role in the Hillsborough case?

Answer
To ascertain whether, on the material available, there appears to be any evidence against any
individuals which might be sufficient for criminal proceedings to be commenced. If, on
examination of the material, sufficient evidence is found, the CPS will advise the police to
commence a formal criminal investigation, ("material" - ie. papers and video tapes).

Question
Have you decided whether there is evidence of a criminal nature?

Answer
On the material so far presented the CPS takes the view that fresh criminal investigations are
not justified but will reconsider the position in the light of the independent scrutiny.

Question
when will you announce your decision?

Answer
It depends on the outcome of the independent scrutiny. If there is material identified to us,
we will, of course, consider it. It is difficult to estimate how long this might take.

Question
Will you re-open the inquest and/or the public enquiry?

Answer
These are not matters for the CPS. (If pressed: legal moves to require a second inquest to
be held did not succeed. It will be for the Home Secretary to decide whether to hold a
further public enquiry - as outlined in the terms of reference for the independent scrutiny).

Question
If there has not been a criminal investigation, how can you be sure you have seen all the
relevant material?



Louise\Hills
Answer
We know what material has been submitted in recent months and what material we have seen
in the past. The independent scrutiny will draw to our attention any material which we have
not considered and which may be relevant to CPS decisions.


Question
Why will you not meet the relatives of the deceased?

Answer
If the relatives of the deceased would welcome a separate discussion with the CPS at the
conclusion of the scrutiny then we will meet them.

Question
Surely it must be in the public interest to prosecute somebody?

Answer
There are two stages in the decision to prosecute. First, we must be satisfied that there is
enough evidence to provide a "realistic prospect of conviction". If the case does not pass
this evidential test, it must not go ahead, no matter how important or serious it may be. If
a case does pass the evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must then consider the second
stage test to decide if a prosecution is in the public interest. In cases of any seriousness, a
prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors tending against
prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour. The Crown Prosecution Service
will only start or continue a prosecution when the case has passed both tests.

Question
What allegations have you been considering?

Answer
It would be inappropriate to discuss individual cases or allegations. Suffice it to say we are
keeping the matter under review.

Question
Has the DPP herself been involved in considering the case?

Answer
The DPP has been kept informed of key developments.

Question
Will the independent scrutiny be able to advise the CPS to commence criminal proceedings?

Answer
No, decisions on criminal proceedings are matters for the CPS. The scrutiny will draw to
the attention of the CPS any evidence not previously considered which may be relevant to
their duties.

Question
What will the CPS do if the scrutiny identifies relevant material?

Answer
That is a matter for the CPS, and it would be wrong to speculate at this stage.

Question
Will you tell the CPS to prosecute?

Answer
No. Decisions on prosecutions are entirely for the prosecuting authorities. It would be quite
improper for the Home Secretary to try to influence prosecution decisions in individual cases.

Question
If the scrutiny finds no fresh evidence, but concludes that material so far submitted justifies
criminal proceedings or further enquiry what will the CPS do?

Answer
The CPS will of course carefully consider any views expressed by the independent scrutiny,
and take them into account before reaching a final decision.

Question
Is the CPS going to make a separate announcement of its conclusions?

Answer
I am aware that all those persons who have recently written to the Director of Public
Prosecutions or the CPS are being sent letters today by the Crown Prosecution Service
explaining more fully their conclusions at this stage and the assistance they will be providing
to the independent scrutiny.


Louise\Hills
Question
Why has the CPS waited until now to announce its preliminary conclusions?

Answer
It would have been inappropriate to announce the view of the CPS while the Home Secretary
was considering requests for a further public enquiry. To do so might have given the
impression that no further action was contemplated.

CPS QUESTION AND ANSWER BRIEFING

LINE TO TAKE:

The CPS considers that the material so far presented to it would not justify fresh criminal
investigation. However that is not a final decision. The CPS will reconsider the position
if the scrutiny identifies any evidence that might be relevant which has not previously been
considered.

Question
What is the CPS role in the Hillsborough case?

Answer
To ascertain whether, on the material available, there appears to be any evidence against any
individuals which might be sufficient for criminal proceedings to be commenced. If, on
examination of the material, sufficient evidence is found, the CPS will advise the police to
commence a formal criminal investigation, ("material" - ie. papers and video tapes).

Question
Have you decided whether there is evidence of a criminal nature?

Answer
On the material so far presented the CPS takes the view that fresh criminal investigations are
not justified but will reconsider the position in the light of the independent scrutiny.

Question
when will you announce your decision?

Answer
It depends on the outcome of the independent scrutiny. If there is material identified to us,
we will, of course, consider it. It is difficult to estimate how long this might take.

Question
Will you re-open the inquest and/or the public enquiry?

Answer
These are not matters for the CPS. (If pressed: legal moves to require a second inquest to
be held did not succeed. It will be for the Home Secretary to decide whether to hold a
further public enquiry - as outlined in the terms of reference for the independent scrutiny).

Question
If there has not been a criminal investigation, how can you be sure you have seen all the
relevant material?


Louise\Hills
Answer
We know what material has been submitted in recent months and what material we have seen
in the past. The independent scrutiny will draw to our attention any material which we have
not considered and which may be relevant to CPS decisions.


Question
Why will you not meet the relatives of the deceased?

Answer
We have a publicly stated commitment to meet the relatives of deceased             DECISION
victims to explain the basis upon which our decisions are taken.                   REQUIRED
As we have not yet made a final decision, it would be inappropriate
to meet them at this stage. [In accordance with our commitment,
we will meet the relatives in due course, when a final decision has
been taken].

Question
Surely it must be in the public interest to prosecute somebody?

Answer
There are two stages in the decision to prosecute. First, we must be satisfied that there is
enough evidence to provide a "realistic prospect of conviction". If the case does not pass
this evidential test, it must not go ahead, no matter how important or serious it may be. If
a case does pass the evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must then consider the second
stage test to decide if a prosecution is in the public interest. In cases of any seriousness, a
prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors tending against
prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour. The Crown Prosecution Service
will only start or continue a prosecution when the case has passed both tests.

Question
What allegations have you been considering?

Answer
It would be inappropriate to discuss individual cases or allegations. Suffice it to say we are
keeping an open mind and are considering whether there is evidence against any individual
for any criminal offence arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy.

Question
Has the DPP herself been involved in considering the case?

Answer
The DPP has been kept informed of key developments and will be involved in the final
decision when that is taken.

QUESTION AND ANSWER BRIEFING FOR HOME OFFICE


Question
Will the independent scrutiny be able to advise the CPS to commence criminal proceedings?

Answer
No, decisions on criminal proceedings are matters for the CPS. The scrutiny will draw to
the attention of the CPS any evidence not previously considered which may be relevant to
their duties.

Question
What will the CPS do if the scrutiny identifies relevant material?

Answer
That is a matter for the CPS, and it would be wrong to speculate at this stage.

Question
Why has there been no criminal investigation?

Answer
In most cases the police themselves decide whether to commence a criminal investigation.
On other occasions the police sometimes act on the advice of the CPS. In this case the CPS
has considered whether to advise a further police enquiry in the light of the material recently
submitted. The CPS takes the view that the material so far presented to it would not justify
fresh criminal investigations. The CPS will of course reconsider the matter if the scrutiny
identifies any evidence which might be relevant to this decision which has not previously
been considered.

Question
Will you tell the CPS to prosecute?

Answer
No. Decisions on prosecutions are entirely ones for the CPS. It would be quite improper
for the Home Secretary to try to influence prosecution decisions in individual cases.

Question
If the scrutiny finds no fresh evidence, but concludes that material so far submitted justifies
criminal proceedings or further enquiry what will the CPS do?

Answer
The CPS will of course carefully consider any views expressed by the independent scrutiny,
and take them into account before reaching a final decision.


Louise\Hills
Question
Is the CPS going to make a separate announcement of irs conclusions?

Answer
I am aware that all those persons who have recently written to the Director of Public
Prosecutions d k the CPS are being sent letters today by the Crown Prosecution Service
explaining more fully the results of their dcliboratioas and the assistance they will be
providing to the independent scrutiny.                 CcvxlW, caa/i a.(~ tL t'j

Question
Why has the CPS waited until now to announce its preliminary conclusions?

Answer
It would have been inappropriate to announce the view of the CPS while the Home Secretary
was considering requests for a further public enquiry. To do so might have given the
impression that no further action was contemplated.

It wonl^-fee w£ 0 ng for the CPS to comment until the independent
^fru£i1iyhargcompleted its work.

8Why will you np4r advise a criminal irpjer^tigation?

Our funct^dn at tills staqe'is to/donsider whether to advise the
police>bo in^fed/tute a > 2ifimina>''investigation. We will not make
thaj^deciaion u n t i L ^ f ter    independent scrutiny has finished
its w o r k .

9Why will you not meet the relatives of the deceased?

We have a publicly stated commitment to/flfeet the relatives of
deceased victims to explain the basis ydpon which our decisions
are taken. As we have not yet made a/decision, it would be
inappropriate to meet them at this stage. In accordance with our
commitment, we will meet the relatives in due course, when the
decision has been taken.

1OSurely it must be in the public interest to prosecute somebody?

There are two stages in the decision to prosecute.  First, we
must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a
"realistic prospect of conviction". If the case does not pass
this evidential test, it must not go ahead, no matter how
important or serious it may be.  If a case does pass the
evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must then consider the
second stage test to decide if a prosecution is in the public
interest.  In cases cf any seriousness, a prosecution will
usually take place unless there are public interest factors
tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending
in favour.  The Crown Prosecution Service will only start or
continue a prosecution when the case has passed both tests.

.11What allegations have you been considering?
(f bfe*k.A Ct   U*.«^/wqr’*voejti lr
Wo-Jtfill->na,t discuss individual cases or allegations. Suffice it
to say we are keeping an open mind and are considering whether
there is evidence against any individual for any criminal offence
arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy.

12Has the DPP herself been involved in considering the case?

The DPP has been kept informed of key developments and will be
involved in the final decision when that is taken.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 10 June about the proposed independent
examination of the alleged new evidence about the Hillsborough disaster.

I am grateful to you for your agreement in principle with what I proposed.
I understand your concerns about the terms of reference and the statutory
responsibilities which rest with you and the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Although I would prefer terms of reference which invited more explicit
recommendations, I am broadly content with the amended terms which you
proposed. I would, however, like to suggest some small changes to refer
explicitly to my role as Home Secretary, and to allow the person appointed to
advise on any other action which should be taken in the public interest. I
suggest therefore terms of reference along the following lines:

      To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
      Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

      {a)   To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

      {b)   To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for
            the purpose of discharging their respective statutory
            responsibilities; or

      (c)   To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to
            police disciplinary matters;
      And in relation to {a) to advise whether any evidence not previously
      available is of such significance as to justify establishment by the
      Secretary of State for the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry;
      and in relation to (b) and {c) to draw to their attention any evidence not
      previously considered by them which which may be relevant to their
      respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which
      should be taken in the public interest.

I would be grateful if you would confirm that you are happy with the slightly
amended version.

1 am grateful to Derry Irvine for proposing that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith might
take on this task. He seems to me very suitable for w hat w e have in mind. If
Derry is able to confirm that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is willing to take on the
task, I suggest the next step might be for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to meet
officials to discuss his requirements. The appropriate official is Paul Pugh,
Head of the Operational Policing Policy Unit here (0 1 7 1 -2 7 3 3 1 4 1 ).

I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the
Lord Chancellor, the President of the Council, the Minister without Portfolio, the
Secretary of State for National Heritage, the Director of Public Prosecutions and
to Sir Robin Butler.

          THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

          Thank you for copying me your letter of 5 June to the Attorney General setting out
          your proposals for an independent examination into the alleged new evidence
          concerning the Hillsborough disaster.

          Such an examination would seem to be a sensible w ay of addressing continuing
          public concern. I have no objections either to your proposed terms of reference or
          to your preference for a judge to lead the examination.

          Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Lord
          Chancellor, the President of the Council, the Minister W ithout Portfolio, the
          Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and Sir Robin Butler.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 5 June 1997 outlining the considerations which
have led you to conclude that we should initiate an independent examination
of the alleged new evidence because this appears to be the only way to allay
public concern.

I have no difficulty in principle with your approach. There undoubtedly
remains deep rooted dissatisfaction amongst the relatives of those who died as
well as some of the survivors and their relatives about the manner in which the
public authorities conducted themselves at the material time. They have
manifested themselves in calls for official action which, even if acceded to.
would in all probability not then address the concerns. For example, a further
inquest - which can only be ordered by the High Court - would have to
consider the statutory issues prescribed by the Coroners Act L988 and could
not properly become a wide ranging or generalised enquiry.

But I do have difficulty with the draft Terms of Reference. They do not
distinguish adequately between the question of a further public enquiry which
is properly a matter of political judgment and the questions of a further
inquest or possible prosecution which have to be addressed on a quasi-judicial
basis and according to established criteria. We start from a position where
there is nothing to suggest that the Director of Public Prosecutions and my
predecessor have failed properly to consider, in accordance with the relevant
tests, all the evidence which has been made available to them. The sole issue
therefore in relation to questions about further inquests or prosecution is
whether there is any evidence which has not already been considered.
Moreover, consideration of that further evidence would be a matter for the DPP
or myself as appropriate. It would for a number of reasons be wrong for a
public enquiry to express a view, for example, on possible criminal charges.
AC/IKKXS/l
Statutory responsibility for these decisions rests with myself and the DPP. We
must not let our discretion be fettered or pre-empted. Any recommendation
of a public enquiry would create an almost irresistible pressure: this scenario
could not properly be compared with the taking of private legal advice from
counsel. In relation to the prosecution issue the publicly expressed views of
a High Court judge about prosecution would be likely to cany such weight that
they might be regarded as making a fair trial impossible.

In these circumstances, I enclose a suggested revised wording for the Terms
of Reference. If you are intending to proceed as envisaged, I would be content
for Lord Justice Stewart Smith to be appointed.

To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
 Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April L989 which was not available:


 (a)         to the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


 (b)             to the Director of Public Prosecution or the Attorney General for the
             purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities:


 (c)         to the chief officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
             discipline matter:


and in relation to (a) above to advise whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance as to justify establishment of a further public
inquiry and. in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their attention any evidence
not previously considered by them which may be relevant to their respective
duties.

                DRAFT LETTER FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO:

                THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

                Thank you for your letter of 5 June 1997 outlining the considerations which
                have led you to conclude that we should initiate an independent examination
               of the alleged new e v in c e because this appears to be the only way to allay
               public concern.

       X       I have no difficulty in principle with rpy approach. There undoubtedly remains
                       o
       X       deep routed dissatisfaction amongst the relatives of those who died as well as
               some of the survivors and their relatives about the manner in which the public
               authorities conducted themselves at the material time. They have manifested
               themselves in calls for official action which, even if acceded to. would in all
               probability not then address the concerns. For example, a further inquest -
               which can only be ordered by the High Court - would have to consider the
               statutory issues prescribed by the Coroners Act 1988 and could not properly
               become a wide ranging or generalised enquiiy.
                                                                                            P. 00
                          attorney general

)9-JUN.'97 (MON) 16■•33




             Against this background. I do have difficulty with the draft Terms of Reference.
             They do not distinguish adequately between the question of a further public
             enquiry which is largely a matter of discretion and judgment and the question
             of a further inquest or possible prosecution. In relation to these, we start from
             a position where there is nothing to suggest that the Director of Public
             Prosecutions and ray predecessor have failed properly to consider, in
             accordance with the relevant tests, all the evidence which has been made
             available to them. The sole issue therefore in relation to questions about
             further in    quests or prosecution is whether there is any evidence which has
             not already been considered. Moreover, consideration of that further evidence
             would be a matter for the DPP or myself as appropriate. It would in my view
             be wrong for a public enquiiy to express a view, for example, on possible
             criminal charges.


             In these circumstances. I enclose a suggested revised wording for the Terms
            of Reference. If you are intending to proceed as envisaged. I would be content
            for Lord Justice Stewart Smith to be appointed.
                                                                                                P. 004

       SUGGESTED TERMS OF REFERENCE


      To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
       Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


       (a)             to the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


      (b)                   to the Director of Public Prosecution or the Attorney General for the
                       purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities;


      (c)              to the chief officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                       discipline matter:


      and in relation to (a) above to advise whether any evidence not previously
      available is of such significance as to justify establishment of a further public
      inquiry and, in relation to (b) and {c) to draw to their attention any evidence
      not previously considered by them which may be relevant to their respective
      duties.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

To see for information purposes at this stage the Home Secretary’s letter to the Attorney
General.

When I saw the proposed terms of reference for the further enquiry I was immediately
concerned about the constitutional position of a judge advising you and the Attorney how
your discretion should be exercised.

Stephen Wooler and 1 will work up a reply for the Attorney to send. I have explained to the
Home Office our concern is not with the underlying principle of the enquiry but the terras
of reference themselves. They are relaxed about us offering a version in more general terms
that does not offend constitutional proprieties. The proposed draft will be sent to you before
the Attorney General considers it.

             THC HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

             As you know, I have been considering the representations whifai tfaifc %elgn V • D
             made about the HillsborouQh Stadium disaster on 15 April 1989. The disaster       "
             was of course fully investigated by the late Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor, but
             concern has been raised about a number of features of the case and material
             considered by some to represent new evidence has been brought to our
             attention. These and related matters were raised in the Granada Television
             documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December.

             My officials have thoroughly examined the alleged new evidence and the
             allegations made in the Granada television programme and have concluded that
             there are no grounds for establishing a new public enquiry. The material has
             also been considered by the Attorney General's Office and the DPP's Office.
             None of those who have examined the material consider that there is evidence
             to justify a new public enquiry, a re-opening of the inquest, or the prosecution of
             individuals. But I am certain that continuing public concern will not be allayed
             with a reassurance from the Home Office that there is no new evidence. I
            therefore propose that there should be an independent examination of the
            alleged new evidence by a senior legal figure - a respected fudge (serving or
            recently retired), or perhaps a senior Counsel. It will be important to ensure that
            whoever undertakes the task is sufficiently senior end respected to command
            public confidence. My personal preference would be for a judge. The proposed
            terms of reference are:

    r >




           "To carry out an independent examination and advise whether there is new
           evidence relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989
           which provides sufficient grounds for:

                  i.     the Secretary of State for the Home Department to establish a
                         further public inquiry;

                  ii.    the Attorney-Generai to consider applying to the High Court under
                         Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for another inquest;

                  til.   The Director of Public Prosecutions to consider bringing criminal
                         charges against any person;

                  iv.    The relevant Chief Police Officer to consider taking disciplinary
                         action against any police officer.

           Or whether there is eny other action which should be taken in the public
           interest."

           There will need to be a public announcement of the establishment of the
           independent examination. This will require careful handling. I am sure that the
           announcement will have to be made in the House. But I shall want to make sure
           that the ground is properly prepared before the announcement is made with
           those outside Government with a close interest in the Hillsborough disaster
           including the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

           I should be grateful for the lord Chancellor's advice on a suitable figure to lead
           the independent examination, and for your comments and those of copy
           recipients on the proposed terms of reference by 12 June.

           Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the
           Lord Chancellor, the President of the Council, the Minister Without Portfolio, the
           Secretary of State for National Heritage, the Director of Public Prosecutions and
           Sir Robin Sutler.

                   THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


                  Thank you for your letter of 5 June 1997 outlining the considerations which
                  have led you to conclude that we should initiate an independent examination
                   of the alleged new evidence because this appears to be the only way to allay
                  public concern.


                  I have no difficulty in principle with my approach. There undoubtedly remains
                  deep routed dissatisfaction amongst the relatives of those who died as well as
                  some of the survivors and their relatives about the manner in which the public
                  authorities conducted themselves at the material time. They have manifested
                  themselves in calls for official action which, even if acceded to, would in all
                  probability not then address the concerns. For example, a further inquest -
                  which can only be ordered by the High Court - would have to consider the
                  statutory issues prescribed by the Coroners Act 1988 and could not properly
                  become a wide ranging or generalised enquiry.

Home Secretary


HILLSBOROUGH


Issue


1.    To consider the possible scope of the judicial examination of the recent
representations.

Timing
2.    W e are to discuss this on 4 June.           You asked for advice on the terms of
reference as a basis for that discussion.

 Consideration

3.        There are seven key issues to consider:

            (i)        the nature of the inquiry

            (ii)      its scope

            (iii)     its purpose

            (iv)       terms of reference

            (v)        timetable

          (vi)       who should do it?

          (vii)      handling.

4.      On the nature of the inquiry, it will not fit any of the conventional patterns for
inquiries - such as Royal Commission, tribunal of inquiry, inquiry under the Police
Act, or non-statutory judicial inquiry. (Those different forms of inquiry are considered
in detail in my submission of today’s date about an inquiry into policing of minority
ethnic communities.) This will be a judicial examination of the substance of
representations calling for a full public inquiry, inquest or prosecution - in effect to
determine whether a full-blown inquiry is warranted.

5.    Youhave indicated that the scope of the judicial examination should not
extend to a re-opening of all the matters dealt with by Taylor.No-one         has
questioned Taylor’s conclusions and recommendations about safety at sports
grounds and the policing of football matches. The scope should be limited to
consideration of the recent representations made by the Hillsborough families and
others. Those representations fall under four broad headings:

          (i)        the ten allegedly ‘unresolved questions’ raised in the Granada
                     programmoi-

          (ii)        allegations about video evidence;

          (iii)       medical evidence about the time of death of the victims;

          (iv)       other allegations by the families about police conduct.

6.     I suggest the focus should be the evidence which has been put forward to us,
together with any other relevant materia! which those concerned want to submit. It
should be mainly a review of the written material, although you wanted to allow the
opportunity for representations. If the examination is, to be manageable, however,
we will need to avoid hearings or legal representation: there are (at this stage) no
parties or plaintiffs.

7.    The purpose of the examination will,have to be several-fold, because - as my
submission of 8 May drew out - it is very difficult to separate matters potentially
relevant to an inquiry, or inquest, possible criminal proceedings or disciplinary
matters. In practice, the inquirer will have to form a view about whether there are
grounds for;

          public inquiry:

           consenting to a new inquest;

           new criminal investigations;

 w         instigating disciplinary procedures;

          or any combination of those options.

That means that the inquirer must report not just to you as Home Secretary,
because only the first of those four issues is for you to determine. The inquirer must
report also to the Attorney General, the DPP, and - on the last point - to the relevant
chief officer of police.

8.        That suggests terms of reference something like:

           “To carry out an independent examination of whether there is new evidence
           relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which
           provides sufficient grounds for:

                      (i)          the Attorney-General to apply to the High Court under section
                                   13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for another inquest;

                      (ii)         the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider bringing criminal
                                   charges against any person;

                      (iii)        the relevant Chief Police Officer to take disciplinary action
                                   against any police officer.

           Or which means that it would be in the public interest for the Home Secretary
           to establish a public inquiry"

9.     It is important that we should put an end to speculation with the minimum of
delay. A timetable of no more than 2 or 3 months is important. That will have a
Bearing on who should do the job. You have already said that it is essential to
appoint a judge. Anyone starting from scratch in considering these issues would
have a huge amount of background to assimilate - the Taylor inquiry alone produced
over 120 files of written material. One possible candidate for the job with a head
start would be Mr Justice Collins, now a High Court judge, but Counsel to the Taylor
inquiry in 1989. We have not approached LCD to see if he would be available, but
could do so if you wish. There would be some risk that he might be perceived -
although not, I think, by the Hillsborough families - as not totally impartial because of
his previous involvement with the inquiry,

10.   The scope and timetable will have implications for the costs to the
department. There is no provision for such costs at present.

11.     On handling the next step will be to secure the agreement of the Attorney and
the DPP. I have told their offices broadly what you have in mind and that you are
likely to approach them formally soon. The Heritage Secretary should also be kept
informed because of his responsibility for safety at sports grounds. The Lord
Chancellor will have to be approached to nominate a judge.

          Once you have colleagues’ agreement we will put forward advice on handling
   an announcement and how to inform the main players. We see those as being the
   Hillsborough families, the Merseyside MPs, and the South Yorkshire Police. Others,
   however, also have a close interest and arrangements will have to be made to warn
   them in advance - particularly former chief superintendent Duckenfield who will be a
   focus of media attention.

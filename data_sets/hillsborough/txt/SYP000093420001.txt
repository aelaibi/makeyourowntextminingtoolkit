Whilst       eatinq         my meal            in^The         canteen,          Chief        Inspector         (now

immediately.




We    left       the    station           and       travelled          at      speed       to H i l l s b o r o u g h .       Whilst

When       passing          Hillsborough                 Park,       along      Middlewood             Road,      a    police

transit,          which        appeared             full      of     officers,         was       patrolling            slo w l y ,

travelling             away        from       the     gr o u n d .




We    parked         our     vehicle           on     the     central          reservation             of P e n i s t o n e       Road and

entered          the    ground           via       the    l a r ge    g at e    which       allows        access        towards        the

what       our    instructions                 were.




He    t o l d me       to    take        my    serial         onto     the      pitch and           report        to    the       senior

I returned             to rny m e n a n d           told       them          that        we    st ill       di d    not      know what              had

happened          but     we      were      to    go    onto           the     pit ch.           I told        them         to    stay       near

me.



We    entered          the      pitch       via     ths^'gap b e t w e e n                the     Kop and           the      North S t a n d ,

As    ws    turned        to      our      right,        onto          the     pitch,          I could         see      a    line       of

possibility             of      persons          having        been          killed.

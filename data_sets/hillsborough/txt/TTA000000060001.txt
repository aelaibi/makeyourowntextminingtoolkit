PRIME MINISTER

NORTH WEST REGIONAL TOUR, FRIDAY 27 JULY


You leave No.10 at 0830 tomorrow to fly from Northolt to
Manchester.    Some robust shoes will be needed at one stage in
the afternoon.    The weather is forecast to remain warm.          On
returning to Northolt you will be changing for your evening
engagement there.


Press Office have provided the attached note giving timings and
other details of your movements during the day.            There is a good
deal of media coverage, with perhaps the best photo opportunities
on the Mersey Ferry in the afternoon.       It has become quite an
attraction for tourists (who do the round trip over and back)
apart from those who commute by ferry to their daily work.


Two hours at the Cathedral will be a more relaxed time - with a
30â€”minute ceremony     in which you unveil a commemorative plaque,
followed by a tour of exhibits and then a buffet lunch away from
the media.


I attach some speech notes for when you unveil the plaque:
otherwise there is nothing formal during the da y.


Briefing from Departments on the four main official events is in
the folders as follows:


1030-1130        SERC, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington
1155-1350        Liverpool Cathedral
                 This includes an advance copy of the unveiling
                 ceremony and the Dean*s speech of welcome.             At
                 Flag A is the guest list for lunch
1355-1425        Mersey Ferry
1445-1520        Ellesmere Boat Museum


There is also a Party tea (1530-1645) at Ellesmere Port.

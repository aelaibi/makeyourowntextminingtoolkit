On turning       into L ep p i n g s Lane we were             confronted with heavy                                                         ;

pede st ri an traffic,          our driver,        PC Leake,            drove slowly and gave a few

short    horn warnings          which seemed to            incite        resentment of our

presence.        I a d v i s e d PC Leake       not      to use the horn any more                    than

nece ss ar y and PC Leake             responded to this.                 We stopped outside                   the                       -

supporters        still      trying     to enter        the ground.            I could see and hear a

P.A.    operating          from a police Land Rover,                   requesting the          crowd to stop--,

pushing.         I nspector Scho le y spoke              briefly with PC Trcek and whilst                                        he

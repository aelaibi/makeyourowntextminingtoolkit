 end of the ground.

The actual          journey to the ground took a p p r o x i m a t e l y                13 minutes,        I had

no d i f f i c u l t y getting         to the ground .and on our arrival                    I parked     in

^Leppi ngs Ln opposite               the forecourt             of a void     petrol    station,        I have

m a r k ed my      position on a sketch map w hich                    I now produce as          reference

numb© r                1 Exhibit No,              (       ).

                                              5s are       to stay with        the engine on the

i n st ru c t i o n of S ub -O f f i c e r                     Sub Officer                F i remen

                        and                 then left the engine taking with them a

 r e s u s c i t a t o r , a first aid kit,              a short    extension       ladder and two

salvage       sheets.

At a pp r o x i m a t e l y   15.40 hrs           I was    sitting    in the engine an d          I saw that

the Liverpool           Supp o r t e r s    were       beginning     to    leave    the ground via the

L ep p i n g s Ln entrance and they were                       in groups     of fours and fives,               I

saw that        nearby the gates              to the ground were             police officers and

be h i n d me      in Leppings        Ln was another             group of      police office r s , A s     some

of the Liverpool              S u p p o rt er s    left    the ground       they were     shouting

abuse at        the    police,       blaming          them for what had happened.               One

s u p por ter was shouting              that       the    police were       “fuckin mu r d e r i n g

bastards".

At a pp r o x i m a t e l y   15.45 hrs           the same date,          two Liverpool      suppo r t e r s

came up to the fire                engine and knoc k e d on the d r i v e r ’s door,                   I opened

the door        to speak       to them.            I saw that       they were white males,             approx.

35 years        of age with Liverpool                    accents.     One man had fair hair and                the

other     had mid brown hair,                     I d o n ’t remember anyth i n g        else about      them

except      that      they were well              dressed.      The man with the fair hair               just

said,     "Thank you" and the one with                         the darker     hair said,      “ It's O.K.

                                                                                                                 S85 2

            mate we're           not getting at you,             i t ’s them bastards",        and he g e s t u r e d

          * towards        the    police.     These    two Liverpool          supporters       then wa l k e d       off

            away    from the ground.

            I didn't       really notice m u c h else              because    I was    too    busy w a t c h i n g   the

            fire    engine,        ensuring    that    none of the equipment             was     stolen.

            Pe o p l e were       constantly       leaving       the ground and by about            16.00 hrs        there

            was a great          increase     in the numbers          of supporters          leaving    the ground

            together,       most     of L e p pings Ln was          crowded w ith the         leaving     supporters.

            Several    Liverpool        supportej^^wej^ep spitting at the engine an d kicking

            it as    they        passed by.    \ X c^yiffo trie's c r i be    them because        there were         too

            m any   people       passing     by.     I didn't       see anyone    fighting and w hen             I later

            e:<arriined the engine           there was       no actual       damage.

            I was    e vent u a l l y joined by the              rest of Red W a t c h at about         16.30 hrs

            and they       told me that a great many of the Liverpool                          supporters        had

            been killed          in a crowd        crush    in the West S t a n d of the ground.

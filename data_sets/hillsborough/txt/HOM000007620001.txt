EMBARGOED UNTIL H.S. ANNOUNCEMENT

While the following will not form part of the Home Secretary's
main statement it will be used should he be asked about the
nature of the inquiries to be undertaken by West Midlands Police.
You may wish to use similar wording in any announcement to the
media.


Mr Peter Wright, Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police,
has requested that inquiries into the planning and operational
decisions of South Yorkshire Police be undertaken by another

force and has asked that the results of their work should be
given to the Inquiry.   Accordingly West Midlands Police will

conduct these enquiries and will report them to Lord Justice
Taylor.

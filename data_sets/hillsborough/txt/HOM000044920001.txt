     Dear Sir

     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

     I write to inform you that the Delegated Powers Committee of the
     Merseyside Fire and Civil Defence Authority at its meeting held
     on 9 March 1998 upon consideration of a Motion submitted by the
     Chairman relating to your recent announcement by the Home
     Secretary that following a scrutiny on new evidence by Lord
     Justice Stuart-Smith, there would be no further investigation
     of any sort into events related to the 198 9 Hillsborough Stadium
     Disaster, passed the following Resolution, Viz :-

         "Resolved that in the light of the deep public concern
          expressed in relation to the decision of the Home Secretary
          regarding Hillsborough and also in view in particular of
          any potential emergency planning and emergency service
          implications this Authority calls upon the Home Secretary
          to reconsider his decision in the public interest."

     Yours faithfully

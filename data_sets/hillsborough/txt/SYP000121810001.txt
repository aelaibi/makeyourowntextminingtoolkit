                 1988 S E M I - F I N A L !     L I V E R P O O L V. NOTTS.           FOREST

                 With    reference        to     the above         subject,         on the given date             in question,

                 under     the     supervision          of PS 229 C a b l e , I was                 i n itially on duty at the

                 turnstiles          giving a c c e s s      to the L e p p i n g s Lane             terrace and stand at

                 Hillsborough          football         ground,

                 My    recollections           of   the o ccas i o n was            that 2 officers were                placed at

                 the m o u t h of each turnstile,                      checking       entrance        tickets     of supporters

                 and    causing any           potent xally o f f e n s i v e / d a n g e r o u s       items such as

                 banners,        staves       to be     left outside             gr o u n d   plus ensuring          that    cans

                working        together        to organise             fans a p p r o a c h i n g   the mo u t h s    of the

                 turns t i l e s     into o r d e r l y queues.

                A r o u n d 3pm      (1500)      this    heavy         influx     had    reduced to what             I would

                 describe as a light                influx        of    "last m i n u t e      stragglers*        running         to the

                 ground.         In general         the flow had d i m i n i s h e d to such an extent                           that   I

                was able,          on several         occasions,           to go      into Leppings           Lane    itself

                searching          for y o u n g s t e r s without           tickets,         having    in p o s s e s s i o n

   At about 3 . 1 0 pm              (1310)    having   d is c h a r g e d    the tickets,       along with

   other            officers       I then went     inside     the ground and took               up position        in

   the       central        tunnel     giving access        to the          centre of the L e p p i n g s Lane

   terrace.              My exact      position was at          the terrace           end of that       tunnel.

   I recall            that    s t a nding    suppo r t e r s were     backed up from the             rear of the

   terrace            steps    some 8 ’~10*       into the tunnel             itself from which          position

   sight            of the game was almost             impossible and any view down the terrace

   itself,            impossible.

   My     i m pression         from    latecomers      attempting            to    penetrate    the   rear   of the

   crowd at this               point was       that    pressure       in the        centre   terrace was

   intense as they almost with o u t                     exception           failed to do so and          ran back

   up the tunnel               in an attempt          to find a more              suitable    vantage    point.

   forwards            towards       the    terrace    in front      of me.

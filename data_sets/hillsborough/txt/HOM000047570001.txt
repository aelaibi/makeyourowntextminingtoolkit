Thank you for your letter of 21 October 1997 and enclosed copy of a letter you had written to
Mr Leo Fallon, which we had previously discussed.

As far as our policy on the release of photographs and video stills is concerned, there has been
no change of approach in what we release to relatives or their legal representatives. Any
photograph of video still that is contained within a body file is released without any form of
editing, ie they are released in the format in which they were presented to the Coroner's Inquest.
Neither have we to the best of my knowledge edited any video still showing scenes on the pitch
or the terraces. We do where it is possible edit the video stills showing scenes from the
temporary mortuary so that only one body is visible, but this is not possible on all occasions
because of the way the bodies were laid out and the angle at which the video camera was to the
bodies. I accept that there will have been occasions when we have released a still from the
mortuary video that shows a part of a second body where it was impossible to blank it out without
destroying the picture content.

As you rightly point out in your letter to Mr Fallon we are continuing to supply stills from the video
to relatives or their legal representatives. We will not supply a copy of the video itself to anyone.
If we were to do so and the video became public I fear the opprobrium against the
South Yorkshire Police would be impossible to overcome.

We all        caught a local          bus and went              to a small      vi 1 la^e/on the outskirts

of S h e f f i el d and had a drink and something                            to e$t    ^ri^a/pub.      We

returned back to the G r o u nd                      by local     bus and a r r i v e d at the        entrance

to the Gr o u n d at about                1420 hours.

I did not see any fans                    drinking          in the streets       or any dist u r b a n c e s

during my travel              to the Ground.

When we arri v e d at the G r o un d we made                       our way to 'the Leppings              Ln

t u rnstiles         of the Ground,            where we         intended to enter.           ,

As we a pp ro a c h e d the          turnstile area,              I could see a \ m a y s I o n people

ar o u nd     the    immediate are a of the turnstiles.                         They were m a s s e d       in the

fo recourt          a p p r o ac h area    from wall           to wall,      afaout^-30 deep.       There were

no uni f o r m e d queues and              I could see s e v e r al Pj/r L ^ c ji O f f icers        m o u n t e d on

horses        in the forecourt area,                    but    I bel i^vjj/onllfyy^wp^actual ly in

a mon g s t    the supporters.                 I was     not aware      of any     club stewards         being

present        in this area.

The moment           I got    into    the       crowd to make my way to the turnstiles                           I

could hear           supporters       shouting at the m o u n t e d Police O f f icers                   to do

s o m ething with the            crowd to            relieve     pressure      on fans at the front                  by

the   t u rn stiles        themselves.               None     of the   fans a p p e a r e d to be making

progress        in getting        thro u g h the turnstiles and the                     crowd was      getting

larger all           the time.

          I then myself            said to the Policeman,                 "For God's sake,        get your       horse

          in here and sort              it out".          I could see       there were young         children       in

          the      crofwd and we were             shoulder    to shoulder and           people were        beginning

          to s/ffer         the effects           of the    crowding.

A        J ^ r re   was     nQ o rg an is at io n at               a n d it seemed to be every man f o r

          ^lmself.          The O f f i c e r s    on horseback       seemed       ineffective and did not

          seem able         to    cope.

          I e v e n t ua ll y was able            to get through one             of the turnstiles at Entrance

          B.       I had been split            up from my friends            but once      inside   the G r o u n d      I

          waited      in the are a by the                turnstiles and event u a l l y met         up w ith all my

          friends         except                                   The time would have been about 2 . 4 5 p m

          ("1425) when           I a c tu al ly    got    inside    the    turnstiles.

          Up     to this     time     I had not w i t ne ss ed any           illegal     entry to the G r o u n d or

          an y     fighting       or drunkenness.

          Once      i ns i de the     t urnstiles         I m ov e d over     to the    r i ght   and stood      close

          to the      blue       concertina        gate.     I could see          clearly to the t urnstiles                 to

          wait      for my friend.

          I stood talking             to a G r o u n d steward at           the    blue gates      still    waiting

          for               to    come through.            My other       friends and son m oved s l i g h t l y

          a w ay    from me,       also w ai t i n g      for him.

          As     I was     talking      to the      steward about          the    crowding    outside      the

          turnstiles,            a Policeman        in unif o r m    came over       to us and told the

          s t e w a r d to open the         c o ncertina      gate.        I did not hear the          conv e r s a t i o n

          then      but the       next thing        the    steward    put his finger          to the    side     of his

          head,      indicating         that      the Police Offi c e r was          crazy.       The Policeman,             I

             under     the W Stand.

             It's     di fficult     for me to say how many fans                    entered through the gate at

             this     time,    but there were        certainly several               hundred.

             I w o u l d estimate       the gate     opening       o c c urred a p p r o x i m a t e l y   10 minutes

             a fter    I had got through           the turnstiles and               I would think          the   time was

             about     1455 hours.

             I c o ntinued      looking       for _______ |from the          same        position near to the gate

             and w h e n   I looked towards          the gate a gain            I saw about 6 u n iformed

             opening,      the gate was          closed.

             About     five minutes       later,     the    gate wa| vA                             and more     fans

             to move at a fast walk i n g            pace.       I did not get an               impression that          they

             were     running.

             I did not see the gates               being    closed because at this                   point    I was     still

             trying     to find K en n y an d       .it was about          kick-off         time.

             The    next    thing     I remember was        some     sort     of    commotion over by the

             entrance       to the tunnel.                                                 *

             I feel     sure that there were           doors       or door across              the entrance m o u t h of

             the    tunnel     and    I m oved    towards     it on hearing               shouting and screaming.

             As    I got to the steps            leading    to the       tunnel,          I realised a lot of the

             com m o t i o n was     people    on my side of the door,                    shouting to a Police

             Officer       in uniform wit h a flat            cap,     who    I believe may have              been a

             Senior     Officer a l t h o u g h    I ’m not    c o mpletely sure.

             People     were    shouting and beckoning               to the Officer             to corne over      to the

             door     to get    it opened.

             At first      the Police Offi c e r       did not seem to                   respond to the u r g e n c y of

             the    people     calling    him,     but as they         continued           he ended up       running to

                 burst    open and fans              spil l e d out of the            tunnel             asking       for help.

                 My m e m o ri es are a little vague at this                          point             because       I don't       really

                 know what       happened then,              but    I was aware               of many          people       lying    on the

                 ground with other              people       standing         over    them,             trying       to help them.

                 I. could see many            people        trying     to give        cardiac massage                      to the fans              on

                 had died and were              dying.         I lost track of all                       time and for a while,                          I

                 just    stood      in a haze.

                 I then became aware                 of a girl        standing        over a young man who was                            lying

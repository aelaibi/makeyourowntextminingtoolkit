    Dear Monsieur Paolini,

                                        Hillsborough Tragedy

         Since the tragic events at Hillsborough on the 15th April Local Authorities
    on Merseyside, plus Cheshire and Lancashire, together with the Mersey Regional
    Health Authority, Merseyside Probation Service and numerous voluntary social services
    organisations have been providing a co-ordinated response.   On the 29th April the
    Leaders of the seven Local Authorities and the Leaders of Nottinghamshire and
    Sheffield met to consider a joint approach to services which will continue to be
    necessary for several years to come.

         The attached report, prepared under the independent Chairmanship of the
    Professor of Social Work at Manchester University, was agreed in principle. The
    report recommends the establishment of a Regional Unit to provide a core of common
    services, including:—

            i)       A Helpline to receive calls from anywhere day and night;

          ii)        The Co-ordination of counselling services both within and outside
                      the nine local authorities provided by voluntary as well as
                      statutory agencies;

         iii)         A Database capable of dealing with all requests for assistance and
                      offers of help;

          iv)         A continuing training and staff support programme in this previously
                      unfamiliar area of work;

            v)        The management of media contacts and publicity.



                                                                        /continued

Monsieur F. Paolini,                                         5th May, 1989.

     It was agreed to reconvene the meeting following exploration of all
possible sources of funding.   Recognizing that services will need to extend
beyond these local authorities and be available on a scale not previously
experienced by authority or group of authorities, our first approach for funding
has been addressed to the British Government.   While it is anticipated that the
British Government will wish to provide financial support it is envisaged that the
European Community will also want to assist, and be identified with this initiative.
Football is the national sport of many member nations and it is understood that the
Community has been associated with work following other disasters.

     The five Merseyside Local Authorities have already demonstrated to the
Community    their common approach to the promotion of the Merseyside Integrated
Development Organisation.   This work following the disaster in Hillsborough
(Sheffield) includes these authorities plus the contiguous Counties of Cheshire
and Lancashire and has now been extended further to include the two localities of
Sheffield and Nottingham.

      Assistance is being sought from our own Government towards the financing of
the Regional Unit (referred to in the attached report) for three years at an annual
cost Of £350,000.    Financial help from the European Community is also sought
because of the scale of the disaster and the number of people affected.    Other
alternatives are also being pursued including private industry sponsorship,
charitable bodies and assistance from football organisations.    Within all the
participating local authorities it will also be necessary to strengthen staffing
in order to directly help individuals and their families according to the scale of
the problems which they are facing.    As yet these costs have not been fully
assessed, but when aggregated are unlikely to be less than £1 million per year.
The Community, we hope, would wish to be aware of this and may consider making
resources available to assist in direct service provision as well as the Regional
Unit.

     It is, of course, appreciated that the British Government has already donated
£500,000 towards the National Disaster Appeal Fund.   According to reports in the
British Press the European Community is also considering making a contribution of
£250,000.   This Fund has, quite properly, focussed its attention on the relief of
individual hardship and will provide financial help directly to victims, but will
not do away with the need for other help of a non-financial nature      tobe provided

     An early decision on financial support would be most appreciated as it is
anticipated that other potential sources of finance will await the      response ofthe
British Government and the Community before making a commitment. It is also

realised that these papers may not provide sufficient information, and in order
to avoid any delay I would, of course, be prepared to provide any additional
detail and meet you for discussions at your earliest convenience.   Alternatively
you may feel it appropriate to visit Merseyside in order to see the situation for
yourself. This could be arranged without either delay or difficulty.

     It is hoped that you will be able to reply as quickly as possible, with a
positive response to this request.

                                        Yours sincerely

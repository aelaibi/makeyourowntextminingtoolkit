                  had one

&     r     t

                  During     the briefing         on the morning          it had taken at             least   15 minutes

                  for a number         of O f f icers       to explain what would happen                 in the    case of

                  e v a c u a t i o n and where      each set     of fans would         go from each stand and who

                  w ould be responsible              for the e v a c u a t i o n   of each      part of the ground.

                  That    is done at every match               on every briefing,             it was     only a couple          of

                  weeks    before H i l l s b o r o u g h    disaster     that     they had a practice            evacuation

                  at Bramell       Ln during a game,             a code word of         "fir Meadows          is required at

                  C ontrol    room" a bell           sounds and all         e m e rgency doors were           open,     no fans

                  were    a s ked to    leave,       then a code of         "Hr Meadows         is no    longer    required'1

                  is said and all          goes      back    to normal.         The same      procedure        is laid out

                  for    both grounds and            is exp l a i n e d at every j a m s .

                  spirits,      drinking       it on the yay asking                us the way to pubs,           they were

                  the    road and      into the grounds           of a public         house,     we    crossed over and

                  advised     these     fans    to make       their way to the ground and about                    their

                  behaviour.        When we       did this they m oved              on we did not get any              oat-k

                  The    fans were      too    busy     looking     f o r/pubs and drinking             that going

                  towards     the ground and at 2 .30               orfh (1430 hrs)         when we were w a l k i n g

towards        the ground there were             loads,    groups walking away from the

g r o u nd asking      us where       pubs were-         These     groups were all         lads aged

from twenty to thirties.



I heard one           lad say    "I've        lost me    ticket". Another         lad     inhis     group

said     "Don't w orry you'll            get    in w ith us".



We    got    back to the ground               between    2.4 5   pm and 2.5 0      pm(1445      -- 1450

hrs),       we got     back ground and          I was with S e c t i o n Officer

there was a lot of speech on the                     radio,       but    I could not make         out what

was     being    said,    I ente r e d the ground thro u g h the big blue gates                       from

the Peni stone Rd             leading    to the gym and then ,,<&'long the gravel                   path on

T hen    I went    back to gate,            then     I realised       no one else         could get         out

because       they were all         blocking         gate    the    kids at front         c o u l d n ’t breath

and the       pushing was         getting worse            it was    unbelievable.



I took rny overcoat              off and      put    it on           spikes      on top of the          gate and

a. Bobbie      held rne legs and            leant ^Ver and started to pull                     the    kids      out

but a lot were a lr ea dy dead, ^tnis                      is how I got my          injuries      the

pressure       caused     internal b r u i s i n g         on my    ribs.       I was    literally       just

t hrowing      peo pi e over               ea d .    I d o n ’t know where my s t r ength               carne

from,     it was      just ^ " r us h      to see how m any          I could get         to,   people were

getting       caught    i / wire       on top of fence and everything.



I then had a k id get              stuck      in wire       to my    left a s pi k e wa s s t u c:k in his

face    his   trousers were            caught       up and he       c o u l d n ’t get over,      it was

ho r r i b 1e sight,      I pulled him by his                legs    it wa s the only thing              1 could

>c<'o'        grab    it ripped his        ear and side            of His       face.       I pulled hirn over       onto

              the    track,    he was     IQ or        11 his     name w a s __________ |l carried on to             pitci

              I put    him down and         I want       to get St J o h n ’s Ambulance and w hen we                      ot

        92    back the young          lad was     d e a d , he just        said      "I    cannot   breath,      I can not

              breath".



              I went    back    to the fence,            by this in me          I was      crying and     I began    to
m        *1
              pull    people    out again.             I just W o u l d n ’t believe           that he had died,

              [ c o u l d n ’t believe what w a s y m a p p e n i n g .             I pulled a young       girl    out,    she

              had nothing       on top,        she wi6s bare to the waist,                    she was    dead.     I c a n ’t

              remember     what    she    looked, like,           I carried her all             the way to the qynu

              and    put her down and^carne back out.



              I went    back again,         then the few of us that were                       there    began to shake

              fence    to pull      it down,      the fence         came    down from top and we boun c e d on

              it to get       it to     come    down,      but    it bent wrong way             it went    in wards

              towards    crowd.         We jumped on it and e v e n t u a l l y               it fell    but    it fell    on

              people    in front.



              F-'eople were     under     the fence         hunched up,             I think    they were a l r e a d y
    &
              dead,    but we were        stood on them then               I went         onto the t e r r a c e , there

              was    pressure     but    it had eased a bit               I was moving          bodies    out    of way and

              other    bodies were        falling        towards        front    on some of the faces             of the

              dead    I could see        the    implant       of the fence where              they had been        crushed

              against    it.      Then we       were      throwing       people           through        the gap in the fe

              we had made,        we were       throwing         the ones we thought were alive.                    We were

              doing    this    for about        13 minutes.



              Then    I was    s ur r o u n d e d by    loads
                                                                                /
                                                                  of dead/Dodies,             but   I could see     towards

              back    by the tunnel         there were           kids    1/ky floor        injured,     but still    alive,

   just      picked them up one at jp'time and                   ran through t u n n e l with

them,       once on the other               si^e there were      loads       of people     lay on floor

and    I just       left    them wi/h, ambulance and medical                   staff and went           back

for more.           I m ov e d about         ten people   through          this way.      I did see what

they    looked       like or find out/who             they were,           there wasn't     time       to     think

of that



I went       back to the f r o n t           of the stand and there were               lots of P o l i c e m e n

pulling       people       Qufi. one P o l i ce an    pulled me out and said " Y o u ’ve done

en o u gh you       canVt do any more".



I was       just    b ew i l d e r e d at    this   stage my mind was switched off                 I was

looking       for something           to do some way of helping,                 but   I was    physically

k nac kered.

Hi 1 Isborough.



   just      think the whole            thing was a /tragic accident                but   I think       the

L i verpool        fans and      in future any fans         should be a l l o w e d to walk                 to the

gr o un d drinking.

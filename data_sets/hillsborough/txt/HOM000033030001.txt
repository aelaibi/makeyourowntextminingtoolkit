                 Re: Hillsborough Disaster

                 Thank you for your letter/6f 17 Apri!                                                         regarding those who were due to
                 give evidence to the Taylor Inquiry

                 I was somewhat surprised at the^a^ture of your response. You will of
                 course be aware that 96 lives were lost at Hillsborough. I cannot
                 therefore understand your position that the answer to my query could
                 be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

                 The Hillsborough Families, and I believe the vast majority of people
                 who viewed the television drama about the disaster, are in no doubt
                 that this case has yet to be fully investigated, and that all
                 information regarding the case should be made available to the
                 Hillsborough Families.

                 In my view, there can be no limit placed on the price of justice. I
                 would therefore ask that you reconsider your decision and the
                 comments contained in paragraph three of your letter.

                  I look forward to hearing from you.

                 Yours sincerely

       You asked for comments on the draft submission. The draft submission is well
       balanced and comprehensive in its coverage. It may well be right not to appear too
       unequivocal, especially with new Ministers. There are a few areas however where I




h     have a number of suggestions for minor amendments which might make things a bit
      clearer for new Ministers. There are also a few typos.


              Paragraph 5 (ii)
              Replace “There” with “They”


              Paragraph 5 (iii)

              If such a thing exists, it would be useftl to include a plan of the ground
             otherwise references to gate C and pen 3 may mean little to Ministers.


             Paragraph 5 (v)

             It might be useful to refer to “Sheffield Wednesday football club’s” confused
             and inadequate signs and ticketing, as there is no previous reference to
             Sheffield Wednesday in the submission.


             Paragraph 8

            It might be useful to refer to the other possible verdicts which the inquest jury
            could have returned.




    F:\OPPIACOMPLNTS\MISC\PEOOOI MA.DOC
           Paragraph 9 line 9
           Delete “a”


          Paragraph 10 line 1
          “Review” should be in bold.


          Paragraph 10 line 7

          Do we accept that at least one of the victims was alive beyond the 3.15 cut off
          point, or do we wish to say that some believe there was such evidence?


          Paragraph 20
          The final two lines are repeated.


         Annex B third page

         In the text in the first line of the extract from the Taylor report at the bottom
         of the page “year” should be plural and south should have a capital S.”

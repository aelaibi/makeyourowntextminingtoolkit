Dur i ng this         period     large        numbers       o f L iverpool           fans arrived,        man y of

fans       did not have any             cans       of beer and a s ke d me where                the    nearest

open       public     house    w ou ld       be,     I told them that                only a few of the            pubs

the     ground.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 pm this             date    our serial        began to make            our way to

the C la y w he el s Lane Traf fi c Depot.                        As we w a l k ed to the depot

L i v er p o o l    fans were      still a rr iving as well                  as      emerging    from the Publi

T here were          large    groups         of youths       running d own towards               the    ground

aware       that     the m at ch w o ul d          be commencing.            I could see that m an y of

these youths           had been drinking                  heavily a nd were worse the wear                     for

made       my way towards         the        tunnel       under    the    stand      the dens it y of bodies

a r o u n d me      increased.          It was       then that          I saw     numerous      bodies     lying      on
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     S3042

the    floor a p pa r e n t l y     lifeless.

At    this      point many of the Liverpool                 fans    began to verbally a buse me

shouting         o bscenities       at me.
                                    c-A' >- _         X
Whi ls t     in the tunnel          a r e a,    bodiesNuapre being         carried out not only by

the Po li c e      but also       the Liverpool           fans were assisting.             I fought my

way    onto      the terraces an d from there e v en t u a l l y onto the                   pitch,     where

I joi ne d        a large     number      of     people who were a lr e ad y on the            pitch.

I then saw and            realised that           there had been a major              disaster.      Many

L iv erpool       fans h a d x been       crushed against          the    perimeter     barrier.       I

would      estimate       that    t W e        were    bodies    of up to five to six deep.                As

other      officers       puisJed the bodies from the                   t er raced area    I assisted       in

laying       them onto      the     playing       surface area.           I lost   count of the        number

of    people      I laid out and          not one of them were              showing any

signs      of    life.

11 was       now that      the hoa rd in gs were           being    taken down and used as

stre tc he r s     for the       injure d and dead.

Once    they were         removed to the other              end of the         ground an Inspector

come up to me and told me                      to make    the L iverpool       fans   return to the

terraces.          This was       futile as they were              looking      for friends and

relatives.

A short         time    late>r t og et he r with other            o ff icers    I helped    to form a

cordon across            t h e centre     line of the           pitch    in order to      prevent    the

rival      fans    from    clashing       who had prev io us ly           been taunting       each other.

Some    time      later    I heard       it a n n o u n ce d that       the m at ch was    now o f f ic i al l y

a bandoned.            The gr ou nd was         event ua ll y    cleared and we        returned to the

H a li fa x Road area as            planned.          As most     of the    cars and      coaches    left

the a rea we           returnd to the Clayw he el s              Lane Depot,

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6.30    pm this          date we were       stood down and       conveyed

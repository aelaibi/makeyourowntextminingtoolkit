The Police seemed to be scared on the day which is unusual

because they are usually good.      Also the fans should have

had the other ends.     ie   Liverpool with better support

should have had the Kop End.



Also the c1ose-circuit T.V,     inside the ground which the Club

have bragged about should have picked up the fact that Pens 3

and 4 were full and tunnel gate should have been closed.

p r o v i s i o n of          resources          to    t ha t     building.




As    information about                      casualties             became        available          from       the    Casualty

c op y    of    the       casualty           lists.




In v i e w      of     the       delicate         nature          of    the     t as k   in hand,          we    determined              t hat

there      would          be     no      public       announcement              of     the    contents          of    the    list        but

t ha t    he w o u l d m e e t            with    individual             members         of    his    staff          and    they     in

turn would             then         individually               brief     the      relatives and             friends          of    t ho se

who      had    been          i d e n t i f i e d as      casualties.




This      process             continued          throughout             the     evening        a n d at     its       height,        I

would assume                  there       would       be s o m e t h i n g      in the        region       of 2 0 0        friends         and

relatives            in the H i l l s b o r o u g h B o y ' s                C lub .     About       9.13       pm    (2115)

information was                     received          t ha t    the     temporary mortuary                  would          shortly         be

able      to    undertake                identifications                of    the      victims       of    the       disaster.




T h r o u g h Mr       COOPER            information was                disseminated            to    the       relevant          friends

and      relatives             and arrangements                   were       m a de    for    those       people       to    be

conveyed          by      bus       to    the    gymnasium.




It w a s       d e c i d e d at          that    stage         t ha t   these         people    should          not    be a l l o w e d

to    return         to       the     H i l l s b o r o u g h B o y ’s C l u b as            their    distress             may    h av e    an

adverse         effect           on      those    who      s til l      had     to     undertake          the    exercise.

             The    identification              process        at   the   gymnasium        proved        quite      t im e

             consuming         and    there      was    s om e      considerable       delay       in    carrying        out      the

             process        in full.



             About    4.00 am          (0400)     as    identifications            were     coming        to a      close,        I m a de

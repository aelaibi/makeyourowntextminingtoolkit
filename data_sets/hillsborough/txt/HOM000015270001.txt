      HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM : INTERIM ADVICE

      Mr Patten has seen a copy of Mr Turney's submission of 26 April.
      He commented:

           "I do not think that a circular is particularly a good idea,
           as it may look as though it is preempting some of Lord
           Justice Taylor's report, and also because our advice could
           hit the wrong targets."

      He agreed with Mr Turney's point (para 6) that to select any
      portion of the Guide would devalue the rest of it.

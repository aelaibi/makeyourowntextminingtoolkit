               I have      been booked by the Berw i c k                    upon '‘T w e e d L i v ^ p o o l    S u p p o r t e r s Club

               to take      them to one           or two matches             a ver t^hpXpaat year'.

               Two weeks        before         the Cup Semi Final                w hi ch was    to be    played at

               Hillsborough,,           Sheffield,         between L i verpool             and Notts Forest,              I was

               co ntacte d      by the S e c r e t a r y       of the B e r w i c k S u p p o r t e r s Club and a coach

               bo o k e d for     the game.            On the M o n d a y or T u e s d a y       before        the m a t c h     I was

               ag a i n   contacted           by the    club and       told the          coach would       have to be

               c a nc e l l e d as they had            no tickets.

               At 9am 0900 on S a t u r d a y             15 April         1989    150489      the day of the m a t c h             I

               was a g a in     contacted by the Berwick S u p p o r t e r s                    C lub and told that

               twenty five          tickets       had a r ri ve d and            could    I provide a coach.
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S 2 4 1'

I a g r e e d to     provide a coach and had a ticket                      for the m^'tch for myself

and    son.        I went    f.n— a ^ w i c k   and     picked up m e n from v^fious             points and

left                          Muse      at      10.30am     1030.      We stop a e d once       on the     route

for fuel       and f<pod a n d did not get held up                      in a n / traffic,       it was a

good       journey.      We a r ri ve d      in S h e f f i e l d and were       directed to a Notts

Forest       car    park,    this was        put    right and we         later    parked      in a street

about       one mile     from the ground,               it was    now 2 . 2 2 pm 1422.

As    soon as       I stop p e d the        passengers       on my      coach got out and wal k e d              off

t owards      the    ground.       I checked the            bus and my S yr old son had a drink

as    I did and        then we     left      for    the ground.

On the way to the             ground        I did not see anv>^Crouble but                 I did see

people       drinking       from" cans ana also             saw a      lot of cans      lying aro u n d         the

streets       and on walls.           On the way'l           a sked a p o l iceman where          I should

go w ith      the    ticket     I had,       he / o 1d me       he did    not know but to go towards

the    gro und and        I w o u ld be d i r ected from there.                  I carried on walking

towards       the    ground an d a l t h o u g h        I did not      know where       I was    going      I

ended       up at    the Le ppi ngs/Hn end where my ticket was                         for.

When       I got    to L e p p i n a * Ln    I was met       by a mass      of    people all      trying         to

get    into the       grounds        There was          no queues      just a ma<ss of         people.

T here was also           people     trying        to   cross    the    crow^/to    get to other          parts

of the       ground.

We got w i t h i n about 30 feet                of the      t u rnstile when we were            stopped       by

P olice H orses w hi c h were               placed to stop the            crowd and give         the

    :              who was s t a n d i n g up on a car to m y right wit^n a speaker

telling       people      not to     push,      he was trying          to get, i m e    start    of the game

to    be    put back.        I don't        think man y      people      he>*Td or took any heed

of this.           We moved     forward after a while and was wi t h i n                      10 to    12 feet

from the       turnstile w h e n a large                roar went      up from     inside     the ground.

I think       this was      the    players         coming    out and this         started      people    to

climb up the wall              and over     the t u r nstile and            there was a p o liceman on

the wall       above     the    turnstile,       pulling        people      up.     I think he was         doing

this     rather     than let them fall            back       onto the       people      underneath,        1

also     saw anot h e r p o liceman on horse                 back   pulling        people     back off     the

wall    w h i ch was     to the    right      of me,      these      people were waving            tickets at

him as     if this       gave    them the       right     to    climb the wall.

By    now we were        getting       rather    crushed and was             still      quite away from

the    t u r nstile a n d      I was    getting        w o r r i e d about my son,        I   a sked    people

to give me some           room for my boy              and they did. 1'           got     to the turnstile

with     the help of people a r o un d you who gave what                           help they      could.        I

went     t hr o u g h the end t u r n stile       at    the next          near a wall,        I gave my

ticket     up and once          inside     it was a'j.ot easier.

I made my way towards              t h e stadia, taking             the    right    hand stairs         up to

the    seats,     it was a r ou nd yC ni s       time     that      I h eard the whistle           go for the

start    of the match.            My(ticket       was     not    checked          by anyone      once    I had

passed the t u rnstile            and       I was      not    d i r ected    by anyone        to my seat.       I

did not     see any gates          open near           the t u rnstile when          Icame thro u g h or

until     I got    to the stairs.

On    reaching     the    top of the        stairs       it hec&fie very           congested,      it was
                                            -^5 T 7 \r -J T ) s '
clear    that     there was       far    too m any people            in the stand,            I saw no-one

sitting     down,      there was        too m a n y / p e o p i e , they were        stood      in the aisle

also.      I saw two men who             had t ra v e l l e d on my         bus and because            I knew we

all    had tickets        together       I /followed.           On reaching         our   seats    it was

impossible        to sit       down,      there was          people       stood everywhere,

I saw    people     next to me            pulling       people      up from the terrace            below,       I

saw the m at c h had star t e d and               did see the         ball kicked a few            times       but

I was    concerned        for my boy as.          we were getting           knocked       about    by people

who were       being     pulled up from           below.

I then     realised       that    the game        had been stop p e d and from my                 position       in

the    stand    I could see        that     people      in the      terrace        were   being    crushed.

I could see            people       turning        blue      on the terrace.               I remember      one

p articular           incident,       I saw a ma n w ith his a r m trapped by his                            side

trying         to give       the kiss        of    life to          persons    stood next          to him,    but

because         of the       crush    it was        not       possible       for    him to help the          person.

The      only d es cr i p t i o n     I could give of the                    person trying          to give      the

help was         that       he was age d 2 0 - 2 5 yrs and                  taller    than most       people aro u n d

h irn.

I saw that            the small       gate        i n>tfe      perimeter       fence ar o u n d      the    pitch

which       led from the            te r ra-fe below us was                open,     but    it a p p e a r e d blocked

by bodies.             The Rsrli c e were           pulling          people    out of the gate when

possible         a n d / T h e y were also          on the fence s h o uting at                   people   to move

back.          I^aw     no m o v e m e n t    on the terrace                it a p p e a r e d that the      people

were      just       that    packed they           could not move.                 On looking       down    into the

terraces         I saw a number              of    people       go from       panic and moving             their    head

to    complete         stillness       and they a p p e a r e d             dead or unconscious.              I also

saw St         Johns memb e r s       trying        to       pass    the    oxygen    pipe       through the       fence

to help         people.

It was         now getting          very     crowded          in the       stand and because          1 was getting

w or ri ed about my son               I deci d e d to try and                 leave    the ground.           Because

of the         crowd    I could       not see the aisle                    or the exit       but w ith great

d i ff i c u l t y    I m an ag ed    to     reach the          top of the stand and went                  down the

stairs         to the a r e a       inside        the    turnstiles.           This area was          clear of

people         but    I saw a crowd of              p o l icemen stood outside a large                     gate     near

to the         turnstile,       people were              running       up to the Pol ice and trying                    to

drag      them       into the       terrace        to help.          On    reaching        the    policeman      I told

them      that       there was       people        being       killed       in the    terrace and they would

have      to    relieve       the    pressure           from the       rear    but    I was told to          leave the

ground.          As we       passed the           policemen they all                went    into    the ground.

I w a lk ed slowly back               to the bus and                I saw Police           cars and a mbulances

rushing         towards       the ground.               As   I got     nearer       to the       bus there was a

            lot     of   people      rushing    from the        crowd to        coaches and telephones.

            I have a telephone             and TV     in the       bus so       I   put   the TV on to watch and

            several       people      used the telephone             to    phone     relatives     or friends.         We

            st a y e d   there    for   quite a while           before all the            passengers a r r i v e d back

            and     then we made        our way home.

            As far as         I am    con c e r n e d the    stew a r d i n g   inside    the ground at the time

            I ente r e d was         non existent.           1 could have qape a n y w h e r e         in the are a to

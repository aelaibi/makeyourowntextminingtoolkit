                I    live at         the a b o v e       address        w i t h my       husband.               I am a trained              state

                registered            nurse.

                On     1 5 th A p r i l     1989     (150489),              I w as a t        h om e   with my          husband,           when after

                switching            on the       television            set     I saw         the      pictures         of    the    disaster

                tha t     had       occurred        at    the H i l l s b o r o u g h         Football           Stadium       in S W e f f i e l d .

                As     a n u rse      I wanted           to    he 1 p , a n d      so    I phoned              the                   General

                Hospital            to offer        my    services,             I was         asked       to a t t e n d      the    hospital

                and     so m y       husband agreed               to    d r i ve    me     to    the N o r t h e r n         General.

                On     our w a y      to    the     hospital           we    had    to     pass        the      p o li ce    control        at

                the L e p p i n g s        Lane     entrance           of    the    g r o un d.         We      stopped       I went        a nd

                t im e a l m o s t      all    of    the       injured        had       been     removed             from    the    g r o u n d , and
                                                                                                                                                 PAGE          2
                                                                                                                                                 S3432

             they were          n ow     dealing          with       the       deceased.             It wa s       decided I would

             be    of m o r e      use      at    the N o r t h e r n          General         Hospital.                I t h e n left         my

             husband and            I was         taken        to    the       hospital         in a        police        van.

             On my arrival               at      the     hospital          by    now      it w o u l d       be    about        4 prn

             (1600),         I reported             to    the       nursing          officer         in    c h ar g e    at    the       casualty

             department.

             I was     asked        to      go    to     the P h y s i o t h e r a p y         u nit      w h i c h was       b e i ng    used

             as a h o l d i n g        area       for     patients             who    h ad     been       t r e a t e d a n d w er e

             either        waiting          to    go     h o me     or    spending           tim e     in the       recovery             unit

             after     treatment.

             1 was     asked        to      go    to     that       a r e a as       no m e d i c a l      staff        was    on d u t y        in the

             department,            and       in the        event         of    someone         suffering           delayed

             shock      I would          be a v a i l a b l e .           I spent        my     t ime      making        tea a n d

             reassuring            relatives             and      friends        of     the     i nju red.

             My    thoughts         after         the     incident             were     so     strong        that       I put      them        in the

             form     of a      l etter ,         covering           my    opinions            regarding           the     cau se s,          b l am e   and

             possible         solutions             concerning             the       disaster.             I sent a           copy       of

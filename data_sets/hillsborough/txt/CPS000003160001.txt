George Croston - Hillsborough Update

           Subject:         Hillsborough Update

           Yesterday I attended the Crown Court in Leeds where an application for a stay of the proceedings
           against Mr Duckenfield was heard. After some heated argument Hooper J directed the 'stay'. The
           hearing is well documented in the national press. His reasons for the judgement will be given on
           Friday 28 July.

           Attached are two file notes which explain the latest developments. The potential Reference would be
           concerning the directions given to the jury by Hooper J on the elements of manslaughter. This legal
           issue is of great importance at the present time.

1.    Discussed the approach from Ann Adlington with Chris Enzor. We agree that
      once the HFSG have legal advice then we could look at their opinion and all
      the relevant papers and decide if we should go to the A-G for a Reference.
      However, run this past the LSLO first,.

2.    T/C to Stephen Parkinson at the LSLO (0207 271 2403) to discuss the possible
      approach. He agrees with our view that we should look at the papers if sent to
      us. If our decision was not to go to the A-G then we should advise the HFSG
      that they can still make their own application for a Reference. He did say that
      the A-G is likely to look at any application 'wearily'.

3.    T/C to Ann Adlington of the HFSG. They will obtain their counsel's opinion
      on an A-G Reference and forward it to us as necessary. They will send a copy
      of the closing speeches, summing up and judgement asap. They understand
      that while there is no time limit for an application it should be dealt with
      speedily. I told them that regardless of any decision by us they could make
      their own application to the A-G direct.

ACTION: Await papers and discuss with CE as appropriate.

27 July 2000

1.    T/C to Ann Adlington of the HFSG. She agreed to send us a copy of the
      transcript of the summing up by the judge from last week, as well as a copy
      transcript of tomorrow's hearing on the reasons for the latest judgement given
      on 26 July. She is faxing through a copy of the four questions posed by the
      judge to the jury during his summing up.

2.    She said that if there had been a conviction there would have been open
       criticism of the original CPS decision making in 1990. She also said that there
       was no criticism of our recent decision making (presumably since the Granada
       TV documentary). Chris Newell might like to know that.

3.    The HFSG legal team is considering further legal action, namely an Attorney
       General's Reference on a point of law under section 36 Criminal Justice Act
       1972. However, they would want us to process the reference for them. I
       suggested that they take legal advice and then write to the Head of Division in
      York as necessary. I note that a referral can only be done where there is an
      acquittal rather than a 'stay'. Of course there was an acquittal re Murray and
       arguably re count 3 against Duckenfield as well. There is no time limit
      imposed except that the matter should be dealt with as speedily as possible.

4.    This poses the interesting question as to who, the private prosecutor or the
      CPS, should submit the papers to the A-G if there is any legal merit in the
      proposal. I have found nothing of assistance in either Archbold, the CPS
      Prosecution Manual or the Casework Directorate Manual. This is not
      unexpected, due to the fairly unique circumstances involved in the case.
      Perhaps the LSLO can say who should be making any application for a
      Reference.

                       ‘HILLSBOROUGH’

           Leeds Crown Court Wed 26 July 2000

RE: RULING ON RETRIAL

Note: Ann Adlington of the HFSG informed me that there had been a unanimous
decision at a meeting the evening before for an application for a retrial.

1030 Court 5
Pros:        Application for a retrial with a PTR on this point before another judge.

Def (D):     Oppose retrial, Hooper J to decide.

Pros:        Normally it should be a different judge. Hooper J’s directions to the
             jury were wrong re manslaughter, a gloss on Adomako. In the
             summing up the judge gave undue weight to the unknown mental state
             of Ds without considering the AG’s Reference. Note: Overall this was
             a strong attack on the judge by Alun Jones and criticised the judge for
             being biased.

J:           Guidance must be given to the jury as to the test re conduct which
             amounts to being criminal.

Def(D):      Jones’s remarks are addressed to the media. All the previous rulings
             made by the judge went against the Defence (Abuse of Process,
             oppressive trial etc). Not unknown for the same judge to do a retrial
             (CA authority to support this where a judge has extensive knowledge
             of a case). There should be a Stay of the proceedings as the
             Prosecution cannot be relied upon to be fair.

             It was believed that the Prosecution had conceded the way in which the
             test had been expressed. It is not accepted that the judge’s directions to
             the jury were flawed. The Prosecution is looking for a judge who is
             more favourable to them.

Pros:        Not an attack on the judge.

J:           You are suggesting that I am biased.
Pros:    No, the directions to the jury were wrong, the wrong tests were put to
         them, better for a second judge to hear the case, there were
         misdirections.

Judge:   I am against the Prosecution submission. I will hear this application.

npf-     Request a Stay on Counts 1 and 2 (two manslaughter charges against
         Duckenfield). Terms to be “ Not to be proceeded with by the crown
         Court or the CA (Criminal Division)”. A further trial would be
         oppressive and unfair taking into account the case history.

         On 16.2.2000 the judge held the trial to be oppressive (at page 37) but
         not sufficiently so as to prevent the trial taking place. The judge also
         said that in th event of a conviction there would not be an immediate
         custodial sentence.

         There would be a delay in a second trial taking place and an increase in
         the pressure and anguish on D. In the light of the verdicts re M, clearly
         there is no realistic prospect of an adverse verdict against D.

         A retrial would be a face saving exercise (for the HFSG). M is
         competent and compellable for D, and M must be accepted as an
         innocent man. He would be a compelling witness for the defence.

         Note: There then followed a professional attack by Clegg on Alun
         Jones over the proper conduct of the case. It mainly concerned the
         prosecution not accepting that D was a person of good character and
         that ACC Daines was not trustworthy. There were comments made
         that the prosecution would not admit obvious facts, made an attack on
         the witness Goddard, put patently false evidence before the jury as to
         the number of fans entering at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles, and
         misled the jury as to how the crowd formed outside the turnstiles. Ann
         Adlington’s correspondence to Goddard and other officers was a sham,
         where it was contended that no senior police officers or Metcalfe of
         Hammond Suddards could be put forward as witnesses of truth.

         The judge had previously said to the jury that Jones had overstepped
         the mark in putting matters before the them. This was described as the
         ‘Heysel Stadium Card’.

J:       This was done to protect against there being a successful defence
         appeal to the CA.

Def:     D did not get a fair trial and won’t on a second time.

         Re oppression, the extensive media presence outside court, D having to
         walk the gauntlet, the websites have opened up with personal attacks
         on the judge and his summing up - disgraceful!
Pros:          These are serious criticisms on my personal and professional integrity.
               Time needed to review and consult, need opportunity to look at the
               transcripts. Re oppression, the strain on D is a factor, but this a serious
               allegation concerning the manslaughter of 96 persons, the jury
               obviously reached question 4 (consideration of gross negligence) in the
               jury room.

J:            Pure speculation as to what went on in the jury room.

Pros:         That there is a case to answer and that it was not an abuse of process to
              bring the case shows it was right to put the matter before a court and
              also right to go to a retrial. It was conventional practice. D had also
              been given an assurance about the sentence and all his costs were paid
              for.

J:            The judge made comments on the costs to the public purse of a retrial.

Pros:         The judge cannot take costs into account. There would only be a four-
              week trial that could be set down in a few months. There is realistic
              prospect of a conviction, based on the jury being out for so long, and
              has been since the Taylor Inquiry.

Note:         There was a discussion between the Pros and the J re the H&SE report
              on the numbers going through the Leppings Lane turnstiles. This was
              served as UM on the Defence. The remarks by Jones amounted to a
              personal attack on Clegg.

Pros:         It is not accepted that any body of late arrivals had any effect. I don’t
               know what ‘late arrivals’ means. It is possible that some arrived, went
               away and came back later.

               Jones then answers all Clegg’s criticisms in order.

               If Clegg does not withdraw his remarks then the matter should go to
               the Professional Conduct Committee of the Bar.

J:            The case will be stayed and the ‘Contempt of Court’ restrictions lifted.
              Costs and count 3 to be decided at 1415.



1415 Court 5

Note: Count 3 concerned the Misconduct in a Public Office allegation based on the
same circumstances as the manslaughter charges. During the trial the prosecution
withdrew the count from the jury as it added nothing to the indictment. It had been
originally properly included because of perceived problems with causation. It had
been agreed that if D was acquitted on the manslaughter charges then he should be
acquitted on count 3 also. The Prosecution wanted count 3 to be stayed and the
defence wanted an acquittal. The judge then directed a verdict of ‘Not guilty’ on
count 3.

Costs: Murray: A Defendant’s costs order was granted out of central funds.

       Duckenfield: Section 16(2) covers the case and therefore a Defendant’s costs
       order was granted out of central funds. There was some discussion about
       s. 16(10) and what constituted ‘in or about defence’.

       Prosecution: A s. 17 costs order applied for and granted subject to taxing by the
       costs officer. The judge considered that at least some of the prosecution costs
       were properly incurred but not many others.


The case was adjourned to Friday 28 July 2000 for the reasons for the judgement
to be given.

           Update. The defendants both have orders for costs (central funds).
           Prosecution costs order made - to be taxed.
           Count 3 - misconduct based on manslaughter which had earlier been withdrawn was brought back and
           a not guilty verdict entered (by the judge I think).
           Manslaughter against Duckenfield has been stayed.
           Reasons to be given on Friday.

           For information
           Information is sketchy at the moment, but:
           Hooper J has stayed the case - so that Duckenfield will not be re-tried. Grounds - oppressive to do so.
           There have been personal attacks in court, by William Clegg QC on Alan Jones QC, and by Alan
           Jones QC on Hooper J.
           Alan Jones has criticised the judge’s direction to the jury, claiming it put a gloss on Adomako which
           isn’t there.
           Apparently the judge has risen until 2.15 to think about a few things. W e may know more then.
           Reasons will be given on Friday.
           This could still rumble on, for example the prosecutor may seek to persuade the Court of Appeal to lift
           the stay. This is speculation. Further briefing will be provided when we know more.

thanks - noted. Well done. Please let m know what goes in court tomorrow.

I've just spoken with Ann Adlington and thanked her for the faxed update.

I asked if there was anything she felt she could tell me. She is obtaining a transcript of last weeks
summing up and will copy it to us. She said:

 1. The summing up by Hooper J was brutal and almost amounted to a direction to acquit.
2. He posed four questions in order to the jury
     i)was there foreseeability of death?... if YES...
     ii) what steps should have been taken?
     iii) would those steps have been effective?
     iv) would it have been a criminal offence under the Adomako test?
3. The jury asked what was the difference between the civil and criminal test for negligence. The
judge is said to have made a hash of his explantation. He did not refer to the recent AG’s Reference.
4. AA and the legal team meet with the HFSG families tonight to determine the way forward. A small
number of the families want the case to stop now. However, there will be a vote and she expects that
the majority will want a retrial of Duckenfield.
5. She considers that the judge is against them and expects that he will refuse the application for a
retrial.
6. She considers that Murray played his case well, but that Duckenfield made a mistake in not giving
evidence. If he had gone on the stand he would have had some hard questions put to him but could
 have obtained more sympathy from the jury (especially as to his medical condition which was not
allowed in to the evidence).
7. The judge did not allow an adverse inference to be taken from Duckenfield's no comment interview.
Which to me is not surprising as D did not give evidence of anything he should have mentioned during
 interview.

She considers that it would be worthwhile for me to be in court tomorrow.

          ALLEGATION &                   1996, the Hillsborough Family Suppori Group (HFSG)
          SENSITIVITIES:                 pressed for the Home Office to institute a new
                                        inquest/public inquiry, and for the CPS to re-open
                                         consideration of alleged police misconduc t. After a careful
                                         review the CPS concluded that there was no new material
                                        which justified asking the police to conduct further
                                        investigations. The Home Secretary set up an independent
                                        inquiry, the findings of which were published 18.12.98: no
                                        justification for a further inquiry/inquest and no new
                                        evidence.

                                                 DISCUSSION

      Of course it is a matter, one understands, that the
ber eaved are most concerned about but it is a natter
that perhaps may be apt to be taken up in other quarters
than before this Inquiry.    That is the only reason that
I raise it and it is obviously a matter that you will
have to think about, perhaps, and d is cuss.-

     MR. HYTNER: Clearly, sir, it would help if you
would give a ruling on the parameters of the Inquiry
because it will then assist us, clearly, in taking
instruct ions and advising the clients but plainly there
is a d i f feren ce of perception, if I may use the word,
between my clients and Mr. Collins as to the matters
which this Inquiry should be dealing with.       They,
clearly, are very concerned about the events between
about 3.30 and perhaps 8 o'clock or 9 o ’clock at night.

     If the ruling is that that is outside the ambit of
the Inquiry, we can at least tell them so and we obviously
will not then get down to taking detailed statements.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, I will think about that,
if I may, over the weekend.
     MR. HYTNER:   I am grateful.   That is why I thought
it was best to raise it at this stage.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, thank you.            Did you want
to say something, Mr. Woodward?                              „

      MR. WOODWARD:      May I, sir?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes.

         MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, the endeavour of all those who
are here: t p keep up wi th the evidence will,, b e ,attempted
to its fullest and we will look at the" videos^ bdt * 'sir, V,.
t h e r e may be a pra ctical problem that d o e s 'a r i s e . 'May .
I mention it, sir?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Yes.

     MR. WOODWARD:    It is anticipated, plainly, that
Counsel for the Inquiry will be calling a considerable
number of Police Officers.    Whilst the lawyers may
burn the midnight oils and may not be away at particular
times over the wee kend to enable the matter to proceed,
we cannot make the same assumptions in respect of all
those who may be called to give evidence.

      Sir, in order to ensure that fairness persists we
would ask, if it can be accommodated, that copies should
be p ro vided of the videos to the Police Officers so that
they can be brought and arranged and it ensured that they
see it.     Sir, that may save cross-examination, it may
save exa minat ion in chief.

MESSAGE: RE SECTION 9 CJA STATEMENTS

1.      Attached is a blank copy of the form that the CPS use in the notification of
further evidence to be served by way of section 9 CJA. I don't have one specifically
for section 9 alone, however I am sure that you can adapt this one as necessary.

2.     The provisions allow you to agree with the other parties that a statement can
be tendered in evidence under the section. That can be done by way of a letter.

I hope this is of assistance

15 February 2000

1.    T/C between GC and Ann Adlington of the HFSG. The judgement of Hooper
      J re the application by the defence on an Abuse of Process argument is due on
      the morning of 16 February. She has received a copy today which is under an
      embargo. It is to the effect that the A of P has failed and the likely trial venue
      for June will be Newcastle CC.

2.    GC informed CE, Chris Newell, the Private Office and the Press office this
      afternoon, while emphasising that the embargo is still in force.

3.   On 10 February we received from the HFSG a copy of Hooper J's judgement
     of 22 December 1999 re the defence application that evidence of Mr
     Duckenfield's answers during XX at the Taylor Inquiry were not admissible
     under section 78 of PACEA. The Article 6 of the ECHR point was made re
     the guarantee of a fair trial. It was argued that the effect of the Inquiry was to
     offend Mr D's right against self incrimination. The judge decided that this
     evidence was relevant and admissible. Still to be decided was the validity of
     Count 5 on the indictment ("the disgraceful lie").

4.   A copy of the transcript of the judgement, and defence and prosecution
     skeleton arguments are attached to this minute. It is of note that the previous
     serious criticisms made by the defence of the private prosecutor appear to have
     been withdrawn. A CD Rom has been given by the SYP to the HFSG. It is
     said to contain thousands of statements, presumably those taken off the
     Holmes Computer.

There were a couple of other - quite important - things that I forgot to mention when we spoke earlier. First - how
was your liP assessment going?! Secondly - 1 had a call from Tony Hooper this afternoon, to thank me for
sending him the Hillsborough advice. He said that he was giving his judgment next W ednesday (he was writing
it when he rang). I cannot remember - did we already know that? He said that he'd send me a copy.

Can we have a word in the morning - principally about liP?

Re counsel's advice.
I remember a discussion with Dru over counsel's advice. W e were concerned that counsel had used a
recklessness test rather than gross negilgence. I attach a note I did to Dru - unfortunately I am not sure of the
date but my best guess is it was December 1998. This tries to analyse counsel's advicein relation to the
subsequent case law in the shape of Adomako.

Re Hillsborough

At the court hearing just before the Christmas break, Hooper J decided that the transcript of the Taylor Inquiry
was admissible in evidence.

The abuse of process hearing before Hooper J commencecl on 4 January 2000 and after representations by the
parties was adjourned until 7 February when the judge will give his decision.

At the request of the judge, the Joint Opinion of counsel from 1990 has been provided to him after waiver of
legal professional privilege by the Director of Casework. Hooper J has considered it and has disclosed it to all
the parties.

FILE NOTE - ANN ADLINGTON - RE HILLSBOROUGH

10 December 1999

In response to her letter of 9 December 1999 I said that I would not be able to get her a reply
today and in any event I was not entirely sure that the matter was relevant. I did say that the
Code is fairly clear that we should consider the evidence. If it is clear that evidence would
not be admissible, we would then take that into account. If, however, we thought there might
be some issue about admissibility, it is open to us to commence a prosecution and fight the
issue of admissibility at court.

I quoted paragraph 5.4 of the Code to her.

I reiterated to her that I was not prepared to waive privilege in relation to counsel’s advice.
In addition, I did say that my recollection was that counsel did not deal with the issue of
admissibility in the advice but I could not say one way or the other whether issues of
admissibility were dealt with in conference or in writing before hand. I did tell her that she
would not get a detailed reply for a couple days.

      HILLSBOROUGH PRIVATE PROSECUTION : ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD

      Further to my letter of 21 October 1999,1 am now able to reply substantively to yours of 19
      October.

      You have asked for my observations on the request from Mr Duckenfield’s solicitors for the
      entry of a nolle prosequi in respect of counts 4 and 5 on the indictment against him.

    Counts 4 and 5 refer to the allegation that Mr Duckenfield made a statement or statements
    about the cause of the fatal crush that was/were untruthful. In commenting on the application
    for a nolle prosequi, it is important to compare those counts with the earlier charge that I
  ' discontinued on 12 April 1999. That charge alleged that Mr Duckenfield

            “with intent to pervert the course of justice did an act which had a tendency to
            pervert the course of justice in that he lied about the circumstances in which gate
            C became open.”

      The particulars of offence in count 4 describe at (a) and (b) two distinct allegations - the first
      of commission, the second of omission. I leave it to others to judge whether the latter can
      amount to the offence of “making statements.. .etc”; but I do observe that this second
      allegation appears to go wider than the original charge.

      Count 5 describes the same two allegations, but as particulars of the offence of misconduct in
      public office. That, of course, is not the same offence as was originally charged.

      I understand your letter to be seeking my comments on the comparatively narrow point set out
      in the final sentence of your second paragraph. In other words, I assume that you are not
      seeking my comments on the law in relation to counts 4 and 5, nor in relation to the strength
    •   of the evidence in support of those allegations. If I am wrong in that assumption, you will no
                                                                                                        •
        doubt let me know.

        The letter from Mr Duckenfield’s solicitors argues cogently that the inclusion of counts 4 and
        5 negates my decision to discontinue, thereby frustrating my expectations and, by implication,
        those of the defendant. It is important to emphasize, however, that in my opinion only the
        allegation at (a) of the particulars of offence in count 4 could'have that effect. I have not
        discontinued any charge alleging conduct as alleged at (b) of those particulars; nor have I
        discontinued (or considered discontinuing) any charge of misconduct in public office based
        on the alleged untruthful statement(s).

        With that important point in mind, however, I agree that the inclusion of count 4 in the
        indictment does have the effect of negating my earlier decision and frustrating any
        expectations arising from it. Laws LJ, in giving the judgment of the Divisional Court in the
        judicial review of my decision not to take over and discontinue the proceedings generally,
        expressly approved the approach in our policy on intervention in private prosecutions that he
        described as “the ‘clearly no case to answer’ test” (transcript at page 12, lines 4-18). I am
        bound to find it undesirable that the application of that policy, at the instigation of the
        Divisional Court, to a charge in respect of which I felt that there was clearly no case to answer
        can be negated.

        The Crown Prosecution Service has not been asked at this stage to intervene again and take
        over the conduct of the proceedings with a view to offering no evidence on count 4. I do not
        know whether the evidence on which that count is now based differs from the evidence that I
        considered in relation to the original charge. It is, of course, a matter for the Solicitor
        General; but in my opinion, if the Solicitor reaches the conclusion that there is clearly no case
        to answer in relation to count 4, then - to the extent that that count replicates the original,
        discontinued charge - it would be appropriate for him to enter a nolle prosequi. For the
        reasons that I have set out above, I am expressly confining my comments to count 4 and to the
        extent that that count replicates the original, discontinued charge.

        I note that you may wish to disclose this letter to both the prosecution and defence solicitors
        in the case. If I have misunderstood your letter, or if there is any other way in which you
        think that I might be able to assist, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Dear Ann

RE: TRANSCRIPTS

Thank you very much for the transcripts which arrived today. I had a quick flick
through them in between reviewing some medical negligence and naughty MP cases.
They will make interesting reading when I have a little more time available at the end
of the week.

I am most grateful for the assistance you have given me over the last few years. I feel
that we have had a productive and professional relationship which has been to the
benefit of all parties.

I intend to close down my file in the next two weeks and then have it archived for
posterity, unless you consider that I am being precipitate.

Take care and good luck in your continuing career.

Yours aye

In the Crown Court at Leeds                                                   18 July 2000

                                  R v. Duckcnfield and Murray


                 Gross ncelieence: Prosecution Submissions on Summing-Up


1       It is submitted that the court has imposed three obstacles to conviction in addition to
         those required by R v. Adamakn. These are that:

        (i)     the conduct must in the opinion of the jury be not just criminal, but amount to
                “a very serious criminal offence” (question 4);

        (ii)    the jury must consider whether it is right to find them guilty of conduct for
                which they arc liable to be punished;

        (iii)   the jury should wish to consider what “message” may be sent to others who
                may have to deal with emergencies.

2       The first of these was decided by the court when the prosecution objected to the
         formulation of the second, proposed by the defence. The prosecution objected on the
         ground that it would be misleading to talk about conduct for which the defendants
         would be pumshfisl\Yken the.court h«vi told the defendants that they would not be sent
        to prison.

3       The prosecution also argued that the new second formulation listed above was
        inappropriate after leading counsel for Mr Duckenfield had twice talked about Mr
        Duckenfield’s “fate”, and had told the jury that they were being invited to convict the
        defendants of crime “with all that that entails.” The court appeared to acccpl this by
        formulating (i), above, as an alternative.

4       It is submitted that the jury will be mislead unless the matter is corrected. The jury
        should be told, in the interests of fairness, that the judge has indicated that, in the
        event of a conviction, the defendants will not be sent to prison; or at the very least
        lhat a conviction so long after the event presents a very rare and difficult problem for
        the sentencer and repeat that it is not a matter for them. It is not enough to direct
        them that they should not consider the consequences of the conviction. The jury has
        been left with the clear impression that the defendants will be “punished” as their
        “fate”, from which expressions they will conclude that the defendants will be sent to
        prison if found guilty.
    «

5       It is respectfully submitted that it is also wrong to have directed the jury that they
        should be conscious of the message that is being sent out. It is not the function of a
        jury to have regard to public policy in returning its verdict. The court did not even
        call upon the prosecution to make submissions about the alleged immunity of the

          defendants from prosecution on public policy grounds,

    6    The prosecution would never have been allowed to make a submission as to how their
          verdict would be received and regarded by the public or a section of it, and have had
          no opportunity at all to make submissions about the matter. The court did not disclose
          to the parties before speeches or summing-up that it was to make these observations.

    7    It is submitted that the court should direct the jury not to have any regard to what
          various sections of the public might think of their verdicts.

                     fThe iurv were brought into court at 10.01 a.m.1

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   Members of the jury, after the jury

           bailiffs have been sworn, would you retire, please, and continue

           your deliberations.

           f The 1urv retired again at 10.03 a.m. and returned to ask a
    B      question at 3.26 p.m.)

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   You have asked this question: "Would

           you please explain again what constitutes a criminal offence as

           opposed to a negligent offence."       I take that as a question which

    C       relates to the question 4 that I have set you.         Therefore, what

            I propose to do is go through again with you question 4.

                   Question   4 asks you this question:     “Are you sure that,

            having regard to the risk of death involved, the failure to take
    D       those steps was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to

            a very serious criminal offence?       If the answer is 'Yes,' your

            verdicts must be: 'Guilty.'    If not, your verdicts must be: 'Not

            guilty.'"    This question, of course, follows the three previous

            questions and the steps referred to are the steps mentioned in

            the previous questions.

                   Question 4 can conveniently be divided into two: "so bad ...

            as to amount to a very serious criminal offence," and, secondly,
    F
            "in all the circumstances."

                   I outlined at some length the relevant circumstances which

            you must take into account and unless you ask me to do so, I will

            not remind you of them.
    G
                   So I turn to "so bad ... as to amount to a very serious

            criminal offence."     In some cases, a person may think about the

            consequences and decide to take the risk.       I gave the example of

    H                                        26

            a driver deciding to overtake on a bend and across double white

             lines.       He is saying to himself, "I know there is a risk and I

            shall take it."          If he takes that risk and causes death, there

            would, I imagine, be no difficulty in concluding that that was

            a very serious criminal offence.                 I also mentioned to you the

            example of the driver choosing to drive with excess alcohol.
     B
                    But that is not this case.              These two defendants did not

            think about the consequences of the decision taken by them in a

            crisis, namely a decision to open gate C in circumstances where,

             if it was not opened, serious injury or death could have occurred

            to those near and at the turnstiles.               How much of a crisis it was

             and how long the defendants had to consider any consequences is,

            of course, a matter for you.               I remind you just in headlines of

            Mr.     Jones's       submission    of   slow    motion    negligence      and     the
     D
            submission of          counsel    for the two defendants that when one

             analyses it, they only had a very short period of time in which

             to make the decision and think about any consequences, and a lot

     E       of other things were going on.

                    You    must    ask    yourselves    whether     it would      be   right   to

             describe a failure to take action in a crisis of the kind that

            you find it to be, to be so bad as to amount to a very serious

             criminal offence.           You are entitled to ask yourselves whether it

            would send out the wrong message to those who have to act in an

            emergency of this kind to label it as a very serious criminal

            offence.        Again,    by "emergency" or "crisis,"           I mean there a
    G       decision taken in order to avoid death or injury to others.

            Whether you label it as so bad as to amount to a very serious

            criminal offence          is a matter for you.            It is entirely your

            decision, but of course you must be sure.

                    Two additional points.       As I told you, the mere fact that

            ninety-six people died does not of itself automatically mean it

             is a very serious criminal offence.          I explained that to you.

                    Secondly, there is a rather smaller point, but nonetheless

            you must take it into account, which concerns Mr. Duckenfield.
    B
            You remember I outlined to you the argument that Mr. Clegg made

            about the skills and attributes of a reasonable match commander.

            What I am about to say now is on the assumption that you did not

             accept   his   arguments    about   the   skills   and   attributes     of   a
    C
            reasonable match commander.          Nonetheless, at this stage, this

            would be a matter you would be entitled to take into account.

                    If you concluded - and there is a dispute about this - that

             he was comparatively inexperienced, taking into account that the
    D
             task of a match commander went with the posting to the Divisional

             Commander of Sheffield North, taking into account that it was the

             Chief Constable who decided that he should take up this new job,

     E       which had of course amongst its many tasks the task of policing

             Hillsborough, and taking into account he had only taken his job

             up some two or three weeks before the match, again those are

             matters which you would be entitled to take into account at this

     F       stage.

                    Is there anything further I can help you with?            No.   Thank

             you all very much.     Would you like to retire and continue your

             deliberations.     If you have not reached a verdict by 4.15, you
    G        will have had a long day, four or 4.15 - I do not mind - if you

             send a message saying that you have really had enough, I will

             send you home about four o'clock.         You have had a long day.      What

                                R v. Duckenfield and Murray


                Gross negligence: Prosecution Submissions on Summing-Up


1     It is submitted that the court has imposed three obstacles to conviction in addition to
       those required by R v. Adamako. These are that:

       (i)     the conduct must in the opinion of the jury be not just criminal, but amount to
               “a very serious criminal offence” (question 4);

       (ii)    the jury must consider whether it is right to find them guilty of conduct for
               which they are liable to be punished;

       (iii)   the jury should wish to consider what “message” may be sent to others who
               may have to deal with emergencies.

2     The first of these was decided by the court when the prosecution objected to the
       formulation of the second, proposed by the defence. The prosecution objected on the
       ground that it would be misleading to talk about conduct for which the defendants
       would be punished when the co*xrt had told the defendants that they would not be sent
       to prison.

3     The prosecution also argued that the new second formulation listed above was
      inappropriate after leading counsel for Mr Duckenfield had twice talked about Mr
      Duckenfield’s “fate”, and had told the jury that they were being invited to convict the
      defendants of crime “with all that that entails.” The court appeared to accept this by
      formulating (i), above, as an alternative.

4     It is submitted that the jury will be mislead unless the matter is corrected. The jury
      should be told, in the interests of fairness, that the judge has indicated that, in the
      event of a conviction, the defendants will not be sent to prison; or at the very least
      that a conviction so long after the event presents a very rare and difficult problem for
      the sentencer and repeat that it is not a matter for them. It is not enough to direct
      them that they should not consider the consequences of the conviction. The jury has
      been left with the clear impression that the defendants will be “punished” as their
      “fate”, from which expressions they will conclude that the defendants will be sent to
      prison if found guilty.

5     It is respectfully submitted that it is also wrong to have directed the jury that they
      should be conscious of the message that is being sent out. It is not the function of a
      jury to have regard to public policy in returning its verdict. The court did not even
      call upon the prosecution to make submissions about the alleged immunity of the

                                               1
■»

           defendants from prosecution on public policy grounds.

     6     The prosecution would never have been allowed to make a submission as to how their
           verdict would be received and regarded by the public or a section of it, and have had
           no opportunity at all to make submissions about the matter. The court did not disclose
           to the parties before speeches or summing-up that it was to make these observations.

     7     It is submitted that the court should direct the jury not to have any regard to what
           various sections of the public might think of their verdicts.

                  BRIEF FOR PRIVATE OFFICE

1.    ISSUE

1.1   What should be the CPS reaction to a potential re-trial of ex Chief
      Superintendent Duckenfield in the Hillsborough private prosecution.

2.    ACTION REQUIRED

2.1   Consideration by the Casework Directorate of our response to a retrial being
      granted by the judge and any applications to us by the Hillsborough Family
      Support Group.

3.    TIMING

3.1   The HFSG meet with their legal team today to decide whether or not to apply
      for a retrial of Duckenfield.

3.2   Mr Justice Hooper, the trial judge, will decide on any application for a retrial
      in Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday 26 July 2000.

4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   The history of the Hillsborough private prosecution is well known.

4.2   The trial for manslaughter, Misconduct in a Public Office of the two most
      senior police officers on duty at the match in 1989 commenced in early June..

4.3   Following legal argument in the course of the proceedings              only the
      manslaughter charges went before the jury.

4.4   On Friday 21 July ex Superintendent Murray was acquitted. At that time the
      jury was unable to come to a verdict on Duckenfield. On Monday 24 July
      they were still unable to reach a verdict and were discharged.

5.    KEY CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   While the HFSG has not yet contacted the CPS, there may be an application
      by them for a contribution towards the costs of continuing the private
      prosecution, or a request that we take over the private prosecution of
      Duckenfield in order to continue it.

5.2   The HFSG may argue that the circumstances and the quality of the evidence
      have changed since the original CPS decisions not to prosecute the two police
      officers and not to intervene in the private prosecution (in order to discontinue
      it).

5.3   At an abuse hearing on 16 February 2000, Mr Justice Hooper stated that while
      the trial should take place he would reduce to a significant extent the anguish
      being suffered by the defendants; he made it clear that the two officers would
      not immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted. He accepted that
      his ruling was highly unusual.

5.4   The jury decision to acquit Murray confirms our review decision on the
      sufficiency of evidence against him. However, their inability to come to a
      decision re Duckenfield may indicate a slight shift in the balance of the
      evidence towards meeting the evidential test.

6.    RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1   The Crown Court have the power to make an order for certain prosecution
      costs of the first trial to be paid out of central funds, under section 17 of the
      Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. We should not become involved in the
      financial obligations of the private prosecutor.

6.2   If the CPS is requested to take over the prosecution in order to continue it, we
       should not be rushed into any decision. We will need to ensure that we are
       apprised of any new evidence which may have come to light before or during
       trial. We should be willing to take representations from the parties to the
       prosecution as we did in our previous decision making process. If we still
       consider that our previous decisions on evidential sufficiency were correct,
       then we would only take over the case if new evidence was sufficiently
       significant to warrant a change in those decisions.

6.3   If we concluded that we should take over and prosecute the case then we
       would make our decisions as to the legal team to be used at court. We would
       not be led by the HFSG.

7.    CONCLUSION

7.1   Await tomorrow's court rulings before further consideration of any necessary
      action to be taken.

                                    Prosecution Submissionson Count 5


    Introduction

    1        David Duckenfleld seeks to quash the original count 5 of the indictment. Counts 4 and 5
             were not committal charges, but were added to the indictment after committal in accordance
             with the proviso to section 2(2) of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions)
             1933 Act (“the 1933 Act”).

    2        The defence applied to the Attorney-General for a nolle prosequi in respect of counts 4 and
             5, and succeeded in respect of count 4 alone. To avoid confusion the original numbering is
             retained in this note.

    Issues

    3        It is believed that the defence will argue:

                     a)     that count 5 should be quashed pursuant to section 2 (3) of the 1933 Act;

                     b)     that, if the count remains, the admissions made to the Taylor Inquiry should
                             be excluded under section 78 (1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
                             1984 (“the 1984 Act”) in respect of count 5; or

                     c)     that count 5 should be severed from the trial of counts 1 to 3.

The evidence at committal on count 5 was found only in the admissions made by Mr
Duckenfield to the Taylor Inquiry. After committal the statements of Kelly and Kirton
were served (see trial file number 1, pages 118 to 136) which also disclose prima facie
evidence of the offence. Of these, only the statement of Kirton had been served before
committal. He was not called because the magistrate decided to deal with the abuse of
process argument first, and Mr Kirton was abroad when the committal proceedings were
eventually heard. The prosecution decided that it was impracticable and unnecessary lo
ask for an adjournment.

No question of discretion arises in determining whether the case is within the proviso to
subsection (2). Either the count is justified or it is not. The section 78 (1) discretion is
plainly relevant only to the later question of whether the evidence should be excluded at
trial. If the court holds that there was insufficient evidence of the offence on the
committal evidence the prosecution will apply for a bill of indictment on this count in the
light of the evidence available for trial.

Misfeasance or misconduct in public office is made out if:

     - (a)      the defendant is a public officer;
       (b)      the act or omission complained of was in the exercise of his duty as a
                public officer;
        (c)     he did the act complained of in bad faith, namely dishonestly, corruptly or
                in wilful neglect of his duty.

The cases o fRvDvtham [1979] QB 722 and R v Bowden [1996] 1WLR 98 set out these
elements. In Dvtham Widgcry L.CJ. said:

        “The allegation made was not o f mere non-feasance but o f deliberate failure and wilfUl neglect.
        This involves an element o f culpability which is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty but
        which must be o f such a degree that the misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public
        interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment. Whether such a situation is revealed by
        the evidence is a matter that a jury has to decide.”

 In Bowden it was:
        "Held, dismissing the appeal, that the common law offence of misconduct in a public office
        applied generally to every person who was appointed to discharge a public duty and was paid
        compensation in whatever form, whether from the Crown or otherwise; and that, therefore, tlw
        defendant was a public offwer and had rightly been convicted (post, p. 103B-G).”

11    The case of Three Rivers District Council v> Governor of the Bank of England, a case on
      the tort of misfeasance, was determined in the House of Lords on 18* May 2000. The
      report on the website http://www.parliament.the-stationerv-officc.co.uk is imperfect, but
      the case does not appear to change the criminal offence of misfeasance.

The defendant is a public officer

12    It is believed that this is accepted. At common law, a constable holds office under the
       Crown.

The act or omission complained o f was committed in the exercise o f his duty as a public officer

13     Mr Duckenfleld was the officer in overall charge of the event. He had a duty to ensure
       the safety of all the spectators, and continuing duties to control events as the disaster
       unfolded. He had a duty to those officials from the Football Association inquiring into
       the events into the cause of the disaster not to give dishonest or deliberately misleading
       answers. He had a duty not to mislead the public in the circumstances of this case.

He did the act complained o f in badfaith, namely dishonestly»corruptly or in wilful neglect of
his duty.

14    There is evidence from which a jury could conclude that Mr Duckenfleld lied, and that he
       acted in bad faith. The admissions are set out as Annex 1 to this document for ease of
       reference.

        At page 1, to counsel for the bereaved, he denied mendaciously that he could not explain
        the genesis of the belief that the fans had broken down a gate,

        At pages 2 and 3, he admitted withholding information out of shock, or at least until he
        had told a senior officer.

        At pages 5 to 6 he admitted that he “may” have misled Mr Kelly.

        At page 6 he admitted that he had said he “was unable to give an accurate account of
        what the situation was other then a possible pitch invasion."

        At pages 7 to 8 he contended that he had acted in good faith, and at page 10 that he
        decided to withhold the information from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

        At page 13 he accepted, in the context of the false impression, that he allowed the
        impression to be created that spectators were in some way responsible for the failure to
        manage the crowd.

           At pages 14 and 15 he publicly apologised, both to counsel for the bereaved families and
           to counsel for the South Yorkshire police, for “the inference that people caused those
           deaths.”1

           At pages 16 to 20 he gave reason for failing to tell the truth and admitted that he had not
           told the truth to Mr Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable, when he arrived in the Control
           Box.

    15    In contrast, at the Inquest, Mr Duckenfield did not claim the privilege against self-
           incrimination on this subject; rather he claimed could not remember what he had told the
           Taylor Inquiry,

    The Section 78 discretion

    16      Section 78 provides:

                    (1) In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes
                    to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances in which
                    the evidence was obtained, the admission o f the evidence would have such an adverse effect on
                    the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.
                    (2) Nothing in this section shall prejudice any rule o f law requiring a court to exclude evidence

            Evidence on the voir dire may be given on this subject,

    17     On 22ndDecember 1999 the court rejected the argument that the admissions should be
           excluded under this section in relation to Counts 1 to 3. It had been contended that
           evidence should be excluded for the following reasons:

                     (i) Mr Duckenfield was not personally represented at the inquiry and relied on
                     Mr Woodward QC who represented the South Yorkshire Police,
                     (ii) Mr Duckenfield was not sent a Salmon letter and nor a copy of the one sent to
                     the police.
                     (iii) he was not cautioned when he gave evidence.
                     (iv) five of the Salmon principles were not adhered to.
                     (v) his right not to incriminate himself was offended by the Inquiry.

    18     The following matters suggest that Mr Duckenfield was well aware that he was liable to
            be questioned about the allegation that spectators had broken down the gates, and some of
            them show that he was willing, and in some respects keen, to give his version of events at
            least when he started to speak about them, irrespective of any tendency the answers may
            have had to incriminate him.



            1 It should be noted that the withdrawal and apology were made “unreservedly”; not “on condition that I am
    not made accountable for them in a court of law.”

The broadcast o f the lie by the BBC and press

It was generally known that supporters had been wrongly blamed for breaking down the
gates. The attached statement of John Motson of the BBC (Annex 2) shows that he
broadcast live the allegation, that the supporters had caused the crush by breaking down a
door or gate. The court is entitled to assume that Mr Duckenfleld would have known that
the allegations that he had made against the supporters had become widely known to a
national and international audiencc, and that he would be questioned about them by Mr
Dyson, the lawyer for the Football Association, who appeared at the Taylor Inquiry.

The BBC film and sound recording says that at 3.13;

       Motson;          “The Gate leading in to that terrace was broken. People without
                        tickets got in, therefore overcrowding the people with tickets and
                        that’s why the crush occurred.”

Motson went on to say on the tape that that message should be passed on to Grandstand,
At 15.25 he says on live television:

                         “I have to sat that as far as I know this was not caused by
                         misbehaviour except that the reason it happened was that one of
                         the outside gates here was broken, and non-ticket holders forced
                         their way in and overcrowded the section at the Leppings Lane
                         end, occupied by the genuine authentic ticket holders There has
                         not been to my knowledge a loudspeaker announcement inside the
                         ground about what the people on the pitch who are not hurt should
                         be doing but there is no question now that the problem was caused
                         by non-ticket holders forcing their way through a broken gate at
                         the Leppings Lane end of the ground, and the FA Cup semi-final
                         has been suspended in the most serious fashion."

Selections of newspapers are attached, which would have demonstrated to Mr
Duckenfteld that he was likely to be asked about his lies. (Annex 3)

 The wide terms o f reference o f the Taylor Inquiry

 The subject matter of the ‘lies’ was clearly within the terms of reference of the Taylor
 inquiry, and presumably Mr Duckenfield knew this:

        “To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15* April 1989 and to
        make recommendations...”

Mr Duckenfleld's police experience

Once Mr Duckenfield agreed to give evidence he must have known, irrespective of these
events, and from his own legal experience alone, that he would be asked about the
circumstances in which the £xit gates became open, and was liable to be asked about
what he said about the matter before, A police witness would know he might be asked
about his previous statement, in which, it may be inferred, he had decided not to refer to
his deceitful account.

The contents o f Mr Duckenfield's witness statement

The court is entitled to conclude that it is clear from the assertions in Mr Duckenfield’s
witness statement, made on or before May 2000, even before the Salmon letters (see
below) were sent, that he knew he would be asked about the question whether he had
blamed the spectators for forcing the gates, and was seeking to set up in advance a
defence that there may been confusion or misunderstanding by Kelly, Kirton and others
about forced gates. Atthefootofpage7hesaid;

        “I saw Gate C burst open and supporters enter the concourse area at the rear o f the Leppings Lane
        stand and terrace. I remember thinking “the gate’s open anyway; 1 had not given permission”

At page 9 he says he says he was told over the radio,

        ‘“‘It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this gate’s going anyway.”
        I was advised this was “A" gate.”

The opening o f the false information given to the Fire Brigade

 Andrew Collins QC spoke in his opening to the Inquiry of a record of a message
received by the Fire Brigade (Day 20, page 42.) :
        “There has been a major accident at Hillsborough football ground. The crowds have forced their
        way in. They have broken fences and the gate down. I don’t know exactly what it is but there are
        people trapped.”

It is reasonable to conclude that South Yorkshire police, including Mr Duckenfield, were
aware of the assertions made in opening, (This recording was produced after Mr
Duckenfield gave evidence, and is now produced by the conditional witness Davies, trial
file 1, page 297-301.)

   (vi)      The Salmon letters

   29        Although the court was given the impression in December 1999 that no letter setting out
             the matters of concern had been sent to Mr Duckenfield personally2 it was held that no
             unfairness would be causedJby the admission of the evidence.

   30         In December, the court’s attention was drawn to the exchanges between counsel on 23rd
              May 1989;

                       Woodward;         “    because insofar for example as there may be points to be
                                         made against individual officers it would be appropriate in our
                                         submission that those officers should have notice of those points
                                         specifically, and the opportunity should be given to them before
                                         they give evidence for them to have their minds put at rest or have
                                         those matters considered.*’ (p83 of Taylor transcript)


                        Mr Collins;        “If it helps, I am sympathetic to the request by Mr Woodward. All
                                          I can say is I will do my best to comply with it. On the whole the
                                          allegations are covered by the general allegations in the Salmon
                                          letter that has already been sent It is only if there is something
                                          specific against a particular officer that I will give formal
                                          notification in writing, and he will receivc specific matters in
                                          relation to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield..’' (p 85 of Taylor

    31        Sir Andrew Collins told the court in December 1999 that the Treasury Solicitor had been
              unable to find any such note, and that nothing had been put in writing, but that he would
               have spoken to Mr Woodward. Mr Woodward did not produce any such document. Mr
               Woodward agreed that on 254bMay 1989 he had said;

                        “We have been given indication of the allegations that have been made against
                        this particular officer and against the police in particular.”

    32        This arose in the context of a complaint by Mr Woodward to a suggestion by Mr Collins
              to Mr Duckenfield that he should have heard of a propensity to arrive late on the part of
               Liverpool supporters.




               2      At page 7 F of the railing Mr Clegg is recorded by the court as having said that another relevant factor was
          He was not sent a Salmon letter and was not sent a copy o f the one sent to the police”.

                                                                 8

In December 1999 Mr Woodward explained this remark in these terms:

       “I think by the time we had got to this stage in the Inquiry those who had been
       present would understand what was being said against Duckenfield. I think that is
       what I intended by that because I never did receivc anything specific to Mr
       Duckenfield.”

                                                                     (21/12/99, page 40A)

It has since become clear that a notice of criticisms was indeed prepared in relation to Mr
Duckenfield and was presumably sent to him. It is most unfortunate that the existence of
this document was not drawn to the attention of the court by the defence in December
1999. It included the circumstances in which the exit gates were opened, to which
question of the lies was obviously relevant. The solicitor to the prosecution recovered a
copy of it, filed under the reference ‘Criticisms of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’,
from the Public Record Office, on 30thDecember 1999, circulated to the defence at court
on 4IhJanuary 2000. (Annex 5)

The criticism that Mr Duckenfieldfailed to explain events on the tannoy

The particular significance of this document is that paragraph 8 records;

       “Failure to use the tannoy on electric scoreboard to explain what was happening
     - and to calm the situation in the ground.”

Mr Duckenfield *s account to the Taylor Inquiry, after initially lying, is that the reason
why he allowed people to be misled was in order to calm things in the ground. Ry giving
this explanation, he appears consciously to have prepared a defence to the criticism,
which he would have received one or two days before giving evidence. The court is
entitled to conclude that Mr Duckenfleld, far from receiving no list of provisional
criticisms, not only received them, but prepared himself to give evidence, if necessary, to
accommodate them. He has given no evidence to the court about this.

A reference to the tannoy failure also appears in the general Salmon letter (Annex 6) at
paragraph 5. The provisional criticism called upon Mr Duckenfield to deal with what he
had said, and had not said, about the disaster, as it became clear what had happened. The
court has already found that “....Mr Duckenfield must have known what use could be
made of [his statement]” (Ruling Annex 7; page 5D)

 The court has also found (Ruling, page 19E):
        “We have heard nothing from Mr Duckenfield, as I have said before, given the veiy sensible
        advice he was receiving. In one sense, Mr Duckenfleld was perhaps in greater possession of the
        facts than the Inquiry may have been. He knew that, assuming the prosecution to be right, he had
        lied nbout how the gates had been opened.”

(viii) The Salmon criticisms were not exhaustive

39    The last paragraph of the Salmon letter makes it clear that the criticisms were in any
       event not exhaustive:
              “ Should any fiirther specific matters which might result in criticisms come to our attention, we
              shall of course make you aware of them.”

General Principles

40     If the lies are admissible as evidence on counts 1 to 3, no material distinction can be
       made in relation to count 5. If, contrary to the above arguments, the court concludes that
       Mr Duckenfield was not expecting to be questioned about his lies, he is, at best, in the
       position of a man who has been arrested for one offence, and admits in interview, under
       the conventional non-specific caution, a related one.

41    If a defendant is arrested for an offence of causing grievous bodily harm and interviewed
       about it under caution he may, for example, admit having possessed an offensive weapon
       in a public place, a fact unknown to the police. Such an admission would not require a
       separate arrest under, for example, section 31 of the 1984 Act, nor a new caution,
       particularly if the admission were relevant to the main allegation. It might be otherwise if
       the new offence did not arise from the same facte (one of the tests for joinder of two or
       more counts on an indictment under Rule 9 of the Indictments Rules 1971).

42    The prosecution knows of no case in which a confession has been excluded on the ground
       that a person had been cautioned only for another offence, related to the main one, and
       which had been, or could have been, properly included in the same indictment.


The lack of defence evidence

43     The prosecution invites the defence to call Mr Duckenfield to give evidence about these
       important matters and, as in the case of Sir Andrew Collins and Mr Woodward QC. in
       December 1999, to present a witness statement in advance.

 Severance

 44    For all the above reasons, fairness does not call, on the available evidence, for the
        exclusion of the admissions to the lies under section 78 (1), nor for severance of the
        count.

                     BRIEFING FOR TUI DIRECTOR

                                ’HILLSBOROUGH'


        1.    ISSUE

        1.1   Report and update on the results of the latest court hearings in the
              Hillsborough private prosecution of two retired senior police officers, David
              Duckenfield and Bernard Murray.

        2.    ACTION REQUIRED

        2.1   Briefing is for information only.

        3.    TIMING

        3.1   Nil.

        4.    BACKGROUND

        4.1   The Director is aware of the main background to the Hillsborough Stadium
              Disaster which occurred in 1989.

        4.2   Following the commencement of the private prosecution by the Hillsborough
              Family Support Group (HFSG) in June 1998, an immediate application was
              made on behalf of Murray (and later by Duckenfield) for the CPS to take over
              the proceedings and discontinue them. The request to intervene was formally
              declined in December 1998. That decision by the Head of Casework Division
              was endorsed by the Attorney General. The defence solicitors then indicated
              that they would take our decision to judicial review.

        4.3   Full voluntary disclosure of all non PII material in the possession of the CPS
              was given to the HFSG and solicitors for Murray in January 1999.

        4.4   The Divisional Court heard the judicial review application in March 1999.
              The court decided that the CPS policy on private prosecutions was not
              unreasonable. Our decision not to intervene on the charges of manslaughter
              and wilful neglect to perform a public duty was upheld, however, our similar
              decision re the charge of perverting the course of justice ("the disgraceful lie"
              made by Duckenfield) was quashed as we did not follow our own policy. In
              April that charge of PCOJ was formally discontinued.

        4.5   The private prosecution continued and in July 1999, a Leeds Stipendiary
              Magistrate heard an abuse of process application from the defence prior to
              committal proceedings being held.      The argument was based on delay,
              prejudice from media reporting, Article 6 of the European Convention, and
t   1




              unreasonable behaviour of the private prosecutor that was said to border on
              being vexatious or with malice. The application was dismissed and committal
              to the crown court followed after an oral hearing where it was found that there
              was a case to answer.

        4.6   At a Pleas and Directions Hearing in September 1999, Mr Justice Hooper
              directed that:-

              •   the trial was to be set down for early June 2000,
              •   all relevant material in the police archive was to be disclosed to the
                  private prosecutor (except for joint counsels' opinion of 1990 and some
                  other documents), and
              •   hearing dates were set for 20 December 1999 and 4 January 2000 for
                  argument on the admissibility of evidence and an abuse of process
                  application respectively.

        4.7   Following the above directions the Casework Directorate in York supervised
              access by the prosecutor to the extensive police archive held in Sheffield.
              From 1989 to the present day, representatives of the HFSG have claimed that
              the South Yorkshire Police have conspired together and with others to pervert
              the course of justice by way of non disclosure of material and suppression of
              evidence. There was, and still is, a great deal of mistrust of the police by the
              relatives of the deceased.      The CPS were seen by the HFSG as being
              sufficiently independent to ensure that all the relevant documents held within
              the police archive were properly disclosed. Our offer to mediate on this
              difficult disclosure was accepted by both sides. The disclosure process was
              carried out successfully in September and October 1999.

        4.8   On 22 December 1999, Mr Justice Hooper heard argument about the
              admissibility of the evidence that Duckenfield gave to the Taylor Inquiry
              without the protection of a caution being administered. At that time it was
              said that Lord Justice Taylor was of the opinion that the prospect of
              manslaughter charges was an "unreality". This was also the view of the
              counsel who was acting for the South Yorkshire police. Mr Justice Hooper
              found that while Duckenfield had not received independent legal advice, he
              was given disinterested advice by other counsel at the Inquiry, and as a senior
              and experienced police officer must have known what use could be made of
              his evidence. There was no justification in saying that the admission of this
              evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings
              that it ought not be admitted.

        4.9   On 4 January 2000 the hearing of the abuse of process application began. The
              defence skeleton submission was that the continued prosecution was in
              contravention of the defendants' rights to a fair trial under Article 6 of the
              ECHR. It was argued that they would not receive a fair and public hearing
              within a reasonable time. Unlike the common law relating to abuse of process
              the question of any actual prejudice was said to be irrelevant under Article 6.
              Time for the officers began to run in 1990 when they were interviewed under
              caution. Further points concerning 'oppression' and 'delay' were made in the
              skeleton.
•
    4.10 Following the conclusion of the hearing Mr Justice Hooper reserved his
         judgement. It was eventually released on 16 February 2000 and a copy was
          received at the Casework Directorate on the 18th. Most of the judgement is
          taken up by a detailed review of the chronology of events from 1989 to the
          present day.

    4.11   The judge found that none of the witnesses, including Duckenfield and
           Murray, were personally advised of their right not to answer questions which
           might incriminate them. That was because Lord Justice Taylor and the
           Counsel to the Inquiry were of the view that manslaughter charges were not a
           realistic possibility.

    4.12 The joint opinion of counsel that was provided to the CPS in 1990 was
          considered in depth. Counsel for the prosecution had submitted that the test
          for manslaughter is as laid down in Adomako[1995]AC 181 by the House of
          Lords. Mr Justice Hooper was of the opinion that if that was the test then it
          was not the test applied by the authors of the 1990 opinion, as that included a
          subjective element. The defence were arguing that the test used in the 1990
          opinion was the correct one for cases of this type. Adomako should only apply
          to medical negligence. At the end of the submissions the judge decided that it
          was not the time for him to reach a final conclusion on the point. He went on
          to say that:-

                  "I take the view that it is, at least, arguable (with the great benefit of
                  hindsight) that the authors of the opinion did not apply the correct test.
                  There is nothing to suggest that this error, if error it be, was recognised
                  when the matter was reconsidered in 1997. I should add that an
                  examination of the judgement in the Divisional Court in March 1999
                  does not suggest that it was being argued              that Mr Newell had
                  erred in reaching the conclusion that the 'no evidence test' was not met.

           The judge then went onto give his decision on each of the separate
           submissions.

    4.13   The delay has been such that no fair trial is possible: He did not accept this
           argument as most of the evidence on which the prosecution would rely was
           before the Inquiry. In particular the video evidence would be an invaluable
           and objective account of the disaster. This was not a case where anyone
           involved that day, witness or defendant, was going to forget what happened.

    4.14   The publicity has been such that no fair trial is possible: He accepted that
           there had been a massive amount of adverse publicity about the role of senior
           police officers during and after the day of the disaster. The defence had
           submitted that the publicity here had been more adverse than in any other case.
           After considering a number of authorities, including Maxwell and others, he
           concluded that the defence had failed to prove on the balance of probabilities
           that the adverse publicity would prevent or impede a fair trial.
«




    4.15   The prosecution is so oppressive, unfair and wrong that it should not be
           allowed to continue: The judge had some reservations about the manner in
           which the prosecution had been conducted. He made it clear that he expected
           the prosecution to act fairly and properly, and if it did not he would not
           hesitate to act. It had been submitted that this prosecution had become a
           private persecution brought against a background of an unprecedented level of
           media vilification of the defendants and a stirring up of emotional passions.
           However, he saw no merit in this argument provided that the defendants can
           have a fair trial. He found that the position had further changed in favour of a
           prosecution in that there was now a case to answer. Mr Justice Hooper then
           accepted that the evidence against the defendants was the same as it was in
           1989. This was not a case where the defendants relied on an undertaking that
           they would not be prosecuted. Nor was it a case where the authorities have
           acted improperly; the decisions not to prosecute were made in good faith and
           it has not been suggested otherwise. There had been no undue delay caused
           by the prosecution following the institution of proceedings. In doing his best
           to resolve the competing interests of the defendants and the public he decided
           that there was an alternative to a stay.

    4.16   The judge concluded that the oppression was not such as to prevent the trial
           taking place but he would reduce to a significant extent the anguish being
           suffered by the defendants. He would take the highly unusual course in a
           highly unusual case by making it clear that the two defendants would not
           immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted.

    4.17   The prosecution is a breach o f Article 6(1) o f the ECHR: It was submitted that
           either the judge should anticipate the coming into force of section 6(1) of the
           Human Rights Act or adjourn the trial until October by which time the Act
           would be in force. There was much discussion of when time began to run.
           The judge found the position to be far from clear, especially as most of the
           authorities referred to concerned the very different systems of criminal
           investigation followed on the continent. There was the added difficulty that
           private prosecutions were unknown on the continent. This was not a case that
           fell into the clear category of cases referred to in Kebilene. His final decision
           was that it would not be right to adjourn the case until October. Should the
           defendants be convicted then the same arguments could be raised by the
           defence at the Court of Appeal.

    5.     KEY CONSIDERATIONS

    5.1    I am informed that there was further argument concerning the appropriate
            venue for the trial. It had been mooted that it should go to Newcastle Crown
            Court. In the end it remains at Leeds Crown court beginning on 7 June 2000
            and is set down for 6 weeks. A panel of 100 potential jurors is available.

    5.2    Ann Adlington, the solicitor representing the HFSG, informs me that the
           disclosure of the 1990 opinion has been of help to them in their submissions.
5.3    Prior to the trial commencing the judge will hear argument as to whether count
       5 on the indictment (the misconduct allegation re the "disgraceful lie") should
       be allowed to stand on the basis that there is no evidence to support it.

5.4    There has been no adverse comment about the role of the CPS throughout the
       history of the case. Indeed the HFSG have previously made comment at court
       hearings as to the great assistance afforded by us in the realm of disclosure.

5.5    Attached to this report is the latest addition to the Hillsborough Log.

6.     RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1     That the Casework Directorate in York continue to monitor the progress of the
        case.

7.     CONCLUSION

7.1    If the review decisions reached by the CPS since 1990 are correct then this
        case is likely to go to the jury where we would saythat the appropriate
      • verdicts would be 'not guilty'.

 Mr Justice Hooper:

The two defendants are charged with manslaughter (Counts 1 and 2) and misconduct in
public office (Count 3) arising out of the events at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15'1' April
1989. The prosecution is what is commonly known as a private prosecution. The decision to
bring the proceedings in 1998 was made by the Hillsborough Family Support Group
(‘*HF$G”) as a whole (S/30). That group is unincorporated and consists of some 86 of the
bereaved families. Arm Adlington has been seconded by Liverpool City Council to act as the
solicitor for the Group and she laid the informations.
David Duckenfield (“Duckenfield”) was a chief superintendent in charge of the policing on
that day.                Bernard Murray (“Murray”), a superintendent, was the officer with specific
responsibility for the control room. Following a decision by Duckenfield to order the opening
of the gates, a decision not criticised by the prosecution, 96 people who were watching the
game in pens 3 and 4 of the West Terraces died from traumatic asphyxiation. Duckenfield
also faces a charge of misconduct arising from an admitted lie told by him at the time to the
effect that the gates had been forced open by the Liverpool fans. (Count 5) Count 4 charged
him with perverting the course of justice, a charge which he no longer faces following
 intervention by the Attorney-General who entered a “nolle prosequi”.
 In this ruling I shall concentrate on Counts 1, 2 and 3.
 (t is the prosecution’s case that the two defendants are guilty of manslaughter because they
 failed to prevent a crush in pens 3 and 4 of the West Terraces “by failing between 2.40 and
 3.06 p.m. to procure the diversion of spectators entering the ground from the entrance to the
 pen.” In argument Mr Jones QC for the prosecution said that his case was that police officers
 should have been stationed in front o f the tunnel leading to the pen to prevent access. It
 appears, at this stage, to be the defence case that neither of the officers, in the situation in
 which they found themselves, thought about closing off the tunnel or foresaw the risk of
 serious injury in the pen if they did not do so. The prosecution submit that they ought to have
 done. This is likely to be the most important issue in the case. There may well be a further
 issue; if the risk had been foreseen, would it have been possible or practicable to have closed
 the tunnel.
 It was the worst stadium disaster in British football history' and has left the parents and loved
 ones of those who died not only with an enduring grief but also with a deep seated and
 obviously genuine grievance that those thought responsible have not been prosecuted nor


                                                                      • i •

   indeed even disciplined. They have campaigned long and hard for what they see as justice
   and have attracted wide-spread support.                                 Amongst other things of which they have
   complained are the lack of any apology, the conduct of the inquest, the disparity between the
   damages awarded to the families and to the police officers and a cover-up amounting to a
   conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, particularly on the part of the South Yorkshire
   Police and their then legal advisers.
   [t is submitted that the proceedings should now be stayed on the following grounds:
         1.      The prosecution is a breach of the defendants’ rightsto a fair trial under Article 6(1)}
               of the European Convention on Human Rights.
         2. The prosecution is so oppressive to these defendants, so unfair and so wrong that it
               should not be allowed to continue.
         3.       The pre-trial publicity has been such that no fair trialis possible.
         4. The delay has been such that no fair trial is possible.


   Chronology of principal events referred to during the hearing

   I have necessarily had to be selective. I have chosen those events whichare or may be

05-06.89
Taylor Inquiry first stage. 174 oral witnesses called, including Duckenfield and 'Murray who
were not personally advised by LJ Taylor of their right not to answer questions which might
incriminate rhem because LJ Taylor and Mr Andrew Collins QC Counsel to the Inquiry took
the view that manslaughter charges were not a realistic possibility (see my earlier ruling on
December 22, 1999). Both Collins J as he now is and Mr William Woodward QC gave
evidence before me that there were at this stage murmuxings of private prosecutions.


04.08.89
Publication of Taylor Interim report.
 I set out some of the findings of the Report. In obtaining her application for the summonses
Ann Adlington relied upon a document prepared by Mr Jones (8/13A) in which it was stated
 that the facts set out in chapters 1-5, 9-11 and 16 of the Taylor Report ‘‘form the basis of the
 allegations against the two potential defendants.”
            “Chapter 1
            Police Communications
            49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the
            south-west comer of the ground between the south stand and pen 1 of the west
            terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number of steps. It has window's
            commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line of the west perimeter
            fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent
            Murray was in control of it and was advisor to Mr Duckenfield as he had been to Mr
            Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant Goddard who operated the radios.
            The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone and public
            address systems. At the back of the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in
            control of the police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on
            a bench in front of him and behind the three seated officers.

             Chapter 3
             ‘Open the Gates’
             70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five minutes it was open
             about 2,000 fans passed through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets
             for the stands. No doubt some had no tickets at all. The majority had tickets lor the
             terraces. Of these, some found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left t h r o u g h
             the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in
             front of them.

             Misinformation
              98. At about 3.15 p.m. Mr Graham Kelly, Chief Executive of the FA, Mr Kirton also
              of the fA and Mr Graham MackrelL Secretary' of Sheffield Wednesday, went to the

              control room for information. Mr Duckenfield told them he thought there were
              fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a gate had been
              forced aiid there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one of the
              television screens focused on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “That’s
              the gate that’s been forced: there’s been an inrush”. Inevitably Mr Kelly was
              interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke of the two stories concerning the
              gate - the fans’ account that the police had opened it, the police assertion that the fans
              had forced their way in.


              The Dead and the Injured
               108. Of the 95 who died the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came
               through gate C after it opened at 2.52 p.m. That is established by the statements of
               relatives and friends who came through with them but survived.


               111. Although the great majority of those who died were in pen 3 at least five were in
               pen 4. Most deaths occurred at the front of the pens but there were a few fatalities
               further back.

               Part 11
               Why did it happen?
               The Archbishop of York, Dr John Habgood, preaching at the Hillsborough Memorial
               Service on 23 April 1989 said:
                               “Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don’t usually happen just for one
                               single reason, nor is it usually possible to pin the blame on one single
                               scapegoat ...   Disasters happen because a whole series of mistakes,
                               misjudgments and mischances happen to come together in a deadly
                               combination.”
                115. This disaster was the worst in the history of British football. It happened
                because pens 3 and 4 became grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably
                overcrowded by 2.50 p.m. at least to a degree which required that they should be
                closed to further arrivals. Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last
                10 minutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would
                h av e been injuries if not fatalities. A s it was the influx through g a te C after 2,52 p.m.
                so increased the pressure in the two pens as to cause fatal crushing.
                Chapter 9
                Summary
                1 S3. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for monitoring the pens
                their policy on the day w'as to leave fans to “find their own level” and to concentrate
                their own attention on possible disorder. Whilst in theory the police would intervene
                if a pen became “full” in practice they permitted the test of fullness to be what the fans
                would tolerate.

                184. By 2.52 p.m. when gate C was opened pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this
                test. Many were uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to

           cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was courting disaster.
           Chapter 10
           Summary
           228. The layout of the turnstiles and the number they were required to serve left no
           margin of safety against an uneven flow of fans. Because police strategy in advance
           and on the day did not cater for it the arrival of a large number of supporters between
           2.30 p.m. and 2.40 p.m. created an unmanageable crush. The presence of a substantial
           minority of fans who had drunk too much aggravated that problem. Having lost
           control and rejected the option of postponing kick-off the police were faced with a
           serious danger of deaths or injuries. They were left therefore with no alternative but
           to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that stage to ask for it and Mr
           Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step required
           other action.
            Chapter 11
           The Blunder on opening the gates
           229. The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or followed
           by any other order to deal with the consequences. When gate C was opened a steady
           stream of about 2,000 fans poured through it over some five minutes. Clearly they
           were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were diverted their
           likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was
           issued from the control room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse
           were not alerted. Neither the Club control room nor the Chief Steward at the
           Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground Commander,
           was informed. From 2.47 p.m. when Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52
           p.m. when Mr Duckenfield acceded to it there were five minutes in which orders
           could have been given as to how' the influx was to be absorbed. It was not done. In
           evidence Mr Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any wrong decision
           but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where
           the people would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see
           the influx on the television screen, no order was given to steer the fans to the wing
           pens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind to detail officers on the concourse
           to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
           full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its
           own observations and using intelligence from around the ground.


            230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 p.m. the tunnel should have been closed off
            whether gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been
            carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was for a few officers to act as a cordon at
            the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately the 1988 closure
            seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not
            figure in the debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.


            231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where
            there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be
            closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened the fans could

           have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster coaid still have
           been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.


           232. Significantly, when permission was given to open gate A, Mr Duckenfield did
           order serials to go to that pan of the concourse to moni tor the influx towards the north
           stand. He did this because he feared that if fans went to the north stand without
           tickets, they would not get seats and there being no perimeter fences at the north side,
           they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding
           pitch invasion as against safety and the risks of overcrowding. Because those entering
           through gate C could not get onto the pitch it was not thought necessary to alert
           officers to monitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simply was not considered.
            Chapter 16
            Brief summary o f causes
            265. The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the
            failure when gate C was opened to cut off access to the central pens which were
            already overfull.

            266. They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities had been laid
            down, no attempt was made to control entry to individual pens numerically and there
            was no effective visual monitoring of crowd density.
            Chapter IS
            Policing on the Day
            280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were
            defensive and evasive witnesses. Their feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and
            genuine. No doubt those feelings were intensified by the knowledge that such a
            disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their handling of
            problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of
            leadership to be expected of their rank.


             281. Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray’s experience. Between them they
             misjudged the build-up at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr
             Marshall’s request to open the gate. They did not, for example, check the turnstile
             figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the numbers still
             to come. They did not alert Mr Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of
             command. They gave no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings
             Lane. Inflexibly they declined to postpone kick-off.


             282. When Mr Marshall’s request came Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions
             and give orders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the
             gates, he failed to give necessary consequential orders or to exert any control when the
             disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4. When
             he was unsure of the problem he sent others down to “assess the situation” rather than
             descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.


                                                                    •6 -

           283. Most surprisingly he gave Mr Kelly and others to think that there had been an
           inrush due to Liverpool fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful, it set
           off a widely reported allegation against the supporters which caused grave offence and
           distress. It revived against fooiball fans, and especially those from Liverpool,
           accusations of hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from
           Europe too. I can only assume that Mr Duckenfield’s lack of candour on this occasion
           was out of character. He said his reason for not telling the truth was that if the crowd
           became aware of it there might be a very hostile reaction and this might impede rescue
           w'ork. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
           officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a
           falsehood. Moreover, although Assistant Chief.Constable Jackson was at hand, Mr
           Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to him until much later.


            284. The likeliest explanation of Mr Duckenfield’s conduct is that he simply could
            not face the enormity of the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom.
            That would explain what he said to Mr Kelly, what he did not say to Mr Jackson, his
            aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control of the
            disaster situation. He froze.
            The Police Case at the Inquiry
            285. It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their submissions the South
            Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in
            what occurred. Mr Duckenfield, under pressure of cross-examination, apologised for
            blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police case was
            to blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the Club for failing to monitor
            the pens. It was argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
            C but was due to barrier 124a being defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives
            cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would have been far more
            seemly, and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

    Inquests open. Given that the DPP was to consider whether charges should be brought the
    inquest at this stage related only to who the deceased was and when and where he/she met
    his/her death but not to how he/she had met his/her death. These inquests came to be known
    as the “mini inquests”.


    25.06.90
    Murray interviewed under caution in the presence of his solicitor by a Detective Chief
    Superintendent. Some 200 pages of interview. (File 6) He was told at the outset that:
                "Following a public enquiry and report the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police
                consulted with the Director of Public Prosecutions and as a result West Midland
                police were requested to do a criminal investigation. This investigation came at the
                same time as certain members of the public decided to make specific allegations
                against named police officers. You are one of those officers and you have already
                been served with Regulation 7 [disciplinary] Notice dealing with specific complaints.
                The nature of those complaints and the particular duty you were performing at
                Hillsborough on the 15,n April 1989 suggests that you may have contributed to the
                deaths of some of those that died. Also that you may have failed to perform your
                lawful duty as a Police Officer...”

    Murray was then cautioned that he did not have to say anything unless he wished to do so
    “but what you say may be given in evidence”. Having answered many questions Murray was
    told (483):
                “The final thing that I need to say to you is that the facts will be reported to the
                Director of Public Prosecutions and it will be a matter for him to decide whether any
                criminal offences have been committed.”

    The appropriate Code of Practice required the caution to be given if there were grounds to
    suspect a person of an offence.

03.07.90
Duckenfield interviewed under caution. He was given the same information and warning as
Murray but, unlike Murray, declined to answer questions, as was his right.


06.08.90
DPP receives a joint opinion from Gareth Williams QC (as he then was) and Peter Birts QC
as to whether there should be prosecutions. At the conclusion of the hearing I asked the DPP
to provide me with a copy, w hich was then made available (subject to some irrelevant editing)
to the prosecution and the defendants. I received further oral submissions dated 13,14 and IS
January. Insofar as the law is concerned the authors of the opinion wrote:
            “(2) Definition of manslaughter
            57. Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person causes the death of another
            either (1) intending to do an act which, whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and
            dangerous in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury (“an unlawful and
            dangerous act”), or (2) intending to do an act which creates an obvious and serious
            risk of causing personal injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk, or
            (b) having recognised that there was some risk involved, nonetheless going on to take
            it (“recklessness” as defined by Lord Diplock in R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510).

            58. To amount to manslaughter a person’s conduct need not be the only cause of the
            death, but it must be a substantial cause in that it contributed significantly to the
            result. Whether it did so contribute is generally a question of fact for the jury: Pagett
            (1983) 76 Cr. App Rep 279, 287-91.

             59. It may also be that manslaughter is committed if the person causing the death
             intends to do an act, or omits to do an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly
             negligent whether death or serious personal injury results (“gross negligence”): see
             e.g. Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 6th ed. (1988) at p 345. The law is at present
             uncertain whether gross negligence still exists as a separate head of liability, two
             recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where manslaughter is defined in
             terms of negligence should not be followed and that Lord Diplock’s test should be
             applied universally.

             60. In Seymour (1983) 76 Cr. App Rep 211, Watkins LI, giving the judgment of the
             Court of Appeal in a reckless driving case, said:
                        we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or helpful to make
                    reference to compensation and negligence. The Lawrence direction on
                    recklessness is comprehensive and of general application to all offences,
                    including manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles recklessly and
                    should be given to juries without in any way being diluted. Whether a driver
                    at the material time was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no
                    thought to its existence, is a matter which affects punishment for which
                    purposes the judge will have to decide, if he can, giving the benefit of doubt to

                        the convicted person, in which state of mind that person had driven at the
                        material time.”

            61. In Kong Cheuk Kwan v R (1985) 82 Cr. App Rep 18 Lord Roskill, giving the
            opinion of the Privy Council, said at p 25:
                   ‘'Their Lordships are of the view that the present state of the relevant law in
                   England and Wales ... is clear. The model direction suggested in Lawrence
                   and held in Sevmour equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter
                   requires, first, that the vehicle was in fact being driven in such a manner as to
                   create an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to another and
                   secondly that the defendant so drove either without having given any thought
                   to the possibility of there being such a risk or having recognised that there was
                   such a risk nevertheless took it.
                   In principle their Lordships see no reason why a comparable direction should
                   not have been given in the present case as regards that part of the case which
                    concerned the alleged navigation of the FIvina Goldfinch by Kong and indeed
                    as regards the alleged navigation of the Flving Flamingo by the other two
                    defendants. Did their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and
                    serious risk of causing physical damage to some other ship and thus to other
                    persons who might have been travelling in the area of the collision at the
                    material time? If so did any of the defendants ... so navigate either without
                    having given any thought to the possibility of that risk or, while recognising
                    that the risk existed, take that risk?”
            At p 26, Lord Roskill said:
                    “Their Lordships ... respectively agree with the comment made by Watkins LJ
                    ... in Sevmour,”

             62. However, as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed. (1988) at p 353), whilst the
             clear implication from Kong Cbeuk Kwan is that there is no longer any separate test
             of gross negligence in manslaughter, it may be that the courts would not be prepared
             to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some support for this view is found in
             Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr. App Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question in
             Kong Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was “guilty of recklessness (or gross
             negligence)”.

             63. We consider it right in the circumstances of Hillsborough to approach the
             evidence on the basis that the gross negligence test is sufficient to establish the
             offence of manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.

              (3) Neglect bv police
              64. When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is alleged against the police,
              however, authority indicates a more detailed test of liability, In R v West London
              Coroner’s Court, ex o Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against police
              following the death of a man while in police custody concerning the use of force
              against him and failure to summon an ambulance promptly when he became
              unconscious. 'Hie coroner’s directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were quashed
              by the Divisional Court, which held that a coroner directing a jury on manslaughter
              comprising unlawful killing alleged to have occurred because of neglect by police was
              required to direct them as follows:
                                                                     - in -

                         (1) that they had to be satisfied of four ingredients, namely (a) that the police
                         were under a duty to have regard to the health and welfare of the deceased, (b)
                         that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what should have been done
                         for the health and welfare of the deceased, (c) that the failure amounted to a
                         substantial cause of death, and (d) that the failure amounted to recklessness;
                         (2) that the test of ‘‘recklessness” was whether a police officer, having regard
                         to his duty, was indifferent to an obvious and serious risk to the health and
                         welfare of the deceased or, recognising that risk to be present, deliberately
                         chose to run it by doing nothing about it;
                         (3) that a failure to appreciate that there was such a risk was not by itself
                         sufficient to amount to recklessness; and
                         (4) that the jury could only return a verdict of unlawful killing if they could
                         attribute the unlawful conduct to a single police officer.

             65. Plainly those directions are those to be given in any criminal prosecution of a
             police officer where omission to act is alleged to have caused death. In our view they
             have a direct bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this case.”

In relation to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield the authors wrote:
             “87. Clearly there was no unlawful and dangerous act on his part or intended by him
             which would found the first head of liability in involuntary manslaughter. But in
             failing to postpone the kick-off, or to order the closure of the tunnel after the opening
             of gate C, or both, did he intend an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
             causing personal injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk, or
             having recognised that there was some risk involved nonetheless go on to take it?

             88. We consider that there are difficulties in proving that he intended to do Jin act
             which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury. In the first place
             there v<as no “act” as such, but an omission or omissions to act which contributed to a
             rapidly developing state of affairs ending in serious risk of injury. But was it an
             obvious risk at the time? We think not. The complexity of the disaster as now known
             to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates that thefe must be grave
             doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the
             time. The considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the driving cases
             or the collision at sea in the Kong Cheuk Kwan case.

             89. We conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient evidence on which to found a
             charge of recklessness against Mr Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was
             grossly negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in mind particularly
             the judgment of the Divisional Court in the West London Coroner’s Court case, the
             requirements of which are not in our view satisfied.

              90. It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion, that there is no evidence
              that Mr Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have
              committed the offence of culpable misfeasance.

              91. We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence of any criminal offence having
              been committed by Mr Duckenfield.”

                                                                         - I! -

30.08.90
DPP announces that there will be no prosecutions. In a letter to KFSG dated 27 July 1998,
[he CPS explained in outline the 1990 decision. The letter explained that the CPS code
requires a Crown prosecutor to be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a realistic
prospect of conviction, that is, a conviction is more likely than not. The letter went on to
state that the reason for not prosecuting was the insufficiency of evidence to justify criminal
proceedings.


19.11.90 -28.03.91
Inquests resumed, 230 oral witnesses called.                            During the inquest both Murray and
Duckenfield give evidence. “The families were represented by various solicitors acting as
"The Steering Group of Solicitors’ who formed the 'Hillsborough Steering Committee’”.
(8/32) Mr Jones told me that some 100 solicitors were involved but that only two played a
part in the inquest, Mr Douglas Fraser and Miss Elizabeth Steel, as she then was, the former
playing the far greater role. A barrister, Mr King, was instructed by the Committee. "The
Steering      Committee was instructed by a group of forty-three families who each eventually
contributed £3.500 . . “an enormous burden” to many of them. (AA, 8/33)
At the conclusion of the inquests the jury returned verdicts of accidental death by a majority
of 9-2.
           “The verdicts of accidental death in 1991 were demoralising for the families .... The
            Steering Committee considered that further action would not succeed. The views of a
           junior barrister contacted in June 1991 by Trevor Hicks, Chairman of FCFSG, were
           sought upon the prospects of a judicial review of the verdicts, but nothing came of it
           at that stage, having regard to the need for a new lawyer to study volumes of evidence
            given at the inquest and the probable expense.” (AA, 8/34)

      the elements of the offence of manslaughter. McCowan LJ. giving his judgment, with which
      Turner J. agreed, said: (pages 8-9 of the transcript)
                 “Assuming, without deciding, that there was a mis-divection, no blame can be attached
                 to the Coroner since he summed up as he was told to do by the Divisional Court and
                 with the approval of counsel for the relatives. That Mr Jones accepts. What exactly is
                 it that Mr Jones would have the Coroner say? He gave us a long passage ending with
                 these words:
                          ‘... that the attempted avoidance of the perceived risk, namely by opening the
                          gates, was attended by such a high degree of negligence that it justifies a
                          conviction for unlawful killing”.
                 So directed, he submits, the jury could have found unlawful killing. But there is
                 nothing to say they would have done. The verdict they in fact brought in was a
                 perfectly rational one.
                  What then, we ask, would be the point of sending the matter back for another inquest?
                 Mr Jones’s answer was that, whatever the verdict might prove to be, the function of
                  the jury w-ould have been fulfilled. He agreed that no prosecution of any police officer
                  would result because the decision was taken as long ago as September 1990 (before
                  the main inquest) that no one should be prosecuted. It is, he said, a point of legal
                  purity.”

       In rejecting the application to add this ground the Court took the view that it had been made
       far too late and, if successful, would have achieved nothing of value.

       Granada television broadcast Jimmy McGovern’s dramatised reconstruction "Hillsborough”.
       Watched by some 7 million people. Included in the film were very moving accounts o f the
       plight of the bereaved fam ilies on the day and thereafter. The film portrays D uckenfield in a
       very unsympathetic              manner. The film also included allegations that video tapes had been
       stolen by South Yorkshire Police as part of a cover-up, allegations that police had deliberately
       and falsely blamed failure to see overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 on the fact that camera 5 was
       defective, that evidence from video tapes of what was filmed by camera 5 deliberately
       suppressed and concealed, that the evidence of Mr Houldsworth, a video technician at
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, was deliberately withheld from the Inquest jury and that

        enquiry. The documentary was accompanied by considerable press publicity both before and
        after the programme in both local (Yorkshire Post) and national newspapers particularly the
        Mirror but also the broadsheets, (see e.g. Tab 3/43 and following of Media file) and led to a

                      (a) to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
                      (b) to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                      purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

              and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report presented to Parliament. Having considered and rejected
the allegations contained in the Hillsborough film, he concluded that there was no basis for
any further public enquiry and no basis for a renewed application to quash the verdict of the
inquest, that there was no material that should be put before the DPP or the police disciplinary
authorities. Pie further concluded that none of the evidence which he had been asked to
consider added anything significant to the evidence that was available to Lord Taylor’s
    inquiry or to the inquests. He considered the alterations to statements and said that it would
have been preferable if alterations to a few of the statements had not been made. He wrote in
    paragraph 57:
                    “The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as the [defendants] were
                    concerned, the prosecution would have to prove to the high standard required for a
                    criminal conviction that the failure to give the order to close off the tunnel when Gate
                    C was opened amounted to a serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute
                    manslaughter”

    The Home Secretary announced in Parliament that he, the Attorney General and the DPP had
    cach considered the report very carefully and had no reason to doubt the conclusions. The
    Minister said that the system had failed the families and cited a passage from Chapter 7 of his
    report, in which Stuart-Smith LJ wrote that he understood the dismay felt by the families that
    no individual has been personally held to account in a criminal court, in disciplinary
    proceedings or even to the extent of losing his job.

    Under xhe headline “Revealed- Hillsborough Police altered statements” the Sunday Telegraph
    reported: (Tab 3/76 of Media File):
                “Dozens of statements made by police officers on duty at the Hillsborough soccer
                ground at the time of the disaster were altered to remove their initial criticisms of the
                South Yorkshire force, an investigation by The Sunday Teiegraph has found.
                Hundreds of sentences which criticised crowd control at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final
                at the Sheffield ground were deleted or amended.
                The original written recollections were changed within a month on the advice of
                solicitors acting for South Yorkshire police or the force itself. It was the amended
                statements which were presented to future inquiries into the disaster. Today’s
                disclosures put renewed pressure on Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, to order a new
                public inquiry just w'eeks before the 10th anniversary' of the tragedy, in which
                overcrowding and late arrivals led to 96 people being crushed to death and another
                400 injured.
                Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG). said
                yesterday the new' study revealed a scale of statement altering which had been greatly
                underestimated by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s “scrutiny of evidence” last year.
                "The sheer scale of the altering of the statements is an absolute disgrace,” said Mr
                Hicks, who lost his only two children, Sarah 19, and Victoria, 15, at the match.
                The disclosures come as Mr Straw faced growing criticism yesterday of the bungled
                handling of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report.
                Yesterday South Yorkshire police denied that there was a need for a public inquiry
                and said the alterations had been examined by Lord Stuart-Smith who decided they
                did not affect the inquiries’ outcomes or the 1991 inquest where the jury returned
                verdicts of accidental death.”

     The statements referred to are, it appears, the statements which had been considered by
     Stuart-Smith LJ and deposited in the House of Commons library by the Home Secretary
     following his announcement. That theme was developed in the Independent (3/77) and

Ann Adlington writes to Professor Scraton, thought to have been behind the story in the
Sunday Telegraph, asking whether, in his new book “Hillsborough'the Truth”, he had
included anything about the guilt of either defendant to which he replied that he had not:
"References to either former officer are restricted solely to that which is already in the public
domain.”

The Sunday Mirror writes about a ‘'disturbing new book” by Professor Scraton who says that
around a hundred first-hand recollections of Hillsborough were altered in a damage limitation
exercise by the South Yorkshire Police and the “censored” statements were submitted as
evidence to the Taylor inquiry. (Tab 3/79 of Media file) The newspaper reported that “The
statement changes became apparent when Lord Justice Stuart-Smith carried out” his enquiry.

    The Independent publishes a review of Professor Scraton’s new book:
                 "I read this book in a fog of anger. At the disaster itself, naturally, but also at the way
                 the establishment ganged together to make sure that the truth - a scarcely believable
                 story of incompetence and mendacity - was never officially told.
                 Let’s establish a couple of facts: Hillsborough was not caused by alcohol and
                 violence; Liverpool people had not, in Brian Clough’s words, “killed their own”. A
                 combination of police incompetence and structural defects at the ground caused the
                 disaster. H o w the world reacted to it was conditioned by the first action of the man in
                 charge, Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield (who had no experience of such
                 events): he informed Graham Kelly that Gate C had been forced by drunken fans.
                 In fact it was opened by the police. Kelly innocently passed this on in a TV interview.
                 One is left hoping that Mr Duckenfield, who retired through “ill health” to pre-empt
                  disciplinary proceedings, wakes up every morning full of remorse.
                  Afterwards the police questioned survivors and bereaved with appalling insensitivity,
                  trying desperately to establish that Leppings Lane that Saturday afternoon had been
                  populated by insensate, aggressive drunkards intent on self-destruction.

                  Throughout the protracted process of inquest and inquiry they told despicable and
                  systematic lies at every stage. By the end my copy was splattered with exclamation
                  marks next to underlined passages.
                  Here, at random, are one or two of the bits that made my jaw drop: the ambulance
                  driver who tried to drive on to a pitch littered with dead and dying, to be told by a
                  policeman: “You can’t go on there, they’re still fighting”, another policeman who,
                  when told by the mother of victim Andrew Sefcon that he neither smoked nor drank,
                  turned to his colleague and said: “She'll be telling us next he’s a bloody virgin!”; the
                  remark to a family member by Mr Justice Stuart-Smith on the steps of the Liverpool
                  Maritime Museum before the so-called independent scrutiny: “Have you got a few of
                  your people or are they like the Liverpool fans, turning up at the last minute?”
                  The story of the Hillsborough disaster is, in the end, grimly familiar: the little people,
                  the ordinary people, the you and the me, we don’t count. Not really. Alive or dead.”


     16.04.99

     The day after the events of 10 years before had been marked in Liverpool by a minute of
     silence and in Anfield Stadium by speeches and music, the Independent reported that the
     families and the entire city of Liverpool “want to see police officers in the dock, charged
     with neglect and incompetence”. “Yesterday was all about remembrance. It did credit to a
     city and its people in its simplicity and reverence. But under the surface the rage and cries for
     revenge and punishment are still strong. It may be that someday those now broken and
     despised men, like Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and several of his named
     colleagues, may have to answer for their disastrous decisions on that day. Others may have to
     explain the lies and deceit that was rife among South Yorkshire police in the following years.
     But they did not set out to kill anyone on that spring afternoon. It was the Glory game.itself.”
     (Tab 3/91-92 of Media File) The Mirror reported on the same day the words of Mr Hicks at
     the Stadium referring to the astonishing verdict of the coroner’s jury and to the alteration of
      150 statements, many significantly, “If that isn’t wrong I don’t know what is.” The full text
      of Mr Hicks’ statement can be found in Tab 6/6 of the Media File, itself taken from the HFSG
      website. In another article reference was made to the length of time taken to bring the
      Lockerbie suspects and a Nazi war criminal to trial: “... the families of the 96 deserve justice.
      However long it takes... You cannot be at peace with injustice”. (3/95)

Duckenfield and Murray, unreported 31/01/1999 (bundle 12 divider PQ).                                Giving the
judgment of the Divisional Court, Laws LJ said:
                   “Representations had first been made to the DPP on behalf of D [Duckenfield] and M
                   [Murray] in. early July 1998. after the commencement, of the proceedings in the South
                   Sefton Petty Sessional Division which proved abortive.              In the course of
                   correspondence the HFSG again contended that it had discovered new evidence,,
                   which, it was said, had not been before Lord Taylor, the DPP, the Coroner, or Stuart-
                   Smitb LJ. At length, after AA’s [Ann Adlington] informations had been laid in the
                   Leeds Petty Sessional Division, the considered views of the DPP as to the approach to
                   be taken to a request to take over and discontinue a private prosecution were set out in
                   a letter to the HFSG on 27 July 1998. The letter did not contain a decision, but. it
                   explained the DPP’s policy:
                          ‘The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private prosecutor
                          builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The right to bring
                          a private prosecution is preserved by 5.6(1)... subject to the pow-er under s.6(2).
                          The CPS will take over a private prosecution where there is a particular need
                          for it to do so on behalf of the public...
                          In the instant case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over
                          the prosecution in order to discontinue it, we would do so if one (or more) of
                          the following circumstances applies:
                                      ♦ There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution
                                              commenced in these circumstances would be unfounded, and
                                              would, therefore be an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution,
                                       ♦ The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly
                                              outweigh those factors tending in favour.
                                       ♦ The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.
                           The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our
                           policy.
                           I f none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to become
                           involved and we would not interfere with the private prosecution.
                           Clearly there is a distinction between the ‘realistic prospect of conviction' test
                           in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under s. 10 of
                           the 1985 Act] and the ‘clearly no case to answer test mentioned above.
                           A c c o r d i n g l y we recognise that there will be some cases which do not meet the
                           CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will not intervene. It has been
                           considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions would unfairly
                           limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.
                           Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be assured that all
                           relevant material has been considered...
                           Until there has been a detailed review of the many papers in the case the
                           Crown's position cannot be determined...’
                    There followed very substantial representations from D and M and from the HFSG. ■ ••
                    the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene, as I have said by letter ot 18
                    December 1998. The letter merely stated:
                            ‘We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and
                            ail the relevant circumstances of the case.             have concluded that we should
                            not intervene to take over any of the charges.

          The respective solicitors for D and M asked for reasons to be given. There followed a
          letter of 1 February 1999 (the ‘reasons letter’) from the CPS’ Casework Director to
          M’s solicitor form which it is necessary to cite at some length:
                  'As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles
                  applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a
                  prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute proceedings, or whether
                  to advise the police to do so. It is correct that the CPS dccided in 199? that the
                  evidence available at that time was not sufficient, in its view, to provide a
                  realistic prospect of the conviction of either your client or Mr Duckenfteld for
                  any offence. However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence
                  and the representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves
                  on behalf of your client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there
                   is now any new evidence sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a
                   conviction. The decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a
                   view to terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied. It is
                   quite possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the
                   CPS is not satisfied, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength, of the
                   evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the
                   Code (that there should be a ‘realistic prospect of a conviction’).
                   In broad terms, the reason for this is that s.6(1)... specifically preserved the
                   right of private individuals and prosecuting authorities and bodies other than
                   the CPS to bring criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other
                   limitations) to the limitation in s.6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over
                   the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to terminating those
                   proceedings.
                   Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors
                   when deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
                    evidential sufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case to
                    answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate t.o intervene
                   to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That general principle
                    has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation Paper
                    No. 149 ‘Consents to Prosecution’ (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).
                    [The letter then proceeds to set out. the DPP’s policy in the same terms as those
                    in which it had earlier been described by the three “bullet-points" in the letter
                    of 27 July 1998, save that it gives instances of the “public interest factors” test
                    as follows:
                              ‘examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious;
                             or the offence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been
                             cautioned; or where, although the offence may be serious, the
                             defendant is terminally ill,’
                    Then the letter continues as follows]
                    T.n this case, I took the decision not to intervene... I concluded in respect of the
                    charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which,
                    for the avoidance of doubt, were each considered against each individual
                    separately) that I could not say that there is clearly no case to answer. It was
                    not right, therefore, for the Service to take over the proceedings with a view to
                    terminating them.

                     I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest
                     factors that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to
                                                     -22   ■

                            discontinuance, but I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
                            tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour; nor did I
                            consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of
                            justice...

The Divisional court concluded that the DPP’s policy was a lawful one (page 22). The Court
went on to consider what it described as the real question: had the policy been lawfully
applied? Dealing with the DPP’s judgment on the issue of public interest, the Court said:
               “Mr Harrison submitted that in the light of everything that had gone before, and not
               least Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny, there were no public interest factors favouring
               continuation of the prosecutions of D and M. He said that there is nothing in the
               reasons letter to show that the DPP accepted the suggestion, urged forcefully and at
               length by the KFSG in the course of their representations., that further evidence had
               come to light since the Scrutiny. With this latter proposition I agree. But the reasons
               letter clearly implies an acceptance that some factors existed which favoured the
               prosecutions. It stated: “I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
               tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour”. What were
               those in favour? If in truth there were no factors which a reasonable decision-maker
               could regard as going in favour of the prosecutions, then the DPP’s decision would be
                vulnerable to a challenge on Wednesbury grounds (as indeed Mr Harrison claims it is)
                since there would be nothing in public interest terms to weight in the scales against
                discontinuance. When the case was opened there was no affidavit from the DPP
                dealing with the point, nor did Mr Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
                factors, Mr Newell swore an affidavit for the DPP on 22 March 1999. He is the CPS’
                Director of Casework and the author of the rea.sons letter. Paras 2 - 4 are as follows:
                         ‘2. As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution
                        which I considered were as follows:
                                 (1) Previous reviews of the case, in particular those carried out by the
                                 DPP when considering the question whether criminal proceedings
                                 should be taken against Mr Duckenfi.eld and Mr Murray and the more
                                 recent report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.
                                 (2) The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions
                                 that the DPP did not intend to prosecute.
                                 (3) The delay which had occurred between the commission of the
                                 alleged offences and the commencement of the prosecution and its
                                 likely effect on the Applicants, although I took the view that delay may
                                 be offset by the seriousness of the alleged offences (as is reflected in
                                 paragraph 6.5(d) of the Code...).
                                 (4) The effect, of the delay on. the evidence, for example in terms of the
                                 potential impairment of the recollections of witnesses.
                                 (5) The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray of ill-health, although
                                  I noted that no medical evidence had been put forward in support of
                                  this assertion and that, as again reflected in the Code (at paragraph
                                  6.5(e)). ill-health may be offset by the seriousness of the offence.
                          3. As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my view-
                          one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the very
                          serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged offences of
                          manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior police officers
                                                                                  -2 3 -

                                responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a result' of criminal
                                were
                         negligence was a very grave allegation.
                         4. Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by the
                         CPS to the seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right
                         balance as to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the
                         opening words of paragraph 6.4) Having carefully considered the factors
                         tending against prosecution and this extremely important factor in favour of it.
                         I came to the firm conclusion that the factors tending against prosecution did
                         not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very strong public interest in
                         favour of prosecution. ’
                One of Mr Harrison’s complaints, advanced before this affidavit was sworn, was that
                the policy should have taken account of para 10.1 of the Code which includes this:
                          ‘Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant that
                         there will not be a prosecution... that is the end of the matter... But
                         occasionally there are special reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service will
                         re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.’
                This is one of the points relating to the Code which, as it seems to me, bear on the
                application of the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) of Mr Newell’s
                affidavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M that
                for his part the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so, within the
                public interest balance. But J. think there is a qualitative difference between the
                situation where the DPP himself goes back upon a previous assurance not to prosecute
                and one where the DPP does not change his mind but a. private prosecutor chooses to
                 instigate proceedings,
                In reply, having by then seen Mr Newell’s affidavit, Mr Harrison made further
                 submissions. While accepting that there could be a case in which a single factor
                 favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multj.pli.city of factors going the
                 other way, he submitted that if the raft of public interest considerations favouring
                 discontinuance in this case was held not to be enough to outweigh the single factor of
                 the allegations’ gravity, it was difficult or impossible to imagine what set of
                 considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that DPP had fettered his
                 discretion by treating the seriousness of the allegations as overriding everything else,
                 so that be had not in truth carried out a proper balancing exercise at all.
                 I would, reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the factors against
                 prosecution were not properly weighed and considered, and certainly no basis for the
                 supposition that once faced with a private prosecution for something as serious as
                 manslaughter the DPP would inevitably decide to allow it to proceed.
                 Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr 'Newell’s affidavit showed that the DPP had
                 transposed from the Code the ‘seriousness of the charge’ factor as a consideration
                 favouring the prosecution without also taking account of his own view that, the Code
                 test of “realistic prospect: of conviction” was not met. I agree that the DPP's view of
                 the prospects of conviction is a proper matter for him to consider, within the public
                  interest test, contained in the policy, when, deciding whether to discontinue; but, as it
                  seems to me, para 2(1) of Mr Newell’s affidavit shows that in this case he has done
                  so.
                  Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 of the affidavit demonstrated that the DPP’s
                  view of the gravity of the allegation was informed simply by the fact that there was a
                  manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree of culpability
                  inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity of the offence of manslaughter can vary
                  very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it perfectly clear that he had
                                                                     -   24 -

              regard to the species of manslaughter in question (“criminal negligence”) and it cannot
              sensibly be doubted that he was well aware and took account of the circumstances in
              which the alleged offences are said to have been committed.
              Lastly on this part of the case Mr Harrison submitted that the refusal to discontinue
              was simply perverse, gi ven the ‘enormous weight’ of the public interest considerations
              going the other way.
              The DPP mi gilt, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to discontinue. The tragic
              events at Hillsborough have been the subject of repeated, detailed, thorough enquiries.
              Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgment was for the DPP to make. If we
              acceded to Mr Harrison’s submission, we would I think usurp the role of the primary
              decision-maker.
               In my judgment the decision not to discontinue is no more unlawful than is the policy
               which the DPP applied.”

 An application brought by the prosecution seeking to prevent the funding of the two
 defendants by the South Yorkshire Police was also dismissed. If that second application had
 been successful then the defendants would have had to pay for their own representation or,
 subject to a means enquiry, seek legal aid.


 07.99
  Following a five day hearing during which it was submitted on behalf of the defendants that
  the proceedings should be stayed, Mr Nigel Cadbury, Stipendiary Magistrate, dismissed the
  application and, in doing so, concluded: “The defence have not persuaded me to the required
  standard of proof that a fair trial is not possible”. (Vol. 8 tab 7) The prosecuti on prepared for
  the committal proceedings an opening note. (Vol. 8 tab 1 pages 1-13) For the purposes of the
  hearing the prosecution prepared a “Revised Skeleton Argument of the Prosecution on Abuse
  of Process”. Paragraph 73 reads in part: “Present leading counsel was involved in the judicial
  review from September 1.993 to November 1993 and from December 1996. He was not
  asked to advise on criminal law until 1998.” During argument, Mr Jones made a correction to
  that.


   20.07.99
   Following a finding that there was a case to answer, the defendants were committed for trial
   to the Leeds Crown Court.

starting on 6th June 2000.

There is an active web site ran by the HFSG. Following indications which I gave at the PDH
it has not been updated since October 26. (Tab 6 of Media file) Above the name of Mr Phil
Hammond, Vice Chairman and Secretary of HFSG can be found a message about the need to
avoid prejudicial media coverage. (6-3)


Publicity following the hearing
following the hearing I was asked ray tentative views about the showing of a repeat of 3
episodes of Cracker, a fictional series starring Robbie Coltrane as a forensic psychologist.
The episodes concerned a young man who was at Hillsborough and resolves to kill 96 people,
principally police officers. I reached the tentative conclusion that J would not be prepared to
 grant an injunction. Understandably, no injunction was thereafter sought. I have also been
 sent material in the public domain reporting and commenting upon an award of damages for a
 nurse who suffered PTSD as a result of help which she gave at Hillsborough.


 Preliminary observations
 Mr Jones submits that the test for manslaughter is that which, he argues, was laid down by the
 House of Lords in Adomako [1995] 1 AC 181. Manslaughter will be proved if it is shown
 that:
        a) That the defendant owed the deceased a duty of care;
        b) That he was negligent:
        c) That bis negligent actions or omissions were a substantial cause of death;
        d) That, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so
               bad in al l the circumstances to amount, in the judgment of the jury, to a criminal act or
               omission.
 If this is the correct test, then, it. seems to me, that it was not the test applied by the authors of
 the 1990 opinion, which includes a subjective element.
 Mr Harrison in his written submission prepared after receipt of counsel's 1990 opinion, now
 argues that Mr Jones’ suggested test , although applicable to medical negligence, is not the
 test for cases of the present kind. Relying p articu larly on a passage in Lord Mackay’s speech

                                                                           -2 6 •

to Adoroako and his apparent approval of Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB and Ex parte
Gray (referred to in that opinion), Mr Harrison submits that the prosecution must additionally
prove that the defendant was at least indifferent to the risk of serious injury (para. 7 of note
dated 13/01/2000). If this is right, then manslaughter in this kind of case requires a subjective
element. He further submits that, therefore, the test applied by the authors of the opinion
remains the correct one.
This is not the time for me to reach any final conclusion on the matter. Nor is it necessary for
me to deal with a further matter relating to breach of duty raised by Mr Clegg in his written,
submission dated 18 January 2000.
 I note that. Mr Harrison’s submissions do not seem to receive the support of Professor Smith,
 Criminal Law, Smith and Hogan, 9th edition, page 376-377, where it is argued that there is
 now only one “single, simple test of gross negligence”, an objective one. I take the view that
 it is, at least, arguable (with the great benefit of hindsight) that the authors of the opinion did
 not apply the correct test. There is nothing to suggest that this error, if error it be, was
 recognised when the matter was reconsidered in 1997. I should add that an examination of
 the judgment in the Divisional Court in March 1999 does not suggest that it was being argued
 by Mr Harrison that Mr Newell had erred in reaching the conclusion that the “no evidence
 test” was not met. If the proper test for manslaughter involves a subjective element of the
 kind for which he now contends, one might have expected Mr Harrison to have argued that
 the “no evidence test” was met.
 The stipendiary magistrate has found that both defendants have a case to answer. It was not
 and could not, as a matter of procedure, be suggested before me that this decision was wrong.
 He gave no reasons and I am therefore unsure which test be applied. I suspect that it was the
 test propounded by Mr Jones.
 The Director of Public Prosecutions in the person of Mr Christopher Newell has reached the
 conclusion that the DPP should not intervene and take over the prosecution to bring it to an
  end. As I have already mentioned, the policy and the decision were analysed in detail by the
  Divisional Court in March last year and the policy was found to be lawful and the decision
  not one that should be quashed.


  The delay has been such that no fair trial is possible
  I propose to deal with this submission first. During the course of the hearing I made it clear
  that I did not accept' it. As the prosecution's case now stands, all or almost all of the evidence

                                                                           •27-

upon which the prosecution rely is the evidence upon which. Lord Justice Taylor relied to
reach bis conclusions. Significant parts of the evidence are recorded on video tapes which
have been edited into a compilation tape. I have seen that tape and. in my view formed at this
early stage of the proceedings, it will provide an invaluable and objective account of what
happened              that afternoon in so far as relevant to these proceedings. This is not a case where
anyone involved that day, witness or defendant, is going to forget what happened.
Mr Harrison submitted that the defendants could be faced with, insuperable difficulties when
examining whether, if thought had been given to closing off the tunnel, it would have been
possible or practicable so to do, It is now too late, he submits, to know, for example, which
police officers could have been used to close it off. Experience shows that judges must be
cautious when arguments of this kind are submitted. In my own experience, having rejected
similar submissions, J have found that, at the trial, the difficulties proved non-existent, At the
present time and having regard, for example, to the video tape, I cannot see how such a
difficulty may arise. Hie tape shows a number of officers inside the gates. As a result of the
opening of the gates, some of those officers, such as those who had been searching, could no
 longer perform that task. If I am wrong and the difficulties outlined by Mr Harrison prove to
 be real difficulties then I have the power at any stage to either stop the case or make some less
 draconian ruling. Likewise Mr Harrison expresses concern should the prosecution seek to
 rely on experience gained at earlier matches. Should the prosecution seek to do this I. will, if
 asked, consider whether it would be fair to do so having regard to the delay.


 The publicity has been such that no fair trial is possible.
 There is no doubt that there has been a massive amount of adverse publicity about the role of
 the police and of senior police officers on and after the day of the disaster at Hillsborough. It
 was submitted, on behalf of the defendants that the publicity ha.s been more adverse than, in
 any other case. Mr Jones submitted that the publicity in the Maxwell case, particularly as far
 as Robert Maxwell was concerned, was as adverse, if not more adverse,
 I turn to the appropriate legal principles. In Maxwell and others, unreported, March 5 1995.
 Phillips J, as he then, was, referred to the “unrelenting adverse media publicity" about Mr
 Robert. Maxwell, whose “name has become a synonym for fraud"5 (page 53). Phillips J said
 that there had. “been significant adverse publicity to Mx Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell.'* In
 ruling against an application to quash the proceedings on this ground, Phillips S said:



 Draft 14 February 2000 Id .45
The contents o f   this   rultoa may n«rt i?9 published until                                   R- v -D u cken field and M urray




          “I am satisfied, nonetheless, that the effect of pre-trial publicity alone can constitute a
          valid ground for ordering a stay of proceedings. The principles that govern the
          exercise of such jurisdiction merit careful consideration.

          No stay should be imposed unless the Defendant shows on the balance of probabilities
          that owing to the extent and the nature of the pre-trial publicity he will suffer serious
          prejudice to the extent that no fair trial can be held.
          I would accept this test, so far as it goes, but it remains necessary to identify the
          essential aspects of a fair trial for the purpose of the test.
          If it were enough to render a trial unfair that publicity has created the risk of prejudice
          against the Defendant our system of criminal justice would be seriously flawed. There
          will inevitably be cases where the facts axe so dramatic that almost everyone in the
          lands will know of them. There will be circumstances when arrests are made or
          Defendants whose guilt will, or may, appear likely. Intense media coverage may well
          take place before a suspect, is identified or apprehended. If in the most notorious cases
          Defendants were to claim immunity from trial because of the risk of prejudice public
          confidence in the criminaljustice system would, be destroyed.” (Pages 60-62)

Having         given         two      examples        Akindor     (The      herald      of    Free      Enterprise)         and
Savundranavagan, he went on to say:
           “Our system, of criminal justice is founded on the belief that the jury trial provides the
           fairest, and most reliable method of determining whether guilt is established. This
           belief is based on the premise that that the jury will do their best to be true to their
           oath and to try the case according to the evidence. The ability of the jury to disregard
           extrinsic material has been repeatedly emphasised by judges of great experience.”


 Phillips J then cited passages from judgments given by Lawton J in K ray, and as Lawton U
 in Coughlan, by Lord Denning and Sir John Donaldson in AG v. News Group Newspapers
 Ltd [1987] QB 1. In K ray. Lawton J said:
            “It is ... a ro.att.er of h u m a n e x p e r ie n c e , an d c e r ta in ly a m a tter of the e x p e r ie n c e of
            those who practise in the criminal courts, first that the public’s recollection is short
            and, secondly, that the drama, if I may use that term, of a trial almost always has the
            effect of excluding from recollection that which went before.”

 As to recollections being short, my own experience may be of interest. When I first came to
 this case last year I thought that the criticism of the senior police officer on the day (whose
 name I did not recollect) was that he had ordered the opening of the gates when he ought not
 to have done. I now know that it is accepted that the order to open the gates was the proper
 course to take.
 Lawton J went on to say that a juror would not disqualify himself merely by reading
 newspapers containing discreditable allegations unless his mind had become so ""clogged with
  prejudice that he w-as unable to try the case impartially”.

                                                                -20-

Again my own experience may be of interest. In a trial last year of a doctor charged with, the
murder of an elderly and very sick patient in great pain, two potential jurors, without being
asked, both indicated that they were unable to act as jurors because of their views on the topic
of euthanasia, one being apparently in favour and one against.
In AG v. News Group Newspapers Ltd Sir John Donaldson said (page 16):
                 a trial by its very nature, seems to cause all concerned to become progressively
              more inward looking, studying the evidence given and submissions made to the
              exclusion of other sources of enlightenment. This is a well-known phenomenon.”

 Phillips J went on to say:
              “How then, in the case such as this, should the Court approach the question of
              whether pre-trial publicity has made a fair trial impossible? I am inclined to think Mi
              Lawson provided the answer when he advanced by way of submission the following
              test:
                      “If prejudicial publicity would, in hindsight result in a conviction being unsafe
                       and unsatisfactory, it cannot a fortiori, be fair to embark on a trial which may
                       so result.”
              It seems to me that the Court will only be justified in staying a trial on the ground of
              adverse pre-trial publicity, if satisfied on balance of probabilities that if the ju ry return,
               a verdict of guilty, the effect of the pre-trial, publicity will be such as to render that
               verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory,
               In considering this question the Court has to consider the likely length of time the jury
               will be subject to the trial process, the issues that are likely to arise and the evidence
               that is likely to be called in order to form a v i e w as to whether it is probable that - try
               as they may to disregard the pre-trial publicity - the jury's verdict will be rendered
               unsafe on account of it.

                1 now turn to consider whether the Defendants have satisfied me that because of the
                pre-trial publicity, a fair trial cannot take place.

                The second point to consider is the possibility of potential jurors whose minds - to use
                the words of Lawton J - have become clogged with prejudice as a result of adverse
                publicity. That such there may be is indicated by some of the answers to the opinion
                polls and by compelling oral evidence given by Mr Kevin Maxwell on this
                application. They also must be identified by an appropriate process of jury
                questioning.
                The question then, remains of whether jurors who set out to perform their duties in
                accordance with their oaths will, by the end of the trial, be at risk of acting under the
                 influence of publicity rather than reaching their verdicts on the basis of the evidence
                 that they have heard in Court.
                 Let me deal first with prejudice that may have been engendered by publicity adverse
                 to particular Defendants. So far as Mr Trachtenberg and Mr Bunn are concerned, their
                 Counsel did not suggest that such publicity as there has been about them w'ould
                 prevent their having a. fair trial. I think it unlikely that any juror would even
                 remember their names.

                                                                               - 3CJ -

                 The adverse publicity that there has been directed against Mr Kevin and Mx Jan
                 Maxwell is far more significant. Nonetheless I do not consider it that it is such as to
                 pose a threat to the fairness of the trial. It is too early yet to form a precise estimate of
                 the duration of this trial. 1have no doubt, however, it will run for a period of months.
                 The phenomenon spoken to by Sir John Donaldson of becoming more inward looking
                 and studying the evidence and submissions to the exclusion of other forms of
                 enlightenment is one of which I have had personal experience in the context of a long
                 fraud trial. It is something that it is impossible to exaggerate. As the weeks go by the
                 trial becomes not merely part of life, but the dominant feature of it so that the stage is
                  reached when one can hardly see behind it or beyond it, and I am quite sure that this is
                 truly true of all involved in the trial.
                 The responsibility of reaching verdicts is a heavy one is any case, but in a case such as
                  this it is one of which, the jury will be particularly aware. I do not believe that their
                  verdicts will be influenced by anything that they may have read about individual
                  Defendants before the trial begins. Nor can I accept the suggestion made by Mr Jones
                  that they will, permit their verdicts to be influenced by views expressed by friends or
                  relatives outside court.” (Pages 72-76)

 Phillips J went on to consider the publicity surrounding the late Mr Robert Maxwell and said:
 “on reflection, I am not persuaded that, if he were to stand trial, a jury would not try him
 fairly and reach verdicts on the evidence” (page 77).
 It will be remembered that the defendants in the Maxwell case were acquitted by the jury.
 I turn to this case applying the principles enunciated by Phillips J. It is anticipated that the
 trial will take about 6 weeks, although it may well be shorter. Certainly it will last long
 enough for the phenomenon of which Sir John Donaldson and Phillips J spoke, to take effect.
                      i

  It can be assumed that every potential juror will know about Hillsborough and be appalled by
 the death of 96 people, many of whom were so young, and feel the greatest sympathy for the
  relatives of those who lost their Jives, particularly the parents of the young. That, assumption
 can be made in many high profile trials. In addition to those mentioned by Phillips J we have
  the more recent examples of Rosemary West and Dr Shipman. It can also be assumed that
  every potential juror may well feel that someone must be at fault for the tragedy, whether the
  police, the fans or the Club. In this case it is noteworthy that at the Inquest the jury brought in
  verdicts of accidental death, knowing, as they must have done, that the families of the
  deceased, many of whom, were present at the hearings, would be deeply disappointed if not
  devastated by the verdict. I see no reason why a jury cannot be chosen all members of which
  will try the case on the evidence before them.
  It can also be assumed that every potential juror may well have read or heard about an alleged
  police cover-up after the disaster. Any concern about that may be met by making it clear to
  the jury, if need be, that the alleged cover-up has nothing to do with these defendants and that,
                                                                                   „ ^ t   ,

in any event, many of the allegations made against the police inspired by Jimmy McGovern’s
film have no foundation. Furthermore questions could be so framed to exclude anyone who
has read, for example, Professor Scraton’s book.
Are there any special features in this case which might have the effect that a juror's mind
could be “clogged with prejudice as a result of adverse publicity”. Counsel point particularly
to the song contained in the Manic Street Preachers album to which I have made reference.
Although many copies have been sold, it would be easy to select jurors who have not heard
the song. In any event, with al) respect to the persons responsible for it and to those who have
welcomed it, the suggestion of mass murder is so outrageous and so far from the truth, that no
sensible juror could, ever be influenced by it.
It will be necessary, if this trial continues, to prepare a list of questions for the jury, the
precise contents of which will be the subject matter of discussion.                   As I indicated in
argument, I have reached the tentative view that it will be easier to select a jury if the trial
were to be conducted outside West Yorkshire.                    Given the proximity to Sheffield and the
 extensive coverage of the matters in the Yorkshire newspapers, there is likely to be more
 potential jurors in West Yorkshire who will answer the questions in such a way that they
 should not be empanelled..                    In any event, as Presiding Judge, I am well aware of the
 difficulties faced by the West Yorkshire courts (Leeds and Bradford) in coping with the
 volume of criminal cases.                   Cases, particularly long ones, are often moved out of West
 Yorkshire when it is practicable so to do in order to relieve the strain on the system. I am also
 aware that none of the courtrooms in Leeds is ideal, for a trial of this kind. I have also reached
 the tentative view that, for these reasons, a. trial, if there is to be one, should be conducted in
 the Moot Hall at Newcastle. However, counsel indicated that they wished to address me
 about that, should I. decide not to quash the proceedings.
 Ever mindful of the obligation to ensure a fair trial, I have reached the conclusion that the
 defendants have failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the adverse publicity will
 prevent or impede a fair trial. I go further. I am quite satisfied that they will have a fair trial.
 If there is to be trial, I shall reconsider the issue if it is necessary to do.


 The prosecution is so oppressive, unfair and wrong that it should not be allowed to continue.
 An attack was made on the objectivity of the prosecution team and particularly Miss
 Adlington. I confess to some reservations about the manner in which the prosecution has
 been conducted, for example the decision to start these proceedings in the Liverpool area, Mr

Jones’ argument at the PDH to the effect that admissions made by the defendants only for the
purposes of the committal proceedings were binding at trial and his argument that I should
admit into evidence an attendance note of a solicitor who was not to be called because the
prosecution did not believe a word he said. A similar argument was raised about Miss
Adlington before Mr Cadbury and was rejected by him. (volume 8, tab 7 pages 100-101) I
see no reason to depart from his finding nor to stop the proceedings for this reason. I make it
clear, however, that I expect the prosecution to act properly and fairly. J am sure it. will. If it
docs not I shall not hesitate to act.
It is submitted that the proceedings should be stayed because the prosecution was only
launched after the McGovern film which was a distortion of the truth. The prosecution has
 been “prompted by a distorted and misrepresented view of the true facts”. I understood the
 description, “misrepresented” to refer to matters unconnected with the evidence upon which
 the prosecution rely in this case. It is submitted that this prosecution has “become a private
 persecution brought against the background of an unprecedented level of media vilification of
 the defendants and a stirring up of emotional passions.” I. see no merit, in these arguments
 provided the defendants can have a fair trial, as I have found they can and provided that the
 prosecution is not so oppressive that it ought not be allowed to continue, a matter to which I
 return shortly.
 It is submitted that, given that the evidence has not changed since 1989-90, the prosecution
 should be stayed having regard to the earlier decisions not to prosecute, the verdict, of the
 Coroner’s jury, the results of the                  r e v ie w   conducted by Stuart-Smith LJ and the endorsement
 of the conclusions therein by the Home Secretary and the DPP. It. is submitted that there is
 here “a refusal to accept eitrlier decisions”. Similar arguments                      were    put to the DPP and, it
 appears, to the Divisional Court in March of last year. Mr Newel] outlined this argument in
 paragraph 2(1) of his affidavit where be dealt with factors tending against prosecution. The
 position, has further changed in favour of the prosecution in. that there is n o w a case to answer.
 Against this background. I see no justification in quashing the proceedings for this reason,
  assuming, without deciding, that this could be a free-standing ground to quash.
  It is submitted that a court has a duty to be extra vigilant when a private prosecution is
  brought because private prosecutors are nor subject to the same codc as public prosecuting
  authorities: "the duty of the court to protect defendants from oppression and abuse against a
  private prosecutor calls for a different approach” than that followed where public prosecuting
  authorities are concerned. Private prosecution “must not be allowed to become an unfettered

                                                                     -33-

indulgence”. It is submitted that this prosecution is so unfair, unreasonable and wrong that it
should not be allowed to proceed. These are similar arguments to those developed in the
Divisional Court, since when, as I have said, there has been found a case to answer. In my
view     it would not be right for me to apply the CPS evidentiary test and decide whether there
is a realistic prospect of a conviction.                                  Indeed I was not asked to cany out a detailed
examination of the evidence. Insofar as public interest is concerned, assuming that a private
prosecutor should take that into account, the Divisional Court has already held that the
decision not to intervene is not Wednesbury unreasonable. Subject to the issue of oppression,
I see no reason why I should interfere with the decision to prosecute which, it seems to me, is
also one that a reasonable prosecutor could reach.
It is submitted on the analogy of cases like R. v. Crovdon Justices, ex parte Dean (1994) 98
 Cr.App.R. 76 that there had been, in effect, an undertaking to the defendants that they would
not be prosecuted. Reliance is placed on what Mr Jones said during the Divisional Court
hearing in 1993 against the background of the CPS decisions not to prosecute. Nothing that
 Mr Jones said on behalf of the six families who took those proceedings can be regarded as an
 undertaking of the kind referred to in Crovdon Justices. This is not a case, on the evidence
 before me. where a person has relied upon a promise or undertaking (see Attorney-General
 of Trinidad and Tobago [1995] 1AC 396 at 417).
 I turn to the question which has given me the most concern: “Is this prosecution, so
 oppressive to these defendants that it ought to be stayed?’’ There was no dispute that an
 prosecution could be so oppressive that it should be stayed. In Latif [1996] 2 Cr. App. R. 92,
 at 101 (H,L.) Lord Steyn said the law is settled:
             “Weighing countervailing considerations of policy and justice, it is for the judge in
             the exercise of his discretion to decide whether there has been an abuse of process,
             which amounts to an affront to the public conscience and requires the criminal
             proceedings to be stayed ... or where it would be contrary to the public interest in
             the integrity of the criminal justice system that a trial should take place. ... [T]he
             judge must weigh in the balance the public interest in. ensuring that those that are
             charged with grave crimes should be tried and the competing public interest in not
             conveying the impression that the court will adopt the approach that the end
             justifies any means.”

 In Attorncy-Generai's Reference fNo. 1 of 1990) (1992) 95 CrApp.R. 296, at 302-303 Lord
 Lane CJ said:
              “Stays imposed on the grounds of delay or for any other reason should only be

              it would be only a short time before the public, understandably, viewed the process

That case and_the earlier case of Heston-Francois (1984) 78 Cr.App.R. 209 refer to the
alternatives open to a trial judge other than stopping a trial.
In D ept of Transport v. Chris Smaller Ltd 1989 AC 1197, at 1210 (a civil case) Lord
Griffiths said:

               “I would, however, express a note of caution against allowing the mere fact of the
               anxiety that accompanies any litigation being regarded as of itself a sufficient
               prejudice to justify striking out an action. ... There are, however, passages in some
               of the judgments that suggest that the mere sword of Damocles, hanging for an
               unnecessary period, might, be a sufficient reason of itself to strike out. On this
               aspect I repeat the note of caution I expressed in the Court of Appeal in Eagil Trust
               Co. Ltd. v. Pigott-Brown [1985] 3 All ER 119,124. where I said:
                       "Any action is bound to cause anxiety, but it would as ageneral rulebe an
                       exceptional case where that sort of anxiety alone would found a sufficient
                       ground for striking out in the absence of evidence of any particular
                       prejudice. Biss's case is an example of such an. exceptional case, the action
                       hanging over for 11 years, with professional reputations at stake."

 Ln the ruling of Buckley J. (unreported, 09/96, C.C.C.) following the acquittal of Kevin
 Maxwell and others at the first trial can be found the following passage (at page 233-234):
                "Fin.al.ly, an important, though not decisive consideration; fairness to the Defendants.
                I have mentioned the time that these criminal proceedings would have been hanging
                over their heads in the event of a further trial, at least five years. That would be so, in
                Mr. Kevin Maxwell's case, notwithstanding that in going through the extremely
                lengthy trial process he gave evidence before the jury for twenty days and
                notwithstanding the acquittals. The disruption to personal and business life is
                inevitably considerable. The stress and pain that criminals inflict on their families is a
                sad but inevitable consequence of their misdeeds. Courts are mindful of it but
                obviously cannot allow it to outweigh consideration for victims and the general public
                 interest in punishing crime. But I remind, myself here that these Defendants have been
                acquitted and in the circumstances I have described. As I mentioned earlier Mrs.
                Kevin Maxwell gave evidence before me. Her obvious distress was. I am convinced,
                entirely genuine. She described the agony of trial and the days waiting for the verdict
                with the prospect of a significant prison sentence in the balance. She told me ot.
                problems with her children. In particular, their son who had been told by schoolmates
                 that his father was going to prison for a long time. When ever her husband goes out
                 she is now repeatedly asked “Will daddy be coming home again?”.
                 I can understand the expectation that built up in the family's mind that an acquittal
                 would be the end of the matter. Mrs. Maxwell’s bewilderment and anger at the
                 decision to proceed to another trial were not feigned. I cannot be over influenced by
                 such matters but no one could have been unm oved by her evidence.”

Some help can be obtained from the ECHR. The requirement in Article 6 of a hearing within
a. reasonable time is designed to prevent a person charged from remaining "too long in a state
of uncertainty about his fate" (Stogmiiller v. Austria 1 E.H.R.R. 155. at para. 5 at 191).
This is not a case where new evidence has been found many years later (for example DNA
evidence) or where the defendants have misled the prosecuting authorities in some way.
Clearly different principles apply in those kinds of cases. As I have said before, the evidence
against these defendants is the same evidence as it was in 1989. Even if the test applied in
 1990 was not the Adomako test (which J. shall assume to be the correct test), that is not in the
 same category as the finding of new evidence. Nor is this a case where the authorities have
 acted improperly- the decisions not to prosecute were made in good faith and it has not been
 suggested otherwise. Nor is this a case where there has been undue delay caused by the
 prosecution following the institution of these proceedings against the defendants.
 In this case neither the defendants or members of their family have given evidence, but I have
 no difficulty in inferring that they must be suffering a considerable amount of strain. They
 are likely to have thought following the verdict of the jury in the Coroner's enquiry in 1991. if
 not earlier, that a prosecution was, at the least, very unlikely, except perhaps during the
 continuance of the 1993 Divisional Court proceedings and in the period leading up to and
 including the enquiry conducted by Stuart-Smith LJ. In 1998 the defendants, I infer, must
 have started suffering the stress which they had suffered during the period 1989-199 L.                                     They

 have, of course, both resigned from the police force and there is no evidence before me that a
 conviction would have any particular financial consequence. I add that, on the evidence
  before         m e,         they         are      receiving the best possible legal representation thanks to the South
  Yorkshire police.
 The thought of being convicted for a serious offence of manslaughter must be a strain on
  anybody. However, and I can say this from my own experience defending in criminal cases
  over many years, it is the thought of prison which, for most defendants, is the greatest worry.
  In the words of Buckley I., Mrs Pandora Maxwell “described the agony of trial and the days
  waiting for the verdict with the prospect of a significant prison sentence in the balance.’* That
  is familiar to anyone who has defended in serious criminal cases. For police officers or ex-
  poli.ce officers, the threat of prison has even more significance than for others. These two
  defendants, if sentenced to prison for the manslaughter of, in effect, 96 people, would
  necessarily be at considerable risk of serious injury if not of death at the hands of those who
   feel very strongly about Hillsborough.

                                                                                      - 36   -

On the other side of the balance is the public interest put succinctly by Mr Newell in the 1999
Divisional Court proceedings:
                there was in my view one extremely important factor m favour of prosecution,
            namely the very serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged
            offences of manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior police officers
            were responsible for the deaths of a number of peopleas a result of criminal
            negligence was a very grave allegation”.

Doing my best to resolve the competing interests of the defendants and the public, I have
decided that there is an alternative to a stay. I conclude that the oppression is not such as to
prevefit the trial from taking place but that J. should now reduce to a significant extent the
anguish being suffered by these defendants.                               I do that by making it clear that the two
 defendant's will not immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted. This is, I accept,
 a highly unusual course, but this is a highly unusual case. When I canvassed this possibility
 with Mr Jones, he fairly and helpfully drew my attention to evidence that the families were
 not, apparently, seeking punishment of this kind (page 6 of transcript of evidence of Miss
 AdJington before the Stipendiary Magistrate).


 The prosecution is a breach of the defendants’ rights to a fair trial under Article 6(TH of the
 European Convention on Human Rights.
 Mr Clegg submits that even if, applying the English law of abuse of process, there should be
 no stay, I should nonetheless stay the proceedings. To order the trial to continue would be, he
 submits, a breach of Article 6(1) of the ECHR. He relies on the words in that Article: “In the
 determination of ... any criminal charge against him. everyone is entitled to a fair and public
 hearing within a reasonable time”. Contrary to the submissions of Mr Jones, he submits that
 time started to run when the defendants were interviewed under caution in. 1990, that it did
 not thereafter cease to run and that a determination of the charges at the earliest in June would
 not be within a reasonable time. He further submits that I should anticipate the coming into
 force of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act which provides that: “It is unlawful for a
 public authority [which includes a court] to act in a way which is incompatible with a
 Convention right”. Alternatively, I should adjourn the trial until October when it is
 anticipated that the Act will come into force.
 He accepts, on the authority of R. v D.P.P. ex parte Kebilene [1990] 3 W.L.R. 972 (H.L.)
 that it would be contrary to the legislative intention to treat section 6(1) as though it was now
 in force. He points to passages in the speeches in that case (984H-985A, 996F-H). Relying
  upon them, he submits that, if there is a clear breach of section 6(1). a decision should be
 taken at this stage rather than on appeal following a conviction. I shall assume the
  correctness of this submission.
  In my judgment the position is far from clear. I was referred to a large number of authorities
  which deal with when time starts to run. They, in very large measure, concern the very
  different system of criminal investigation followed on the continent. It is far from clear
  whether time would start to run at the moment of arrest or charge in this country or from the
  moment of an interview under caution. In this case there is the added difficulty that this is a
  private prosecution, a type of prosecution unknown, I believe, on the continent. Although 1

        am inclined to think that time would not cease to run, that is certainly not clear. Mi Jones
        strenuously argued that, even if time had started to run in 1990 and continued to run, the
        determination,vould still be within a reasonable time. My inclination would be that the
        determination would not be within a reasonable time but is not clear how that should be
        determined in a case of this kind.
        Amongst the many cases to which I was referred is EckJe v. Federal Republic of Germany
        (1982) 5 E.H.R.R. 1. In that case the Court said (at page 25) that a German court had
        available a means of affording reparation for a breach of the reasonable time requirement in
        Article 6(1): “according to well-established case law in the Federal Court of Justice, when
        determining sentence the judge must take proper account of any over-stepping of the
        ‘reasonable time’ within the meaning of Article 6(1)”. Mr Jones relied on this case and on
        section 8 of the Act which provides that, in relation to any act which the court finds is
        unlawful, “it may grant such relief ... as it considers just and appropriate.” Mr Clegg
        submitted that section 6(1) of the Act prevented the approach in EckJe- if the reasonable time
        had expired there was only one remedy available, namely stay the proceedings. He submitted
         that the court had no discretion in the matter. The balancing approach developed in the
         English courts could not be adopted. If all else were clear, this certainly is not. This alone
         prevents this case from falling into the category of clear cases referred to in Kebilene.
         Should I then grant an adjournment until October, when it is anticipated that the Act will
         come into force? The trial date was set in September of last year, with the consent of all
         concerned. It would not be right now to adjourn it. Should either of the defendants be
         convicted, the arguments raised by Mr Clegg can be raised again in the Court of Appeal and
         the chronology which I have set out coupled with the written evidence of Miss Adlington and
         her oral evidence before the Stipendiary Magistrate, should enable the appellate court to
         resolve any issues of fact and, in particular, whether the determination will have been within a
         reasonable time.

         Conclusion

         I decline to stay the proceedings and the trial will start in June. I shall n ow hear submissions
         as to whether it will be in Leeds or Newcastle.

Informed Ms Adlington that we did not have QPO’s for ACC W.W.Jackson,
Ch Supt Duckenfield, Supt Marshall, nor Supt Greenwood.
I referred Ms Adlington to her request for the minutes o f a meeting
between DCC Hayes, Ch Supt Mole and DS Peter Carr. I informed her
that as far as I was aware the meeting had not been minuted and that it
had been held to instruct DS Carr to prepare an ANACAPA chart. I
informed her I had spoken to Peter Carr on his return from annual leave
and although he could remember preparing the ANACAPA chart he had
no recollection o f the meeting nor could he assist with whether minutes
had been prepared or not. I also informed her that I had spoken to the
former secretary to the DCC and that she had no recollection o f
minuting the meeting, nor was anything indexed to suggest the meeting
had been minuted. She asked if there was a written action to record the
request for the ANACAPA chart and I replied, "No”.

Provided Ms Adlington with a copy o f the 142 page Hillsborough Video
Schedule.

I spoke to Ms Adlington re her request for the transcript o f radio
channel 35, informed her that the channel had been used by Hammerton

was added to by an operator sitting at a computer terminal typing
details from channel 35 on screen as they happened. This system was
not perfect, as it was neither verbatim, nor real time. The print out o f
this extended incident, which was the only record o f channel 35 was
contained in D1393, which had been copied to her today.

Provided Ms Adlington with a typed list o f officers interviewed by West
Midlands Police in accordance with her request o f 14.10.99. They were:
Assistant Chief Constable W W Jackson;
Chief Superintendent D Duckenfield
Superintendent B Murray
Superintendent R Marshall
Superintendent R Greenwood
PC417 Illingworth
PC442 Cuckson
PC1285 Smith
PC2316 Scott, and also
Mr G H Mackrell (Secretary SWFC)

I informed Ms Adlington that a search o f the archive had not revealed
there to be any police officers pocket note books stored therein and no
PSU forms either. I informed her that we did not have copy o f original
FA Submissions to the LJT Enquiry, but confirmed with her that she did
not know if there had been an original submission as opposed to the FA
final submission, a copy o f which had been disclosed.

Disclosed to Ms Adlington a file o f West Midlands Police Reports R1 to
R109 to supersede the partial file o f reports originally supplied on Friday,
8 October 1999. I also disclosed the file o f reports R1 to R l l from the
original South Yorkshire Police Enquiry into Hillsborough. I particularly
referred her to R8 PC1632 Keith Smith and pointed out that this was
actually a note by DS Mick Oughton after he had interviewed PC Smith,
giving a summary o f what he could say. I also disclosed a print out o f the
SYPol HOLMES action schedule from 17.04.89, which tasked DS Oughton
with interviewing 4 officers. I disclosed a copy o f the index to the SYPol
Reports R1 to R l l and the folder o f those reports.

In answer to a query by Ms Adlington about R48 from the West Mids Pol
Reports I disclosed S120 & S495, being identical statements by PC7048
Stephen Martin Foster, Merseyside Police. I also referred her to R65,
which was about the same officer and indicated that he had been
registered on the HOLMES system twice and given two nominals hence
the two differently numbered identical statements. The two entries had
later been merged.

A copy o f the S.Y.Fire Service original submission to LJT was supplied to
Ms Adlington.
Wednesday, 20 October, 1999.
All documentation from yesterday, Tuesday, 19 October 1999 was again

Provided her with a further copy o f the index to West Mids Pol Reports

I respect o f R103 - Complaint against Police and Ms Adlington’s request
for a copy o f the contemporaneous notes o f the interview with the officer
complained o f (PC1285 Smith) I refused disclosure on the grounds o f
irrelevancy to the Prosecution.

16.11.99 between Ms Adlington and myself, I refused to disclose to her
the Index o f Actions from the West Midlands Police, HOLMES Hillsborough
data base. My grounds for this decision were that the index, which
comprises over 8 60 0 different actions had no relevancy to the
Prosecution and its disclosure was not covered by the Court Order issued
by His Honour Judge Hooper.
I wrote with this decision on this date and also enclosed a copy o f the
schedule o f documents, statements, photographs and indices that I had
disclosed and copied to the Prosecutor.

                  Dear Ms Adlington

                  HILLSBOROUGH PRIVATE PROSECUTION - ADLINGTON v DUCKENFJELD
                  AND MURRAY

                  I write further to our telephone conversations on 14 January.

                  1 can confirm that I have now watched episodes 2 and 3 of the "Cracker" sleries
                  that you have provided. In both episodes, there are direct references to
                  Hillsborough. In the second episode the killer murders a policeman and iti the
                  third attempts to murder other policemen. In the third episode the killer steeks
                  to explain this (and his other murders) as in part revenge for Hillsborough and
                  the attitude of those in power to white working class people that it illustrates.
                  In the second episode, there are three references to the police responsibility for
                  events at Hillsborough:

                             (i)    During what I think can only be described as a “rant”, the killer,
                             referring to Hillsborough, says ‘The police killed 96 people*;

                            (ii)   During a scene at a police station, "Fitz”, after commenting that
                            the killer is intending to kill 96 people in revenge, says "If there is a n y
                            justice, most will be coppers”;

                            (iii) The killer, at one stage, says that his intention is     to kill a lk of

                 In the third episode, there arc two direct references to the police responsibility.
                 Both occur when the killer is being interviewed after having been caught, j

                           (i)    At one stage, the killer says that he is seeking revenge against “the
                           bizztes and the politicians";

                           (ii) The killer subsequently says that “The bizzies and bourgeois lefties
                           caused Hillsborough”.

                 The Solicitor General has reconsidered whether there is a sufficient basis on
                 which to seek injunctive relief against Channel 4 in respect of the broadcast of
                 episodes 2 and 3. He has concluded that the proposed broadcast would not
                 create a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the forthcoming trial arid he
                 will not, therefore, be commencing proceedings.

                 When we last spoke, on Friday last week, you indicated that, if the Solcitor
                 General were not to initiate proceedings, you would consider making an
                 application to Mr Justice Hooper yourself. If you deride to do so, I should be
                 grateful if you could notify me of the terms of the application.

                 I am copying this letter to Winckworth Sherwood, Walker Morris and to Mr
                 Pepin,

                 Yours sincerely,

                                to paragraph 3 o f the Code Crown Prosecutors in December 1987. The purpose of the amendment
                                                            was to reflect with even greater clarity the arrangements for the

                                    referred to the Criminal Law Revision Committee which subsequently'; 1
                                    recommended that provision be made to restore the law to its pre-l$i77
                                    position. Section 12(1) adopts that recommendation, and accordingly
                                    permits proseciitors to charge conspiracy to defraud at common law .
                                    notwithstanding that the defendant’s conduct might also amount to, or
                                    involve the commission o f a statutory conspiracy under Section 1 of the
                                     1977 Act or some other substantive offence. The Criminal 'Law
                                    Revision Committee also recommended, having regard to the width of
                                    the offence of conspiracy to defraud, that as a safeguard to defendants it
                                    would be appropriate for the Director to incorporate into the Code for
                                    Crown Prosecutors guidelines in general terms as to the circumstances
                                    in which, it would be appropriate to prefer a charge of conspiracy to
                                     defraud as opposed to a substantive offencc or a conspiracy to commit
                                     one. This suggestion was acceptcd and the guidance which now appears
                                    in paragraphs 13 to 17 of the Code was prepared.

                                            by means of Circular?. A complete reprinting of the Code is not

                                            Prosecutors will wish to satisfy themselves that confession
                                            evidence has been properly obtained and is not exposed to the
                                            suggestion of oppressive behaviour. In considering other evidence,
                                            Crown Prosecutors will need to consider1whether it has been
                                            obtained improperly and, if it may have been, whether a court
                                            might feel it right to exclude it on the grounds that its admission
                                            would have an adverse effect on che fairness of the proceedings.
                                            The possibility that certain evidence might be excluded should be
                                            taken into account when the sufficiency pf evidence to justify the
                                             proceedings is initially reviewed and, if it is crucial to die case,
                                            may substantially affect the decision whether or not to proceed.

                                           accused, or may be otherwise unreliable?

                                        , is. likely to be fit enough to stand his trial. The Crown
                                        1Prosecutor should have regard to any medical reports which
                                       ' have been -madd available by the defence solicitor and may

                                   (v) Mental illness or stress
                                        (a) Whenever die Crown Prosecutor is provided with a
                                        medical report to the effect chat an accused or a person under
                                        investigation is suffering from some form o f mental illness or
                                        psychiatric illness and that die strain of criminal proceedings
                                        may lead to a considerable worsening of his condition, such
                                        report should receive anxious consideration. This is a difficult
                                        field because in jsome instances the accused may have become
                                        mentally disturbed or depressed by the mere fact chat his
                                        misconduct has jbeen discovered and the Crown Prosecutor
                                        may be dubious about a prognosis that criminal proceedings
                                        will adversely affect his condition to a significant extent.
                                        Where, however, the Crown Prosecutor is satisfied that the
                                        probable effect upon the defendant's mental health outweighs
                                        the interests of justice in that particular case, he should not
                                        hesitate to discontinue proceedings. An independent medical
                                        examination may be sought, but should generally be reserved
                                        for cases of such gravity as plainly to require prosecution but
                                        for dear evidence that such a course would be likely to result

                                         accused mental state will, of course, be relevant in

                                      (vii) Complainant’s attitude :■        , ■
                                      In some cases it will be appropriate for the Crown Prosecutor to
                                      have regard to the attitude of a complainant who notified the
                                      police but later expresses a wish that no action be taken. It may be
                                      that in such circumstances proceedings need not be pursued unless
                                      cither there is suspicion that the change of heart was. actuated by
                                      fear or the offence was of some gravity.

                                      (viii) Peripheral defendants
                                      Where an allegation involves several accused, as a gejneral rule the
                                      Crown Prosecutor should have regard to the need to ensure that
                                      proceedings are continued only against those whose involvement
                                      goes to the heart of the issue to be placed before the Court. The
                                      inclusion of defendants on the fringe of die action and whose guilt
                                      in comparison with the principal offenders is minimal can lead to
                                      additional delay and cost, as well as unnecessarily clouding the
                                      essential features of the case.

                                 9. Finally, if, having weighed such of the above factors as may
                                 appertain to the case, the Crown Prosecutor is still in doubt as to
                                 whether proceedings are called for, he will throw into dip scales the
                                 attitude of the local community and any information about the
                                 prevalence of the particular offcnce in the area or nationally. Should
                                 doubt sail remain, the scales will normally be tipped in favour of
                                 prosecution as if the balance is so even, it could properly be said that
                                 the final arbiter must be the Court.

              Discontinuance      10. The use by the Crown Prosecutor of his power to terminate
                                 proceedings whether by using the procedure under Section 23 of the
                                 Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 or the continuing power to
                                 withdraw or offer no evidence, is in many ways the most visible
                                 demonstration of the Service’s fundamental commitment towards
                                 ensuring that only fit and proper cases are taken to trial, Unless, of
                                 course, advice has been given at a preliminary stage, the police decision
                                 to institute proceedings should never be met with passiv e acquiescencc
                                 but must always be the subjcct of review. Furthermore, the discretion
                                 to discontinue is a continuing one, and even when proceedings are
                                 under way Crown Prosecutors should continue to exercise their
                                 reviewing function. There may be occasions when time and other
                                 practical constraints limit the;depth' of the initial review of the case. It is
                                 important that cases should be kept undcr continuous review, not least
                                 because die emergence of evidence or information hitherto unknown to
                                 the'Crown Prosecutor may sometimes castvdoubt on the propriety of

Conspiracy to Committa Statutory Offence                        t'              • ,, i ,
13. The Practice Direction dated 9th May 1977 (1977) 2 ALL, ER 540
states that where an indictment 'contains counts alleging substantive
offences and a rdated conspiracy counts the prosecution must justity
the joinder or be required to elect to proceed on the substantive or
conspiracy counts.
14. Where substantive counts meet the justicc of the case a conspiracy
count will rarely need to be added but may be added where the
substantive counts do not represent the overall criminality of the case.
Where a Crown Prosecutor is proposing to lay a conspiracy count,
before doing so he should give consideration to the risk of the trial
being lengthy and complicated or otherwise causing unfairness to
defendants.

 Conspiracy to Defraud■
 15. The effect of K v Ayres (1984) AC 447 has been reversed by
 Section 12 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987. It also provides a
 maximum penalty for the offence of 10 years imprisonment. When any
 substantive offences are no more than steps in the achievemen o a
 dishonest objective it is open to Crown Prosecutors to concentrate
 upon that objective and to charge a single count of conspiracy to
 defraud. It may sometimes be appropriate to charge conspiracy to
 defraud where the object of the exercise was to swindle a large number
 of people and a conspiracy to commit a substantive offence is not
 appropriate and does not meet the justice of the case. Whcre^ however,
 the essencc of the offence is not really fraud at all, as m theft from
 shops or robbery, it would be wrong to charge conspiracy to de au
  relying upon the wide category of offences which might loosely indude
  an element of fraud-
                                i i
   J6 The offence is one which juries can readily understand and which
  enables justice to be done iix a class of case which is very injurious to
  the public at large. It, wm^pti normally be appropriate to useit in.
  relation to minor criminal cbn,duct.' Crown Prosecutors sho 1 , ., y
  exercise care to ensure that',the.offence is commensurate with the
  gravity of the charge.       / ' ■ ,
       17', Whether it is 'appropn&brta charge one or other form of conspiracy
       will depend on the particular facts of the case and trial judges may be
       expected to intervene to present injustices which might otherwise
       oceiir. During, the course of'the trial it may become apparent, for
       example, that the conspiracy to defraud alleged in the indictment could
       be put more straightforwardly to the jury as a case of obtaining by

                            21. There may be positive' advantages for the individual and for
                            socicty, in using prosecution as a last resort and in general there is in
                            the ease ofjuvenile offenders a much stronger presumption in favour of
                            methods of disposal which fall short of prosecution unless the ,
                            seriousness of the offence or other exceptional circumstances dictate
                            otherwise. The objective should be to divert juveniles from court
                            wherever possible. Prosecution should always be regarded as a, severe ,
                            step.             i

                             22. The Home Office has issued guidelines to the police on cautioning
                            juvenile offenders and on related decision making. Where the police are
                            unable to make an immediate decision to caution, the guidelines suggest
                            that there may be advantages in their seeking the advice and views of
                             other interested agencies, such as the Sodal Services Department, the
                             Probation Service and the Education Welfare Service, on whether to
                             caution or institute proceedings. Where the Crown Prosecutor dcddes
                             that the public interest does not require the institution or continuation
                             of proceedings against ajuvenile and it appears that there has been no
                             prior consultation, the Crown Prosecutor should consider whether to
                             ask the police to bring the circumstances of the individual’s
                             involvement to .the attention of the appropriate agcney. Crown
                             Prosecutors should be aware of the general arrangements and
                             procedures for inter-agency consultation in their areas and arc ,
                             encouraged to contribute dieir experience to the development arid
                            improvement of such arrangements. Crown Prosecutors must satisfy
                             themselves that the spirit of the Cautioning Guidelines has been applied
                             before continuing a prosecution instituted by the policc against, a
                            juvenile. The Crown Prosecutor should, taking account of the views of
                             all the agendcs concerned of which he is aware and having regard to
                             the Cautioning. Guidelines, refer back to the police any case where he •
                             considers that a: lesser disposal for example a caution would be an
                             adequate response and, in the final analysis, will not hesitate to exercise
                             his power to discontinue proceedings where he is satisfied that, ^
                             prosecution is not required in the public interest. When considering
                             whether or not to continue proceedings, the Crown Prosceutor should
                             have regard to the circumstances of 'any previous cautiotis the juvenile
                             may have boen.'given by the police. Where these are such as to indicate
                             that a less fornial disposal in respect, of the present offence wouldprove
                             inadequate, a prosecution will be appropriate. ,

                            23. It will never be right to prosecute a juvenile solely to-secure .access ■’
                            to the welfare powers .of the court. Where the Crown Prosecutor,thinks
                            that there may'be grounds for care proceedings; and that this might
                            better serve the public interest and welfare of the individual he should
                            invite the police to put this possibility to the local sodal services ^
                            authority.             "

                                      (ii) Jvilvemles charged with adults: A charge against a juvenile may
                                      be heard'in an adult Magistrates’ Court if an adult is charged at
                                      the1same time where either is charged with aiding, abetting, etc
                                      the other’s offence, or where the juvenile is charged with an
                                      offence arising out of circumstances which are the same as, or
                                      connected with, those giving rise to an offence with which the
                                      adult is charged at the same dine. There is also a discretion to
                                      commit for trial where the juvenile is charged with an indictable
                                       offence jointly with an adult and the Court considers it necessary
                                      in the interests of justice to commit them both for trial. In making
                                      representations as to venue in these circumstances, the prime task
                                       of the Crown Prosecutor will be to assist the Court in its judicial
                                       considerations.

                                In reaching his decision as to the mode of trial to be requested, the
                                 Crown Prosecutor will wish to take several factors into account. These
                                will include, for example, the respective ages of the adult and the
                                juvenile, the seriousness of the offence, the likely plea, whether there
                                are existing charges against the juveniles before the Juvenile Court and
                                the need to deal with the juvenile as expeditiously as possible consistent
                                with the interests of justice.

             Dear Sir,

             RE:         REGINA v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY


             In 1990, Mr. Birts QC was involved in the preparation of a joint opinion in relation to
             the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster. The other counsel was Mr. Gareth
             Williams QC (as he then was).

             As you may be aware, a private prosecution has been launched against Mr.
             Duckenfield and Mr. Murray, who were serving police officers at the time of the
             disaster. The CPS has been requested, by the private prosecutor, to waive privilege
             and disclose the joint opinion. This request has very recently been endorsed by the
             judge, Mr. Justice Hooper.

             As a matter of courtesy I write to inform you that CPS has waived privilege. We have
             sent a copy of the joint opinion to the judge to enable him to disclose it to the parties
             under such conditions as he may think appropriate. Lord Williams QC has also been
             informed of the position.



             Yours faithfully,

         Dear Ms Adlington,

         RE:         R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY


         Thank you for your letter of 10 January 2000 enclosing a copy of the letter to Mr.
         Newell. I was already aware of this, having received a copy of it on 7 January.

         The CPS has decided to waive privilege and I understand that a copy of the joint
         opinion either is being forwarded or has been forwarded to the judge.


         Yours sincerely,




         Christopher H. Enzor
         Head of York Division

     R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     In response to the letter of 7 January 2000 from Mr James Lewis, I enclose a copy of the Joint
     Opinion of Mr Gareth Williams QC (as he then was) and Mr Peter Birts QC, dated 6 August
     1990, concerning the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster. On behalf of the Crown
     Prosecution Service, I am content to waive any privilege that attaches to the Joint Opinion, to
     enable you to disclose it to the parties in the current prosecution of Messrs Duckenfield and
     Murray under such conditions as you may think appropriate.

     I note from Mr Lewis’ letter that you may wish to redact the Joint Opinion. I do not make
     any proposals in this context, save only to suggest that you may care to refer in particular to
     paragraphs 69-77 inclusive and 92-94 inclusive.

     I have consulted Lord Williams QC about my intention to disclose the Joint Opinion to you
     and he is content with that course of action. For the avoidance of any doubt, I should
     emphasise that I consulted Lord Williams in his capacity as a member of the Bar and joint
     author of the Opinion, rather than in his present capacity as HM Attorney General. As a
     matter of courtesy, I shall also ensure that Mr Peter Birts QC is informed of the disclosure.

     I have not written separately to Mr Lewis, nor to those representing Messrs Duckenfield and
     Murray.

                            it v Duckenfleld ana Murray. Leeds crown Court

         Dear Mr. Newell,

         we write with the consent of the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper and with the consent of
         all parties to this case, and to that effect Mr justice Hooper has authorised it to De
         written on his notepaper.

         The defendants have made appiicat££to stay the prosecution in this case on the basis
         that it amounts to an abuse of process of the court. The parties have made their
         submissions and Mr Justice Hooper has reserved his Judgement on the application.

         During submissions it became clear that the basis for the DPP's decision not to prosecute
         tne defendants taken on the 30'" of August 1990 maybe a material consideration for the
         court.

         Mr justice Hooper asked us to write to you and and reauest you to disclose the opinion
         of leading counsel, Lord Williams o,c., and Peter elrts o.c., dated the 6th of August 1990.
         in these circumstances we would ask you to disclose the opinion to his Lordship. It Is
         the intention of Mr justice Hooper further to disclose the opinion to all parties in this
         case, it is agreed between the parties that prior to this onward transmission to tne
         parties Mr justice Hooper may redact the opinion as he sees fit, perhaps with reference
         to the criminality of any other persons if such is disclosed.

         This is a matter of urgency,    Mr justice Hooper has indicated that the prosecution
         should have 48 hours to make any representations on the opinion and the defence 48
         hours thereafter for the same. Of course, the parties will try to improve upon this
         timetable as in any event Mr justice Hooper would like the opinion and the
         representations with him by Friday the i4mof January 2000.                      ^ .

         The opinion should be faxec^as soon as possible to the clerk to Mr justice Hoopay

         Yours sincerely,                                 ^   ^

     R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     In response to the letter of 7 January 2000 from Mr James Lewis, I enclose a copy of the Joint
     Opinion of Mr Gareth Williams QC (as he then was) and Mr Peter Birts QC, dated 6 August
     1990, concerning the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster. On behalf of the Crown
     Prosecution Service, I am content to waive any privilege that attaches to the Joint Opinion, to
     enable you to disclose it to the parties in the current prosecution of Messrs Duckenfield and
     Murray under such conditions as you may think appropriate.

     I note from Mr Lewis’ letter that you may wish to redact the Joint Opinion. I do not make
     any proposals in this context, save only to suggest that you may care to refer in particular to
     paragraphs 69-77 inclusive and 92-94 inclusive.

     I have consulted Lord Williams QC about my intention to disclose the Joint Opinion to you
     and he is content with that course of action. For the avoidance of any doubt, I should
     emphasise that I consulted Lord Williams in his capacity as a member of the Bar and joint
     author of the Opinion, rather than in his present capacity as HM Attorney General. As a
     matter of courtesy, I shall also ensure that Mr Peter Birts QC is informed of the disclosure.

     I have not written separately to Mr Lewis, nor to those representing Messrs Duckenfield and
     Murray.

     R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     For the avoidance of any doubt, I should state at once that I am writing to you in your
     personal capacity, as a member of the Bar formerly instructed by the Crown Prosecution
     Service, rather than in your capacity as Attorney General. This explains my style of address.

     I enclose a copy of a letter that I have received today from James Lewis, junior counsel for the
     prosecution in the current proceedings brought by Ms Ann Adlington, on behalf of the
     Hillsborough Family Support Group, against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, formerly of the
     South Yorkshire Police.

     You have, of course, distanced yourself from any involvement with the current proceedings.
     Inevitably, however, you will be well aware of the case; and in particular, you will clearly
     recall advising the then Director in a Joint Opinion in 1990, following which advice the
     Director reached his decision not to prosecute anyone for any criminal offence arising out of
     the Hillsborough tragedy.

     James Lewis’ letter is self-explanatory. I have not followed the abuse argument in court, but
     it is clear that the Judge is satisfied that the Joint Opinion may be relevant. The Judge has
     asked that I disclose to him a copy of the Joint Opinion, for him to consider appropriate
     onward disclosure to the parties.

     Assuming that legal professional privilege attaches to advice provided by counsel to the
     Crown Prosecution Service (from time to time, the contrary has been argued), it would be for
     the Crown Prosecution Service to waive the privilege. Nevertheless, on the rare occasions on
     which I consider disclosing counsel’s advice, it is my invariable practice to consult counsel
     and to invite any comments on my proposed course of action.
On the basis of James Lewis’ letter, the contents of which have been expressly approved by
the Judge, I would be minded to waive any privilege and disclose the Joint Opinion. In so
doing, I might draw to the Judge’s attention any passages that I think should be redacted; but I
should be content to leave the final decision on that to him. Before disclosing the document,
however, I should welcome any comment that you might care to make.

As is clear, the Opinion was the Joint Opinion of you and your junior, Peter Birts (now Peter
Birts QC). Not least because of the urgency of the Judge’s request, I have decided not to
approach Peter Birts separately for his comments. Subject to your views, and should the Joint
Opinion in due course be disclosed, I should arrange for him to be informed as a matter of
courtesy.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as is convenient. I am, of course, available on
Monday, should you wish to discuss the matter. If the Joint Opinion is to be disclosed, I can
arrange for a copy to be delivered to the Judge at the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday.

LONDON, EC1


                        R v Duckenfield and Murray. Leeds crown court

Dear Mr. Newell,

We write with the consent of the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper and with the consent of
all parties to this case, and to that effect Mr Justice Hooper has authorised it to be
written on his notepaper.

The defendants have made applica&te-to stay the prosecution in this case on the basis
that it amounts to an abuse of process of the court. The parties have made their
submissions and Mr Justice Hooper has reserved his judgement on the application.

During submissions it became clear that the basis for the DPP's decision not to prosecute
the defendants taken on the 30thof August 1990 maybe a material consideration for the
court.

Mr Justice Hooper asked us to write to you and and request you to disclose the opinion
of leading counsel, Lord Williams Q.C., and Peter Birts Q.C., dated the 6tft of August 1990.
In these circumstances we would ask you to disclose the opinion to his Lordship, it is
the intention of Mr justice Hooper further to disclose the opinion to all parties in this
case, it is agreed between the parties that prior to this onward transmission to the
parties Mr Justice Hooper may redact the opinion as he sees fit, perhaps with reference
to the criminality of any other persons if such is disclosed.

This is a matter o f urgency.   Mr justice Hooper has indicated that the prosecution
should have 48 hours to make any representations on the opinion and the defence 48
hours thereafter for the same. Of course, the parties will try to improve upon this
timetable as in any event Mr Justice Hooper would like the opinion and the
representations with him by Friday the 14* of January 2000.             ^    ^ -r-
                                  ^                                                                ^   f       '

The opinion should be faxec^as soon as possible to the clerk to Mr Justice Hoop&C™^
                                                          fa ^                   A* -

     R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     For the avoidance of any doubt, I should state at once that I am writing to you in your
     personal capacity, as a member of the Bar formerly instructed by the Crown Prosecution
     Service, rather than in your capacity as Attorney General. This explains my style of address.

     I enclose a copy of a letter that I have received today from James Lewis, junior counsel for the
     prosecution in the current proceedings brought by Ms Ann Adlington, on behalf of the
     Hillsborough Family Support Group, against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, formerly of the
     South Yorkshire Police.

     You have, of course, distanced yourself from any involvement with the current proceedings.
     Inevitably, however, you will be well aware of the case; and in particular, you will clearly
     recall advising the then Director in a Joint Opinion in 1990, following which advice the
     Director reached his decision not to prosecute anyone for any criminal offence arising out of
     the Hillsborough tragedy.

     James Lewis’ letter is self-explanatory. I have not followed the abuse argument in court, but
     it is clear that the Judge is satisfied that the Joint Opinion may be relevant. The Judge has
     asked that I disclose to him a copy of the Joint Opinion, for him to consider appropriate
     onward disclosure to the parties.

     Assuming that legal professional privilege attaches to advice provided by counsel to the
     Crown Prosecution Service (from time to time, the contrary has been argued), it would be for
     the Crown Prosecution Service to waive the privilege. Nevertheless, on the rare occasions on
     which I consider disclosing counsel’s advice, it is my invariable practice to consult counsel
     and to invite any comments on my proposed course of action.
On the basis of James Lewis’ letter, the contents of which have been expressly approved by
the Judge, I would be minded to waive any privilege and disclose the Joint Opinion. In so
doing, I might draw to the Judge’s attention any passages that I think should be redacted; but I
should be content to leave the final decision on that to him. Before disclosing the document,
however, I should welcome any comment that you might care to make.

As is clear, the Opinion was the Joint Opinion of you and your junior, Peter Birts (now Peter
Birts QC). Not least because of the urgency of the Judge’s request, I have decided not to
approach Peter Birts separately for his comments. Subject to your views, and should the Joint
Opinion in due course be disclosed, I should arrange for him to be informed as a matter of
courtesy.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as is convenient. I am, of course, available on
Monday, should you wish to discuss the matter. If the Joint Opinion is to be disclosed, I can
arrange for a copy to be delivered to the Judge at the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday.

                   7 January, 2000

                   Mr. Christopher Newell,
                   Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions,
                   50, Ludgate Hill,
                   LONDON, EC1


                                             R v DuckenffeW and Murray, Leeds crown court

                   Dear Mr. Newell,

                   We write with the consent of the Honourable Mr Justice Hoooer and with the consent of
                   all parties to this case, and to that effect Mr Justice Hooper has authorised it to be
                   written On his notepaper.
                                                                             £w
                   The defendants have made applicattsLto stay the prosecution in this case on the basis
                   that it amounts to an abuse of process of the court. The parties have made their
                   submissions and Mr justice Hooper has reserved his judgement on the application.

                   During submissions it became clear that the basis for the DPP's decision not to prosecute
                   the defendants taken on the 3(P of August 1990 maybe a material consideration for the
                   court.

                   Mr Justice Hooper asked us to write to you and and request you to disclose the opinion
                   of leading counsel. Lord Williams Q.C., and Peter Birts Q.C., dated the 6tn of August 1990.
                   In these circumstances we would ask you to disclose the opinion to his Lordship, it is
                   the intention of Mr justice Hooper further to disclose the opinion to all parties in this
                   case,   it is agreed between the parties that prior to this onward transmission to the
                   parties Mr justice Hooper mav redact the opinion as he sees fit, perhaps with reference
                   to the criminality of any other persons if such is disclosed.

                   This is a matter of urgency.    Mr justice Hooper has indicated that the prosecution
                   should have 48 hours to make any representations on the opinion and the defence 48
                   hours thereafter for the same. Of course, the parties will try to improve upon this
                   timetable as in any event Mr Justice Hooper would like the opinion and the
                   representations with him by Friday the 14th of January 2000.            ,    ^ ^

                   The opinion should be faxed^as soon as possible to the clerk to Mr Justice H o o p e & ^

                   Yours sincerely,                                           V *                  & ^

                  Dear Mr. Newell,

                  Wfe write with the consent of the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper and with the consent of
                  all parties to this case, and to that effect Mr Justice Hooper has authorised It to be
                  written on his notepaper.
                                                               £w
                  The defendants have made appltcatte~to stay the prosecution in this case on the basis
                  that it amounts to an abuse of process of the court* The parties have made their
                  submissions and Mr Justice Hooper has reserved his judgement on the application.

                  During submissions it became clear that the basis for the DPP's decision not to prosecute
                  the defendants taken on the 30“ of August 1990 maybe a material consideration for the
                  court.

                  Mr justice Hooper asked us to write to you and and request you to disclose the opinion
                  of leading counsel Lord Williams Q.c., and Peter Blrts Q.C., dated the 6Ih of August 1990.
                  In these circumstances we would ask you to disclose the opinion to his lordship. It is
                  the intention of Mr justice Hooper further to disclose the opinion to all parties in this
                  case, it is agreed between the parties that prior to this onward transmission to the
                  parties Mr Justice Hooper may redact the opinion as he sees fit, perhaps with reference
                  to the criminality of any other persons if such is disclosed.

                  This is a matter of urgency.    Mr Justice Hooper has Indicated that the prosecution
                  should have 48 hours to make any representations on the opinion and the defence 48
                  hours thereafter for the same. Of course, the parties will try to improve upon this
                  timetable as in any event Mr Justice Hooper would like the opinion and the
                  representations with him by Friday the 14* of January 2000.                  gc< T -

                                     R v. Duckenfield and. Murray


                         Skeleton Argument o f the Crown on Abuse o f Process


      1     The skeleton arguments o f the defence are similar to those presented at the Leeds
             Magistrates Court, but the serious criticisms made o f the prosecution's motives and
             objectivity appear to have been withdrawn..

      2     Accordingly the Crown relies on the arguments and written materials presented
            below, and submitted again in files to the court on 16th or 17th December.

      3     The m edia bundle relied upon by Walker Morris has not been served.

      4     A CD has been supplied this week to the Crown by South Yorkshire police after many
             technical and other delays. It contains thousands of statements. Reliance may be
             placed on 4‘" January on new material revealed.

      5     Reliance may also be placed on evidence given in court in the week o f 2Q,•,, December
             1999.

                                                                         James Lewis
                       R v Duckenfield and Murray

          Further subm issions on behalf of the Defendants


1. When analysed ECKLE demonstrates that if a breach of Article 6

  occurs reparation can include a reduction of sentence awarded by a

  national court.


2. In ECKLE no breach of Article 6 had been found by the Courts in

   Germany. Hence reparation was to be agreed under article 50 between

   the parties. See para. 96.


3. It does not appear that it is unlawful in Germany to act in a way

   which is incompatible with a convention right. The law is only that the

   convention is “an integral part of the law.” See para 67.


4. The distinction is that in Germany if a Convention right is breached

   the victim would be entitled to reparation and /o r damages. Damages

   being a frequent method of affording reparation in the ECHR.


5. In England the Human Rights Act goes further. It does not just

   incorporate the Convention rights into our law (s 1 (2) of the Act) but

   under s 6 it m akes it unlawful to act in a way incompatible with a

   compatible right.


6. The Convention “right” is a right to trial within a reasonable time,

   nothing by way of monetary damages and /or reduction of sentence

   removes the Convention right it only ameliorates the consequences of

   the breach. The breach still remains a breach. There is a fundamental

   distinction between the action of a court taken to protect/uphold the




                                    1
Jl



     right and the action of a court taken to com pensate the victim of a

     breach for the effects of the breach.


7. Therefore a trial after a promise of a non-custodial sentence (if

     convicted) is still a trial not within a reasonable time.


8. The holding of su ch a trial is unlawful under s 6 because the judge

     would be acting in a way incompatible with a convention right.


9. Section 8 only becom es relevant if (a) in relation to an act which the

     court finds unlawful or (b) a “proposed” act which the court finds

     would be unlawful.


 10.In considering the first possibility: it is clearly possible for the Court

     of Appeal to find a breach of Article 6 where the trial court has not

     found one (indeed the delay in the appellate process may amount to

     the breach). In this situation the court could grant relief including

     mitigation of sentence.


 11. In considering the second possibility: this envisages the identification

     of a breach prior to the trial. In this situation the grant of such relief

     or remedy m ust be subject to the overriding provision of s 6 and the

     relief or remedy consistent with it. In this case this can only be a stay

     of proceedings. In a civil case different remedies may exist.

    A P PL IC AT ICS

    1:1    Application         is mc.ee to      stay   zr.e   proceedings     on

    the    ground      that     the continued      prosecution       of     the

    defendant is in contravention of his rights to a fair

    trial under Article 6 of E.C.H.R.                  and is oppressive.




    1:2    Further grounds are being submitted on behalf of

    Murray     and     these are adopted         in    advance    and     relied

    upon     insofar      asthey      also        have        application     to

    Duckenfield.




    ARTICLE 6


    2:1    Under       Article     6 of   the    European      Convention     on

    Human Rights provides

                                           1
          "In    the   determination                  of   his     civil    rights       and

          obligations,        or     of       any      criminal       charge    against

          him,    everyone      is      entitled to               a fair    and public

          hearing       within            a       reasonable           time        by        an

          independent and impartial tribunal established by

          law




2:2       The    failure      to proceed to a                     determination         of    a

criminal         charge       "within             a     reasonable         time"        is     a

fundamental            breach      of         a       person?      human    ■rights          as

protected by the convention.




2:3       The European         Court          has      recognised that         criminal

proceedings have by their nature an urgency that does

not apply to a civil dispute and recognises that what

is    a    "reasonable time"                  must be        examined       against          the

background and circumstances of the case.




2:4       A      "reasonable            time"              runs      from      when           an

investigation            of     the       suspect           begins      and    embraces

"preliminary investigations".




                                                  2




                                                                                                   2
2:5    Two requirements need to exist under European law

before time begins to run, first a suspected crime and

secondly   a    suspect       informed          and    aware       he    is   under

suspicion.




2:6    Hence no breach of Article 6 exists where a crime

is discovered after           the     lapse of many            years       (as   for

example in cases of suspected child abuse).




2:7    Likewise the trial of alleged war crirt; r.als from

the    Second World         War does       not    involve      any breach           of

Article    6    if    the    suspect        has       not   been        traced   and

informed that he was under investigation.




2:8    However       once    you    have    a     suspected        crime      and    a

suspect informed that he is under investigation then

time begins to run for the purpose of Article 6.




 2:9   Unlike        the    common        law     relating      to       abuse      of

process    the       question        of    any        actual    prejudice           is

 irrelevant under Article 6.
2:10 Case     law    has     evolved    under     the    continental

system,    quite different from the adversarial                  system

and the investigation is frequently over-seen by the

court. .




2:11 Time beings to run once there is a nexus between

the suspected crime and someone who is aware they are

being investigated.           If someone were Been only as a

potential witness then time would not run.




2:12 Once time begins to run then it cannot thereafter

cease and restart at a later time.                This proposition

advanced     by     the    prosecutor   at    committal     is,      with

respect, misconceived and not supported by authority.

Furthermore         it     would   seriously        undermine         the

protection afforded to the citizen by Article 6.




 2:13 It is submitted that time began to run in the

 case   of Duckenfield when         he was made         aware    of the

police      investigation       into    the     disaster,       it   must

 certainly have been running when he was interviewed

 under caution on 3rd July 1990 by which time he must

 have been a suspect of a suspected crime.

2:14 In determining when the time period begins to run

for the purposes of Article                      6 the European Court has

frequently taken the date of arrest or the date when

a warrant was             issued.     In an investigative system of

criminal    justice this will occur at an earlier                               stage

than    under       the    English    adversarial             system where        the

"examining magistrate" will not interview suspects nor

direct the investigation.




2:15 The position o f a private rrosecutor as permitted

under     English           state     law        has       not    hitherto       been

considered          by    the   Court.          It    is    submitted     that    the

"reasonable           time"       must begin          by    reference      to     the

position       of     the    accused not the               prosecutor     and that

the    State    is obliged to              ensure      that      an    individual's

human rights are not violated by a private prosecutor.




2:16 It    is       submitted        that       the    delay      in   prosecuting

Duckenfield          is    such     that    it       amounts     to    a breach    of

Article 6.

     2:17 The    British        Government         has     signed       but    not

     valuable guide to the court in assessing whether the

     proceedings     amount      to   an    abuse    of     process      and   has

     significant persuasive value.                 Furthermore the courts

     OPPRESSION

     3:1     The power to stay proceedings includes a power to

     safeguard an accused person from oppression.                        This has

     been described as "something so unfair and wrong that

     the     court should not allow a prosecutor to proceed

     with     what   is    in     all      other     respects       a    regular

     proceeding" Hui Chi-Mincr v R. 1992 1 A.C. 3 4 .

                                                                                       6
3:2     It    is   submitted          that        the      prosecution          of

Duckenfield is oppressive for the following reasons.

        (a)   The prosecution reflects a refusal                          on the

part of those responsible                  for bringing the              case to

accept the decisions of various                      investigations            into

the   tragedy      including         the   verdict         of    the    coroners

jury.

        (b)    Delay     on    the    part    of     the    prosecution          ir.

bringing the case.




3:3     Following the tragedy at Hillsborough a Public

Inquiry was set up under Lord Taylor which produced an

interim report in August 1989 and a final report in

January 1990.          Duckenfield gave evidence before the

Inquiry on the 24th and 25th May 1989.




3:4     Thereafter       the    D.P.P.        instructed          two    Queen's

Counsel to advise if any criminal proceedings should

be    brought      against      anyone       in    connection           with    the


disaster.           The       advice         tendered           was     that     no

prosecutions        be    brought.            This      decision        included

consideration of the position of Duckenfield.
3:5     The coroners court conducted a lengthy inquest at

which Duckenfield gave evidence on the 12th and 13th

March    1991.        The    verdict     of   the   jury   was    one    of

accidental death.




3:6     An   attempt        to   overturn     the   verdict       of    the

coroners court in the Divisional Court failed.




3:7     On the 30th June 1997 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith

was appointed to conduct a Scrutiny into whether there

was any fresh evidence which might have a bearing on

the various       legal procedures and decisions that had

been taken.       The Scrutiny was established, at least in

part, as a result of pressure by the prosecution who

made allegations that were found on examination to be

 unfounded       of   fresh      evidence     and   interference        with

 witnesses.




 3:8     His report in February 1998 concluded that :

         "I have come to the clear conclusion that there

         is no basis upon which there should be a further

         Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's

         Inquiry.           There   is   no   basis    for    a   renewal
      application to the Divisional Court or for the

      Attorney General to exercise his powers under the

       Coroners Act 1988.                  I do not consider that there

       is. any material which Bhould be put before the

       Director         of    Public       Prosecutions          or    the    Police

       Complaints Authority which might                          cause them to

       reconsider            the     decisions        they        have       already

       taken."




3:9    Consequent upon the receipt of the report of the

Scrutiny conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith the

Secretary of State for the Home Department                                 (Mr. Jack

Straw) informed the House of Commons                         :

        "My Right Honourable Friend the Attorney-General,

        the Director of Public Prosecutions                             and I have

        had     to      consider       Lord        Justice       Stuart-Smith's

        report .... we accept its conclusions."                              (Hansard

        18th February 1998 p.1089).




3:10 It       is        submitted           that     the     prosecution           of

Duckenfield          against         the    background       of       10   years   of

investigation and scrutiny is oppressive.                               It reflects

a     refusal      by        those    responsible          for        bringing     the
prosecution to recognise and accept the conclusions of

the Inquiry and Scrutiny, the verdict of the coroners

court, the judgement of the Divisional Court and the

decision of the D.P.P.




3:11 The position of Duckenfield is, it is submitted,

unique, no other defendant will have been subjected to

such a level of public and judicial scrutiny and at

the   same    time       analysis    by   the        media    prior    to       the

commencement of criminal proceedings.




3:12 It is submitted that the essential                          criminality

alleged      by    the     prosecution          is    the     same    as    that

investigated        in the earlier          Inquiry          and to found a

criminal trial upon such a basis would test both the

public's      confidence        in   and        the    integrity       of       the

 system.




 3:13 While       no     authority   exists          that    reproduces         the

 unique    factual        position      facing         Duckenfield         it    is

 submitted        that    two   lines      of        authority       assist      in

 identifying the legal principles to be applied.




                                     10



                                                                                      10
THE   REFUSAL TO  ACCEPT  EARLIER  CONCLUSIONS  AND
DECISIONS FROM PUBLIC INQUIRIES. CORONERS COURT AND
THE D .P »P .

4:1   The principles which led the court to stay the

trial of Maxwell, Trachtenberg and Fuller (unreported

transcript enclosed) included an appreciation of

      "fairness to the defendants.        I have mentioned

      the time that these criminal proceedings would

      have been hanging over their heads in the event

      of a further trial, at least five years"

and an acknowledgement that

      “it would be very likely to appear to the public

      that the authorities were not prepared to accept

      the   verdict   of   a   jury and were   determined   to

      pursue the defendant at whatever cost to the ....

      disruption of the Defendant's personal life."




4:2   Having had the benefit of two separate decisions

by the D.P.P. not to prosecute one in the autumn of

 1990 and one in February 1998 it is an abuse of the

procesB of the court to now prosecute on essentially

 the same evidence as existed in 1990.
4:3    For the Crown to prosecute after a defendant has

been informed that a trial will not be proceeded with

has been held to be an abuse in some circumstances.

        , R. v. Croydon J.J. ex parte Dean 9 8 C.A.R. 7 6

               R. v. Townsend & Others 1997 2 C.A.R. 540

A.G. of Trinidad and Tobaao v Phillip 1995 1 A.C. 396

                        R. v. Bloomfield 1997 1 C.A.R. 35




4:4    It must be a question of fact and degree whether

a private prosecution amounts to en abuse of process

after a decision by the D.P.P.               not to prosecute has

been communicated to a suspect.              Clearly if a decision

to prosecute privately is made immediately after the

decision by the D.P.P.          it will be more difficult to

 establish abuse because the effect would be to fetter

 the right of a private individual to prosecute when

 the State declines.         Where however nine years elapses

 between   the    two   decisions         then   tfre      existence   of

 unfairness can be presumed.




 4:5    This   is particularly           so where    the    decision    to

 prosecute     is not made on any fresh evidence but is

 essentially     made   on    the   material        available    to    the

                                    12




                                                                             12
Taylor Inquiry.         Indeed the Scrutiny concluded that

       "none of the evidence           I was       asked    to    consider

       added anything significant to the evidence which

       wa>s available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry or to the

        Inquests."




DELAY

5:1     The second line of relevant authorities concerns

the delay       in bringing these proceedings                of    some   10

years.




 5:2    A distinction        needs   to be drawn between             cases

where     the    essential    evidence       was    not    known    to    the

 prosecution until many years after the alleged crime,

 examples       are   frequently     found    in    cases    of    alleged

 child abuse and cases where the essential evidence was

 available but no decision to prosecute was made.




 5:3    In this case the prosecution were aware of the

 essential       evidence    in the    case    at    the    time    of    the

 original decision by the D.P.P.               not to prosecute in

 the autumn of 1990 but, it must be assumed, elected to

 seek to persuade the coroners jury to return a verdict
of    unlawful    killing       rather        than     institute         criminal

proceedings against the defendant then.                            Furthermore

after the appeal to the Divisional                           Court   failed      in

1993 it; must be assumed again that a decision not to

prosecute        was    made.            It     is     observed      that       the

prosecutor has had the advantage of professional legal

advice throughout.




5:4     The resultant delay is comparable with that in

the A.G. for Trinidad and Tobago v. Charles, Carter &

Carter (unreported transcript enclosed^ where a delay

of     eleven     years       was    held        to     be     "on   any        view

considerable and disturbing."                        In the event the Privy

Council       held     that    the       combination          of   two    factors

namely the delay and the fact it was a third trial

caused the prosecution to become "wrong in principle

and constitute a misuse of the criminal process."




 5:5    The     delay     in     the          case     of     Duckenfield         is

 comparable to that in the case of Charles and OtherB

 and the effect of having been tried three times can be

 compared     vfith having          to    undergo       the    strain      of    the

 Inquiry, Inquest and Scrutiny.

                                         14




                                                                                       14
5:6   Although some of the evidence is unaffected by

the passage of time including that             recorded by the

video    cameras    in   the   stadium   the   evidence    of   the

witnesses will inevitably be adversely affected.




5:7     In the judgement of the Divisional Court McCowan

L.J. recognised the difficulty of witnesses

        "who would have to come along 5 years later and

        try to cast their minds back to events that they

        must have been trying to forget.”




        At   the   Scrutiny    some   eight    years    after   the

disaster the eye witnesses called were                 found to be

unreliable, vague and confused and although evidence

was given in "good faith" ........ . "cannot be relied

upon.*




        This conclusion is hardly surprising in view of

the time span involved and the trauma of the events.




        This trauma applies equally to Duckenfield.
5:8   It is submitted that the court can infer that the

delay in this case will inevitably adversely affect

the ability of everyone to recollect accurately the

events* of the afternoon.          Another real danger is that

the perceived recollection of witnesses may have been

influenced unconsciously by the intemperate and wholly

inaccurate media coverage of the police role in the

disaster.




5:9   Such is the time lapse between the disaster and

the   committal     that    the    witnesses     Guest,   Lang   and

Creaser     have   died    and    three   of   the   remaining   four

police officers whose statements were served prior to

committal cannot be traced.




      It is submitted that the continued prosecution of

the defendant violates his rights under Article 6 and

is oppressive.

   A                                                  RULI NG


        MR JUSTICE HOOPER: I first of all give my reasons for the ruling I made on

        Monday.
   B
              Mr Clegg QC, objects to the admissibility of answers given by the defendant,

        Mr Duckenfield, to the Taylor Inquiry and to the statem ent in w riting made by him

        to the Inquiry. He submits that the evidence is inadmissible on the grounds of

   C public policy at common law. A t the conclusion of the submission, I ruled against

        it.    That submission was heard before a number of other submissions, also

        concerning the admissibility of this evidence. Had this first submission succeeded,

   £) then witnesses would not have needed to come to court. Mr Clegg's submissions

        are set out in paragraphs 2.4, 2.5, and the first sentence of 2.6, w hich I now cite.

                 "2 .4 The Taylor Inquiry was established w ith the follow ing terms of
                 reference

    E                      'To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday
                           football ground on 15th April 1989 and to make
                           recommendations about the need of crow d control and
                           safety at sports events.

                 2.5 It is axiomatic that in the circumstances of the Hillsborough
    p            Disaster it was in the wider public interest that all witnesses should
                 be free to give their evidence w ith candour and that the overriding
                 public interest in seeking to prevent a possible recurrence of the
                 disaster far outweighed the interests of the prosecutor in this trial.

                 2.6 Were evidence given by witnesses to such an Inquiry to be
                 admissible against them in criminal proceedings then one of the prime
                 objectives of the inquiry m ight be eliminated."

        If there was such a public policy rule, then it would apply to any subsequent civil



                                                         1

        '        and criminal proceedings. I asked Mr Clegg whether the rule of public policy would
        W
                 apply if a witness had been reminded of the privilege against self-incrimination and
            A
                 had continued to give evidence upon which the prosecution wished to rely at some

                 subsequent trial. He seemed to accept the rule of public policy would not preclude

                 the admission of that evidence. The only authority to w hich Mr Clegg could point
            B
                 w as a passage in a decision of Mr Justice Turner in a case called Alcindor and

                 O th e rs, a decision he gave at the Old Bailey on 11th June of 1990. That case

                 involved the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in Zeebrugge harbour on 6th

            C March        of 1987 and the manslaughter charges that arose out of it. Shortly after

                 the sinking an Inquiry was opened under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping

                 A ct.      That Inquiry concluded w ith the publication of the report.              Police

            D investigations subsequently started in December 1987.              It was unsuccessfully

                 submitted on the part of all of the defendants that the prosecution was an abuse

                 of process. During his ruling, Mr Justice Turner said,

                          "It should of course be stated that if a public inquiry is to fulfil the
            E            reasonable expectations of those w ho have caused it to be set up,
                          and indeed the legitimate expectations of the wider public, that the
                          candour in the witnesses w ho are called to give their evidence is to
                          be encouraged. If witnesses, or potential witnesses are conscious
                          tha t w h a t they may say at an Inquiry may subsequently be used
                          against them one of the prime objectives of the Inquiry might be
             p           eliminated, either by the witnesses withholding that required candour
                          or alternatively by not coming forward in the first instance."

                 I was told that subsequently the prosecution decided not to reiy upon the answers

                 given by defendants to the Inquiry.

                    Mr Jones QC, for the prosecution, w ho appeared in that case, told me that the

                 case against the defendants come to an end part w ay through the prosecution



                                                               2

^        case and before the time at w hich any such answers w ould have been put into

         evidence. It seems clear that the passage is obiter and it must be doubtful whether
    A
         or not the matter was fully argued.            Indeed, on page 23 of the transcript of the

         decision, there is a reference to the fact that Mr. Carman QC might advance in the

         future an argument that the admissions made in the course of the formal
    B
         investigation should be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal

         Evidence A ct 1 984.

            Mr Jones in his skeleton argument opposes the submission made by Mr Clegg.

    c He draws my attention to the fact that both in the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, being

         conducted under the Chairmanship of Lord Saville of Moodigate and in the

         Lawrence Inquiry, under the Chairmanship of Sir William Macpherson of Clooney,

    D the witnesses were given an undertaking that their evidence w ould not be used

         to their prejudice in any criminal proceedings, other than for perjury.          Mr Jones

         submits that no such undertaking w ould be necessary if Mr Clegg was right.

             I agree w ith that submission. Although Mr Clegg drew my attention to cases
    E
         concerned w ith the privilege against self-incrimination, I do not see how they help

         in deciding the issue as to w hether or not it would be against public policy to

         permit any answers given during an Inquiry to be used in subsequent civil or
     F
         criminal proceedings. Reluctant as I am to depart from anything said by Mr Justice

         Turner, albeit obiter, I am firm ly of the vie w there is no such rule of public policy

         as that for w hich Mr Clegg argued.

     G
              I n o w give my reasons for the ruling I announced late yesterday afternoon,

         namely that the statem ent made by



                                                          3

     Mr Duckenfield for the purposes of the Inquiry and the answers to questions put

     to him during the Inquiry, are in principle admissible, subject to any further
A
     argument as to that part of the answers which underpins count 5 and relates to

     an alleged lie.          I shall deal w ith that matter, if it is necessary to do so when I

     consider the validity of count 5. That will only arise should the application to stay
B
     the proceedings on the ground of abuse, which I’ m hearing starting on 4th

     January, should fail.

        Mr Clegg submits that a statement made by Mr Duckenfield on about 5th May

C of 1989 and the answers he gave, starting on 24th May of 1989 at the Inquiry

     into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, are inadmissible by virtue of section 78 of

     the Police and Criminal Evidence A ct 1984. Section 78 provides,

£)            "(1) In any proceedings the Court may refuse to allow evidence on
              which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the
              Court that, having regard to all the circumstances in w hich the
              evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence w ould have
              such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the
              Court ought not to admit it."

E
     The defence having put before me sufficient credible evidence to raise an

     argument that the admissibility of the evidence would be unfair, I approach the

     issue on the basis that the prosecution must satisfy me on the balance of
 F
     probabilities that the admission of the evidence would not have such an adverse

     effect. I add that in any event I w ould have reached the same conclusion had the

     burden been the higher one of being sure.

         During the trial w ithin a trial I heard oral evidence from three witnesses: David

     Brummel (whose witness statement will be found at tab 12, of the bundle entitled,



                                                      4

    'D efendant’ s skeleton submissions and witness statements re admissibility and

    related docum ents'); Sir A ndrew Collins (who was leading counsel to the Inquiry
A
    and is now a High Court Judge, tab 9); and Mr William Charles W oodward QC

    (w ho was counsel to the South Yorkshire Police in the Inquiry, tab 10).                            Mr

    Duckenfield            chose        not to         give   evidence.   Mr   Duckenfield   was   a Chief
B
    Superintendent at the time and was in overall charge of the policing on the day.

    He had

    become a police officer in 1960.

C            Mr Jones QC, for the prosecution, sought to put into evidence three

    documents. For reasons which I have separately given, I ruled that that evidence

    was inadmissible in the form in w hich he wished to put it before the Court.

D         I start w ith the statement made on or about 5th May of 1989. Following the

    disaster on 1 5th April of 1989, Lord Justice Taylor was asked to preside over the

    Inquiry. He was assisted by the West Midlands Police. Understandably, everything

    was done extremely quickly at that stage. The Inquiry opened on 1 5th May, one
E
    month after the disaster. On the evidence which I have heard, it appears that Mr

    Duckenfield handed the statement to the West Midlands Police. That police force

    then handed it to the Treasury Solicitor, w ho provided it to Mr Collins, as he then
F
    w as, to help him in the preparation of his opening.                       Sir A ndrew said that in his

    opinion, having regard to the contents of the statement and the circumstances at

    the time, Mr Duckenfield probably prepared the statement himself w ith o u t legal

    advice.        I shall so assume.                 It is submitted by Mr Clegg that in the absence of a

    solicitor, in the presumed absence of any warning against self-incrimination and



                                                                  5

     bearing in mind the passage of

     Mr Justice Turner in the Herald of Free Enterprise case, to w hich I made reference
A
     in my earlier ruling, the admission of this evidence w ould have such an adverse

     effect on the fairness of the proceedings that I ought not to admit it.

         Bearing in mind tha t Mr Duckenfield was a very experienced and senior police
B
     officer when he made this witness statement, and must have known w hat use

     could be made of it, I can see no justification at all for saying that its admission

     would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that I ought

c not to admit it.

           I turn to the answers w hich he gave before Lord Justice Taylor.                   Mr Clegg

     makes a number of submissions, which are helpfully summarised in paragraph 3.2

D and fo llo w in g of his skeleton argument.                        He submits first that, amongst the

     fo llo w in g factors w hich he says are relevant is (1) the defendant was not

     represented at the Inquiry.                       Mr W oodward QC represented the South Yorkshire

     police, not any individual officer: "M y approach from the outset was that David
E
     Duckenfield and Bernard Murray were simply witnesses and not my clients." The

     passage, as cited by Mr Clegg, comes from the w itness statement of Mr

     W oodward.            It seems clear that both Mr Collins and Lord Justice Taylor thought
F
     that Mr Woodward was representing the police officers. The evidence for that can

     be found in the w itness statement of Mr Justice Collins at tab 9 at page 389. In

     paragraph 3 will be found these words, "throughout the course of the Inquiry there

G
     was no doubt in my mind, and I'm sure Lord Justice Taylor shared this view , that

     the police both as a Force and individual officers, were represented by Mr



                                                                6

    Woodward QC, instructed by Hammond Suddards.” A reference can also be made

    to the transcript for the first day, namely, 1 5th May. On that first day submissions
A
    were being made by Mr Brown QC regarding the possible representations of the

    Police Federation.             Lord Justice Taylor, at page tab 9, page 398, asked whether

    he thought there was going to be a conflict of interests between the Federation
B
    and the South Yorkshire Police, to w hich Mr. Brown said he simply did not know.

    Lord Justice Taylor w e n t on to say,               "M y approach has been that when

    applications were made last month that I w ould always be open to further

C applications if the evidence w ent in a w ay w hich suggested som ebody's interests

    ought to be represented and was not being up until then. I'm reluctant to allow

    representation, as it were, on the speculative chance that there might develop a

D c o n flic t."      In tab 9, page 40 2, Lord Justice Taylor, according to the transcript,

    asked M r W oodw ard w hether he saw any conflict as at present, to which Mr

    W ood w a rd replied, "I rose because of the w ording in the letter suggesting that

    there might be. It seems to be not on the horizon at the m om ent." That reference
E
    to the letter there is, I assume, a reference to w h a t has been called in this hearing

    'the Salmon Letter’ to w hich I shall return.          I shall come back to this topic later.

    Mr Clegg submits that another relevant factor in support of his submission that the
F
    evidence ought to be excluded was, "He was not sent a Salmon letter and was not

    sent a copy of the one sent to the police." The Salmon principles are helpfully set

    out in the skeleton argument submitted by the prosecution. The relevant principles
Q
    are 2 to 6 and read as follow s:

              2. Before any person w ho is involved in an inquiry is called as a
              w itn e ss he should be informed of any allegations w hich are made
D.L. S ELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




             against him and the substance of the evidence in support of them.

              3. (a) He should be given an adequate opportunity of preparing his
A            case and of being assisted by legal advisers.
                 (b) His legal expenses should normally be met out of public funds.

             4. He should have the opportunity of being examined by his own
             solicitor or counsel and of stating his case in public at the inquiry.

B            5. A ny material witnesses he wishes called at the inquiry should if
              reasonably practicable, be heard.

             6. He should have the opportunity of testing by cross-examination
         .   conducted by his own solicitor or counsel any evidence w hich may
             affect him.

C On 9th M ay of 1989 a letter was sent by Mr Brummell, the Treasury Solicitor

    assigned to the Inquiry. That letter will be found set out in full in tab 9, pages 395

    to 396. The letter was sent to Hammond Suddards and sets out w hat was then

D believed to be the main general criticisms which appeared so far from the evidence

    available to the Inquiry. From the evidence I have heard I draw the inference that

    Mr Duckenfield was shown it or made aware of its contents.           As I understood

    w h a t Mr Clegg was saying, he did not dispute that that was a proper inference
E
    th a t could be drawn. The prosecution case is that the defendant is guilty of

    manslaughter because, having correctly decided to order the opening of the gates,

    he failed thereafter to take the allegedly necessary and simple steps of closing off
F
    access to the already allegedly over full pens, 3 and 4. It was in those tw o pens

    that the injuries were caused which led to the 96 deaths. There is evidence that

    Mr Duckenfield received further details relating to him personally. Even if he had

G
    not received any further details it seems clear to me, having regard to the contents

    of the Salmon letter, and in particular the contents of paragraphs 2 and 3 in so far



                                                 8

D.L. SE LL E RS & CO. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




    as these charges are concerned, that Mr Duckenfield must have known w hat it

    was that was concerning the Inquiry, namely not preventing persons from entering
A
    the already overcrow ded pens 3 and 4.

        The transcript for day six reveals that Mr W oodward was expressing a concern

    about the position of individual officers. This transcript w ill be found in three loose
B
    pages w ith w hich I was provided.             He submitted to Lord Justice Taylor that it

    would be appropriate that officers should have notice of individual matters against

    them , thus giving them an opportunity to either put their minds at rest or have

c various matters considered. See G on the first page of that three page document.

    Lord Justice Taylor states, see the second page,

              "As far as specific points of criticism, if there are any, are concerned,
              this is not a civil case in w hich every allegation has to be pleaded.
D             The general nature I think of the expected points of possible criticism
              has already been indicated in letters w hich have been w ritte n by
              Counsel for the Inquiry. Insofar as it is possible to be more specific
              at any stage no doubt that can be done between counsel and if in the
              last resort something crops up during the course of the evidence of
              a witness, or indeed after he has finished, w hich makes it desirable
              he should be recalled to have an opportunity of dealing w ith it, that
E             will be done. That is, I hope, the best w ay we can proceed."

    Finally, on the third page of that same short transcript,

    Mr Collins is recorded as saying this,

F             "I have already told my learned friend",

    that must be Mr W oodward,

              "I have done that exercise, and he will receive specific matters in
              relation to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. A t the moment I have
              not done it in respect of any other officer but since Mr Duckenfield
              is intended to be either next or next but one and will probably take
              a considerable time, he may have a slight breathing space."

    The transcript, to be found at tab 3, page 51, records
D.L. S ELLERS & CO. / W. LLO YD W O O D L A N D




    Mr Woodward as saying during the evidence of Mr Duckenfield,

             "We have been given indication of the allegations that are to be made
A            against this particular officer and against the police in particular."

    It appears, therefore, that Mr Duckenfield did have the more detailed allegations,

    albeit that he would have received them orally from Mr W oodward. I see no merit

g in this ground.

        I turn no w to the grounds put forw ard by Mr Clegg and summarised in 3.2(iii)

    of his skeleton argument, namely, 'He was not cautioned when he gave evidence.’

    Mr Clegg said in argument that he had meant by that, of course, not warned or
C
    not told that he had a privilege against self-incrimination.     I deal w ith this matter

    along w ith the other matters to be found set out in paragraphs 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6,

    3.7 and 3.8 of the skeleton argument, which read as follow s:
D

              "3.3 It was the vie w of A ndrew Collins QC and Lord Justice Taylor
              that they,

                "did not believe that there was a realistic         prospect    of   a
              manslaughter prosecution being        brought."
E
              As a consequence Duckenfield was not cautioned when he gave his
              evidence.

              3.4 There was a failure to afford Duckenfield the protection of five
              of the cardinal principles established by Lord Salmon. [Nos. 2-6]
F
              3.5 It is submitted that the failure to caution the defendant or afford
              him the protection of the Salmon principles renders the admission into
              evidence of his answers unfair.

              3.6 Further it is submitted that in the circumstances of this case
              Duckenfield once giving evidence to the inquiry was in practice
              required to answer (he had not been told that he could not answer).
              Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees
              him a 'fa ir' trial. The effect of the Inquiry was to offend his right
              against self-incrimination. Saunders v. UK 1994 18 EHRR 2 3 . Re

             Arrows Ltd (No. 4) Hamilton and Others v. Naviede 1995 1 CAR 95

             3.7          It is the same principle that requires a judge in civil proceedings
A           to w arn a w itness that he need not answer questions that may
             incriminate him and the same privilege that entitles a party to civil
             litigation to refuse to give discovery of documents in like
             circumstances. Rank Film Distributors Ltd v. Video Information Centre
             1982 AC 4 5 .

B           3.8 The defendant may elect to give evidence in support of this
             submission but no witness statement will be served.

         I start then w ith the failure to advise Mr Duckenfield of the privilege against

    self-incrimination. It is clear under the law that there is no duty to advise a witness

c but it is custom and practice so to do. Although Mr W oodward was, I accept, not

    acting for Mr Duckenfield, Mr W oodward became concerned about his position.

    Mr W o od w a rd explained that out of a sense of fairness. Although Mr Jones in

D cross-examining Mr W oodward was critical of Mr W oodward on this matter, it

    seems to me that Mr Woodward behaved in a w ay that one w ould have expected

    of leading counsel.                     By the opening of the Inquiry, a private summons had

    been taken out charging someone or somebody w ith manslaughter.                    I have no
E
    more details other than the recollection of Sir A ndrew Collins. It is clear from the

    evidence there was much talk behind the scenes of manslaughter charges

    follow ing the Inquiry. Feelings were running very high at this time.              It will be
F
    remembered that blame had been attached to the supporters by at least some

    newspapers. There probably also was a feeling of hostility tow ards the police for

    w h a t may well have been seen as an attitude of denial of responsibility on their

G part.

        I turn to Mr W ood w a rd's witness statement, tab 10. In paragraph 10 at page
D.L. S ELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




     4 he mentioned that the "sights" of others might have been on individual officers.

     In paragraph 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 he sets out the background to an
A
     Inquiry that he was to make of Mr Collins. Those paragraphs read as follows:

          »~f3. A t some point between 15 May 1989, w hich was when the
            evidence to the Inquiry first began, and 24 May 1989 when David
            Duckenfield started his own evidence to the Inquiry, I raised w ith
B          Andrew Collins the question of whether David Duckenfield should be
            cautioned w ith regard to the question of possible criminal
            prosecution. The question of cautioning was in my mind at that time.
            My concern was that David Duckenfield was not represented at the
         , Inquiry, tha t there were murmurings amongst the Liverpool camp of
            a prosecution of him for manslaughter and that he ought to be
            advised of his entitlement when being invited to give evidence to the
c          Inquiry. I cannot say exactly when it was between 1 5 May 1 989 and
            24 May 1 989 that I raised this w ith A ndrew Collins. I cannot recall
            w hether it was w ith specific reference to David Duckenfield or to
            police witnesses generally.
            M y raising of the issue w ith A ndrew Collins w ould have been
            purposeful and fairly formal as I did not know Collins at the Bar. The
D          issue of cautioning witnesses was in the legal air at that time. This
            was after the Herald of Free Enterprise case when talk of
            prosecutions was in the air. I made a point of raising this matter w ith
            Collins. I wanted to have Lord Justice Taylor's view. Collins was my
            route to Taylor unless I raised it publicly in the course of the Inquiry.

              14. I have a recollection of Lord Justice Taylor saying that he would
              reconsider further individual representation if any individual requested
              it. No individual w ould need to seek representation unless a finger
              w as pointed at him. No individual officer had been named in the
              "Salmon letter".

             15. I do not recall w h a t I actually said to Collins when I first raised
F           the m atter w ith him or w hether I broached the subject generally or
             w ith regard to specific people. My concern w ould have been for
             those w ho by that time appeared to be the principal actors. When I
             first raised the matter w ith Collins I had seen enough to cause me to
             be concerned, and that includes w hat I had made of the material
             w hich I had seen and the incandescence of the Liverpool camp. In
G           raising the matter w ith Collins I had hoped to get feedback from Lord
             Justice Taylor and his view. I may have been given Collins' view but
             I had had no proper answer as to Lord Justice T aylor’ s view.

              16. When I had raised w ith Collins my concerns about the possible


                                                 12
 H

             need to caution Duckenfield in relation to his evidence before he
             commenced on it, on the basis of risk of potential prosecution for
             manslaughter, Collins had been quite dismissive of my concerns. I
A            have no doubt that I told him that I was not acting for David
             Duckenfield but that I felt that Duckenfield should get some legal
             advice. I fe lt that Duckenfield, being about to give evidence in the
             witness box w ithout representation or advice, was like a lamb going
             to slaughter and that he needed to be advised about getting legal
             advice.
B
             17. I therefore felt a need to w rite a note to A ndrew Collins asking
             him whether he had managed to speak to Lord Justice Taylor on the
             question of prosecutions as I wanted Lord Justice Taylor's views
             given a prospect of manslaughter charges arising.            I have no
             recollection no w of how much time had passed between my initial
             raising of this matter w ith Andrew Collins and my w riting the note to
C            him. I w ould have w ritte n the note to him before 24 May 1989
             which is the date when David Duckenfield started his evidence to the
              Inquiry.

             18. I have retained the original note.     My handwriting on the note
             reads as follow s:-
D
                       "A n d re w - did you manage to speak to PT on the
                       question of prosecutions."

              A lthou gh I did not refer specifically in the note to manslaughter it
              w ould have been obvious to both of us that this is w h a t I was
              inquiring about. We had mentioned manslaughter in our earlier
E            discussion.

              1 9. I had passed the note across to Andrew Collins in the Tow n Hall
              in the currency of the sitting. I needed an answer and I thus far had
              not received one. I gave the note to him myself. We were only
              sitting a matter of feet away from each other. I was not interested
F            in hearing again w h a t Collins thought. I cannot recall       a verbal
              exchange between us at the time that I passed the note to him but
              there m u st have been one. Collins' view was that I was w orrying
              over nothing. The effect of w hat Collins was telling me was that I
              had no thing to w o rry over as the law was not like that. This was
              what Collins had told me when we had discussed the matter earlier.
£            I w anted to know the vie w of Lord Justice Taylor. I did not ask
              Collins fo r his own v ie w although this     is w h a t I had received
              previously.

              20.    I eventually received w ritten reply from A ndrew Collins on the
D.L. SEL L ER S & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




             same piece of paper on w hich I had sent him my note. His reply
              reads, "Yes - he said that (since because in part of his vie w of the
              unreality of suggesting manslaughter) he w ould leave it to you to
A            raise the issue if you thought it necessary". I did not get this answer
             straight away. I do no recall exactly when I received the answer. I
             might have got it back on the same day that I had w ritte n my note.
              I m ight have got it back after the interval or the break for lunch on
             the same day. My impression was that Collins did go away and talk
             to Lord Justice Taylor before giving me his reply. My impression of
B            the reply from Collins was that it was quite plain w hat the Inquiry
              was not going to do. I took Collins' reference to "the issue" to be
              w hether w h a t the witnesses w ould say m ight incriminate them. I
             trusted w hat the Inquiry would not do. Lord Justice Taylor had a job
              to do but he knew that I was enquiring not about w h a t he w ould do
              but about a w ider scope of the consequences of a witness
              incriminating himself.
C
    In paragraph 21 he said that he knew that there would be further proceedings and

    claims for damages.               He did not know at that time that David Duckenfield would

    eventually be prosecuted for manslaughter, "But I felt that this w ould not be an
D
    end of the m atter."               In paragraphs 24, 25, 26, 27, 29 and 30, Mr Woodward

    w rote as follow s:

              24. I remember David Duckenfield. He seemed to be ill. He was
              pale. I did not know him from before although I w ould have met him
E             before at Snig Hill. He struck me as very odd, as behaving oddly.
              There w as something about him. He seemed "shot to pieces". I
              have an image of a man w ho was not w ith it. I got this impression
              from a com bination of his appearance, his demeanour and his
              responses. I have no clue as to w hat time of day this meeting took
              place although something tells me that it was round about midday.
F
              25. I was seeing David Duckenfield because I was concerned for him
              in that he was not legally represented and he was clearly a target for
              criticism in that he was being substantially blamed by the media and
              the Liverpool group for all that had happened and he had clearly
              played an im portant part in w hat had happened.
Q
              26. As he was not represented I had a concern fo r his position,
              given the atmosphere on the part of the Liverpool people, and I
              thought that someone should talk to him if Lord Justice Taylor was
              not going to give him a warning, as he was not. It seemed to me
D.L. S EL L ER S & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




              that this m atter w ould not end w ith the Inquiry.

             27.            I told David Duckenfield and those present of my concerns and
A            the query tha t I had raised w ith Lord Justice Taylor. I told him that
             I did not represent him and that I could not advise him of his own
             personal position, and that my concerns for him were such that I
             thought that he should get legal advice. I may have asked him how
             he was, w hether or not he had had legal advice and w hether or not
             he was having any medical treatment. I may have told him that he
B            did not have to give evidence and that if he was going to get legal
             advice it should be before he started giving evidence. He seemed to
             w a n t to get on w ith it. I cannot recall w h a t else was said. My
             purpose was to see him and to tell him to get legal advice.

              29. I have no precise recollection of how long the discussion was.
              It was a short discussion, between 10 and 15 minutes perhaps. My
c            approach to him was motivated by personal fairness. I was not
              professionally required to speak to him. I am not sure how he
              actually received my advice. He gave me the impression that he just
              w anted to get in the witness box and get it over w ith and I do not
              know w hether he actually understood the implication of w h a t was
              concerning me. That is w hy I emphasised that he should seek some
D            independent legal advice. My impression was that he had not
              previously had any independent legal advice. It was unclear to me
              what advice he might already have had or from w hom he might have
              had it.

               30. I am fairly sure that at the time of my conversation w ith David
               Duckenfield I had the card w ith me, on which I had w ritten my note
E             to Collins and on which he had written his reply. I think I might have
               show n it to Duckenfield. I w ould certainly have told Duckenfield
               about w h a t Ihad raised w ith Lord Justice Taylor and I w ould have
               told him that the gist of Lord Justice Taylor's response was that a
               prosecution for manslaughter was unlikely.




     In evidence, Mr W oodward said that in giving advice to

     Mr Duckenfield he told him that there was a whisper of manslaughter charges in

     the air. He said to him that he thought that in the circumstances, he, Duckenfield,

     ought to have his own legal advice about it. The drift of w hat he was saying was,

     'I don't think it will end here so that he should have his ow n independent advice


                                                    15
 H
D.L. S EL L ER S & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




     about his position.'             The effect of w h a t he was saying to Mr Duckenfield was,

     'This is not a guarantee', by that meaning the contents of the note which Mr
A
     Collins had sent him.               M r W oodward w ent on to say that he was saying to Mr

     Duckenfield that he should get advice.                 He w e n t on to say that he did not know

     w hether Mr Duckenfield did, in fact, get any advice. Mr W oodward said that he
B
     got the impression that he wanted to get on and have it done w ith, accepting that

     it was a surprise. He said that he thought that w hilst Mr Duckenfield was hearing

     w hat I was saying he seemed to w ant to get on w ith it and to, "N ot mess about

C w ith       law yers."          Although there is reference to the condition in w hich Mr

     Duckenfield found himself, there is nothing to suggest that he did not understand

     the advice that he was being given by Mr Woodward. So although it is true to say

D Mr W oodward was not representing Mr Duckenfield, notw ithstanding w hat Lord

     Justice Taylor and Mr Collins may have thought, it is clear to me that at this vital

     point Mr W oodward was giving him the sort of advice that a lawyer w ould give,

     w ho could not himself give the advice, but that it was right that someone else,
E
     another lawyer, should do so.                  It seems clear to me that

     Mr W oodw ard was, in the best traditions of the legal profession, giving Mr

     Duckenfield disinterested advice and I reject entirely the criticisms made of Mr
F
     Woodward by Mr Jones in his cross-examination.                   Indeed, I could not understand

     them.

         There is no evidence from Mr Duckenfield w hether he did or did not seek any

     further advice as to w hy he decided to give evidence follow ing his conversations,

     as recorded by Mr W oodward.                     Sir A ndrew Collins describes the events which



                                                           16

     led up to the note to which I have referred in paragraphs in his w itness statement.

     I turn first of all to paragraph 4, w hich will be found at tab 9 at page 390. That
A
     reads:

               "In terms of the protection of potential witnesses, I did not have any
               power to give any undertaking to any party seeking protection from
               prosecution. Had any party suggested such an undertaking I would
B              have consulted Lord Justice Taylor and contacted the A ttorney
               General. I consider that had any undertaking been given it would
               have been in very limited terms. A t the time these preliminary matters
               were being considered I did not consider that there could be charges
          ,    of manslaughter brought against any individual from the South
               Yorkshire Police Force. I did not consider that there was sufficient
               evidence for the bringing of any such charges"
C

     In evidence he said that his view , that there was not sufficient evidence for the

     bringing of any charges, was a vie w that did not and had not changed.              In

j) evidence he said also tha t if there had been a reasonable fear that manslaughter

     charges might have arisen, then they would have gone to the A ttorney General for

     the kind of undertaking to which I referred in the ruling I gave earlier. Sir Andrew

     Collins said he thought that it was usual practice to take that course because it
 E
     was important to have all the evidence necessary to conduct the Inquiry properly

     rather than have persons claiming the privilege against self-incrimination and thus

     possibly denying the Tribunal important and relevant evidence.
 F
              In paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 he sets out the background to the note.

     Paragraph 14 merely sets out the contents of the note to w hich I have already

     made reference.              In paragraphs 13 and 15 he states:

G
               "13. A t some stage prior to Mr Duckenfield giving evidence to the
               Inquiry, w hich I no w understand to be 24 May 1989, I believe that

              behalf of South Yorkshire Police. Although I do not recall the
              meeting, I have no w been shown a note detailing an exchange
              between Mr W oodward and myself.             I confirm that it is my
A             handw riting on the note and it is apparent from tha t note that Mr
              W oodw ard wanted me to speak w ith Lord Justice Taylor on the
              question of criminal prosecutions of individuals. I do not recall when
              the note was made but it seems likely that it was made prior to Mr
              Duckenfield giving evidence to the Inquiry.

B           15. Although I do not recall speaking to Lord Justice Taylor it is
             apparent from the w riting on the note that I must have done. I
             believe that neither Lord Justice Taylor nor myself thought that any
             criminal charges were going to arise out of the Hillsborough disaster.
          . The note records that I have indicated to
             M r W oodward that Lord Justice Taylor had considered that the
             prospect of manslaughter charges was "an unreality". I meant to
C           indicate to Mr W oodward that if he was concerned about the
             possibility of manslaughter charges he should raise w ith Lord Justice
             Taylor that possibility and w hat should be done about it. The aspect
             of cautioning a witness prior to giving evidence was never raised by
             Mr Woodward during the Inquiry. I am sure, however, that if in the
             course of giving evidence, a witness was incriminating himself or
D           herself in terms of criminal charges Lord Justice Taylor w ould have
             raised the issue of cautions w ith the representatives of the particular
             witness concerned out of his sense of fairness."

     In paragraph 16 he said,

               "If I had felt that any witnesses were laying themselves open to a
E             criminal charge, I would have raised the issue of cautioning. I did not
               so w ith David Duckenfield or any other officers because I did not
               believe that there was a realistic prospect of a manslaughter
               prosecution being brought against them, a view w hich I knew was
               shared by Lord Justice Taylor."

F
     In paragraph 19 he said,

               "D uring the course of the Inquiry, there was never at any time any
               suggestion that there was inadequate protection for witnesses. I had
               no reason to believe that the legal representatives of each witness
               were not a proper protection for those witnesses. A t no time did I
               consider that there was a need to caution any w itness in relation to
               their evidence, on the basis of risk of any potential criminal
               prosecution."

         Mr Clegg submits that, putting the note aside, then this evidence, the evidence of

         the answers to the Inquiry, must be inadmissible under section 78 because if either
     A
         Lord Justice Taylor or Mr Collins had perceived the risk of prosecution then they

         would have gone to the A ttorney General and, as a consequence, the answers

         which Mr Duckenfield gave would not have been admissible in any subsequent
     B
         trial. He submits that that is sufficient in itself to make these answers inadmissible

         under section 78. However, one has to bear in mind that Mr Duckenfield was, as

         I say, a very senior police officer w ho had been in the Force since 1960.

     C Secondly, the note makes it clear that it was left to Mr W oodward to raise the

         issue if he thought it was necessary. As we have seen in the witness statement

         of

     j) Mr W ood w a rd, the contents of the note were drawn to the attention of Mr

         Duckenfield. Thirdly, I have already set out the advice w hich Mr W oodward gave,

         making it clear that it was a matter for Mr Duckenfield himself.             We have heard

         nothing from
     E
         Mr Duckenfield, as I have said before, given the very sensible advice which he was

         receiving. I do not know how he reacted to that or, indeed, do not know w hat he

         did. In one sense,
     F
         Mr Duckenfield was perhaps in the greater possession of the facts than the Inquiry

         may have been. He knew that, assuming the prosecution to be right, he had lied

         about h o w the gates had been opened.                  He was later to accept that he had

     ° wrongly blamed the supporters for the deaths (see transcript 26th May, page 31

         set out at tab 3, 224).             Having regard to the matters w hich I have just outlined,

        I take the view that it could not be stated that this evidence is inadmissible under

        section 78.
    A
             I finally and briefly turn to numbers 2 to 6 of the Salmon principles. I take the

        view that in so far as number 2 is concerned, Mr Duckenfield was informed of the

        allegations w hich were being made against him and, albeit that he may not have
    B
        known the substance of the evidence in support, he was the officer in charge on

        that day. He had made the decision that the gate should be opened and he would

        know from the letter that he received, if not from any further communication, the

    C thrust of the criticisms against him. It is right to say that he did not have his own

        lawyer but that has to be seen in the context of the view taken by Lord Justice

        Taylor and Mr Collins that there would not be any manslaughter prosecution and

    D the advice given to Mr Duckenfield by Mr W oodward. The other three matters

        seemed to be not to be relevant. The issues which I have to decide today, namely

        the admissibility of the answers that he gave to questions posed, even if there was

        some breach of the Salmon principles it w ould not be sufficient, in my judgment,

        to make this evidence inadmissible under section 78.

              In conclusion, I am quite satisfied that this evidence is admissible for the

        reasons I have given.                          ___________________

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of 9 December 1999 concerning your request for assistance
as to the evidence which was taken into account by the counsel advising the DPP.

I have examined the papers in my possession and I am satisfied that counsel carried
out their instructions to advise the DPP by reading and fully considering all the
material that was provided to them by the CPS. The papers that they received
included the transcript from the Taylor Inquiry.

 I have found no evidence in the papers of any assurance being given to Mr
Duckenfield as to potential criminal proceedings. Neither is there anything to support
your inference that such an assurance was the reason that interviews of a number of
suspects, including the two defendants in this case, were carried out in 1990. Indeed
the file notes show that the criminal investigation to be conducted by the West
Midlands Police was to be treated as a normal criminal enquiry with all the ordinary
criminal rules applying. It has been acknowledged that this was a thorough and
detailed police investigation and as such included the taking of CJA statements from
potential witnesses and the conduct of PACE interviews with potential defendants.

I note your letter of 11 November 1999 to the Attorney General. My comments
follow.

Paragraph 6: Following the judgement of the Divisional Court and the reconsideration
by the CPS of the earlier decision not to take over any part of the private prosecution,
there was ample time for the HFSG to make further representations to us, as indeed
you had done on previous occasions. That we had not expressly asked you to
comment does not in any way show a procedural impropriety or a breach of natural
justice.
Paragraph 19: As we have stated previously a number of times, the CPS does not
consider that the legal professional privilege in the joint opinion obtained from our
counsel should be waived. We do not agree that provision of the opinion to either the
police or Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny constituted waiver, whether express or
implied.

Paragraph 20: I am satisfied that the two counsel and the CPS reviewing lawyer in
1989 and 1990 were fully appraised of all the factual matters as contained within
witness statements and the evidence given to the Taylor Inquiry. We do not accept
that the CPS was given a misleading account on the question of the gates being
forced. Indeed during our latest detailed review of the evidence all the papers were
fully reconsidered.

Please let me know if there is any further assistance I can give.

Yours sincerely

George is in the office today, he has looked through the papers. He cannot see any material which suggests that
counsel were concerned that the evidence given by Duckenfield to the Taylor Inquiry might be inadmissible. On
the other hand, counsel were concerned to see that there had been a full and proper criminal inquiry, which
appears to be why potential suspects were interviewed.
In the circumstances, I think we are justified in sending a robust reply, along the lines already mooted.

W e do spoke:
Re letter from HFSG to LSLO:
para 6 alleges W e did not give opportunity for further representations, presumably after the Divisional Court
decision. I think this is without substance. HFSG (and the defence solicitors) had ample opportunity for comment
before the judicial review. Indeed, comments and replies to comments were numerous. Further, if they had
wanted to make further representations, they should have either done so or said they wanted to. They knew
what was happening.
Para 19 and 20 - will we waive privilege re the 1990 counsel advice. Also, we were misled about the question of
the gates being forced in 1990. As to waiving privilege - 1am not persuaded that we should do so. It is our
advice. True, we copied it to the police, but that was our choice. In any event, it was a decision we made, not
made by counsel. Further consideration was given to the case (in 1998) and there was the Scrutiny, following
further pressure and more evidence.
I do not think there is substance in these points. These arguments can be developed further if necessary.

W e have had a letter from HFSG today (9 Dec). It asks the extent to which counsel in 1990 based his advice on
Duckenfield's evidence to the Taylor Inquiry. This leads up to the startling assertion that if counsel did not pay
attention to that evidence from Duckenfield then counsel was wrong. HFSG asks for a clear indication of the
basis on which the DPP acted. As discussed, this is without substance again. I have not examined the papers -
but it would be right to say that the decision was made on the material then available. No doubt counsel did take
into account the fact that Duckenfield (and Murray) had given evidence to the Inquiry and that there might be an
issue in relying on that evidence. It would be impossible to say that a decision had been flawed simply because
an unquantified obstacle to admissibility might be thought to exist. I have not decided how we should reply to
this letter, but it may well be on the lines that the DPP considered all relevant matters!

9th December 1999


Dear Mr Croston,

R v. Duckenfield and Murray


1      I am writing to you to ask your assistance about a new development in this case. This
       week, the prosecution has received copies of statements of four witness who the
       defence of Mr Duckenfield may rely on in the week of 20th December. It will be
       argued that the evidence given by Duckenfield to the Taylor Inquiry ought to be
       excluded, as a matter of law, alternatively as a matter of discretion.

2      We are told that Duckenfield may give evidence at the hearing, but that no witness
       statement from him will be served on us in advance. The Crown yvill resist this
       application, because the extensive admissions made by Duckenfield to all allegations
       in the indictment are important.

3      I enclose a copy of the material served on us (without the immaterial appendices of
       Whitehurst)

4      You will see that the written note exchanged between Mr Justice Collins and Mr
       Woodward refers to a view apparently expressed informally by Lord Justice Taylor.

' '   - 5   The new material indicates that Duckenfield is going to contend that his evidence to
            the Taylor Inquiry ought to be excluded because he was given an assurance that if he
            gave evidence, it would not be used against him, or that there would be no
            prosecutions. The last eleven paragraphs of the statement of Woodward have been
            deleted from our copies for the obscure reason set out in Mr Eastwood’s covering
            letter to leading counsel for the prosecution of 7th December.

        6   We suspect that similar arguments were presented to the DPP in 1990. We have for
            long been puzzled as to why counsel advising the DPP asked that fresh interviews
            with the defendants be held, under caution, in April 1990. After all, the transcripts of
            the Taylor Inquiry were detailed and comprehensive. At the Inquest in 1991, Mr
            Isaacs, his junior counsel, correctly pointed out to the Coroner on 12th March,


            “Mr Duckenfield will do his very best to assist both you and the Jury in relation to the
            events which took place before and on 15thApril 1989........ His evidence to that
            Inquiry covers over 200 pages of transcript; many aspects of this case were asked
            about time and time again. His evidence lasted for some three days, often, as I have
            mentioned earlier, giving evidence for some three hours at a time without a break. “


        7   One reason for the request for an interview under caution in 1990 is that leading
            counsel may have been told that an assurance had been given to Duckenfield, before
            he gave evidence, about the use to which evidence would be put, and they had
            therefore decided not to have regard to the contents of the transcripts of his evidence.
            Alternatively, leading counsel might have considered that, since the defendants’
            statements and evidence to the Taylor Inquiry had not been given under caution, it
            ought not to be considered unless it was confirmed under caution.

            When Mr Duckenfield was interviewed under caution on 3rd July 1990, it is notable
            that he was asked about the transcript of his evidence to the Taylor Inquiry, and he
            declined to answer questions even about that. By contrast, Mr Murray did answer
            questions. Among the first substantial questions after caution were:

                   “ You also gave evidence at the public inquiry and a transcript of the
                   evidence that you gave was produced?

                   That’s correct, yes.

                   Have you seen the transcript and agree with it?

                   Yes I have

                   And you agree with it?

                   Yes, sir.”
9      This suggests to us that leading counsel did not take into account the evidence given
       by Duckenfield to the Taylor Inquiry in advising on the question of prosecutions.
       This inference tends also to explain :

              (a) why no serious consideration was given to the allegations of attempting to
              pervert the course of justice and misfeasance in 1989-90, in spite of
              Duckenfield’s comprehensive admissions to Taylor to lying on 15th April 1989
              as to the circumstances in which Gate C became open;

                (b) the assertions by Duckenfield’s counsel at the Inquest that

                       “       on my advice, and I stress this, if he is asked about any matter
                       relating to the evidence he gave before Lord Justice Taylor he will
                       exercise his privilege [against self-incrimination]”

              (c) the decision of Mr Newell earlier this year to discontinue the attempting to
              pervert charges.

10    If leading counsel decided not to pay attention to Duckenfield’s evidence, we suggest
       that his decision was, on the available evidence, wrong. The evidence was obviously
       admissible, but might be excluded in the exercise of a judge’s discretion. The material
       we enclose with this letter suggests that Duckenfield was indeed acting on legal
       advice at the Taylor Inquiry (that of Woodward, as Mr Justice Collins and the
       Treasury Solicitors considered) and would have been aware of the consequences of
       giving evidence. Why else are Winkworth’s considering a claim of privilege for part
       of Woodward’s statement?

11    We therefore regard it as very important that we know on what basis the DPP acted in
      1990, and what he was told as to the circumstances in which Duckenfield gave
      evidence. We are also concerned that he might have been given an inaccurate version
      of the views of Lord Taylor and Mr Justice Collins.

12    The Attorney-General is now considering whether to issue a nolle prosequi in relation
       to counts 4 and 5 of the indictment. Because it was indeed he who advised in 1990
       that no prosecutions should be brought, it may be that the Solicitor-General is
       considering the matter. Accordingly, we shall send him a copy of this letter and
       enclosures.

       We look forward to your early reply.



Yours Sincerely,



Ann Adlington

                   I understand that you have received a copy of Wlnckworth's letter of 6 December. I
                   do not think that It raises new matters so that a reply from you is needed, but if you
                   take a different view I should be grateful If you would (fit me know by the end of the
                   day.

           HILLSBOROUGH PRIVATE PROSECUTION
           ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD

           I am grateful to you for your letter of 5 November.

           I now enclose a copy of Ms Adlington’s letter of 11 November, and the
           reply of 6 December. At present, I do not think that I require any further
           assistance from you, but I will revert to you if it becomes apparent that
           you can help in some further way.

           You will wish to note paragraph 20 of Ms Adlington’s letter, with its
           request that the DPP waive his privilege in the advice given by leading
           counsel in 1990. I am inclined to think that it is a matter for you to
           decide how to respond to this request.

                       We only received a co^.of; tb&tetter fron&Ms Adlington to yourself dated 11 November
                       1999 on 12 November          aridk copy of-tfte enclosures contained therein on 29 November
                       1999. In those circumstances,'we trust th'ait you will understand why we considered it
                       necessary to seek an extension o f time in otd^r to respond.

                       For ease of reference we propose to deal with. each of the subjects raised by Ms Adlington
                       in the order in which shs apldressed them heiiself in her letter to you.

                       The Attorney’s position

                       We did not and do not seek- to. itiSuence a^decision by yourself as to who ought to advise
                       you in this matter.

                       Procedural matters

                       The history of the matter has been accurately^ out by Ms Adlington.

                       It is quite wrong and misleading for Ms Adlifigton to assert that the CPS did not give her an
                       opportunity to make fre^h^ubirasskms. •

                       The judgment of the Divisional Court made it clear that the CPS would be required to
                       reconsider the decision not to intervene, and discontinue proceedings in relation to the
                       allegations which form the basis.for counts^ and 5 of the indictment.

                       Ms Adlington was well aware of the fact that we, who represented Mr Duckenfield, relied
                       upon the fact that no p r i^ facie cvidence.vexisted as the basis of the submissions advanced
                       to the court. She ha4'.'^l$6$tne to maJ^further representations to the CPS if she had

            chosen to do so. The stattriient-.of Mr Kelly^sdds nothing to the facts as found by the Taylor
            Inquiry. We find it vejc^^urpnsmg thatsKds statement, made in 1989, is alleged to he
            something which “we ;didi"not$ave” in jeSbber 1998. Mr Kelly gave evidence to the
            Inquiry in 1989. Our unde^taftding is that^copy of his statement would have been made
            available to the represetxt^VeS;6f;&e bereaivgd at the time of the Inquiry. In any event this
            statement adds nothing                     -Mr Kht(|h who also gave evidence at the Inquiry and
            whose statement was c^F^dy Vfisclosed '^p^vve understand that the representatives of the
            families were given cogi^ J(t'|^ :i^ scri^ S u iin g the Inquiry and that the prosecution had
            access to all transcript^ dfphe.:£vidence. '^^se, we regret, have just been disclosed to the
            defence as part of the ovei|it:lni^My tran^^t and we provide you with copies herewith.

            The statement o f Mr Kelly cannot possibly, in our judgment, provide any evidence to
            support the information laid and discontinued by the Director.

            We are in no position-to:>dispftite.the reaspn| Ms Adlington gives for not seeking judicial
            review but we would ^i^gest^k; any a||j|cation would inevitably M l because she had
            chosen not to make repfeisertatiehs to t h e ^ S at the appropriate time after judgment in the
            first review proceedings.                   -\S:

            She is, with respect, wrong .when, she says-ihat the alleged “alternative remedies” would
            have resulted in a refusal of relief. This -is an adaptation of an argument advanced and
            rej ected by the Divisional; Court in the first -faring.

            Ms Adlington has personally ^tributedti^ihe delay in the case by making representations
            to the South Yorkshire.PbHjce./^ority seeding to argue that no power existed for them to
            provide financial assistances die. defendant She then instructed counsel to advance the
            same misconceived arguriisnt ^the Divisi<^l Court.

             Each application made on behalf of the^defendant to the Divisional Court has been
             successful in whole or in. part, Ms Adlin^ton is wrong when she says that the application
             for judicial review was “lost”. It succeeded insofar as it related to the matter now being
             considered.

             Insofar as it is relevant.h^.?jhd^standing o£|he funding of the defence case is also wrong.

             The changed legal context/.' •

             Ms Adlington is again Wr6ng when she sajfs that “the prosecution decided not to attempt to
             reinstate the charges at . pmmlttaT. She could not reinstate them; the Director had
             intervened and discontinued.. She could not possibly have sought committal on charges that
             had been discontinued..                   .. . ;.

             We cannot comment upon -advice .which shd says that she has received from counsel. No
             copy of that advice has  disclosed andftve do not know the basis upon which the advice
             was given.

Alternative remedies for the defence: the powers of the judge

The alternative remedies identified, exist m^very case. If these were a bar to the obtaining
of a nolle prosequi then &^IIe. .yva\M nevit$e entered.

Ms Adlington is wrong to suggest th atio power exists to enter a n o lle p ro s e q u i on
individual counts of an indictment We note-that no authority is cited to support her view
and the 1933 Act does flotjsupport her intei|>Eetation.

The merits of the application-.-

There is no evidence on^Mte^^and 5, ^ : Director was correct in his assessment. The

The state of the evidence is; as it was. when counsel advised the Director in 1990.

The reason why the representations of Ms.&idlington dated September 1998 were not sent to
you was because we sent A copy of our request for a nolle to her enabling her to send any
representations that she. wanted..

It is quite wrong for her.toassert that the decision not to prosecute in 1990 was flawed or
that any “deception” operated Ori those thetfadvising.

 This allegation was M ly investigated by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith at the time of the
 Scrutiny and found to be w&dWfptu^tio^;;

        Attorney General’s Chambers
        9 Buckingham Gate
        London SW1E 6JP

        11thNovember 1999

        Dear Attorney,

        Regina v Duckenfield and Murray

        1     I am the solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group, and laid the
               informations alleging crimes on the part of the above named at the Leeds District
              Magistrates Court in July 1998. As such 1 was the prosecutor before the matter was
               committed for trial in July 1999, and I continue to act as instructing solicitor.

        2     I write to set out the Crown’s submissions on the application by Mr Duckenfield to
               you to enter a nolle prosequi in relation to counts 4 and 5 on the indictment currently
              before the Crown Court sitting at Leeds. A copy of the signed indictment is attached
               for ease of reference.

        The Attorney’s position

        3     Although the application is addressed to you, we appreciate that you cannot take the
              decision in this matter in the light of the principles set out in Re Pinochet No 2,
              because you personally advised the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1990 that no
              criminal prosecutions should be instituted. Neither can the matter, in our submission,
              be delegated to the Crown prosecution Service, which would then be invited to act as
              iudex in sua causa. However, we nonetheless invite you to take note of the contents
              of this letter particularly in relation to the written advice of August 1990.

        Procedural aspects

        4     The Crown Prosecution Office came to the view that there was no prima facie case on
              what is now count 4 on the indictment. However, the CPS initially declined to
              interfere in the prosecution on those charges having decided it would not interfere
              with the prosecution on the manslaughter charges. The Divisional Court ordered a
              reconsideration.

Accordingly, the CPS, acting through Christopher Mr Newell, reconsidered its
previous decision, and took over and discontinued the prosecution in relation to the
charge which is now count 4 of the indictment. It is apparent that the decision was
based upon the opinion of Mr Newell that there was insufficient evidence to
constitute a prima facie case on that charge.

Procedural irregularity

Unfortunately, the CPS did not give us an opportunity to make fresh submissions
upon the question of sufficiency of evidence. The Crown regards this, therefore, as a
decision flawed by procedural impropriety and a breach of natural justice. If they had
provided such an opportunity, we would have referred to the statement of Graham
Kelly, enclosed, which we did not have when we made our representations to the CPS
in October 1998.

The prosecution did not seek judicial review of the CPS decision for the following
reasons:

       (a) We had “alternative remedies”, such as the ability to put these counts on
       tide indictment in the event of committal by virtue of section 2(2) of the
       Administration of Justice ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933. This potential
       remedy would no doubt have led to the refusal of relief even if the Divisional
       Court had agreed with us as a matter of substance.

       (b) We were afraid of delay. After service of process in July 1998, the
       defendants have delayed these criminal proceedings by a variety of devices.
       They applied to the CPS to take over and discontinue the proceedings.
       Having failed, they applied in February for judicial review, arguing, among
       other things, that the CPS decision not to take over and discontinue the entire
       case was irrational. A further application for judicial review by us, launched in
       April 1999, would have caused further unacceptable delay in the hearing of
       these proceedings.

       (c) We were afraid of cost. The South Yorkshire Police Authority agreed in
       1998 to fund the entire criminal defence of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray,
       including out of pockct expenses, and was willing, it appears, to fund ancillary
       applications for judicial review. Two applications for judicial review have
       been brought by the defendants, one of the decision of the CPS, another of the
       decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority in March 1999. The first of
       these they lost. The second of these argued that the Authority had been wrong
       to decide, in February 1999, that it had no power to grant financial assistance.
       In this they succeeded. They were then given their costs by SYPA of
       applying, for the most part unsuccessfully, for review of the CPS decision
       Another application mooted was an application for judicial review of a
       decision of the South Sefton Magistrate Court in July 1998 in relation to an
       application for their costs. Summonses had originally been brought there by
       the prosecution, but dropped because, though the court had jurisdiction to hear
       the case, no process existed to compel the defendants to appear there.

The changed legal context

8     The position is now different. In the light o f the CPS decision, the prosecution
       decided not to attempt to reinstate the charges at committal. The defendants were
      committed for trial on the charges of manslaughter and misfeasance, having argued
      unsuccessfully that there was no case to answer, and that the proceedings were an
      abuse of process,

9     Pursuant to the 1933 Act, and on the advice of leading counsel counts 4 and 5 were
       added to the indictment by the Crown after committal as charges disclosed on the
       committal documents. Count 5 is entirely new. It is based upon the same facts, but
       was never considered by the CPS. The transcripts of evidence given by the
       defendants to Lord Taylor and the Inquest were in evidence at committal, and those of
       Mr Duckenfield contained admissions to telling lies to the Taylor Inquiry as part of
       his evidence about the disaster generally.

10    The Crown wishes also to emphasise that, where a prosecution is discontinued under
       section 23 (3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, by virtue of section 23 (6);

               “The discontinuance of any proceedings by virtue of this section shall not
               prevent the institution of fresh proceedings in respect of the same offence.”

11    This subsection does not even contain a requirement for fresh evidence to come to
       light before fresh proceedings are instituted.

Alternative remedies for the defence; the powers o f the judge

12    Even if there were insufficient evidence to support a case to answer on those counts
       disclosed on the committal papers, the judge could grant a voluntary bill on
       indictment on those counts if there was sufficient evidence now available. He himself
       referred to this power in the preliminary hearing of 3rd September 1999, and has set
       aside time in the week of 20th December to hear argument on this matter, should the
       application for a nolle prosequi fail. We enclose a copy of his observations on that
       matter on 3rdSeptember 1999.

13    If the Crown is wrong in its position, which is entirely a matter of law, Mr
       Duckenfield’s remedy is to ask Hooper J. to quash those counts. The judge can hear
       oral argument and is therefore in a much better position than Mr Newell to assess as a
       matter of law whether or not a prima facie case is made out on those charges, It is
       beyond argument that Hooper J. can quash those counts under the Administration of
       Justice ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 or by way of abuse of process; see R v
       Bedwelty JJ ex parte Williams [1997] AC 225.

14    Further, the judge has set aside four days from 4thJanuary 2000 for a full abuse of
       process hearing. The judge has ample power to find that it is an abuse of process to
       prosecute for those offences, even if they are sound in law.

       15    It is not accepted that, since the powers conferred by the 1933 Act, whatever had been
              the position at common law, a nolle prosequi can be entered on selected counts in
              relation to an indictment. It was surely the intention of Parliament that the power of
              the Attorney-General, excrcisable without the power to hear submissions or evidence,
              exists to prevent a trial; not to quash individual counts. The power in relation to
              individual counts is surely the prerogative of the judge.

       The merits o f the application

       16    On the merits of the application, it is the submission of the Crown that the case
             against Mr Duckenfield on counts 4 and 5 is very strong. It will be noted by the
             Attorney-General that the letter of Winkworth and Sherwood of 13thOctober fails
             utterly to deal with the substance of the case or the strength of the charges. Our
             representations of 2nd October deal with the facts, and the enclosed statements of
             Kirton and Kelly throw further light on the matter.

       17    We are surprised that the defence solicitors should not have enclosed copies of the
             annexes to our representations of September1998. You are asked to exercise a
             discretion, which, as Winkworth and Sherwood should know, must be exercised in
             the light of all the circumstances of the case. You will note that the prosecution
             produced abundant primary material to show that the DPP decided not to prosecute in
             1990 on the basis of selected statements, some of which had been improperly edited
             to exclude statements by South Yorkshire police officers. It is necessary to look at the
             actual excisions to appreciate the significance of the deception.

       18    In all the circumstances it would be wholly inappropriate for a nolle prosequi to be
              entered for counts 4 and 5 of the current indictment.

       The advice o f leading counsel to the DPP in 1990

       19    Although for some reason the advice of leading counsel to the DPP in 1990 has been
             sent to the South Yorkshire police, who retain a copy, and has been disclosed to Lord
             Justice Stuart-Smith, who quoted it in part in the report of his “Scrutiny” in 1998, it
             has not been disclosed to the Crown in the prosecution of this case.

       20    It is believed that the DPP was given a misleading account in the final West Midlands
              Police Report about the question of gates being forced. Paragraph 8 of the
              representations made by the prosecution on 9lhOctober 1998 refers to this. It is
              believed that the attention of leading counsel in 1990 could not have been directed to
              the true facts. The Attorney is invited in his capacity as statutory superintendent of
              the Director of Public Prosecutions to invite the CPS to waive privilege in respect of
              this advice, so that the judge can determine the abuse of process application on 4lh
              January, and the motion to quash on 20th December, on a fully informed basis.

                The Winkworth and Sherwoodjibe

                21     The final paragraph of Winkworth’s letter to you of 13lhOctober contains an
                       apparently gratuitous jibe, alleging, without giving particulars, that I have made
                       misrepresentations. This is connected with the fact that I am employed, rather than in
                       private practice.

                22     I have asked Winkworths for an explanation of this, and for the provision of an
                       example of a misrepresentation that I have made, but have received no reply. I
                       enclose a copy of the ruling by Mr Cadbury, the Leeds stipendiary magistrate,
                       dismissing the argument that the prosecution was an abuse of process, and upholding
                       the integrity and motives of the prosecution.

                23     I should, in turn, be grateful to be given an opportunity to deal with any new matters
                       raised by the defendants in reply to this letter.

                24     I shall be pleased to deal with any queries arising out of this letter.

                Yours faithfully,

        Dear Sir

        R -v- Duckenfjeld

        We wrote to Hillsborough Family Support Group yesterday by fax enclosing a copy o f Olir
        skeleton submissions relating to the validity o f counts 4 and 5 of the indictment and the
        admissibility o f the evidence given by David Duckenfield to the Taylor Inquiry which is to
        be heard in Leeds Crown Court on 20 December 1999.

        We are sending them today, by fax, copies o f the witness statements upon which we shall be
        seeking to rely at that hearing and, following discussion and agreement between yourself
        and our Leading Counsel, Mr William Clegg QC, we enclose herewith copies o f those same
        witness statements for your own information as follows:

        1)                    Mr Justice Collins;

        2)                    Mr William Woodward QC;

        3)                    Mr Peter Whitehurst;

        4)                    Mr David Brummell.

        With regard to the statement of Mr William Woodward QC we should draw to your
        attention, the fact that there are eleven further paragraphs numbered 25 to 35 inclusi ve which
        we are not disclosing at this stage as they refer to a conversation which possibly raises
        questions o f legal and professional privilege.

        Yours faithfully

        This statement (consisting o f 7 pages each signed by me) is true to the best o f my knowledge
        and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to
        prosecution if I have wilfully state in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe to

        1.     In April 1989 I was instructed by the Treasury Solicitor to act as Leading Counsel to the
               Inquiry into the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 at which 96 people
               died as a result o f crushing. Mr Alan Goldsack and Mr Bernard Phillips were instructed
               to act as Junior Counsel on behalf of the Inquiry. The solicitor to the Inquiry was Mr
               David Brummell from the Treasury Solicitor’s Office, and Mr Peter Whitehurst o f the
               Treasury Solicitor’s Office provided further assistance on a day to day basis at the
               Inquiry hearing.

        2,      On 28 April 1989, Lord Justice Taylor, the judge appointed to convene the Inquiry, held
                a preliminary meeting. Oral applications from any party wishing to be represented at
                the Inquiry were heard. Those accorded representation at the preliminary meeting were
                as follows:


                2.1.    those bereaved or injured as a result o f the disaster;


                2.2.    the Football Supporters Association;


               2.3.     the Football Association;


               2.4.     Sheffield City Council;


               2.5.      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, the football league, the Club’s casual staff
                         and their insurers;


               2.6.     South Yorkshire Police; and


               2.7.     South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.


        3.     T have been shown a copy of the transcript of the meeting on 28 April 1989. Lord
               Justice Taylor dealt with a number o f issues on that day. The possibility o f criminal
               proceedings to be faced by any person arising out o f the disaster was not raised nor did
               he make any directions on that issue, I do not believe that any party present raised any
               particular concern over the issue o f protection that ought to be offered to witnesses who
               would appear at the Inquiry. From that time, and throughout the course o f the Inquiry,
               there was no doubt in my mind, and I am sure Lord Justice Taylor shared this view, that
               the Police, both as a force and individual officers, were represented by Mr Woodward
               QC, instructed by Hammond Suddards. This was wholly consistent with the approach
               of the Chief Constable referred to at page 66 o f the transcript o f 15 May 1989,

      4.      In t e r m s o f the protection o f potential witnesses, I did not have any power to give any
              undertaking to any party seeking protection from prosecution. Had any party requested
              such an undertaking I would have consulted Lord Justice Taylor and contacted the
              Attorney General. I consider that if any undertaking had been given it would have been
              in very limited terms. At the time these preliminary matters were being considered I did
              not consider that there could be charges o f manslaughter brought against any individual
              from t h e S o u t h Yorkshire Police Force. I did not consider that there was sufficient
              evidence for the bringing of any such c h a r g e s ,


      5.      The documentation and material presented to the Inquiry was presented to me through
              the Treasury Solicitor’s office. This material was provided to me for presentation to the
              Inquiry. I am not aware whether all the documentation and material prepared for the
              Inquiry remains in existence.


     6.       The West Midlands Police were appointed to investigate the Hillsborough disaster. The
              evidence was collected by the West Midlands Police who performed an admirable task
              given the tight timeframe we were working to. Lord Justice Taylor was under pressure
             to complete the Inquiry and make recommendations prior to the commencement o f
              1989/90 football season. I recall that the solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police
             or their insurers did make some amendments to statements submitted by police officers
             but I understand that many statements were submitted without alteration. There was no
             suggestion that the solicitors were acting in a sinister manner in amending statements
             and Lord Justice Stuart Smith has recently dealt with this issue in his Scrutiny. I recall
             that Mr David Duckenfield submitted a statement which, I believe, he had personally
             drafted without assistance from the solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police. I do
             not know whether or not Mr Bernard Murray received any assistance in the preparation
             o f his statement.


     7.      I am aware that on 9 May 1989, a letter was sent to Messrs Hammond Suddards, the
             solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police, under the principles determined by the

                Salmon Commission of 1966, I was the author o f the letter. I recall that the Salmon
                letter was addressed to the South Yorkshire Police as a force rather than to particular
                individuals as the force was being represented at the Inquiry as a body. I was of the
                view that the representation of the force by solicitors would be for the benefit of
                individuals as well and there never appeared to be any question that the individuals
                would be separated from the force in terms o f legal representation.


        8.      The purpose o f the “Salmon letter” was to give advance notice to the organisational
               bodies o f the areas of criticism that were likely to be made against them and members of
                those bodies. In terms o f the letter to South Yorkshire Police, it was for their legal
               representatives to make their own decisions as to how they ought to act upon the letter.
               I presumed that following receipt o f the Salmon letter, the legal advisers to the South
               Yorkshire Police would advise the South Yorkshire Police and the individuals involved
               in relation to the criticisms contained therein and that the South Yorkshire Police and
               the individuals would establish their own evidence in relation to the criticisms and speak
               to their own witnesses and officers to bring out various points that were not covered in
               their original statements.


        9.     My recollection is that I had Mr Duckenfield’s initial statement prior to the force
               solicitors receiving the Salmon letter.   I would have expected the force solicitors to
               consider Mr Duckenfield’s statement in light o f the criticisms made in the Salmon letter
               and to put him on notice as to the criticisms that may affect him.


        10. It is my understanding that the South Yorkshire Police, like every other party
               represented at the Inquiry, had access to all the statements and other documentation
              placed before the Inquiry prior to individuals giving oral evidence.       Every witness’
               statement was made available to all parties before he or she gave evidence. Statements
              of witnesses who were not to be called to give oral evidence were served on all other
              parties if those statements were to be taken into account by the Inquiry. In my role as
              Counsel to the Inquiry, I or one o f my juniors would call any witness to give oral

             evidence and ask any questions which we considered necessary, including cross-
             examinations. They would then be examined by each Counsel for each party, and then
             by their own Counsel last. I would re-examine the witness at the conclusion of their
             evidence if any matters arose out of the cross-examination by the other parties’
             Counsels.


      11. The Inquiry was opened on 15 May 19S9. At that time I believe I had sufficient
             material with which to open the Inquiry including statements from the main police
             officers and from supporters. Further material was provided during the course o f the
             Inquiry to the extent that I made a second opening statement at some time during the
             Inquiry to examine documents and statements that I had not previously had in my
             possession.


      12. The Inquiry first heard evidence from 56 supporters before the first police officers were
             called. The first of the police officers to be called were the most important witnesses
             who had some role in the organisation and command o f the police operation,         Mr
             Duckenfield and Mr Murray were obviously two o f the most important witnesses in the
             police structure.


     13. At some stage prior to Mr Duckenfield giving evidence to the Inquiry, which I now
             understand to be 24 May 1989, I believe that I was approached by Mr William
             Woodward QC, leading counsel on behalf o f South Yorkshire Police. Although I do not
             recall the meeting, I have now been shown a note detailing an exchange between Mr
             Woodward and myself. I confirm that it is my handwriting on the note and it is apparent
             from that note that Mr Woodward wanted me to speak with Lord Justice Taylor on the
             question o f criminal prosecutions o f individuals. I do not recall when the note was
            made but it seems likely that it was made prior to Mr Duckenfield giving evidence to the
            Inquiry.


     14. My handwriting on the note reads as follows:

              “Yes - he said that [since because in part o f his view o f the unreality o f suggesting
              manslaughter] he would leave it to you to raise the issue i f you thought it necessary”


      15. Although I do not recall speaking to Lord Justice Taylor it is apparent from the writing
              on the note that I must have done. I believe that neither Lord Justice Taylor nor myself
             thought that any criminal charges were going to arise out o f the Hillsborough disaster.
             The note records that I have indicated to Mr Woodward that Lord Justice Taylor had
             considered that the prospect of manslaughter charges was an “unreality”. I meant to
             indicate to Mr Woodward that if he was concerned about the possibility o f manslaughter
             charges he should raise with Lord Justice Taylor that possibility and what should be
             done about it. The aspect o f cautioning a witness prior to giving evidence was never
             raised by Mr Woodward during the Inquiry. I am sure, however, that if in the course of
             giving evidence, a witness was incriminating himself or herself in terms o f criminal
             charges, Lord Justice Taylor would have raised the issue o f cautions with the
             representatives o f the particular witness concerned out of his sense o f fairness.


      16. If I had felt that any witnesses were laying themselves open to a criminal charge, I
             would have raised the issue o f cautioning, I did not do so with David Duckenfield or
             any other officers because I did not believe that there was a realistic prospect o f a
             manslaughter prosecution being brought against them, a view which I knew was shared
             by Lord Justice Taylor.


      17. In the normal way, Mr Woodward, representing the Police, was given the opportunity of
             examining Mr Duckenfield last, before my re-examination.


     18. As Counsel to the Inquiry, I was required to examine each witness vigorously to elicit
             the evidence upon which the Inquiry would base its recommendations. I consider that
             Mr Duckenfield was examined in the same fashion as all other witnesses to the Inquiry.
             I was not aware o f the material that Mr Duckenfield had seen prior to his giving
             evidence. I would have made any documentation available to him had Mr Duckenfield

             asked to see the same during the course o f the examination. As I was aware that all the
             material had been provided to the South Yorkshire Police and its legal representatives, I
             assumed that this material would have been made available to Mr Duckenfield prior to
             his giving evidence.


       19. During the course of the Inquiry, there was never at any time any suggestion that there
             was inadequate protection for witnesses.       I had no reason to believe that the legal
             representatives o f each witness were not a proper protection for those witnesses. At no
             time did I consider that there was a need to caution any witness in relation to their
             evidence, on the basis of risk o f any potential criminal prosecution.

     HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


     You will recall that at the pre-inquiry meeting on April 28th Lord Justice Taylor
     indicated that any body against whom any allegation was to be made would be informed
     of it aid the substance of the evidence supporting it.

     You will appreciate that the task of assembling the evidence for the Inquiry is a
     formidable one. And statem ents are still being taken. However, it seemed right to let
     you have what must be a preliminary indication of criticisms^which may be levelled at
     the South Yorkshire Police as soon as possible before the commencement of the
     Inquiry.   We suspect that you are already aware of the general thrust of criticisms
»•   which have been made and that what is set out in this letter will be no surprise to you.

     The following are the main general criticism s which so far appear from the evidence
     available to us:-

     1.            Failure to take any adequate steps to control supporters so that the crush, which
                   built up from about 2.20 to 2.30pm outside the Leppings Lane entrance to the
                   ground and which led to the decision to open 'C gate because of a perceived
                   danger to life, did not occur. In particular, there were not proper arrangements
                   to check supporters at a far enough distance from the ground and insufficient
                   officers were available to control the crowd outside the turnstiles.       Having
                   regard to the lim ited space available, the disposition of mounted police may not
                   have been of any use and may have constituted a positive danger. It should
                   have been anticipated that many supporters would arrive shortly before kick-off
                   and that some would not have tickets. Steps should have been taken to stop
                   non-ticket holders getting near the ground and adding to the congestion.

 2.    Failure by officers outside to liaise adequately with those inside the ground and
       vice versa. There were in addition problems with radio communications and the
       noise of the crowd rendered such tannoy or loudspeaker announcements (if any)
       as were made in effective. When it was decided that a gate or gates must be
       opened, to relieve pressure outside (and the decision to open gates may well have
       been a necessary one in the circumstances), there were no steps taken to ensure
       that there was any police or steward presence to prevent those entering going to
       the tunnel which led onto the already overcrowded Pens 3 and <*. it ought *o
       have been realised that without such presence all those coming in the gates
       were likely to go down the tunnel because of inadequacy of signing ar.i because
       the tunnel was the only visible way to the terracing.

 3.    No steps were taken to monitor properly the state of Pens 3 and <*. Officers
       ought to have been stationed in the tunnel and/or at the rear of the pens and
       should in conjunction with those at the front have ensured that the pens did not
       become too full. It was known that there was likely to be a full house and that
       it was essen tial to ensure an even distribution of spectators in all the pens on
       the terraces, particularly as the decision had been made to give Liverpool the
       smaller end of the ground.

       When people began to be crushed and to lose their lives, the officers Vi front of
       Pens 3 and k took too long to react to what was happening. They seemed to be
       thinking in terms of prevention of disorder and pitch invasion rather than safety.
       There was no proper guidance given to the individual officers because no proper
       plans had been made to deal with overcrowding in the pens. The gates leading
       on to the pitch were not opened in time and, when they were, officers were
       initially trying to prevent people getting out. O fficers seemed not to know what
       they should do and, although many individual officers showed great presence of
       mind and devotion to duty, valuable minutes went by before the nature of what
       was happening was appreciated.

 5.    There w ere inadequate contingency plans to deal with the sort of emergency
       which arose. In particular, the emergency services may not have been called as
       expeditiously as they should have been and insufficient arrangements had been
       made to enable them to gain access to the ground. Help for the injured was not
       co-ordinated and no use was made of the tannoy system to explain to spectators
       what had happened or to organise assistance.

 6.    Since there was no chance that ail those trying to enter the ground would be
       able to do so by 3pm, consideration should have been given to deferring the
       kick-off at a much earlier stage. It seems that it was not until about 2.55 that
       this step was considered and by then it was thought to be too late because the
       teams were coming out.        It should have been clear much earlier that the
       k ic k -o ff m ust be postponed and th a t adequate step s w ere taken to give
       assurance to those trying to get in that there was a postponement. This might
       have r e lie v e d the pressure and obviated the need to open the gates.

 Should any further specific m atters which might result in criticism s come to our
 attention, we shall of course le t you know of them.

              MR. BROWNE:           Sir, I am instructed on b e h a l f of the
  P o l i c e F e d e r a t i o n to apply for full representation.        I
  a p p r e c i a t e the a p p l i c a t i o n is made late. I apprehend
  you will h a v e a l e tter from those instructing m e on
  behalf of the Federation.
              The F e d e r a t i o n might essentially b e said to have
  three r e a s o n s to be represented; two of those can be
  further said to be in part concurrent with bodies a l ready
  r e p r e s e n t e d b e f o r e you, sir.     First, of course, a number
  of O f f i c e r s were injured in the incident, or c e r t a i n l y
  have r e q u i r e d c o u n s e l l i n g since the incident.   I accept
  that that, of course, is an interest concurrent w i t h
  those of the relatives and those of the deceased, much
  more s e r i o u s l y .
              Second, it may be the case that the F e d e r a t i o n
  m e m b ers will be cri tic i s e d during the c o urse of the
  Inquiry.            Sir, the federation represents all O f f icers up
  to the r a n k of S u p e r i n t e n d e n t - over 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 . Sir,
  again it may be that in that respect, the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e
  Police a l r e a d y represented, have a concurrent interest,
  a l t h o u g h it could be that there might be a d i v e r g e n c e of
  interest, if it were to be the case, and one simply does
  not know, if it were to be the case that o p e r a t i o n a l
  d e c i s i o n s w e r e c a l l e d into question and then the way in
  which those d e c i s i o n s were put into practice, and given
  the fact that O f f i c e r s may have claims arising, there
  could be a d i c h o t o m y of interest.
              I t h e r e f o c e pursue the application on a third
  ground       a n d that is this:         sir, it is the o r d i n a r y
  O f f i c e r w h o w e e k in and week out is required to police
  football stadia.                 Sir, it is that individual O f ficer
  who, as it were, is'-perhaps best able to j u d g e the

    the i n d i v i d u a l O f f i c e r , sir, who will have to put into
    effect...
              LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:           That is really d e a l i n g with
    the future r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s side of this I n quiry and it
    w o u l d be p e r f e c t l y c a p a b l e of being put in writing.
                MR. BROWNE:          Sir, that clearly is right.              T h a t is
    clearly         in part w h a t was done after the B r a d f o r d fire.
    Sir, the F e d e r a t i o n a p p l i e d before Mr. J u s t i c e P o p p l e w e l l
    for r e p r e s e n t a t i o n at the Inquiry and were g r a n t e d full
    r e p r e s e n t a t i o n at the Inquiry,     I made that application.
    I made it on a s i m i l a r basis that I am m a k i n g today.
                Sir, a n u m b e r of matters that will be c o v e r e d by
    the Inquiry w h e r e the individual Officers has, as it
    were, an i n t e r e s t in those r ecommendations - fencing,
    radios, perhaps.                 The Federation has a u nique i n t erest
    really in those matters.                  Its members would wish to be
    r e p r e s e n t e d to m a k e inquiries into those m a t t e r s and for
    the c o n f l i c t that I have already indicated b e t w e e n safety
    and the p o t e n t i a l d i s o r d e r at matches.
          Sir, that is the way in which I put the
    application.
                LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:     Let's be clear about this.
    Are you saying there is going to be a conflict of
    i n t e r e s t b e t w e e n the Fe deration and the South Y o r k s h i r e
    Police?
          MR. BROWNE:              Sir, I simply do not know.         With
    respect, sir, the a p p l i c a t i o n is made.      The F e d e r a t i o n
    is unaware w h e t h e r the        members they represent are likely
    to be c riti cised.             It may well be that they are.           Sir,
    it may be there c o u l d be a conflict depending upon, as it
    were, i n s t r u c t i o n s given to individual O f f icers and the
    way in w h i c h those instructions were put into effect.
             Sir, I a p p r e c i a t e I sound hesitant in this regard.
    It is simply that I do not know the evidence that is to
    be p r e s e n t e d b e f o r e the Inquiry,
                LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:       My approach has been that
    when a p p l i c a t i o n s were made last month, that I would
    always be o p e n to further applications if the e v i d e n c e
    went in a way w h i c h suggested that s o m e b o d y ’s i n t e r e s t
    ought to be r e p r e s e n t e d and was not being up until then.
    I am reluctant to a l l o w representation, as it were, on
    th e s p e c u l a t i v e c h a n c e that there might d e v e l o p a
    conflict.            I hope in a way that a conflict does not
    d e v e l o p , but if it did I would certainly hear an

        knowledge and belief and I make it knowirig that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable

        believe to be true.


        Dated the                day o f                                 1999-

        1.      In April 1989 I was instructed by their solicitors, Messrs Hammond Suddards, to act on
                behalf o f the South Yorkshire Police at the Inquiry into the disaster at Hillsborough
                stadium on 15 April 1989 at which 95 people had died as a result o f crushing. Mr
               Andrew Collins QC was instructed by the Treasury Solicitor to act as Leading Counsel
               to the Inquiry. It was within a very short time after the incident on 15 April 1989 that I
               was instructed.   It was not over the weekend itself but it could have been on the

              following Monday. As I perceived it, my instructions were unequivocally to act on
              behalf o f the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police, the Force which had been
              involved in policing the Hillsborough Ground on 15 April 1989, and not on behalf of
              any individual Police Officers.


              My recollection, at this time, for much detail and for many events is unclear. About
              many matters it has been inevitably corrupted after having read and seen much material
              from many sources, professional and private, media and other writings, television
              productions, talks, discussion and debates. What follows is to the best o f my ability my
              present recollection.


       3.     There were many meetings at Snig Hill, the South Yorkshire Police Headquarters, prior
              to or at the time o f the Inquiry. I recall an early meeting at Snig Hill where there were
              street plans on display and a m o f officers whose names were new to me and whose
              roles I did not comprehend at that stage. I think that David Duckenfield and Bernard
              Murray may have been present at that meeting. I cannot put a date to it. I do remember
              this as being a large meeting with a lot o f tables. I had no “one on one” meeting with
              David Duckenfield or Bernard Murray prior to the Inquiry. They were witnesses and
              not my clients.


       4.     My approach from the outset was that David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray were
              simply witnesses and not my clients and that approach never altered all the way through
              the Inquiry. I never viewed any officer from South Yorkshire Police as being my lay
              client.

              I was very quickly made aware that West Midlands Police had been appointed to handle
              the Inquiry, At a very early stage I was given the impression that South Yorkshire
              Police were standing back and letting West Midlands Police get on with it. I had the
              impression that South Yorkshire Police wanted the Inquiry dealt with properly without
             the suggestion o f their own hand being on it. From the outset material would be sent to

                 me by Hammond Suddards. I would look at it and, if necessary, advise. My contact
                 was always with Hammond Suddards and never direct with the South Yorkshire Police.
                 It was teamwork on a fairly formal basis. I cannot recall having any contact with the
                 Inquiry itself until the first day o f the Inquiry and thereafter.


        6.       On 28 April 1989 Lord Justice Taylor, the judge appointed to convene the Inquiry, held
                 a preliminary meeting. Oral applications from any party wishing to be represented at
                the Inquiry were heard.        Those accorded representation at the preliminary meeting
                 included South Yorkshire Police. I have been shown a copy o f the transcript o f the
                meeting on 28 April 1989 which shows that I requested and was granted representation
                 for South Yorkshire Police. The transcript o f the preliminary meeting shows that there
                 was no separate application for representation by David Duckenfield. It is clear from
                reading the transcript o f the preliminary meeting on 28 April 1989, with particular
                reference to my exchange with Lord Justice Taylor set out on page 16 o f the transcript,
                 that I was seeking global police representation and that there was no other application
                 for individual officers.     No one at that meeting was addressing representation for
                 individual officers.


        7.      I have been shown a copy o f a letter dated 9 May 1989 seat by David BrummeM,
                Assistant Treasury Solicitor, to Messrs Hammond Suddards, by my instructing solicitors
                acting for the South Yorkshire Police, under the principles determined by the Salmon
                Commission o f 1966. I cannot now remember what material I had been given by the
                time that the “Salmon letter" was issued. I remember the letter and having seen it. I do
                not remember actually receiving the letter nor can I now remember whether it came to
                me on its own or with other papers. I do not now remember how much o f these events
                mentioned in the “Salmon letter” were in my mind at the time that I first saw it. In my
                professional capacity I would have looked at the letter for South Yorkshire Police. My
                brief was to deal with it in a particular context. I have no recollection now of my initial
                reaction to the “Salmon letter”.         I expect that I would have discussed it with my
                instructing solicitors.

                The Inquiry opened on 15 May 1989.            Andrew Collins, instructed by the Treasury
                Solicitor for the Inquiry, must have had enough material to open the Inquiry on 15 May
                1989, I did not necessarily have exactly the same material at that stage that Collins had.
                We relied on material which was received daily at the Inquiry which came from the
                Inquiry itself rather than from Hammond Suddards. If I required any specific material
                once the Inquiry was underway I would ask Collins, the Inquiry juniors, or perhaps the
                Inquiry staff for this. New material with increasingly more detail and different aspects
                was cropping up all the time. We were running to keep up. I cannot recall receiving
                any material other than that material received from the Inquiry.      We were receiving
                boxes o f transcripts o f what was being said in evidence cach day. Back at the hotel in
                the evening we would have such of the material as had been typed up from that day and
                such o f the material from the Inquiry for the following day. The material which I was
                receiving was therefore frequent and voluminous.


         9.     I recall that the first few weeks o f the Inquiry were taken up with the evidence o f fans.
                That was my main focus. David Duckenfield was, I think, the third police witness in the
                running order of those officers giving evidence. Bernard Murray was the sixth. The
                batting order was set by the Inquiry as far as I know.


         10.    As things progressed, whether as a result of my own thinking or whether as a result of
                the attitude o f the press and individuals from Liverpool who had suffered being at the
                incident or losing family and friends there, it was in my mind that otherjsights might
                have been on individual officers, whether appropriately or inappropriately, but this was
                not something which was at the forefront of my mind at the start o f the Inquiry.


         U.     I have been shown a copy o f a 17 page statement of David Duckenfield which is signed
                but undated. I cannot remember whether I have seen this before. Reading the statement
                does not help me to remember whether I had seen it before and, if so, when this was. I
                do think that I did see a statement made by him. Given the way that the Inquiry went,
                David Duckenfield was, as with any other witness called, unlikely to have given

                   evidence without a document having been produced. Any documents which I received
                   in relation to witnesses would have come via South Yorkshire Police’s solicitors,
                   Hammond Suddards. I expect that I would have seen statements of David Duckenfield
                   and Bernard Murray as all represented parties would have seen these. I would not know
                   who prepared this particular statement. My understanding now was that all the material
                   which came to me from the Inquiry had been prepared by West Midlands Police
                   although there must have been a time when South Yorkshire Police were carrying out
                   their own enquiries. The evidence which the witnesses were to give at the Inquiry I
                   believe came to us from the Inquiry and to have been prepared by West Midlands
                   Police. I cannot now remember if I received any material other than that prepared by
                   West Midlands Police. I cannot therefore now remember whether I had any separate
                   statements from David Duckenfield or Bernard Murray.


       12. I do not now recall receiving the statement of David Duckenfield before he gave
                   evidence to the Inquiry but I assume that I must have done. I cannot now recall reading
                   this statement before David Duckenfield gave his evidence but I would have read
                   anything which I received, I cannot now recall any reaction which I may have had to
                   reading David Duckenfield statement at that time.


       13. At some point between 15 May 1989, which was when the evidence to the Inquiry first
                  began, and 24 May 1989 when David Duckenfield started his own evidence to the
                   Inquiry, I raised with Andrew Collins the question of whether David Duckenfield
                  should be cautioned with regard to the question of possible criminal prosecution. The
                  question o f cautioning was in my mind at that time.                 My concern was that David
                  Duckenfield was not represented at the Inquiry, that there were murmurings amongst the

                  say exactly when it was between 15 May 1989 and 24 May 1989 that I raised this with
                  Andrew Collins.                  I cannot recall whether it was with specific reference to David
                  Duckenfield or to police witnesses generally. My raising of this issue with Andrew

            Collins would have been purposeful and fairly formal as I did not know Collins at the
            Bar. The issue of cautioning witnesses was in the legal air at that time. This was after
            the Herald of Free Enterprise case when talk of prosecutions were in the air. I made a
            point of raising this matter with Collins, I wanted to have Lord Justice Taylor’s view.
            Collins was my route to Taylor unless I raised it publicly in the course of the Inquiry.


       14. I have a recollection of Lord Justice Taylor saying that he would reconsider further
            individual representation if any individual requested it. No individual would need         to

            seek representation unless a finger was pointed at him. No individual officer had been
            named in the “Salmon letter”.


       15. I do not recall what I actually said to Collins when I first raised the matter with him or
            whether I broached the subject generally or with regard to specific people. My concern
            would have been for those who by that time appeared to be the principal actors. When I
            first raised the matter with Collins I had seen enough to cause me to be concerned, and
            that includes what I had made of the material which I had seen and the incandescence of
            the Liverpool camp. In raising the matter with Collins I had hoped to get feedback from
            Lord Justice Taylor and his view. I may have been given Collins’ view but I had had no
            proper answer as to Lord Justice Taylor’s view.


       16. When I had raised with Collins my concerns about the possible need to caution
            Duckenfield in relation to his evidence before he commenced it, on the basis of risk of
            potential prosecution for manslaughter, Collins had been quite dismissive of my
            concerns. I have no doubt that I told him that I was not acting for David Duckenfield
            but that I felt that Duckenfield should get some legal advice. I felt that Duckenfield,
            being about to give evidence in the witness box without representation or advice, was
            like a lamb going to slaughter and that he needed to be advised about getting legal
            advice.

    17. I therefore felt the need to write a note to Andrew Collins asking him whether he had
            managed to speak to Lord Justice Taylor on the question of prosecutions as I wanted
            Lord Justice Taylor’s views given a prospect of manslaughter charges arising, I have no
            recollection now of how much time had passed between my initial raising o f this matter
            with Andrew Collins and my writing the note to him. I would have written the note to
            him before 24 May 1989 which is the date when David Duckenfield started his evidence
            to the Inquiry,


    18. I have retained the original note. My handwriting on the note reads as follows: -


            “Andrew - did you manage to speak to PT on the question o f prosecutions ".


            Although I did not refer specifically in the note to manslaughter it would have been
            obvious to both of us that this is what I was inquiring about.        We had mentioned
            manslaughter in our earlier discussion.


    19. I passed the note across to Andrew Collins in the Town Hall in the currency of the
            sitting. I needed an answer and I had not thus far received one. I gave the note to him
            myself.      We were only sitting a matter of feet away from each other.        I was not
            interested in hearing again what Collins thought. I cannot recall a verbal exchange
            between us at the time that I passed the note to him but there must have been one.
            Collins’ view was that I was worrying over nothing. The effect of what Collins was
            telling me was that I had nothing to worry over as the law was not like that. This was
            what Collins had told me when we had discussed the matter earlier, I wanted to know
           the view o f Lord Justice Taylor. I did not ask Collins for his own view although this is
           what 1 had received previously.


   20. I eventually received a written reply from Andrew Collins on the same piece of paper on
           which I had sent him my note. His reply reads, “Yes - he said that (since because in
           part o f his view o f the unreality o f suggesting manslaughter) he would leave it to you to
           raise the issue i f you thought it necessary”, I did not get this answer straight away, I do

                   not recall exactly when I received the answer. I might have got it back on the same day
                    that I had written my note. I might have got it back after the interval or the break for
                    lunch on the same day. My impression was that Collins did go away and talk to Lord
                    Justice Taylor before giving me his reply, My impression of the reply from Collins was
                    that it was quite plain what the Inquiry was not going to do. I took Collins’ reference to
                   “the issue” to be whether what the witnesses would say might incriminate them. 1
                   trusted what the Inquiry would not do. Lord Justice Taylor had a job to do but he knew
                   that I was enquiring not about what he would do but about a wider scope of the
                   consequences of a witness incriminating himself.


       21. I have kept the original note with my question and Collins’ reply as it was part of my
                    own records, some of which I have kept. I have also retained a copy of .Lord Justice
                   Taylor’s Interim Report marked up for my closing submissions. I knew that there
                    would be further proceedings and claims for damages. I did not know at that time that
                    David Duckenfield would eventually be prosecuted for manslaughter but I felt that this
                    would not be an end of the matter. I recall some suggestions voiced to the Inquiry by
                    Ben Hytner in closing submissions concerning further proceedings including
                   manslaughter prosecutions.


       22. I had a meeting with David Duckenfield which I believe that I initiated. It was not a
                    chance meeting. My ordinary practice would not be to see anyone without a solicitor or
                    solicitor’s representative being present and I would not have seen anybody without my
                   Junior Counsel being present. I cannot remember who in fact was present at the time
                   that I spoke to David Duckenfield but I have a recollection of a number o f people being
                   present in a room in the Town Hall which was dimly lit. This was not the main
                   chamber. I am sure that it was a side room somewhere in the Town Hall. David
                   Duckenfield was present. I cannot remember whether any other officers were present.
                   It is possible that other officers may have been there but they would only have been
                   principal officers, being those in respect of whose alleged conduct from my enquiry of
                   Taylor would have been relevant. I do not think that Peter Metcalf from Hammond

               Suddards was present. My recollection is that there were between about three and five
           people present, in addition to myself and my junior.


     23. I am not sure whether my meeting and discussion with David Duckenfield was on the
           same day that he commenced his evidence to the Inquiry on 24 May 1989. It may have
           been a day or so earlier that we had this discussion. I think that he might have been in
           mufti rather than in uniform when I saw him. My impression is that our discussion was
           not on the same day that he first gave evidence.


     24. I remember David Duckenfield. He seemed to be ill. He was pale. I did not know him
               from before although I would have met him before at Snig Hill. He struck me as very
               odd, as behaving oddly. There was something about him. He seemed "shot to pieces”.
               I have an image of a man who was not with it. I got this impression from a combination
               of his appearance, his demeanour and his responses. I have no clue as to what time of
               day this meeting took place although something tells me that it was round about midday.

                 1984. This department provides a range of legal advisory and litigation services to a
                number o f Government departments and other public authorities and is currently

      2.      In April 1989 I was appointed as the solicitor to the Public Inquiry into the Hillsborough
              Disaster. Mr Peter Whitehurst, an Assistant Treasury Solicitor, was appointed to assist
              me. We were a team of about three lawyers and other staff. Mr Andrew Collins QC
              was appointed as Counsel to the Inquiry and was assisted by two junior Counsel, Alan
              Goldsack and Bernard Phillips. The Treasury Solicitors team appointed to assist the
              Inquiry was initially based in London but we later set up an office in Sheffield which is
              where the Inquiry was to be held.


      3.      On 28th April 1989 Lord Justice Taylor, the Judge appointed to convene the Inquiry,
             held a preliminary meeting at Sheffield Town Hall at which I was present.             Oral
              applications from any party wishing to be represented at the Inquiry were heard. I recall
             that William Woodward QC requested and was granted representation for South
              Yorkshire Police. I have been shown a copy of the transcript of the meeting on 28th
              April 1989 which confirms this. I do not recall any request for separate representation
              for any individual police officers. It was my understanding at that time, and throughout
              the course of the Inquiry, that Mr Woodward QC, instructed by Hammond Suddards,
             represented the interests of South Yorkshire Police both as a Force and its individual
              officers. I do not recall any consideration being given by the Inquiry team to separate
             representation for individual officers,


      4.      Within a few days o f the Hillsborough disaster taking place on 15 April 1989, West
             Midlands Police were appointed to investigate it.          It was their task to collect the
             evidence which would then be made available to us as solicitors to the Inquiry, We
             would then read through all the material produced by them in order to decide what
             material was relevant and should be produced to the Inquiry. There were box loads of
             this material, much of it being witness statements. These statements and other material
             received from the West Midlands Police were delivered to us within a few days of the
             statements being taken from the witnesses. I do not believe that we had received all the
             statements and material by the time that the Inquiry began. I recall further statements
             and material being delivered to us by the West Midlands Police when the Inquiry was

             already underway.      Although the initial review of the material produced by West
             Midlands Police was carried out by the Treasury Solicitors team, we then referred
             potentially important statements and material to our leading Counsel and junior Counsel
             for their assessment as to what should be produced to the Inquiry.


       5.    All the material submitted to the Inquiry for Lord Justice Taylor and his assessors to see
             would have been copied and distributed to all interested parties for whom representation
            had been granted. A list of the material which was distributed to interested parties was
             maintained and a note was made confirming such distribution. My recollection is that
             material was distributed regularly from the Inquiry office to interested parties. As it was
             my impression that Hammond Suddards were acting for South Yorkshire Police, not
             only for the Force itself but also for its individual officers, I believed that all statements
             and other material copied and distributed by us to Hammond Suddards would enable
            them to advise individual officers who were to give evidence to the Inquiry, as well as
            to enable them to make these documents available to those officers so that they could
            prepare for giving their evidence to the Inquiry. I would have been surprised if that was
            not the case.


       6.   For the purpose of this statement I have been shown a copy of a letter dated 9th May
             1989 and sent by the Treasury Solicitor’s office to Messrs Hammond Suddards, the
            solicitors acting for South Yorkshire Police. The letter is signed by me and it was
            drafted under the principles determined by the Salmon Commission of 1966.                 The
            purpose of this “Salmon letter” was to advise Messrs Hammond Suddards of the
            potential criticisms which might be levelled against the South Yorkshire Police during
            the course of the Inquiry. I recall that the Salmon letter was drafted by Andrew Collins
            QC, Leading Counsel to the Inquiry, and I believe that he and I discussed the content of
            the letter and the level of detail which was to be included in it.


      7.    I have also been shown copies of similar Salmon letters, also signed by me and dated 9th
            May 1989, sent to Messrs Davies Arnold Cooper, solicitors for Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club, and to Messrs Keeble Hawsons, the solicitors for Sheffield City Council.
             There was ongoing consideration regarding the issue of further Salmon letters as the
             evidence to the Inquiry unfolded and this is evidenced by the later Salmon letter of 16th
             June 1989 written by ray colleague Peter Whitehurst to Messrs Reynolds Porter
             Chamberlain, solicitors for Dr W Eastwood, the Consultant Engineer retained by
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.


     8.      I do not recall any other Salmon letters being written, and in particular, I do not recall
             any such letters being addressed and sent to individual police officers over and above
             the letter sent to Hammond Suddards to which I have referred above. I would have
             expected that if Hammond Suddards had felt there was any conflict of interest between
             South Yorkshire Police as a Force and any individual police officers the proper and
             appropriate course would have been to advise those individual police officers to seek
             separate representation,   I would have expected Hammond Suddards to know the
             identity of the principal police officers who would be giving evidence to the Inquiry. I
             would have expected Hammond Suddards to have copies of the witness statements of
             any police officers who would be giving evidence to the Inquiry. I would therefore have
             expected Hammond Suddards to draw to the attention of those police officers the
             particular criticisms which I, as solicitor to the Inquiry, was raising in the Salmon letter
            of 9th May 1989 sent to them,


    9.      I was not aware of any advice given by Hammond Suddards to any individual police
            officer and I would not expect to have been aware of any such advice, as it would have
            been covered by legal and professional privilege.


    10. With regard to Hammond Suddards, representing South Yorkshire Police, my concerns
            as solicitor to the Inquiry were that they were made folly aware of the criticisms which
            would be raised against South Yorkshire Police during the course of the Inquiry, as set
            out in the Salmon letter, and that they were provided with all relevant material,

             officers before they gave evidence to the Inquiry. I cannot recall whether these matters
             were considered or not.

   knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable

   1.    I have been a member of the staff of H M Treasury Solicitor since 1972.                       I was
          appointed as an Assistant Treasury Solicitor in 1990 and am presently a member of the
          Senior Civil Service. I am currently the Solicitor to the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry.


   2.    In April 1989 I was assigned to assist the Solicitor to the Inquiry into the Hillsborough
          Stadium Disaster, David Brummell. Initially the Treasury Solicitor’s team appointed to
          assist the Inquiry remained in our London office but as the Inquiry was to be based in
          Sheffield, a team consisting of Mr Brummell, myself and four other members of staff

          and a local secretary set up an office in the Town Hall, Sheffield shortly after the
          announcement of the Inquiry,         We shared offices there with the Secretariat of the
          Inquiry and the Chairman and Assessors.


    3.    Mr Andrew Collins QC was appointed as Counsel to the Inquiry and he was assisted by
          two junior Counsel from the local bar, Alan Goldsack and Bernard Phillips.


    4.    I recall that the West Midlands Police were appointed to investigate the actions of the
          South Yorkshire police almost immediately after the disaster occured place on 15 April
          1989. It was decided at an early stage that the Solicitors to the Inquiry would be given
          access to the material gathered by the West Midlands Police as and when it became
          available. It was the task of the Treasury Solicitor team and Counsel to sift through all
          the material produced by the West Midlands Police to determine what was relevant and
          should be produced to the Inquiry, both by means of documents and oral evidence.


    5.    Once the Inquiry was underway, I have a strong recollection of the material arriving
          daily from the West Midlands Police by the box load. I understood that the HOLMES
          computer system was being used to create and log the statements taken from potential
          witnesses print outs of which were then delivered to our team for evaluation. The
          material was usually delivered to us within days of the statement being taken from the
          witness.


    6.    As the statement gathering was not an ordered process (as many different witnesses
          were being interviewed at the same time), one of our main tasks was to categorise the
          statements for witness selection. I recall that the evidence to the Inquiry was presented
          in the following order:


          6.1.     Supporters and local residents;


          6.2.     South Yorkshire Police;

          6.3.     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club;


          6.4.     Others; eg the City Council.


   7.     Although the initial review of the material produced by the West Midlands Police was
          carried out by the Treasury Solicitors team and was then seen by Counsel, the final
          decision on whether any witness would be called by the Inquiry was with the Chairman.


   8.     I have been shown a letter dated 9 May 1989 from the Treasury Solicitor’s office to
          Messrs Hammond Suddards, solicitors.              I recognise this as a “Salmon letter”. The
          purpose of this letter was to advise the South Yorkshire Constabulary of the general
          criticisms that were likely to be raised during the Inquiry. It is likely that I had some
          input into the preparation of the letter, although now I cannot recall this for certain. I am
          sure that the letter went through several drafts and was considered by Counsel and Mr
          Brummell before the final draft was settled upon and forwarded to Hammond Suddards.
          The Chairman would also have been aware of the letter and approved its despatch.


   9.    The letter of 9 May 1989 was addressed to Hammond Suddards as they were acting for
          the South Yorkshire Police. I would have expected that Hammond Suddards would
          have referred the letter to relevant individuals within the South Yorkshire Police
          particularly those who were to give evidence at the Inquiry. It was my understanding at
          all times that Hammond Suddards represented both the South Yorkshire Constabulary as
          an organisation and also the individual officers. Likewise, Mr William Woodward QC
          was instructed by them on behalf o f the organisation and individual officers. I do not
          recall any application for separate representation for individual officers, save that there
          was an application for representation on behalf of the Police Federation. This was
          unsuccessful but the Chairman indicated that it could be renewed in the event of a
          conflict of interest arising.


   10. I have been asked to recall the system for the distribution of material received by the
          Inquiry solicitors.         The Inquiry process, ten years ago, was paper based and the

              Solicitors team received a large volume of material including police generated
              statements, other statements, video tapes, and various other matters on a daily basis,
              some times several times a day. The team then scrutinised the material for relevance to
              determine that which should be distributed to all those who had been granted
              representative status. This included the South Yorkshire Constabulary, The material
              was then copied and distributed to all these parties, at least daily and sometimes more
              frequently.        A list of the material that was distributed was kept and a note made
             confirming distribution to each party,


       11. Given the timeframe in which we were working it is likely that often there was only a
              short time between the distribution of statements and material and the giving of
              evidence.


       12. For the purpose of this statement I have been asked whether I have any recollection of
             any potential criminal prosecution being addressed by the Inquiry team. I have no
             recollection of that matter being addressed by me and I am not aware that the matter was
             addressed by Counsel to the Inquiry or by Lord Justice Taylor.


       13. In preparing this statement I have had the opportunity of reviewing the correspondence
             files and some of the transcripts.         In those files I have discovered a bundle of
             distribution lists, I do not know if this is a complete set, I attach a copy of this bundle
             to this statement.

      Dear Sir

      Thank you for your letter of 29 November providing us with copies of the enclosures which
      accompanied the letter dated 11 November 1999 which was sent to you by HFSG. We note
      that they did not send you a copy of the indictment referred to in their letter of 11 November
      but you should already have a copy of this as we enclosed it with our original letter of 13
      October,

      We now enclose our reply to HFSG’s submissions and we look forward to hearing from you
      in due course. We confirm that we have provided HFSG with a copy of the enclosed letter.

      Yours faithfully

        Dear Attorney

        R -v- Duckenfield (Hillsborough Private Prosecution)

        We only received a copy o f the letter from Ms Adlington to yourself dated 11 November
        1999 on 12 November 1999 and a copy of the enclosures contained therein on 29 November
        1999. In those circumstances we trust that you will understand why we considered it
        necessary to seek an extension o f time in order to respond.

        For ease o f reference we propose to deal with each of the subjects raised by Ms Adlington
        in the order in which she addressed them herself in her letter to you.

        The Attorney’s position

        We did not and do not seek to influence any decision by yourself as to who ought to advise
        you in this matter.

        Procedural matters

        The history o f the matter has been accurately set out by Ms Adlington.

        Procedural irregularity

        It is quite wrong and misleading for Ms Adlington to assert that the CPS did not give her an
        opportunity to make fresh, submissions.

        The judgment o f the Divisional Court made it clear that the CPS would be required to
        reconsider the decision not to intervene and discontinue proceedings in relation, to the
        allegations which form the basis for counts 4 and 5 of the indictment.

        Ms Adlington was well aware of the fact that we, who represented Mr Duckenfield, relied
        u p o n the fact that no prima facie evidence existed as the basis of the submissions advanced

        to the court. She had ample time to make further representations to the CPS if she had

      chosen to do so. The statement of Mr Kelly adds nothing to the facts as found by the Taylor
      Inquiry. We find it very surprising that this statement, made in 1989, is alleged to be
      something which “we did not have” in October 1998. Mr Kelly gave evidence to the
      Inquiry in 1989. Our understanding is that a, copy of his statement would have been made
      available to the representatives of the bereaved at the time of the Inquiry. In any event this
      statement adds nothing to that o f Mr Kirton who also gave evidence at the Inquiry and
      whose statement was certainly disclosed and we understand that the representatives of the
      families were given copies o f the transcripts during the Inquiry and that the prosecution had
      access to all transcripts of the evidence. These, we regret, have just been disclosed to the
      defence as part o f the overall Inquiry transcript and we provide you with copies herewith.

      The statement of Mr Kelly cannot possibly, in our judgment, provide any evidence to
      support the information laid and discontinued by the Director.

      We are in no position to dispute the reasons Ms Adlington gives for not seeking judicial
      review but we would suggest that any application would inevitably fail because she had
      chosen not to make representations to the GPS at the appropriate time after judgment in the
      first review proceedings.

      She is, with respect, wrong when she says that the alleged “alternative remedies” would
      have resulted in a refusal o f relief. This is an adaptation of an. argument advanced and
      rejected by the Divisional Court in the first heating.

      Ms Adlington has personally contributed to the delay in the case by making representations
      to the South Yorkshire Police Authority seeking to argue that no power existed for them to
      provide financial assistance to the defendant. She then instructed counsel to advance the
      same misconceived argument in the Divisional Court.

      Each application made on behalf o f the defendant to the Divisional Court has been
      successful in whole or in part. Ms Adlington is wrong when she says that the application
      for judicial review was “lost”. It succeeded insofar as it related to the matter now being
      considered.

      Insofar as it is relevant her understanding o f the funding of the defence case is also wrong.

      The changed legal context

      Ms Adlington is again wrong when she says that “the prosecution decided not to attempt to
      reinstate the charges at committal”. She could not. reinstate them; the Director had
      intervened and discontinued. She could not possibly have sought committal on charges that
      had been discontinued..

      We cannot comment upon advice which she says that she has received from counsel. No
      copy o f that advice has been disclosed and we do not know the basis upon which the advice
      was given.

      Continued

      Section 23(3) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 covers the position o f instituting
      fresh proceedings in the Magistrates' Court This Ms Adlington could seek to do in this
      case but has chosen not to. Her reasons are obvious, the Director would again intervene and
      discontinue and/or the summons would be set aside as an abuse o f the process o f the court.

      Even if fresh proceedings were instituted and a committal obtained then the indictments
      could be joined and a trial proceed in the form now envisaged by her. There is ample time
      for such a course o f action as the trial has been fixed for June 2000. Obviously such a
      course of action has not been attempted because the result would be a further intervention
      by the Director.

      Alternative remedies for the defence: the powers o f the judge

      The alternative remedies identified exist in every case. If these were a bar to the obtaining
      of a n o l l e prosequi then a noils would never be entered.

      Ms Adlington is wrong to suggest that no power exists to enter a nolle prosequi on
      individual counts o f an indictment. We note that no authority is cited to support her view
      and the 1933 Act does not support her interpretation.

      The merits o f the application

      There is no evidence on counts 4 and 5, the Director was correct in his assessment. The
      statements o f Kirton and Kelly add nothing to the state of the evidence as at the conclusion
      of the Taylor Inquiry.

      No “course o f justice” existed at the time ,the words spoken by Mr Duckenfield were said.
      There could be no attempt, the words were never spoken to anyone who was subsequently
      charged with investigating the disaster. Mr Kirton and Mr Kelly do not advance the case at
      all.

      The state of the evidence is as it was when counsel advised the Director in 1990.

      The reason why the representations of Ms Adlington dated September 1998 were not sent to
      you was because we sent a copy o f our request for a nolle to her enabling her to send any
      representations that she wanted.

      It is quite wrong for her to assert that the decision not to prosecute in 1990 was flawed or
      that any “deception” operated on those then advising.

      This allegation was fully investigated by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith at the time o f the
      Scrutiny and found to be without foundation.

       The advice o f leading counsel to the DPP in 1990

       This document is dearly privileged but was seen and read by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,
       His conclusions are wholly inconsistent with the assertion of Ms Adlington that was made
       to his Scrutiny by her and rejected by him,

       The Winekworth Sherwood jibe

       Our concerns have nothing to do with the.fact that Ms Adlington is employed rather than in
       private practice. As this response indicates, we have respectfully drawn attention to a
       number o f inadvertent inaccuracies in h e r:submissions to you and the continuation of
       wholly unsubstantiated allegations of “deception” of the Director and counsel advising him
       in 1990 that have been thoroughly investigated during the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny and
       rejected.

Lord Williams of Mostyn QC
Attorney General’s Chambers

London SW1E 6JP

11thNovember 1999

Dear Attorney,

Regina v Duckenfield and Murray

1      I am the solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group, and laid the
       informations alleging crimes on the part of the above named at the Leeds District
       Magistrates Court in July 1998. As such I was the prosecutor before the matter was
       committed for trial in July 1999, and I continue to act as instructing solicitor.

2      I write to set out the Crown’s submissions on the application by Mr Duckenfield to
       you to enter a nolle prosequi in relation to counts 4 and 5 on the indictment currently
       before the Crown Court sitting at Leeds. A copy of the signed indictment is attached
       for ease of reference.

The Attorney’s position

3     Although the application is addressed to you, we appreciate that you cannot take the
      decision in this matter in the light of the principles set out in Re Pinochet No 2,
      because you personally advised the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1990 that no
      criminal prosecutions should be instituted. Neither can the matter, in our submission,
      be delegated to the Crown prosecution Service, which would then be invited to act as
      iudex in sua causa. However, we nonetheless invite you to take note of the contents
      of this letter particularly in relation to the written advice of August 1990.

Procedural aspects

4     The Crown Prosecution Office came to the view that there was no prima facie case on
      what is now count 4 on the indictment. However, the CPS initially declined to
      interfere in the prosecution on those charges having decided it would not interfere
      with the prosecution on the manslaughter charges. The Divisional Court ordered a
      reconsideration.



                                              1

Accordingly, the CPS, acting through Christopher Mr Newell, reconsidered its
previous decision, and took over and discontinued the prosecution in relation to the
charge which is now count 4 of the indictment. It is apparent that the decision was
based upon the opinion of Mr Newell that there was insufficient evidence to
constitute a prima facie case on that charge.

Procedural irregularity

Unfortunately, the CPS did not give us an opportunity to make fresh submissions
upon the question of sufficiency of evidence. The Crown regards this, therefore, as a
decision flawed by procedural impropriety and a breach of natural justice. If they had
provided such an opportunity, we would have referred to the statement of Graham
Kelly, enclosed, which we did not have when we made our representations to the CPS
in October 1998.

The prosecution did not seek judicial review of the CPS decision for the following
reasons:

       (a) We had “alternative remedies”, such as the ability to put these counts on
       the indictment in the event of committal by virtue of section 2(2) of the
       Administration of Justice ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933. This potential
       remedy would no doubt have led to the refusal of relief even if the Divisional
       Court had agreed with us as a matter of substance.

       (b) We were afraid of delay. After service of process in July 1998, the
       defendants have delayed these criminal proceedings by a variety of devices.
       They applied to the CPS to take over and discontinue the proceedings.
       Having failed, they applied in February for judicial review, arguing, among
       other things, that the CPS decision not to take over and discontinue the entire
       case was irrational. A further application for judicial review by us, launched in
       April 1999, would have caused further unacceptable delay in the hearing of
       these proceedings.

       (c) We were afraid of cost. The South Yorkshire Police Authority agreed in
        1998 to fund the entire criminal defence of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray,
       including out of pocket expenses, and was willing, it appears, to fund ancillary
       applications for judicial review. Two applications for judicial review have
       been brought by the defendants, one of the decision of the CPS, another of the
       decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority in March 1999. The first of
       these they lost. The second of these argued that the Authority had been wrong
       to decide, in February 1999, that it had no power to grant financial assistance.
       In this they succeeded. They were then given their costs by SYPA of
       applying, for the most part unsuccessfully, for review of the CPS decision
       Another application mooted was an application for judicial review of a
       decision of the South Sefton Magistrate Court in July 1998 in relation to an
       application for their costs. Summonses had originally been brought there by
       the prosecution, but dropped because, though the court had jurisdiction to hear
       the case, no process existed to compel the defendants to appear there.
The changed legal context

8      The position is now different. In the light of the CPS decision, the prosecution
       decided not to attempt to reinstate the charges at committal. The defendants were
       committed for trial on the charges of manslaughter and misfeasance, having argued
       unsuccessfully that there was no case to answer, and that the proceedings were an
       abuse of process.

9      Pursuant to the 1933 Act, and on the advice of leading counsel counts 4 and 5 were
       added to the indictment by the Crown after committal as charges disclosed on the
       committal documents. Count 5 is entirely new. It is based upon the same facts, but
       was never considered by the CPS. The transcripts of evidence given by the
       defendants to Lord Taylor and the Inquest were in evidence at committal, and those of
       Mr Duckenfield contained admissions to telling lies to the Taylor Inquiry as part of
       his evidence about the disaster generally.

10     The Crown wishes also to emphasise that, where a prosecution is discontinued under
       section 23 (3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, by virtue of section 23 (6);

               “The discontinuance of any proceedings by virtue of this section shall not
               prevent the institution of fresh proceedings in respect of the same offence.”

11     This subsection does not even contain a requirement for fresh evidence to come to
       light before fresh proceedings are instituted.

Alternative remedies fo r the defence; the powers o f the judge

12     Even if there were insufficient evidence to support a case to answer on those counts
       disclosed on the committal papers, the judge could grant a voluntary bill on
       indictment on those counts if there was sufficient evidence now available. He himself
       referred to this power in the preliminary hearing of 3rd September 1999, and has set
       aside time in the week of 20th December to hear argument on this matter, should the
       application for a nolle prosequi fail. We enclose a copy of his observations on that
       matter on 3rd September 1999.

13    If the Crown is wrong in its position, which is entirely a matter of law, Mr
       Duckenfield’s remedy is to ask Hooper J. to quash those counts. The judge can hear
       oral argument and is therefore in a much better position than Mr Newell to assess as a
       matter of law whether or not aprima facie case is made out on those charges. It is
       beyond argument that Hooper J. can quash those counts under the Administration of
       Justice ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 or by way of abuse of process; see R v
       Bedwelty JJ ex parte Williams [1997] AC 225.

14    Further, the judge has set aside four days from 4thJanuary 2000 for a full abuse of
       process hearing. The judge has ample power to find that it is an abuse of process to
       prosecute for those offences, even if they are sound in law.
15     It is not accepted that, since the powers conferred by the 1933 Act, whatever had been
       the position at common law, a nolle prosequi can be entered on selected counts in
       relation to an indictment. It was surely the intention of Parliament that the power of
       the Attorney-General, exercisable without the power to hear submissions or evidence,
       exists to prevent a trial; not to quash individual counts. The power in relation to
       individual counts is surely the prerogative of the judge.

The merits o f the application

16    On the merits of the application, it is the submission of the Crown that the case
      against Mr Duckenfield on counts 4 and 5 is very strong. It will be noted by the
      Attorney-General that the letter of Winkworth and Sherwood of 13thOctober fails
      utterly to deal with the substance of the case or the strength of the charges. Our
      representations of 2ndOctober deal with the facts, and the enclosed statements of
      Kirton and Kelly throw further light on the matter.

17    We are surprised that the defence solicitors should not have enclosed copies of the
      annexes to our representations of Septemberl998. You are asked to exercise a
      discretion, which, as Winkworth and Sherwood should know, must be exercised in
      the light of all the circumstances of the case. You will note that the prosecution
      produced abundant primary material to show that the DPP decided not to prosecute in
       1990 on the basis of selected statements, some of which had been improperly edited
      to exclude statements by South Yorkshire police officers. It is necessary to look at the
      actual excisions to appreciate the significance of the deception.

18     In all the circumstances it would be wholly inappropriate for a nolle prosequi to be
        entered for counts 4 and 5 of the current indictment.

The advice o f leading counsel to the DPP in 1990

19     Although for some reason the advice of leading counsel to the DPP in 1990 has been
       sent to the South Yorkshire police, who retain a copy, and has been disclosed to Lord
       Justice Stuart-Smith, who quoted it in part in the report of his “Scrutiny” in 1998, it
       has not been disclosed to the Crown in the prosecution of this case.

20     It is believed that the DPP was given a misleading account in the final West Midlands
       Police Report about the question of gates being forced. Paragraph 8 of the
       representations made by the prosecution on 9thOctober 1998 refers to this. It is
       believed that the attention of leading counsel in 1990 could not have been directed to
       the true facts. The Attorney is invited in his capacity as statutory superintendent of
       the Director of Public Prosecutions to invite the CPS to waive privilege in respect of
       this advice, so that the judge can determine the abuse of process application on 4th
       January, and the motion to quash on 20th December, on a fully informed basis.
The Winkworth and Sherwoodjibe

21     The final paragraph of Winkworth’s letter to you of 13thOctober contains an
       apparently gratuitous jibe, alleging, without giving particulars, that I have made
       misrepresentations. This is connected with the fact that I am employed, rather than in
       private practice.

22     I have asked Winkworths for an explanation of this, and for the provision of an
        example of a misrepresentation that I have made, but have received no reply. I
        enclose a copy of the ruling by Mr Cadbury, the Leeds stipendiary magistrate,
        dismissing the argument that the prosecution was an abuse of process, and upholding
       the integrity and motives of the prosecution.

23     I should, in turn, be grateful to be given an opportunity to deal with any new matters
        raised by the defendants in reply to this letter.

24     I shall be pleased to deal with any queries arising out of this letter.

Yours faithfully,



Ann Adlington

   We write with the benefit of Mr William Clegg QC’s advice, on behalf of David ,
   Duckenficld to invite you to enter a nolle prosequi in relation to two counts of an indictment *
   he faces at the Crown Court sitting at Leeds.

   The defendant was the senior police officer in charge of the Hillsborough Stadium at the ■
   time of the disaster in April 1989 when 95 supporters died as the result of crushing. He has j
   been committed for trial on three counts by the Magistrates Court, two counts Of
   manslaughter and one of misfeasance in public office. Wc do not invite you to enter a nolle
   prosequi in relation to these counts.

   The remaining two counts of the indictment contain allegations of falsely telling persons
   inquiring into the causes of the disaster, that the crash had been caused by spectators who
   had broken down a gate, and of failure to corrcct the false belief relating to that cause,
   induced by the alleged statements. Two counts arc based on these allegations, firstly, a
   charge of making statements tending and intended to pervert die course Of justice, and
   secondly, misconduct in public officc. It is the history of these allegations that prompt this I
   invitation.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <

                                                                                                  l
   Originally the defendant was summoned on four charges, the three now represented by the ’
   (ir.st three counts of the indictment and a fourth chargc alleging that Duckenfield did an act •
   w h i c h had a tendency to p e r v e r t the course of justice.                               ^

   On the 1st July 1998 we invited the Director of Public Prosecution to take over the conduct
   of the proceedings under Section 6 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and to
   discontinue them under Section 23. On the 18th December 1998 the Crown Prosecution

      February 1999 which stated, in reference to the allegations that Duckcnfield had done an act
      attempting to pervert the course of justice:-

              “I had formed the view that there was clearly no case to answer on that charge.”

      There followed an application for judicial review before the High Court, judgment being
      given on the         March 1999. Mr Newell writing on behalf of the Director swore an
      affidavit that dealt with the position of partial intervention at paragraph 5 and 6. The Court         j
      having considered the matter quashed the decision of the Director 80 far as it related to the          '
      charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice.

     Thereafter the Director reconsidered the question of intervention and discontinuance of that 1
     charge and by letter dated the I2lh April 1999 concluded:-                                   ]

              “I have decided that the C.P.S. should take over that single charge in order to
              discontinue it... The reason is that there is clearly no case to answer on that charge”.

     The committal then proceeded on the three remaining charges and Duckenfield was
     committed for trial on the 20111 July 1999. Thereafter an indictment was settled which
     inctuded the original charge discontinued by the Director and a further charge relating to the
     same allegation.

     It is against this background that the request is made for a nolle prosequi in relation to those            |
     two counts.

     The decision to discontinue the proceedings was made by the Director in the context of the
     judicial review decision after hearing lengthy representations by both sides. It was not a
     decision that was subject to any further application for judicial review, by the prosecutor.                j

     If the only charge being faced by Duckenfield had been the charge discontinued by the
     Director then clearly there could be no question of any indictment embracing those                          j
     allegations and the effect of the decision to discontinue would be to end the proceedings in                I
     relation to that allegation. This, I anticipate, was the expectation of the Director.

     To permit the prosecutor to reinstate those charges in the form of counts four and five in the                  ,
     indictment would be to permit the prosecutor to effectively negate the decision of the
     Director to discontinue. It is only the fact that in respect of other charges, not the subject of
     this application, Duckenfield happened to be committed for trial independently of the
     charges discontinued, that rendered this course of action possible. Clearly the ability to
     indict a person ought not to be dependant upon circumstances such as those found in this
     case.

     We do not believe that there has ever been a case in the past where an indictment has been
     drawn including charges previously the subject of a decision by the Director to discontinue.
     It is submitted that the situation is unique and ought to be remedied by the entering of a
     nolle prosequi in relation to counts 4 and 5 of the indictment. This would have the effect of
     preserving the decision of the Director in relation to the allegations that are reflected in the

     charges that he discontinued while permitting a trial to proceed in relation to the three
     remaining charges that were not discontinued by the Director.

     Fndosed with this letter is a copy of the indictment, a copy of the representation made by
     each of the parties to the Director, the first decision of the Director and his subsequent
     reasoned decision, the Affidavit of Mr Newell, the judgment of the Divisional Court and the
     subsequent decision of the Director pursuant to that ruling.

     A copy of this letter is being sent personally to Ms A. Adlington the prosecutor. She has
     not instructed solicitors in private practice to act for her but is herself an employed solicitor
     with the Liverpool City Council. Wc ask for an opportunity to respond to any
     representations she chooses to make as in the past representations by the prosecutor have
     inadvertently contained factual inaccuracies.

On S a t u r d a y    15th April         1989,      I was a wa re       that a C up Semi F inal               was

being     played at         the H i l l s b o r o u g h G r o u n d    b e tw e e n N o t t i n g h a m F o re s t a nd

L iv er pool.



In my o c c u p a t i o n    I have        quite a lot to do w i t h C o ur a g e B r e w e r i e s and

had been ab'iUf to o bt ai n a c o m p l i m e n t a r y t icket                  to go a nd w a t c h the

game.      The       ticket was        free     but had a face v al ue of £14 a nd was                        for

s eating     in^'t'frie N o r t h S t a n d     near    to the L a ppings Ln end.                      I was also

aware     of a frien                                , who was also            t r a v el l in g w i t h a

complimentary           ticket.



O n the day of the m a t c h a                coach      party of       i nv it ed guests met at a bout

1130 hours,          m ys el f     included,        for a c o m p l i m e n t a r y    r ec ep t io n at the

H a l l a m T ow er s Post H o us e Hotel              on the M a n c h e ^ e r Road.              In a d d it i o n to

knowi ng                           , I a l so met a no t he r          friend,                              who    I did

not know had a c o m p l i m e n t a r y            ticket.       Although         I did not drink m ys el f

there was al co ho l             a v a il ab le ,   although       nobo dy was         d ri n ki n g    in a m a nn er

other     than what         I would        call     socially.



Having     had a meal            and drink a bout           f if ty of us w o u l d have set off on

the    coach arid got            to our      car    park at a bo ut          1430 hours.           I could        not

remember       the name of the              coach nor what             time we        left    the hotel       but the

traffic,       as you w ou ld e xpect               on a Semi Final            day,     was    quite      heavy.        I

r emember      the     coach was         p arked     in a car         park   next      to the G i ld er s

V o l k s w a g e n Garage,       M i d d l e w o o d Rd,   Hi 1 1s b o r o u g h , a nd from there           I

w a l k e d down to the g r o u n d w i t h                       and



As we w a l k e d down M i d d l e w o o d Rd a nd L e p p i ng s              Ln,     towards         the entrance,

I was     s u r p r i s e d by the       number      of fans      lining       the S t re e t s        in view of
                                                                                                             PAGE         3
                                                                                                             S2147

the     time    to kick       off.         The fans        in this a r e a were L i v e r po o l         fans,        I

could tell         by their a c c e n t s         and scarves.



One     thing    I found w h i c h was            to ta l ly the o p p o s i t e       to   last year's Semi

F inal    was    that    this year a large                 number      of fans were a s ki n g         for    spare

tickets,        wh er ea s    last year          there was        very few        people w a n d e r i n g a bout

in the v i c i n i t y of the ground.                    In the five m i n u t e walk            to the g r ou n d

it was     clear       f rom the      numb^c^of          people a s k i n g       for tick et s     that about

7 0 or 80       p e op le I p as se d w a n t e d        tickets.



On the w a y down to the                g ro un d     I also      saw a m i n o r i t y     of fans who were

drinking        from    cans     on the      route.         I saw no d r u nk e nn e ss a n d no disorder.



I cannot        recall       s e e i n g a n y P ol ic e    on the w ay to the g r ou n d but                being

aware     of the g r o u n d       I did not          need d i r e c t i o n s    to   it so w o u l d have had

no need to look for Police.



I wo til'd have a r r i v e d        in the       v i c i n it y of the L e p p i ^ q s Lft\e nt ran c e at

g r o u n d 14iS5-144Q hours.               At    that     time    the e nt r an c e ways we\e a m as s of

As    I came down I saw there a p p e a r e d to Jbe very few P ol ic e for that

As    I got     in the e n t r a n c e ways,           having a t t e n d e d      the g r ou n d before,         I

      w ent      th ro ug h the t u r n s t i l e      f u r t h es t    to the     left.     As   I approached                the

      turnstile         so the a r e a      became        tight         packed,     so m uc h so that         I could not

      even       push and j ostle my way through.                          It was     like an      i n vo l u n t a r y

      movement         towards      the    turnstile.



      As   I neared the t u r n s t i l e           I t hough t          I would     get m y ticket         out so         I

      tightly        packed that          I could not move my arms.



      It w o u l d     have   t a ke n me a bout          ten m i n u t e s    to get t h ro u g h the          crowd a nd

      o ut s i d e a n d   it must        have    been \ b o u t         1 4 45-1430 hours w h e n we           sat       down.



      It was s ho r t l y a fter           si tt in g iiown that             the    players     came out.          The only

      thTng''l''-Hcecal 1 n o t i c h a          was    the     central       terracing        in L e p p i n g s Ln was

W   l , very full and the outer                  s'ide t er ra ce s were            quite e mpty w i t h        plenty of

      room for more           fans.



      I n ot i c e d nothing more as                I c en tr ed my a t t e n t i o n on the            players and

      looked fo rw ar d         to the game.



      It w o u l d have       been s h o r t l y a f te r        kick off          that    I n o ti ce d fans were

      c limbing        over   the    peri me te r       fence from the L e p p i n g s Ln t erraces.                       The

      first       few fans who        had    climbed over                looked a l mo s t    comical,        they were

running       to a n d from P o l i c e O fficer s.                 S om e    of the fans        that      followed

them were          not so full        of    life and a p p e a r e d          to    collapse.          I could not

u n d e r s t a n d what was       g oing      on but    I reme mb er          the L i v e r po o l     g o a l ke e pe r

the       pitch.



The scene          that was       c arrying       on was      chaos,         n obody a p p e a r e d to know

what was        going on a n d        n obody a p p e a r e d to take               charge.


      \


I part'J'e^ilarly noted a_______ ed response                           to what was going                on by the

P ol i ce    on thf track.            The S t e w ar d s      did    not a p p e a r     to be doing

anything        but   I was       un aw ar e    of    their    role      so did not know w h a t               they

s h ou l d have done.



I remember          one   incident         in par ti c ul a r       that      o c c u r r e d a bout    1510 hours -

1515 hours.           I saw four           fans      on the    pitch side of the                p erimeter

fe n ci ng     pulling at         the f encing         in what a p p e a r e d        to me\to         be an a tt e mp t

to rip the fencing^jiown.                      I m m e d i a t e l y b e hi n d these fans wfesTe four

P o l i c e O f f i c e r s who a p p ^ r e d        to be doing         nothing.           I r em e mb e r the

P o l i c e m a n on the f u r t he st         side    of the four            kept    pulling     the one fan

off the f encing            by his      shirt.         The    fan,     each time         he was        released,

just       ret ur ne d a nd    t ried to        pull at       the    fence again.             This went          on for

a couple        of m in u t e s    until       assumably       the P o l i c e       r e al is ed what was

going       on and s ta r t e d     to join          in a nd h el p the fans.



I c o n ti nu ed to w a t c h       the     chaos and w o u l d have seen three or four-

p eople      being given          heart m as s a g e     but    could not s p e c i f i c a l l y          desc ri be

the       incidents.        By a b ou t     1525 hours,         I s t a r t e d to       realise        the full

scale       of the disaster.               I had seen three              or four       bodies     being t aken

              up.      I assumed        these     people were           dead.



              I was a ware a n n o u n c e m e n t s were             being made        over    the P u bl i c a d dr es s     but

              could not d e c i ph er what was                being said.             Having     seen the b odies          pass,

              we d e c i d e d we s h o u l d     leave.

              v e h i c le s were a l r e a d y     d rawn up.          The o nl y thing         I recall      of note was

              the     number       of d i s t r e s s e d fans who w er e           c le arly blaming       the P ol ic e      for

the L ep pi ng s LN end was               a«mpty in comparison.



At about 2 .45           pm (1445)        eight Liverpool    supporters          came to the front

of the kop and a sked to be transferred.                      The      kop end was all           but full

and    it was      obvious      to the N o t t i n g h a m Forest     s upporters       that    the fans

were    from Liverpool.



The    fans     came to number 2 gate             policed by 446            OOliE >     At this     time

               When        had dealt w ith this               I made my wary back         to the t r a c k , and at

At this time         it was        chaos/^n the       radio w i t h muc h of the^-Conversation

being shouted and            it a p p e a r e d    that    no one     realisedXwhat was           happening,



I still       thought     it was a pitcj^/invasion a n d when a N o t t i n g h a m

s up porter      jumped onto         the      tch he w e s c o r t e d            from the ground.         3^

saw numerous Liverpool                fans on tjy^ pitch taunting                   the Nott i ngh^»^ fans

and the N ot ti n g h a m         fans,    also    unaware       of how serious        the     incident was

were     shouting and taunting               the Liverpool          fans.         Because    of the

s upporters       on the     pitch someone,           I don't know who,              decided that

officers        form a line across            the    pitch along         the      halfway    line to keep

the s upporters apart.                At    this    time    I was     still       not aware    of the

s ev er i t y of the      incident.          I thought a fence              had    collapsed wit h a

resulting        pitch invasion and was               still jyxpecting the game to

cont inue         It wasn't         until    the Amb uV an ce        came    onto           pitch a nd the

suppo rt er s     started tearing            up a dv er ti si ng      hoardings       to use as

s tretche rs      that    I realised that            persons were           injured.



C hief      I n s p e c j / 6 r BEAL then instructed sey^ral                officers,       including

The    vast m aj or it y are     decent and well             behaved but as on previous

o casions      there    is an idiot m in or it y         that drink         heavily and         cause

problems-         On the    previous      o cc asion Liverpool             a tt en de d    in Janu ar y

a r r e s t e d a very drunken supporter who                 had found his way              into    the

Sheffield       end.



In c o n cl us io n    I feel   that      this semi~>Pi nal was            not as           1 o r g a n is e d

as on previous occasions.                 The r eza p ,p e a r e d    to be a             of officers

doing jrothing,         as we were        on the track,         and      could have jfcreen better

employed-         I have found out that m an power was                     reduced           107., this

o b v i o u s l y had an effect.          And also several             publ i c t u s e s    near      to the

g ro un d were     open and serving          up to kick off             time,    surely they should

have    been a d v is ed to      close     or serve only to              regulars.



On a previous          occasion this        season when S h e f f i e l d W e d n es da y          played

M a nc h e s t e r United    in a League       game      I was a g ai n working            perimeter

track w hen       in company w ith PC 2 2 S 9 G R E E N we             informed     control        of a

build up of Manc he st er          Un it ed supporters               on the Kop with S h e f f i e l d

supporters.           With PC G R E E N    I went     out onto Pen is to ne RD and there

were    no officers working            on turnstiles and M an ch e s t e r                supporters were

bui ld in g    up outside       the ground.         We    informed        control     on several

occ as io ns    but nothing was           done.     When M a n c h e s t e r    scored the

in evitable       happened the Manch es te r             contingent        started to        celebrate

and a fight        took     place whe n several           people were arrested-                  It does

not a ppear       that any      lessons were         learnt      from this,        clearly m an power

sh or ta ge at the Hop end was              responsible          for this       problem.



I also     feel    that morg      details      could havae                   passed over         the
         PA/tanr
public a ddress s ^ t e m         to   late s u p p o r t e r / a n d     Police    to keep

supp or te rs       calm and    informed.



In concl usion          it would appear         that the Liverpool                supporters         for

w ha t ev e r    reason a r r iv ed m uc h    later than the N o t t i n g h a m fans and they

a p p e a r e d to all     congregate      in the       centre     sect io n of the Leppings                  LN

stand.



F ro m what       I saw after      the game        it w as > D b v i o u s   that     numerous

Li verpool        supporters were        the w o r y f for d r i n k , from past e xperience                        I

know that at a NO RM AL m a tc h thj/se pe ople w o u ld not have gained entry

but w o ul d have        been either a rr es te d or            refused entry.



I k now that speaking             to other      officers who were               on turnstile           duty

that    they had to a ll ow          people     into the gr ou nd who               normally w ould           not

have    gained entry.            I was    told of 4 officers                 covering 5 turnstiles

and that         to take 2 officers away to arrest                     someone w ould have

s e v e r e l y d ep leted the     strength.



My    previous       comments     regarding        the M an ch e s t e r     U ni t e d m atch       I believe

are    relevant to this           game.      O b v i o u s l y L iverpool       supporters           had bought

tickets         for the N o t t i n g h a m end,    I g enuinely         feel     that     if the m a tc h

had    p r og ressed as normal           we would have          had severe          problems w ith

f ighting        etc.    The   s e g r e ga ti on on the      "Kop"      is not very good and                 it

w ou l d have       taken many more        officers        than were d ep l o y e d to have

done     it successfully.



I h o ne s tl y feel       that the general           stajp*fard of o r ga ni s a t i o n at this

m a tch was       not as good as         I have^eviously               e x p e r i e n c e d.   As    I have

s ta te d there a pp ea re d to          be too many officers                 doing nothing,           whilst

others were          o bviously     rushed off their            feet.

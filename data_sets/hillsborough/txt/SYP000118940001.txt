           I am Detective C o n stable 2369 Blake,                      presently stationed at

           E c c l es fi el d Police Stat i o n »

           1 have wo r k e d at F D i v i s i o n for           11 years,       10 years     of w hich were

           spent at Ft Division.                   During that        period    I worked at almost            every

           match at S h ef fi el d W ed ne s d a y G r o u n d , having spent some time working

           as a C om mu n i t y C o n stable around the                ground,    I am very familiar with

           the    layout and practices               involved      in big m atch operations.

           At    1 0 a m (1000)   on Saturday,            15 April,     1989    ( 150489)    I a t t e n d e d the

           S he ff i e l d W e d n e s da y ground and was            present    during     the briefing.

           My specific duties were                  in the gym n a s i u m under the s u p e r v i s i o n of DS

           L i nd le y and working alongside DC                   1724 and TDC Stoker.             Our   team's

           brief was to take             reports      of crime,       namely     pickpockets       etc from

           complainants.           That was to take             place wi t h i n the gym and to that                 end

           a small       'office*      was       set up.

           1 remained        in the      gym area from 10.3 0 a m (1030)             to 2 pm    (1400)       when a

           number of       complainants            came    in reporting        crime.     One   particular

           complaint       I dealt wit h was about 2 . 40pm                 (1440)      when three men handed

           to me three         tickets w hich were             obv i o u s l y forged.      The men had been

                                  - stewards        from the Leppings Lane              end and    referred to

                                   took      possession        of these     tickets and; detai 1 s «           It

tr anspired that         these men,     all    from the C h e s t e r f i e l d area,         were

neutral    supporters.

About 3pm       (1500)    I took the three men from the gym to a nearby exit

when    I heard the       roar of the       crowd as the m atch kicked off.                      Walking

back to the g y m , I saw a uniform sergeant,                       a man     1 know to be a

Detective Sergeant          Morton,     o b viously working            in uniform,         run from the

playing area between the N orth and East                      stands and           passed me.        He

looked very shaken and out of breath.                        Another        uniform officer          said

to him something          like   " W h a t ’s the m a t t e r ? "     He    replied      "There's

peo pie ge11 i ng killed down the r e .               I t ’s a riot."

I walked     down the w al k w a y between the Hop and North                        stand and onto

the    perimeter    track at that          corner.       I saw across             the   pitch,   a number

of    people spilling       onto    the pitch,        through an open gate and over the

perimeter       fencing.

A number     of supporters         together wit h Police              officers were walking

across    the    pitch towards       us.      I could see           the supporters were walking

wounded,     a number      of them obv i o u s l y     in pain and distress.                  A Police

officer wit h one of these supporters                    said       "They're       getting killed

down there       in the    crush."

I decided to go and be of a ss i s t a n c e             to the       injured and at that             time

joined by DC Hall          and TDC Stoker.            I ran across           the    pitch to the

Leppings Lane       terraces.

As    I arri v e d at the    perimeter        fencing      behind and just              to the    left of

the goal,       I could not believe what              I was     seeing.           There were a sea of

faces    pressed against         the square metal mesh.                    Most    of them,      I would

say twenty       in number,      were   blue.       The i r faces were             bloated and their

eyes    bulging.     M a n y of them were         v o mitting        through the mesh.             The

full    horror    of the sight was          i mmediately apparent.                  There were at

 east    fifteen of that twenty dead.                  The    remaining five or so taking

,he i r last     breath.     Unif o r m Police        officers were           fr a n t i c a l l y trying

                                                                                                    R233

to pull    casualties        out of the open gate             into that section but               the

force    from behind was so great              that    people against           the    fence     could

not move one       inch either        to their    left    or    right,       even w i t h i n    reach of

the open gate.

My    immediate    reaction was        simply one       of horror.           I thought       that    I

w a s n ’t t h e r e , I was watching        it from a distance whilst                not     really

being    the r e , as though       it was a video        recording.           It couldn't         happen

at Hillsborough,          it c o u l d n ’t happen to me and           it couldn't          possibly

happen    in front of your           eyes.

The    sight   is one     I will     remember and will          no doubt never           forget.          The

most    upsetting       thing   looking back was         the fact that           these      people,

squashed against          the metal were w i t h i n       inches      of you,        in fact you

could touch them,           but do nothing       to help them.           They were          dying    in

front of you and wit h all             the will       in the world nothing              could be done,

Some    people were       being    hauled out of the           crowd,    through the open,

narrow gate,       and handed back           to a chain of Police             officers.          I joined

the    chain and body after body passed through my hands.                              At    the end of

the    chain were a number           of officers,       a m b ulance    staff and supporters,

checking for       vital     signs    of life but       few showed a n y .

It was all       very    confusing     but    I remember       above the din           and death an

officer    inside       the terrace shouted           "This     o n e ’salive".         The     limp form

was    passed along       the   line and I took         p o ssession of         it pulling        the

injured man a few feet             into   the g o a l m o u t h of the       pitch together w ith

a unifor med officer,           I checked for         signs    of    life.      There were        none.

The    officer    inside     the terrace had w i t n e s s e d the           last     breath of this

man.     I pumped his        chest,    and thumped       it.        I breathed air          into him

but after a few minu t e s           realised    it was a useless             gesture.          There

w e re d a z e d , crying    fans all around.           I stood up and           looked around me

      the full    extent     of the tragedy.          Little        pockets of        people,     Police,

s t e w a r d s , supporters were all         beating    the    chest of hor izontal

victims,       kissing    life    into the dead.              At    one time    I remember       seeing a

casualty a p p ar en tl y brought          to    life by a uniform officer,                PC Hanson

from    *F ’ Division.



fly personal      victim was       lying dead at my feet.

A group of supporters             brought a large a d v e r t i s e m e n t         hoarding and

placed    "my b o d y ’ on the stretcher.                I told them to leave him where he

was and     look for one alive,            a casualty           for who they         could do

something.        One    of the supporters               punched me at the side            of the head

on my    right    ear and f r a n t ically started yelling                     "Leave him,      he's

alive,    he's    fucking breathing,            he wants an ambulance".                  There was       no

point    in reasoning with this group.                       They were all          screaming,    crying

m any of them      reeking of beer.             They were so grief              stric k e n that       there

was    no way they were going            to listen to              reason.     They    put my body on

the hoarding and          ran off w ith him towards                  the Kop end.

I went back       to the human chain             in      the vain hope that a real              living

supporter w ould be         passed out but               it w a s n ’t the case. 5,10,15,20.

T hey all      passed through the          line,         all    o b viously dead. Like          the

casualty       I tried to    resuscitate,             they all       looked the same.           They were

all    blue and bloated.           I c a n ’t recollect any of their                   faces    only blue

bodies all       looking    the same a g e , the same                size and weight.

The    only faces       I can recall were             those of the P o l i c e m e n and women.

Officers who       I had wo r k e d with for years all                  busying       themselves with

what    they    could but all wit h the               same     look.    They we re startled,

shocked,       bewildered,       but all    looking          the same,       like    busy androids.

Some were       crying.     I know how they felt.                    I wanted to cry       in

f rustration at         not being able          to do anything.              I looked towards          the

perimeter       fence where       the faces       had been          pressed against.           There were

to    faces.     The    pressure from behind had been released an d they had

fallen back onto a pile of other                      bodies.

I r em e m b & red TV         clips    of the h o 1ocaust             in the Second W o r 1d War,                  p i 1es

of bodies m a r s h a l l e d         into a heap by bulldozers.                         I was      looking at             the

same thing.              T here must        have    been 40 bodies               still    piled up and almost

as many ha n d e d          back.       It was then          I think that            1 just w a n t e d      to run

awa y and         leave     it all.         The    e n o r m i t y of the tragedy had just                   unfolded

but     still        I r ef u s e d to be 1 ieve       it.

As    1 stood,          b ew il d e r e d not     really know i n g what             to d o , I heard a

ho r rible        scream.        I looked a r o u n d and saw a casualty being                            lifted by

well     mean i n g      fans onto a hoarding.                  His       left    leg was o b v i o u s l y broken

been     in some         real    pain.      I    helped      place him on the hoarding and

carried him to the exit across                         the     pitch.         1 knew the -ambulances

would      be a r r iv in g      s ho r t l y at    the P e n i s t o n e Road end.

T og e t h e r    w i th the supporters,              we    carried        the    casualty to an area by

the     side      of the      gym.     For       the next 20 minu t e s             or so     1 assisted         in

o rg a n i s i n g     c a sualties wit h the a m b u l a n c e            staff.        Most      of the

casualties             at that are a were           bre a t h i n g   okay but suffering                from broken

b o nes .

relatives and friends                  of       ’missing'     people.            This we did taking

reports          etc    for about      5 fours        before     going        to the gym           inside    the

        of f icers a ss i g n e d           to each b o d y .            This      I did until      being    relieved at

        2 am   (0200).

        In c on c l u s i o n the m o o d of the                    fans     was    of horror    but      also    of

        a ggression.              As well         as   w an t i n g      to get     to the Forest         fans,    they were

        a g g r es s i v e   towards Police,                  a mb ul a n c e    staff and stewards alike.

        T here     is little              doubt    that       their        b e h aviour was mad© worse            by   the fact

        that many of the                   fans    1   dealt w i t h on the pitch               itself     had been

        d r i nking heavily.                 Many      were         so o b v i o u s l y    drunk    that they were

        s tagger i n g »

        Their      behaviour was              very strange               I thought,         in view of the fact              that

        they had just w i t n e s s e d such horror.                               They seemed      now    intent      on

        reprisal        agai n s t         everyone          else     in the       ground    rather    than quiet

        I cannot make                comment       on radio           procedure as          1 did not have access               to

        one.       L i k e w i s e w i th     regards          to the stewards,              because      I had nothing             to

        do w i t h     them.

        I do not know the                   names      of any of the               deceased     I dealt w ith and            nor

        can I descr i b e             them.        For       some     reason       their    faces   have    been erased

        seem sketchy              in places.             I    believe         t h e reason    is,   that     1arge chunks

        of that        day's         events are missing                  from my memory.            S p e cific    details

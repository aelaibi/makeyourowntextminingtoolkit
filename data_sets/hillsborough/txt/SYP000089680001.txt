                I am a married man and I live at the above address.



                A short time after the disaster at the Hillsborough Football ground,                    I

                was interviewed by two Police Officers from the West Midlands Police

                and I completed a Supporters Questionnaire for the Hillsborough

                Judicial    Inquiry.



                Further to the information contained in my Supporters Questionnaire,                    I

                can add the following in regards to my experiences at the football

                game held at Hillsborough on the 15th April                 1989 (150489).
                                                                                                       PAGE      2

           on the coach were known to me as I used to live in Garston, although I

           knew these people by sight,            I could not give their details.



           The details I know of the other passengers on the coach are as follows

           a lad calle              who was with me on the terraces.                  I only know

           because I stand bv him at Anfield.                 I d o n ’t know his s u r na me.




           As previously stated I was involved                    the crush outside the ground

           and eventually I was pulled out o y the crush by a mounted Police.

           situated to the rightyfiand side of the terrace turnstiles.                             I now know

           this gate to be gaj^fe *C * .         It was some time between 2.5Q pm (145Q) a nd

           2.55 pm ( 1 4 5 5 n I entered the ground.                           C            C      >



           After entering the ground,            I went down the tunnel with                               and

                   the lad I know from Anfield.              We went down the tunnel            because I

           thought that the tunnel was the only entrance to the terraces.                               It was

           my intention to get onto the terraces and make my way across to

           the left hand side of the terraces on the N stand side of the ground

           to view the game.



           All three of us had free passage a long theyxunnel up to its end, where

           the tunnel joined the Leppings Ln terr ac es , t h e n                  I could see the
                                                                      PAGE
                                                                      S3394

terraces were very crowded.       We pushed our way into the crowd and

tried to work our way over to the left.        As we got onto the back of

the terraces   I could see that the players were on the pitch for their

kick about.



We had only pushed our way into the back of pen n u ^ e r    four for a

distance of a few feet when there was a sudd$n>>gurge f rom behind.

This surge pushed me further over to the left and at the same time it

spun me around and I ended up looking up into the W Stand above the

terraces.



I suspect that the surge was caused by more people coming        into pen

number four from the tunnel.



At the same time as I was spun around by this surge,       I felt that the

pressure from the crowd around me had increased compacting people

tighter together.



I managed to turn around to face the pitch again, although the crush

had increased.     I could still move although only very limited.      As I

turned around the players were still having their kick about.



Shortly after I had turned myself around,       I felt ano Vier strong surge

from behind,   this surge pushed me forwards and(|fijXher over to my left

to a position about halfway down the terracing.



I have marked two positions on a separate grid plan which I produce

(Ex No         )(Ref No      *1>, these two positions a re marked as number

(1) and number two    (2).
                                                                                               PAGE           4
                                                                                               S3394

                Position number one    (1)    is    the position I was   in after   the first surge

                where    I was spun around to       face the W Stand.    I cannot be precise

                about the time I was    in this position other than to say it was just

                after the players had come          out onto the pitch for the kick      about.



                Position number two    (2)    is    the position I was in after     the second

                surge.     I was about half way down the terraces, and the dividing fence

                between pen number four and pen five was about eight feet away to my

                left hand side.     In position two       (2)   I was standing with a barrier to

                my back, although on first arriving at that position I was not aware

                of the presence of that crush barrier.            I cannot say what time I got

                to position two    (2) but I am sure the game had not kicked off.                On

                arriving    in position two    (2)                 was still   close to me

                standing next to me on my left hand side.            I had lost sight of                 by

                the time I got to position two          (2).



                In position two    (2) I was       crushed to an extent where I couldn ’t move,

                but I believe because I was standing just            in front of a crush barrier,

                I was not being crushed as severely as the people who were around me.



                In position two    (2) there was a young lad immediately in front of me

                and pushed up against me, he was panicking saying he couldn ’t breath.
gtl'fa*         My hands were stuck down by my sides and I/£ried to grab hold of this

\a C            young lad to push him up to help him.               was only a young lad,        I

                think about    16 years old.       He had jylond h a i r , medium in len gt h.       I

            '   think he was wearing a denim jajTKet.           I c an’t really say much more

                about him.     I only saw the barck of his head.         While I was trying to

                the back of me and to rny right hand side,           shouting something like,

         in front of me.



         I looked over my right shoulder and I could see a young b o y , his face

         was purple,   his eyes were closed.    He was about arms length away from

         me behind me and to my right hand side.        There was another man trying

         to lift this young boy up.     I bent backwards and with my right hand I

3>cf^5   grabbed hold of the front of the b o y ’s clothis>      >elow his neck line.

         I just pulled and he came out of the crowi /and the last I saw of this

         boy he was lying on top of the people jm the crowd in frgnt of me and

         just to my right hand side.     I caVH   say if I saw this young boy move

         at all.    Again I cannot say what time this occurred,        I was not aware

         of the game kicking off.
('£V


         I can only describe this boy as a white male aged ^fefout 13 y e a r s .       I

         think he was slim.     I think light brown to mous)/coloured hair,       cut

         short.     I think he may have been wearii            jeans and training

         shoes although I c an’t be sure,



         Just after we had managed to pull this young boy out,          I heard someone

         who was behind rne shouting,    "He’s down,   h e ’s down."   I looked down

         over my right shoulder down onto the floor and I saw someone was

         lying on the terraces,     I could see two feet, with brown leather shoes

         on.   I then quickly turned around to look behind me to my left and I

         saw an pld man lying face up on the fl o o r .



         It was then that I realised there was a crush barrier          immediately

         behind me.     I leant over the crush barrier to try and pick this man

         up.   He was an old guy,    his face was purple,    his eyes were open and

         his mouth was open.     I could see his teeth,     his face appeared to be

         bloated.     This old guy looked far worse than the young lad who had
                                                                               PAGE    6
                                                                               S3394

also gone purple.        I think the young lad may have passed out but on

looking at this old guy,       I thought he was dead.       I leant over to try

and pick him up,       I grabbed hold of him with my right hand.         He was not

moving at all, he was a dead weight.           I had to let go of him, he was

too heavy.



On our side of the barrier       it was still very packed but on the side of

the barrier where this old guy was          lying a gap had formed around the

old g u y ’s body.            I think,   had got under the barrier and was by

this old guy.        I went around the barrier     I was standing close to the

end of it.



This old guy was lying face upwards on the steps of the terraces he

was lying with his head towards the dividing fence of pens four and

five.    His head was under the crush barrier and his feet were slightly

higher up the terraces towards the rear.



I got around the barrier and joined                          was trying to ease

the old g u y ’s head back to open his mouth, and I felt his wrist to

feel for a pulse.        I coul dn ’t feel anything.     I also felt his chest

but I co ul dn’t feel a heart beat.         I h a v e n ’t had any first aid

training but we tried to resuscitate this old g u y , I pressed on his

chest, but it just felt solid.           I could n’t even hear anything        like

wheezing.    There was just no movement or reactions to our efforts.

I think we were trying to revive this old guy for I think about three

minutes but nothing happened.         We had been joined by a couple of other

supporters and one of these took over from me pumping the old g u y ’s

chest.    Whilst I had been pumping this old g u y ’s chest,         I think

had been trying to give him mouth to mouth.

                                                                           S3394

By this time I was becoming very worried about what may have happened

to my brother.          told me to go and look for the others

remained with this old guy.



I would describe this old guy as a white male aged abou>^6Q years,

stock ily built.   I d o n ’t think he was very tall.          had grey h a i r , a

full head of hair.     I think he was    cJLean shaveyrf    I cannot remember

much about his clothing.      I can say that op/Monday 17th April         1989

( 170489),I saw a photograph being jj>          on a television programme of
                             A / W            ~n>-----------
one of the deceased named as John ANI         SON.  I believe that the old

guy I have referred to abovV^was^fohn A N D E R S O N .            ^^



The incidents I have described above,       the times between first helping

the young blond guy immediately in front of me and then the young boy

and then the old guy who I believe was John ANDERSON, would not have

been more than about two minutes,       the sequence of events happened very

quickly.



I cannot be precise about the times of the occurrences,           but I would

estimate from my time of entering the terraces just as the players

came out for their kick about,      that when I first saw the old guy lying

on the floo r the game had still not kicked off,          I would estimate the

time to be about one or two minutes before kick off.

On page 2 of this statement I have referred to a mounted Policeman

pulling me out of the crush.        I would like to say that prior to this

happening the crushing in the approach to the outer gates had got very

severe,   because of this I approached a Policeman who was standing

controlling   (opening and closing)      the outer   perimeter gates leading to

the terrace turnstiles.       I cannot say which gate at this time.             I was

outside the outer gates     in Leppings Ln.      There was a man in front of

rne with a young boy of about eight or nine years of age on his

shoulders.    This man was having problems keeping on his feet because

of the pushing and shoving.       I was afraid that the young boy would

fall off his shoulders.



I approached this Policeman who was ho 1d i n o ^ e       gate^ closed.    I

pointed out the situation with this yajrfg boy and asked him to open

the gate to allow the man and the tpfy into the area of the turnstile

approach or to radio into the gj?6und and to ask for the game to be

delayed and to announce     it oy^r the tannoys to stop all the people

pushing at the back,      ThiyiPol i ceitian just ignored me, he just stood

there.    He couldrdef inL^ely see that this young boy was in d a n g e r .            I

got annoyed at this and asked him for his number.            He continued to

ignore rne.   As I had asked for this P o l i c e m a n ’s number   it was then

that the mounted Policeman picked me up by the front of my s h i r t .             He

did not do this to help me but because         I had asked the other Policeman

for his number.



The Policeman controlling the gate, t heyane who ignored me, was

wearing a helmet and an ordinary unifjyrm jacket.           He was ab o u t 40 to

45 years of age with a round pJTum p r a c e .     I do not know this Officer's

            With reference to the Questionnaire                     I made to the Police, about the

             disaster at Hillsboro.

             I made       reference to a Policeman that swore at me at the g a m e .             When I

             was trying to get the fence down,                  to get people out, after   I got out

             of Pen 4.           It was chaos,        I don't   remember any description of the

             Policeman involved only that he had glasses.

             I do not wish to make a specific                   complaint against the individual

             officer.           I c o uld n’t recognise him if I saw him again.

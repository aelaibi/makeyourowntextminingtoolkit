                                          R esp o n se to Daily Mirror report on H illsborough

    •Resporiding to a report injtoday's Daily Mirror, about the Hillsboroug t tragedy, Assistant
   '..Chief Constable Ian Dain^s said:

     “Reports' about this particular video tape continue to add confli fion to an already
   • complex 'set of circumstances. The Chief Constable has always said that any new
    . evidence surrounding th® disaster will be examined in detail. There is no new evidence
      in-tfte,,article published irvjthe Daily Minui today.

     “Tfte tape-in question - from a dosed circuit television camera s owing the disaster
    -unfold on .the Leppings j-ane terraces - Has never been 'missinc and it was made
    ■availe.ble in full .to bqth L>ord Justice Taylor's inquiry and to the cc roner's inquest. Its
     exists nee has never .beenj in doubt.

   • “The ^ ra 'e ra whicB tbok the pictures was indeed in working order, o lerwise there would
     .have be§n- no tape t6"submit as evidence.

       ‘W hat officers have previously 'exp lamed is that the live transmissior of the pictures into
   . the-poHce control-point at the time-was of poor quality This meant *iat they had to reiy
    . on.tha vlew'frpm'thepoiic & controrroom window and on information from officers on the
       grdurid;, It;',has always paen assumed that the Interference on their screen w as caused
     . by tel^yfsiort:!equipm8rit .ijeing used to transmit live coverage of the FA cup seml-fina!,
      .wftfchwas htii.a-facfor^when the equipment was tested earlier in the ay.
                                   wV..


       *A^;haS'be^n explained before, the confusion over ‘missing' tapes ieems to arise from
       the fact that,two othslr tabes recorded at the ground on the day       the disaster were
                                  bffield W ednesday Football Club’s recording suite in a locked
       stojeir overnight fromSheffr
       Yoomj'i.n :the;stedium: Or)e would have shown a disused area of t e complex and the
        otM r would havig . shown turnstiles. Neither tape would have bi en relevant to the
       tragedy and the motivs.-fej’ the theft has never been established.

        but nave not yet been concluded

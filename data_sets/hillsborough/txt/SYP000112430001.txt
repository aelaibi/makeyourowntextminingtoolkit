 Police Constable 776




 On Saturday 15 April 198 9 , I arrived at Hillsborough Football Ground at

 0930.      At 09^5     the briefing commenced and I was detailed to Serial 19

 under the command of Sergeant Proctor PS 323.

 Immediately after the briefing the serial was detailed to meal and from

 there proceeded to the Leppings Lane end of the ground arriving outside

 the Leppings Lane gates at 11.00 on that day.

The serial was involved at this time in coach reception.

After a short         time it was realised that coaches were no longer able to

use     Leppings      Lane      and    Serial        19   was   detailed      to support       the   mounted

section moving supporters without                          tickets away       from the ground.        During

this     time     I   was       constantly         aware     that a     lot    of the    supporters       on

Leppings Lane were in possession of and drinking from cans of beer and

on    one   occasion        I    saw    a    glass    bottle     with     a   cider    label    on   it   and

deposited it behind a Police barrier outside Leppings Lane for safety.

I saw Police Officers telling supporters to dispose of the alcohol they

were carrying and did so myself.

At about        1420 hours on that day I was informed that a fight had                               broken

out on Leppings         Lane       between         supporters     in the direction of Catch Bar

Lane.       I   immediately           made    my    way    up   Leppings      Lane    from where      I was

deployed near to Vere Road.

On arrival       all was quiet and I saw some of my serial had made arrests
                                       - 2 -




and were      taking    their prisoners          to the Police Room.         Sergeant Proctor

then    deployed me       to one of the gates.             To get to this       gate I had to

force myself through a crowd of supporters.                       I saw that elements of the

mounted section were keeping the crowd back from the barred gates which

at this time were closed.              My instructions from Sergeant Proctor were to

allow the gates to be open on instructions from the mounted section and

then close them.          This was to alleviate pressure on the turnstiles.

Soon after I arrived outside the gate it was opened to allow me to get

to my position on the other side.                      I then saw a young girl was being

forced    against      the     gates    because    of    the   pressure    of   the     crowd.      I

managed       to get her passed along the gate until I could reach her and

pull    her    to safety.       She was        in the region of 11-14 years old.                 Soon

after    this    the    gate    flew    open,    the    upright    bar   holding   it    into     the

ground    was    bent by the pressure exerted on it and a number of people

fell to the ground.             I immediately assisted as many of the people as I

could and I saw another Police Officer who had been on the other gate

(number and name not known) doing the same.

Supporters rushed in through this gate and were causing the people near

to the turnstiles to be pushed forward on to the turnstiles themselves.

I saw a mounted officer with his horse against a wall, he did not appear

able to move.          I was aware of pushing against the crowd in an effort to

alleviate the pressure on the turnstiles with no success.

People    were    still      flooding    in    through   the   gate although       the space in

front of turnstile entrance               'B' was packed tightly with people.                I saw

people climbing over the turnstile wall into the ground.                           The pressure

          which was very severe, inside this section was suddenly alleviated.                           I

          then saw that the concertina gates were open.                     These gates lead behind

          the West Stand.

          The area outside these gates became clear of supporters.

          A short time later I was called into the ground, through the concertina

          gate, where I turned right and entered the ground.                     We had been informed

          that   fans had invaded the pitch.             When I got into the ground I saw a

          great many supporters, Police and first aid men (St John's) in front of

          the    standing enclosure on Leppings             Lane.       I made my way     to the stand

          where I saw a mass of supporters crushed against the fence.                      I initially

          started    to pull people      over the front fence as they clambered out.                     I

          then saw another officer run towards enclosure                       1 where the small gate

          had been opened.          I followed this officer and went into the enclosure 1

          stand across to the fence which divides enclosure 2 and 3 where I saw it

          was not possible to enter this enclosure without making some space.

          I saw other people         still   trying to enter this enclosure              from the rear

          tunnel.

          Together    with    another officer       (name    and number not known)             I assisted

          people     over    this    fence   into     enclosure     2    and    made   space    to   enter

          enclosure 3-

          I then entered enclosure           3 and was immediately aware that some of the

          crowd were still trying to push forward and appeared to be in a state of

          pa nic.

          I was jostled quite severely initially and nearly fell to the floor as a

          result.     However,      people were     leaving the stand by being pulled on to
the upper terracing by other supporters and this helped the situation.

I then requested and received aid from 2 other supporters in this stand

and started to pull bodies away from the fence where we laid them on the

terracing behind us.                Those not unconscious were lifted straight over

the si<^e fence into enclosure 2 where a Police Sergeant (name and number

not known) was organising a team of helpers.

I then helped to pass unconscious bodies across this fence, at one time

I    attempted       to     give    artificial    respiration     to   one    male    person   but

because of the crowd of people stepping on myself and the body it was

not really possible, so I passed him across the side fence also.                          I must

have passed between 15-20 persons across this fence some conscious but

many unconscious.

Once this area had been cleared, I left enclosure 3 and was immediately

deployed      at      the    opposite       end   of   the   ground    restraining     Liverpool

supporters who had run               to the Nottingham Forest Stand (Spion K o p ) and

was part of the Police link across the pitch.                    Before I left enclosure 3

an object hit my helmet which I was wearing, it was a man's wristwatch

and it appeared to have been thrown from the upper terracing.                          I did not

recover this item.             Shortly after this I was deployed outside Leppings

Lane    entrance       in    the    alley   running    between   the   ground   and    the river

where      numerous       injured    and    dead people were laid on the          floor and on

stretchers awaiting ambulances.

A Police message was passed over loudspeakers asking the crowd to remain

in   the    ground     so    emergency vehicles could remove            the   injured.     I was

then deployed outside               Leppings Lane gates holding back            the crowd,     who
                               - 5 -




were leaving the ground, so ambulances could carry out their tasks.

A number of fans verbally abused us when they left the ground.    I have

worked   at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on other occasions where

1st Division matches have been played and have normally been located at

Lepping Lane entrance.

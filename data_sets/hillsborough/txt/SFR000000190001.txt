  Transcription' of VHF Channel 1 Tape.

  Attached are amended timings between 1441 hours and 1559 hours. These
  timings have been taken from the master tape at South Yorkshire Police
  Headquarters, and I am satisfied that they are accurate.

  The inaccuracy of the previous timings was as a result of a gaining of
  tape speed when taping from the master tape onto smaller 40 minute
  tapes. As a result of this approximately one minute was gained in
  each hour from the commencement of the master tape at 0407 hours.

CHIEF INSPECTOR MCROBBIE                                                            R125



I transferred to 'F' Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

(Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As a preliminary to the event I received an overview of the planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1989 •

I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April 1 9 8 9 .

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

9.45 a.m.   I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear cf, the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

in front of the Special Constables.

It appeared to me that attention to detail was evident in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.              He impressed that

officers must      act   in a professional manner which would reflect credit on

South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a microphone

and amplifier.

This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

I was   again    impressed with    the   standard of briefing,      again attention to

detail such as the evacuation procedures and officers being aware of their

indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality.

I   particularly    recall   him   saying,   "We   have   fully   tried   the   evacuation

procedures twice this season, the first time was good, the,second time was
                                                           -2-



excellence;     if we       are required to impliment evacuation today,                        itmust be

excellent."

This    briefing      was    followed            by   an   up     to   date   intelligence    report   from

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Finally,    Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios, issue and

mealing arrangements.

It was     stressed       that       all    officers must be on their respective points by

11.15 a.m.

After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

later    into   the       operation         so   I left      the    stadium to return to my private

vehicle.     I was approached on three separate occasions in Penistone Road and

asked if I had any tickets to sell.

There were a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

I went     to my vehicle             and drove        to Hammerton Road Police            Stationwhere I

carried out some outstanding clerical work.

I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police
                                 *

Station,    when      a    police          car   offered     me    a   lift   to   the   ground.   This    I

accepted.

I saw Policewoman           Smith and another officer outside Threshers near Holme

Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

and not in uniform.

All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

By Hillsborough Park I saw a group of people sitting around,                                  there was a

white plastic carrier bag with them and                            the outline of cans could be seen.
                                                  -3-



The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were    six men and they were joking about having to drink the lot as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By Leppings    Lane   gates were        few supporters,         road clear, plenty of Police

officers evident.

I went   to   the   barrier       at   Leppings    Lane/Vere     Road where     I    spoke   to   'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                    A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I   then walked     past    Leppings      Lane    gates   and   came   to barriers     and Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                         There were no

other people near this area.               I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell      the necessity to provide a sterile area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I continued along the road being the South Stand past the T.V. unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

I produced my warrant card, but I was known to one officer who I did not

know.

I went down and along Penistone Road which was busy.

I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the flow of people, it was

very busy.

I   stopped   and   spoke    to    Police    Constable     Vallance     from   'A'   Division     and

Police   Constable Haltman         from     'A'   Division at separate points but due to

enquiries and sheer numbers of persons it was prudent to move on, as they

needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

 I returned to rear of South Stand.

About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd__
                                               -4-



awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the Nottingham Forest                    team coach arrived.          The     procedurewas

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this area and returned to Penistone Road as I intended to use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.           At that time about one hour to kick off.

I knew there was a Liverpool train due at Wadsley Bridge around 2.05 p.m.

but decided to go into the ground.

I went to the main sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a special

card   issued to me         by Superintendent            Murray.     Both were         fully checkedand

examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

I was assured no unauthorised person would gain entry at that gate.

I went down onto          the   perimeter track and was immediately surprised               by how

full the Spion Kop was.           I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

I made my way to the Police Control box.

Inspector       Sewell    had   alerted me   to    the     fact   that   inside   there was   only

limited space.           I intended to visit, see it operated and leave if I was in

the w a y .

I wanted       to see     the   Control point      as I was at Doncaster Rovers when the

camera equipment          was first installed and operated at the beginning                 of the

present       season.     The   engineer was      always    quoting the Sheffield Wednesday

system as being excellent and holding the system as the way all grounds
                                                    -5-



should operate.

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at     the    front    and     Police    Constable    Bichard       at   the   rear   by    the    camera

operating controls.

I was        informed by Police         Sergeant    Goddard       that Superintendent Murray had

gone    to speak to the referee             so I sat on his seat and was offered a hot

drink.        It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant       Chief     Constable      (Operations)       Mr.    Jackson     came   to   the    control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw     through     the   control    room     window    Superintendent       Murray     and    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, in uniform, walking along the track.                             They came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the Notts

Forest parts I could see on the South Stand and the Spion Kop were quite

full.

I recall Chief Superintendent Duckenfield commenting about there being no

entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

I remember        when    I was    a child there          always being a band playing by the

players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                                When

I looked the person was jiggling around.                     I remember thinking how empty the

area around this youth was.                 Police Constable Bichard operated the camera

and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super

facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was aware       the area in Leppings Lane behind the goal was filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

up.    As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                        The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                             All was good humoured.

The    area behind the goal at Leppings Lane was getting full but there was

space at the front.            People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

Approx 2.30 p.m.

I looked     on    the    left monitor            and was      aware    there      seemed a build up       of

supporters.

I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

necessary    segregation of fans,                 access      to the North Stand, which had been

allocated    to    Liverpool         supporters,           could       only   be   done by   Leppings    Lane

entrances,       this meant      that       the    entrances       on Penistone Road         to the     stand

which would normally be used were unavailable.

This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

An     engineer    came       into    the    room         to    try     and    improve transmission       and

reception.

I     remember    him    in   blue    under       the      control      room    bench, I thought      it was

crowded as Police Sergeant Godd^ard was walking round/over him.__________

I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was.

I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the closure of Leppings Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                      It was not

extraordinary.      I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception, the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                      The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx- 2.45 p .m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on the 'screen.         Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

to assist officers outside.

Around    this   time    a radio message was relayed requesting             the gates   to be

opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

I remember thinking, you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

and may    create       a difficult   public     order    situation for Police     inside        the

ground.

The   gates      were    not   authorised   to       be   opened   by   Chief   Sueprintendent

Duckenfield at this time.

I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terracejunder the_____

Police Control.

It occurred that some Liverpool supporters were leving it late but people

often enter after the start of many games.

About this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to the controllers.       I then saw the gates displayed on the camera which I

believe   are   the   concertina   gates   on   the   service   road to the rear of the

South Stand open and a surge of people rush into the ground.                I said, "The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.        It seemed control was regained with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the gate.

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent Marshall again requests the gates to be opened.                 This is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

I can see by the players tunnel a semi circle of photographers awaiting the

arrival of the two teams.

It seems the Superintendent will have to try and prevent the start of the

game as the fans willnot all get in but I thought                 thereis no way anyone

can get to the referee       or team managers to do this at this late stage.         As I

was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                I've no idea which

team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

At   this point Superintendent Marshall           requested     the gates to be opened as

there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in the crush

if they were not opened.

There was still room on the terrace under the control.                The South Stand was

much fuller but not full.                                 ------------- ---------------

Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was evident there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect - If there's likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent Murray gave   the general   instruction over the radio to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.   The play was

at the Penistone Road end.

I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

onto the,track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as directed

but then stopping and standing watching the game.

A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was space

but did not open it.

I thought she probably didn't have a radio or handn't sensed that she must

open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

I began to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of the

control point, through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got

the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.    More

and more were coming onto the track, I was ushering them to the open gate
                                                                 _____________
and the Policewoman assisted.

I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I   could   see   people   pushed   up   against    the   fence   but   not   aware   of   any

particular problems or injuries as there is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More   and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run to control but by the uncovered seats I meet Superintendent Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.             We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the gaT,0 .

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

Terrace.

I think it is a public order situation.

As they are Liverpool supporters,          I run onto the playing         area andprotect

Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

people spilling onto the playing area.             There is quite clearly in my mind a

major public      order situation which will        need a large uniform presence to

control.

I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

There is nothing I can usefully do in a public t^er context sojfr decide to

return to the Police Control point.

En route    I am     passed        by    uniformed       reinforcements        as    I pass   through   the

uncovered seating.

On   re-entering         control    room    I learn         that persons       are    suspected of being

injured.

An   ambulance      is    called    for and      quickly arrives          behind the Leppings Lane

goal.

A message      is relayed to Police control that many people are injured.                                As

they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides to call

out Casualty Bureau staff.

I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson, to call for Chief

Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

I've no accurate           assessment of time,                  but this call should be recorded on

tape    in Force     Control.           Coins   or other          items are being thrown at Police

Control    in large numbers.               In view of the situation unfolding,                   'Operation

Support 1 is authorised.

All available personnel are deployed in area.

I    suggest    I   go     to   Hammerton       Road       Police    Station    and    receive   Operation

Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground Control.

I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

 in a marked Police car.                He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

 I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Commander.

Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific areas in

 makeshift serials.

 I remain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

MICHAEL THOMAS SAVOURY




Police Constable 2717




El Hackenthorpe



I commenced duty at 0830 on Saturday 15 April 1989 at El, Hackenthorpe,

where I joined colleagues to form Serial 13, under the direct command of

Police Sergeant 2001 Burman.      We arrived as a serial at Hillsborough

Football Ground at 0930 and attended the general briefing at 1000 hours

given by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.      Meal times for our serial

was set at 150 0 hours and we were provided with a snack meal immediately

 following briefing.

We made our way to the West Stand to take up our designated positions at

 1115 in plenty of time before the opening of the ground to the public at


 1 20 0 noon.

 Together with Police Constable 10 Mercer, I went to Gangway U in the :

 West Stand at the Leppings Lane end.     Our position was to the left of

 the goal when looking at the pitch, almost directly above gate 5 in the

 perimeter fence.

 Our duties were to:

 1)   Stop fans climbing over the fence separating the north end of the

      stand from the raised section of terracing (overlooking gates 6 and

      7 in the perimeter fence)

 2)   Prevent fans from throwing items from the stand on to the pitch, or
                                 - 2 -




     on to fans below.

3)   Supervise the use of the emergency gate situated at the front corner

     of the North end of the West Stand,         (above gate 6 in the perimeter

     fence).     Two stewards were also near to the gate (one in training).

At this time (and up to phase two) there were only eleven officers

(Serial 13 consisted of 12 officers, plus Sergeant, but it was depleted

by one due to illness) in the West Stand, which has a capacity of about

three thousand five hundred.         At phase two, we were to be relieved by

Serial 16 to go for meal (three o'clock).

The times listed         hereafter are as accurate as I can make them,   to the

best     ofmy recollection of     the events which occurred, but they    are

approximations only.

1200     -   Ground opened to the public.

 134 5   _   Large numbers of Nottingham Forest supporters in their

               allocated enclosures, but only low numbers of Liverpool

               supporters, notably women and families.

 1430    —     Still relatively low numbers of Liverpool supporters in

               ground.

 1440    -   Visited by Sergeant Burman, who I had not seen since taking          up

               position at 1115-     Comment passed by me to him about the low

               numbers now entering the stand.      Central terracing (rear of

               goal)     and stand now substantially filled with supporters.

               North     and South ends of terracing relatively empty.   Raised

               area of terracing to the North of the West Stand nearly full.

               Large numbers of youths congregating near to the dividing
                 - 3 -




fence, apparently with the intention of climbing over.

Several aborted attempts made.   Complaints made by female

members of the crowd in that section of youths urinating in

the enclosure.   Several youths seen at the rear of the raised

terracing climbing on to the fencing above the rear entrance

tunnel and removing the barbed wire.   Moving through the

crowds at this time, in an effort   to stop those wishing to

climb over the fence, it was obvious that   large numbers had

been drinking, some heavily.

Looking down on to the terracing, it was obvious that the

centre sections were overcrowded.   Persons were climbing over

the fencing separating the pen at the rear of the right hand

side of the goal looking from the stand, to the pen on the

left hand side of the goal.    This appears to be shown

incorrectly on the plan provided.    The double row of fencing

which separates pens 4 and 5 form a gangway from the entrance

tunnel to a gate in the perimeter fence.

Officers were standing on the perimeter track supervising

 those fans climbing and preventing them from climbing over

 on to the track.

 Fans began climbing over on to the perimeter track and then

 the gate in the pen behind the goal was opened, the fans were

 allowed to walk along the perimeter track and re-enter the

 terracing via gate 6 as shown on plan, which is directly

 below gangway U.

    1502    -    Crowd in West Stand stood up.

    Ref Y

    1503    -    I went to barrier with Police Constable Mercer and looked down

                  on the terracing.    I could see fans surging forward in the

                  two pens behind the goal.    Fans were now climbing over the

                  perimeter fence on to the track, and over the fence separating

                  the two pens (single fence).    Large numbers of fans seemed to

                  be crushed into the corners of those pens.

    1504        - Obvious that persons were being crushed at this time, and fans

                  were being assisted over the fence by Police Officers.

    1505        - Heavy surge of spectators towards the front of the terrace,

                  but instead of the gap left in the crowd when fans sway

                  forward, the space was immediately filled by other fans.       It

                  was now obvious that there were serious problems in the pens,

                  and more and more fans were spilling over the fences and on

                  to the pitch.   Looking at them it was obvious that some were

                  injured.   More Police began to help at the fences and

                  supporters in the stand were now helping those below up into

                  the stand over the front of the balcony.

    1506        - Bolt croppers were requested and request acknowledged.

j( 1 !            Ambulance requested and acknowledged.    Large numbers of

                  spectators walking and being carried on to the pitch, some

            down behind the Police box and made a path through the crowd

            they wanted was to be told what to do, as they were incapable

            of making decisions themselves.                              Advised them to leave ground

            quietly and make their way home.

            On looking around the bar area I noticed a heap of discarded

            tabbards which stewards had been wearing.                                      On purposefully

            looking around the stand I realised that there were no

             stewards in sight.

           expect them to do if they're going to get thumped".       Heard

           During the time span of the disaster unfolding, I closely

           monitored radio traffic.     The only messages I heard were those

           appropriate, their acknowledgements.

       spectators were killed on a stairway.



       The Home Office issued Guidance to Local                    Authorities       under      cover    of

       Home Officer Circular 150/1975.



1.2    The    Safety       of   Sports Ground Act gave the Secretary of State power to

       require through designation orders that safety certificates                           be    issued

       to     sports    stadia       with accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators.

        The intention was for the Act to come into force                     gradually       through      a

        phased      programme of designation orders so as not to place an immediate

        financial burden on the smaller and less well off clubs.



 1.3    The first order was made in August 1976 and applied to                          first     division

        football       clubs       and       certain        international         grounds.      Sheffield

        Wednesday's ground was designated in August 1978, although the club was

        not    in    the     first     division,          because of its quasi international use.

        Second division clubs were designated in August 1979.                           Third and fourth

        division       clubs     and rugby league clubs were designated in August 1985,

        following the Bradford City Football Club fire.

X„ 1976, the Home Office produced a voluntary code called the -Guide to

safety        at    Sports       Grounds       (Football)",         commonly       known as the Green

Guide.        This gave guidance on measures                      for     improving    the    safety      of

    spectators      at     sports      grounds and extended the recommendations of the

    Wheatley Report.         ' '



    The former South Yorkshire county council, as the enforcing                               authority,

    delegated       its    powers and duties under the safety of Sports Ground Act

    to the Fire Service committee.                      On 3th    January,     1976,    the     committee

    decided     that      their     functions            should    be     exercised    through Officer

    working parties for the              four       borough       council     areas,    consisting         of

    representatives          of    the       police,       the     fire    service     and the building

     inspectors of the borough councils, with co-ordination being undertaken

     by the Department of Administration.



5 Under        the        co-ordination            of    the     county/^uncil •s        Administration

     Department, the four Officer Working Paulis produced a                              draft       General

     the       minutes            of meetings were sent to each member and all arrangements

1 10 It was the practice for the Officer Working Parties to                                         carry

          inspections              of      the     ground     each year. c<»mo„l, known as -summer- and

          -winter- inspections.                         Xt was fire service practice to              be     represented

          standard to be applied.



 1.11 When the south Yorkshire count, council was abolished on 1st April.

          1986,          enforcement              in South Yorkshire, passed to the four Metropolitan

          District councils, Rotherham, Barnsley, Doncaster and                                      Sheffield.         The

           Home Office issued guidance on the new arrangements under cover of Home

           O f f i c e   Circular           7/1936.        These    changes        were   effected        by   the     Local

           Government Act 1936 at which time the Fire Authority assumed the status

           of -interested party- which meant that the local authority was required

           to      consult            it about the terms and conditions of a safety certificate.

            The Fire Authority also then had a right to authorise officers to carry

            out     inspections under                   section 11 of the Safety At Sports Grounds Act.
1.12 Prior    to    the    1st        April,        1986,      Mr D Vaughan of the south Yorkshire

    county council Department of administration arranged                                  a    joint       meeting

    with     the    officers        of     the District councils who would be taking o,er

     responsibility for Safety of sports Grounds Act matters which was

     attended      by officers from the police and fire service.                               The purpose of

     the meeting was to hand over the county                          council-s          files      and    have     a

     general       discussion         on   safety         of    sports       Grounds matters.             The fire

     service said that they hoped the South Yorkshire count, council General

     safety     certificate           would be adopted by all the districts because this

     would help them standardise on one rather than four different                                         sets    of

     conditions.          ( < " 4      •



 1.13 in    Sheffield      the        Administration            and    Legal       Department         became       the

      responsible department.                  In     a     letter     dated       5th    June,       1986,       they

      attached      a     copy    of a report which had been placed before the General

      Purposes panel on 6th May, 1986 together with a                               copy       of    the    panel's

      resolution in relation to that report.                          Items A and c read as follows:-



       (a) the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the
              former    south Yorkshire county council under the safety of sports

              Grounds      Act        be noted and authority be given for the continuation

              of such a system for the time being;



       (O)     The Head of Administration and Legal Department                                 be    requested          to

               draft new safety certificate conditions in consultation with other

               appropriate authorities for approval by the county council.



   1.14 A meeting took place on 10th                      March,      1987    to    deal       with       the     future

        administration           of      the   council's certification function.                          The general

           feeling of the meting was that the roles                          of    each       authority         involved

           should be defined perhaps along the lines of the south Yorkshire count,

                                                - 4 -
council system.     This was described in     a   letter dated    14th     May,     1987

which    enclosed   a   draft division of responsibilities.       The letter asked

for comments on the proposals which showed the following                 fire    service

responsibilities        fire   precautions,   fire   alarms,     means     of    escape,^

emergency lighting,'      stadium capacity.    I remember commenting on the

stadium capacity (seeTpencil note on draft) because each discipline on I
the working Party would have        to put forward figures and those of the

fire service would be based only on the means of escape available not
on the condition of terraces or crush barriers for example and final^

 figures would be a matter for the Licensing Authority to determine.



 comments    were   sent in a letter dated 7th July, 1987, which attached a

 copy of the divisions of responsibilities used by the              south       Yorkshire

 councy Council and suggested the system be retained.

                   SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE


           SUBMISSION BY CFO H.B. WRIGHT, QFSM, MIFireE, FBIH




I am Henry Edward WRIGHT appointed as the Chief Fire Officer     of   the
South Yorkshire County Fire Service on 14th December, 1982.

Previous to that date I held the appointment of Assistant chief Fire
Officer of the County Fire Service with the main reference of fire
prevention from 1st September, 1978 when I transferred on promotion to
South Yorkshire from the Leicestershire Fire Service, until March 1981
when I transferred to other responsibilities.

During that time I was involved in discussions on the safety aspects of
the Hillsborough stadium, Sheffield occupied by Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club Ltd.

Just prior to my      arrival an order had been made under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act,   1978 which designated the ground of Sheffield
Wednesday FC by virtue of its quasi international use. This order
required an application for a general safety certificate to be maria
before 1st January, 1979 when the designation order become effective.

The requirements of a general safety certificate with regard to this
stadium was considered by an Officers' Working Party chaired by Mr.
David Vaughan of the Administration Department, South Yorkshire County
Council with representatives from the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield
City Council Building Inspection Department and the South Yorkshire
County Fire Service. This working party was responsible    to the Fire
Service Committee     who had delegated responsibilities from     the South
Yorkshire County Council.

To assist officers a Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) was
issued by the Home Office. Local Authorities were reminded that this
non-statutory document was not a iet ~of requirements tfo Be rigidly
applied   regardless   of individual circumstances.     Indeed maximum
rlexipiiity was to be maintained to take account of the different
circumstances at individual grounds. Particular attention was drawn to
tne Act which provided that the terms and conditions should be such as
"necessary or expedient to secure reasonably safety" and that it would
be~unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute
safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.

In  order to avoid duplication and division of responsibilities a draft
   items relative to the safety in sports grounds had been prepared and
discussed prior to my arrival. This division of responsibility was
checked and approved in April, 1978 at a meeting attended by H.B.
Dunstan and K. Jones.

At an initial meeting with the club officials on 13th December, 1978 at
Sheffield Wednesday FC, Hillsborough it was agreed that Dr. Eastwood
would prepare and submit a comprehensive survey report on matters
relating to the above Act. This was submitted on 17th January, 1979
and   provided Dr. Eastwood's opinion regarding the West Terrace
(including the lower level at North West Corner).
It was determined that a comprehensive survey of the ground be
undertaken by the Officers' Working Party and a report produced by each
department for discussion prior to meeting the Club officials to
discuss Dr. Eastwood's report.

This meeting was held on 12th February, 1979 and was attended by H.B.
Dunstan, K. Jones, B.A. Ellis and        of the County Fire Service.

Due to delays in meeting with the Club officials a further meeting of
the Officers' Working Party took place on 30th March, 1979 to review
the position prior to meeting with the Club.

The main point made regarding the West Terrace was by the Building
Authority that the crush barriers were below the height recommendation
of the Guide.

At the meeting between the Club officials and the Officers Working
Party on 2nd April, 1979 the reduced capacity of 7,200 spectators as
suggested by Dr. Eastwood to compensate for the lack of gangways was
agreed. The height of the crush barriers was to be subject to detailed
discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Inspectors.

A letter from Sheffield City Council dated 1st May, 1979 confirmed that
the major points were acceptable including the barriers.

On 16th May, 1979 the County Fire Service sent to M r . Vaughan the
improvements considered necessary at the ground.     This letter was
ociyii'leited By Station Officer        and was sent by the Divisional
Commander. This letter states that the exit routes from the West and
Noarfeh West Terrace were satisfactory.

The positioning of required EXIT signs as detailed on the plans sent
with the letter (16l0/l x A; 2 x A; 4A; 6A; 7A; 8A; 9A; 11 and 12).

These improvements were apparently collated into a schedule to include
all requirements of the working party and sent by Mr. Vaughan to the
Club. Although a copy of the schedule was provided for the County Fire
Service no plans were included.

At the meeting between the Club officials and the working party on 12th
November, 1979 it was reported that the work required on the West
Terrace had been carried out.       EXIT signs were to be erected after
decorations were complete but their positions not identified in
writing.

The general safety certificate was issued by the South Yorkshire County
Council to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. for their ground
situated at Hillsborough, Sheffield on 21st December, 1979.

Prior to the FA Cup Semi-Final match scheduled for 12th April, 1980 it
was suggested on 14th March that the members of the Working Party
review the situation at the ground and make comment on outstanding
matters. This inspection was undertaken by Station Officers Binnington
and Davis and comments made. Their comments were forwarded in writing
to the Chief Executive on 26th March, 1980.      These in turn were
forwarded to the Club on 31st March.

As the Assistant Chief Fire Officer responsible to the Chief Fire
Officer for the satisfaction of the statutory responsibilities of the
Fire Authority as delegated to the Chief Fire Officer I attended
necessary meetings and provided guidance and advice to   officers   under
my direction whenever required or requested.
I never considered that the provision of reasonable safety on the West
Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield had not been provided
for and in saying this I was aware of the guidance given by the Guide
applicable at that time and the conditions applicable at this area of
the ground for which the County Fire Service had responsibilities, eg
means of egress.

STATEMENT:          FRANK MICHAEL DAVIS

I have been in Sheffield/South Yorkshire Fire Brigade for the past 25 years.
My current post is ADO Technical. In 1979 I represented the Division into the
Officer Working Party with reference to the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
175 General Safety Certificate - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. I believe
that the last meeting I attended was June, 1981.

Prior to the issue of the above certificate I served on the Officer Working
Party along with Senior Officers from the County Fire Service Headquarters.
My role was to represent the Division whose area Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club were in.

Recommendations were made regarding all parts of the ground which affected the
maximum number that could be accommodated in various areas.    The figure of
7200 maximum was allocated to the West Terrace. At this date no radial
barriers were in existence.                                            ”

This figure was arrived at after studying the construction of the ground,
width and position of exits, circulation area to exits and the evacuation
procedure that was to be adopted.             ...----------------------

My thinking at the time was that persons could enter the West Terrace from the
tunnel under the stand and in the event of an emergency, move sideways to an
exit which would lead him/her to a place of safety. Crush barriers were so
placed to prevent unreasonable crushing or large forward surges by the crowd.

The West Stand and West Terrace were concrete, therefore tl^e risk of fire was
considered minimal. The means of escape was considered more than adequate
considering this low fire risk.       I did not consider that gates in the
perimeter fence were necessary as a means of escape and they were not taken
into account by me.

Fire exit signs were considered unnecessary in the West Terrace considering
the openness of it. The exits from this part of the ground being self
evident.

Because the means of escape from the West Terrace were considered to be
adequate and the fire risk minimal it was decided that large numbers of
spectators would not need to be evacuated onto the pitch via’ the gates leading   <&■>•
ontoTTEEe perimeter of the pitch.     — —   —

The gates were considered suitable for access for a relatively small number of
spectators at localised incidents such as fighting and possible first aid
treatment to spectators. The access to and frnm t-.hsae— gates— was- under the
control of the Police. We did not consider them to be a means of escape gnH
therefore not under our responsibility .

These perimeter gates were not marked to indicate they were "Exits" because
it was felt this would lead to confusion. The normal ingress routes were
considered as satisfactory for means of escape purposes.

Staff Training

At the time that the safety certificate was issued I was involved in producing
a Training and Fire Drill Procedure particularly for Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

The Training instructions    were sent in two parts to Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club. The first part related to Fire Instructions and Drill.

This detailed areas of responsibilities, areas that should be concentrated on
minimum periods between instruction, together with a method of recording these
training periods.
The second part instructed staff how to act in the event of a fire.      This
included the action to be taken on discovering a fire and the action to be
taken on hearing the warning signals. These instructions were sent on the 9th
April 1980.

I had, prior to the issue of the safety certificate, contacted Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club with a view to training their staff. This is minuted
in a meeting at Hillsborough dated 12th November 1979.

Meetings were held with the members of the staff shortly afterwards. I can
recall at least two visits. During these visits I emphasised the action they
should carry out at a typical evacuation procedure, went through the
instruction procedure I had prepared for them and walked around the ground
highlighting possible fire situations, together with the correct method of
using fire extinguishers.

The following year, after an inspection prior to a semi-final taking place, I
was concerned that the staff required further training in an "Emergency
Evacuation Procedure". A document was produced in consultation with the Chief
Superintendent Bob Herol of the South Yorkshire Police, detailing the
emergency evacuation procedure. The document was then circulated to all
members of Sheffield Wednesday's staff.       This is minuted in a meeting at
Hillsborough on 7th April 1981.

A further meeting was held on 8th June 1981 at which I was present where
mention was made of future proposals concerning the West Terrace. I would
rely on the minutes of this meeting to remind me of what transpired at this
meeting, I cannot recall any discussion regarding incidents at the 1981 semi­
final. Assurances were given that the Officer Working Party would be
consulted. This concluded my involvement at the Sheffield Wednesday ground.

            STATEMENT BY H B DUNSTAN (RETIRED FIRE PREVENTION OFFICER)



re. Inspections          or    Deliberations         of    Working          Party    on    Application            for

Certificate       by     Sheffield      Wednesday         Football          Club under Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975.



I began working for the Barnsley Fire and                        Ambulance         Service      in       1954.      I

transferred       to     South   Yorkshire       County          Council       in    local government re­

organisation in 1974.            I assumed the position                of    Divisional         officer          with

responsibility for certification.



1.   I   attended        a    meeting    of    the    Officers          Working       Party          on the 21st

     September 1978, and it              was    agreed          that    responsibility              between       the

     different parties be divided in accordance with the annexed schedule.



2.   The    Act     -    being    new    -     all    the       Working Party members drew on the

     experiences of colleagues in the other Authorities,                               used         Home    office

     guidance and their own experiences to formulate standards acceptable to

     the South Yorkshire Authority.



3.   All Working Party members agree that                       their       approach      to        an    existing

     sports       ground      would     be tempered with reasonableness in regard to the

     exacting standards of the Act and that - in                            some    cases       -    compromise

     would     be       necessary. . However,             new    grounds       or    any       alterations to

     existing grounds would be required to comply fully with                                   the       standards

     laid down.



4.   A     survey report by the Consulting Engineers, Eastwood and Partners was

     studied.       Some parts were rejected and more stringent requirements
        enforced,      whereas        compromise      -   as in the case of the west terrace -

        i.e. in the reduction of capacity - was accepted.



5.      Means of Escape in case of fire or other emergency                     was    considered       by

        the     fire    service, in the case of the west terrace and on reduction of

        crowd capacity to 7,200 - a reduction of 10%                     giving an evacuation time

        of    just     over     6 minutes - the existing means of escape was considered

        satisfactory.          At the time that I supported             that   decision     there     was

        total    movement        laterally       throughout      the terrace and three entrance/

        exits from the terrace were well situated.


                                                                          U
        As the west stand provided a minimum of fire risk^it was accepted                           that

        these    routes       would     be available and adequate in an emergency and the

        existing gates in the perimeter fence                 were      discounted    for   means      of

        escape    purposes.       At that time I^considered^ the^gates^in^ the perimeter

        fence as there for the convenience of                   the   police   for    crowd    control

        purposes. I Neither           was   it   considered       necessary to identify exits as

        these were the ones used for normal entrance and exit from the terrace.



6.      Even at this      early        stage     in   dealing    with    the   application      for     a

        certificate       it    was     agreed    that    any    alterations     to   the     existing

        conditions would require reappraisal of the situation.

             Preliminary Statement of Stephen Keith Allcock,
                     Temporary Divisional Officer 979,
    Pogayriing involvement at Hillsborough Football Ground 1984 - 1986

In 1984 I was one of two officers of "C" Division Fire Prevention
Department who were given 'Safety at Sports Grounds' as part of a licensing
reference. This involved work at Hillsborough and Bramall Lane.

Work at Division involving sports grounds was done in conjunction with a
Headquarters FP Officer in order to standardise and co-ordinate activity
throughout the county.

The majority of comments regarding the grounds were relayed to the relevant
club through the County's Safety at Sports Grounds, Officer Working Party
(OWP).   Six monthly inspections, consideration of new        developments,
alterations and other matters concerning the grounds were carried out or
submitted to the committee for its consideration. The committee comprised
    representatives from the Fire Service (Division and Headquarters), SY
Police, and Sheffield City Council (Building Control), all being co­
ordinated and minuted by David Vaughan of the County Council.

I was involved in several inspections at Hillsborough and Bramall Lane
prior to May 1985 when I was temporary promoted to Headquarters Fire
Prevention.   As a consequence of that move I relinquished my divisional
references and then became involved in a headquarters capacity until early
1986 as assistant to DO Grimshaw who had as part of his headquarters
reference, 'Safety at Sports Grounds'.


Leppinqs Lane Involvement 1985

Taking into consideration that the events mentioned below were four years
ago, the following recollections are made with explanation of any personal
observations as appropriate.

In early 1985 I can recall requests by the police to improve crowd control
by segregation of supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. This
is reflected in the OWP minutes of 23.1.85.

Up to my departure from 'C' Division in April 1985, I can recall being
involved in calculations of exit flows in connection with proposals made
concerning the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
This included a site meeting between myself, Stn O Vicars (C FP), and Insp
Celvert (Police), at the area of the ground to be involved. The meeting
would have been to consider any site difficulties that might be envisaged
by the proposals.

In July 1985 the club, via Eastwood and Partners, submitted plans for the
consideration of the OWP. These were received by us and a request to
attend a meeting on the 29th July   to discuss the proposals was made at
short notice due to an apparent oversight by Eastwoods in applying for
Building Regulations Approval without prior acceptance by the OWP. I feel
that I was the only Fire Service representative at the meeting because of
the short notice and no other person being available to represent the
Division.

Discussion would have taken place between me and other officers at
Headquarters and Division before I attended the meeting, any points to be
clarified or our requests for alterations to the proposals on the plans
noted and those taken to the meeting.    Once those points were accepted at
the OWP meeting and checked on the subsequently published minutes, they
would not have been retained as the minutes would then be accepted as our

            Preliminary Statement of Stephen Keith Allcock,
                    Temporary Divisional Officer 979,
    Regarding Involvement at Hillsborough Football Ground 1984 — 1986

In 1984 I was one of two officers of "C" Division Fire Prevention
Department who were given 'Safety at Sports Grounds' as part of a licensing
reference. This involved work at Hillsborough and Bramall Lane.

Work at Division involving sports grounds was done in conjunction with a
Headquarters FP Officer in order to standardise and co-ordinate activity
throughout the county.

The majority of comments regarding the grounds were relayed to the relevant
club through the County's Safety at Sports Grounds, Officer Working Party
(OWP).   Six monthly inspections, consideration of new        developments,
alterations and other matters concerning the grounds were carried out or
submitted to the committee for its consideration. The committee comprised
of representatives from the Fire Service (Division and Headquarters), SY
Police, and Sheffield City Council (Building Control), all being co­
ordinated and minuted by David Vaughan of the County Council.

I was involved in several inspections at Hillsborough and Bramall Lane
prior to May 1985 when I was temporary promoted to Headquarters Fire
Prevention.   As a consequence of that move I relinquished my divisional
references and then became involved in a headquarters capacity until early
1986 as assistant to DO Grimshaw who had as part of his headquarters
reference, 'Safety at Sports Grounds'.


lappings Lane Involvement 1985

Taking into consideration that the events mentioned below were four years
ago, the following recollections are made with explanation of any personal
observations as appropriate.

In early 1985 I can recall requests by the police to improve crowd control
by segregation of supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. This
is reflected in the OWP minutes of 23.1.85.

Up to my departure from 'C' Division in April 1985, I can recall being
involved in calculations of exit flows in connection with proposals made
concerning the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
This included a site meeting between myself, Stn O Vicars (C FP), and Insp
Celvert (Police), at the area of the ground to be involved. The meeting
would have been to consider any site difficulties that might be envisaged
by the proposals.

In July 1985 the club, via Eastwood and Partners, submitted plans for the
consideration of the OWP. These were received by us and a request to
attend a meeting on the 29th July   to discuss the proposals was made at
short notice due to an apparent oversight by Eastwoods in applying for
Building Regulations Approval without prior acceptance by the OWP. I feel
that I was the only Fire Service representative at the meeting because of
the short notice and no other person being available to represent the
Division.

Discussion would have taken place between me and other officers at
Headquarters and Division before I attended the meeting, any points to be
clarified or our requests for alterations to the proposals on the plans
noted and those taken to the meeting. Once those points were accepted at
the OWP meeting and checked on the subsequently published minutes, they
would not have been retained as the minutes would then be accepted as our
file record.
I cannot recall details of the meeting accurately, but by virtue of this
feel that no controversy, or rejection of any parties proposals, or
question as to any obligation placed upon them by the scheme on the plans
submitted, was raised. If it had been I feel I would remember, and David
Vaughan, being a very accurate minute taker, would have recorded it in the
minutes.

The minutes of     the   meeting relate points raised on nine of the fourteen
plans submitted.

Plans that were of specific interest to the Fire Service were;

6705/6   Exit width between proposed central radial fence and each
side of the exit tunnel. Fence was central - acceptable.
         The position of the central fence would mean that one of
         the new areas created would not have        a   pitch perimeter
         gate into it - one was required.

6705/8A      Apparent    funnelling    effect created by       proposed new
          handrail adjacent to access road to Leppings         Lane - point
          raised and noted in minutes.

6705/12     Split   of segregation of supporters in       relation   to   exits
          from each side of new barrier - acceptable.

6705/17   Gate provided in radial barrier - acceptable.

6705/18   Gate widths - acceptable.

6705/19   Swing and position of gates - acceptable.

The other matter covered by the minutes was the stewarding of new gates.
The principal of control and definitions of the terms relating to
stewarding, policing, being under police control, would not have been
discussed.    However, all parties present were aware of the inter­
relationship of the factors comprising the evacuation procedure, and the
club and the police were especially aware of the implications of extra
gates meaning extra staff having to be present when the ground was in use.

There should be no doubt that if someones duty or task is to control a gate
then that duty or task is to control it by perhaps opening it if it is
closed, closing it if it is open, or whatever other control is necessary
according to the direction he is given or by the situation at the time. If
the duty or task was to control a gate by only being in attendance at that
gate when it was shut in order to open it in an emergency, then that is
what would be required in the certificate or required by the OWP.         A
similarity can be drawn with the term stewarding of gates.

The use of the term 'stewarding' as opposed to any other term for meaning
someone being present at a gate to control it in order to carry out duties
during supporters access to or egress from the parts of the ground for
whatever reason including emergency evacuation, was because the safety
certificate places that responsibility on stewards.

There are however some gates where the police feel that it would be more
appropriate for the police to do the 'stewarding' task.
This is because of their location the stewarding of certain gates may have
more of a law and order involvement than others. Eg gates in fences or
barriers which split opposing supporters.     The provision of either a
steward or a policeman would be generally acceptable to us, and the
decision as to which would be provided was open to negotiation by the club
and the police.
The proposals, despite being modified, did not change the means of escape
situation from the West Stand and Terrace. Exit widths were not reduced,
and the situation regarding factors such as the perimeter fence, terrace,
entrance/exit tunnel, signs on exits, and alternative exit from the areas,       j
were not in any way worsened by the proposals. In fact the provision of          i
the new central radial barrier made it necessary to install an extra pitch       i
perimeter fence gate, as previously one gate served the undivided central        '
area which was to be split in half.

Consideration to the need for forward evacuation of the whole area onto the
pitch was not necessary due to the proposals. We would consider this
action if for example:

      A risk existed, or was to be created by any proposals, at          the
back of the terrace thus creating a possibility of the           exit routes
becoming unusable, eg timber stand.
      (This element would have been considered again at the time          of
the review of grounds following the Bradford City Fire).

      Long distances or complicated routes were to be followed on           an
evacuation.

      At the request    of   the   police,   for   segregation   of   opposing
      supporters.

The provisions of the better crowd segregation facilities given by the
proposals would have been seen as an advantage, as it would assist in
achieving a more orderly and effective evacuation of the ground when that
was necessary.

The matters in the minutes were relayed to Eastwood and Partners by David
Vaughan and certain comments given in reply. Clarification was given where
necessary at the next OWP meeting.

My involvement with sports grounds ceased in early 1986 when I was promoted
to ADO at Headquarters.
Thoughts o n potential criticism listed o n brief

"The pens on the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
constituted a potential danger if crowded. The means of escape on
to the pitch were inadequate".

[Section 1 of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football),
HMSO 1976, sets the criteria for approaching work to be done in
grounds to achieve "..a reasonable degree of safety" for
spectators.]

All terraces in any sports stadium; rooms in a building; any area
designed to accommodate a certain number of people constitutes a
danger if crowded to the extent that the designed capacity is
exceeded.

The safety of people regarding crushing and egress in football
grounds, night clubs, department stores, and any other place where
members of the public have access in large numbers, and
consequently would require evacuation in an emergency, is
dependent generally on two factors;

     The physical elements of structure designed and provided for
     escape from the place, and

     the management or other persons controlling access
     and initiating and co-ordinating the evacuation.

Without either of the two elements overcrowding and crushing would
occur and an evacuation would not be effective.

I feel that it is reasonable to consider that if capacities are
known and provision is specifically made to ensure that the
capacity is closely controlled and the people directed, that the
capacity would not be exceeded. If a statement was made that no
assurance could be given to restrict the number of peoplewho may
enter an areaTwhich has a stated maximum capacity, then the
physical elements of structure would be different to those where
control is assured.

It would be unreasonable to require the provision of exits for
2000 people from an area that has a stated capacity of 1000. It
would be even more unreasonable to require that provision if
specific arrangements were in force to carefully supervise and
control people to ensure the capacity was not exceeded.

It would be unreasonable to expect a situation to be predicted
where several tasks specifically designed to either control or
allow/initiate escape in an emergency would not be carried out,
and consequently require the provision of extra exits to allow for
such a combination occurring.


Exit signs were not specifically required by the 1976 Guide,
except to encourage crowds in any particular sectTon to flow in
one direction when leaving the ground. Section 6.6.
%       —                 _         -
This was not the case from the central areas of the West Terrace;
the way in, was the direction the crowd was wanted to exit and
would naturally be the way the spectators would leave the area.


The Guide indicates that ramps should be of a constant gradient
and preferably not exceed a gradient of 1:10 where subject to
heavy crowd flow.

It again would be unreasonable to have envisaged a situation where
large crowds, (a packed mass of people akin to the crowds exiting,
instead of the controlled ingress of people regulated by turnstile
access), would enter onto the terrace from the tunnel. The
argument is really the opposite of an evacuation of the terraces.
If the slope had been in the other direction then consideration
would have been given to the suitability of the ramp as an element
of the exit route.
                     SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF MR S K ALLCOCK

I have to point out              that I    have     very little recollection                 of what       was

actually said at the actual meetings, or what my precise thoughts were on a

particular day.             However, having looked at the documents, I am able to                          say

what thoughts and views inevitably went through my mind.



As     regard       what     I have to say on pages 2 and 3 of my statement, I want to

make it clear that I understood that the gates in the radial                                fences       would

be     manned       at     all   times     during      the       game. However, it was a matter of
           ■f              : ’                         —         _
indifference to the              fire service whether                that manning   was      by a    police

officer or a steward.               That was a matter to be decided between the club and

the police.         I     believe       that    this       was       also the   policeunderstanding,

although        I   cannot swear to it.            However, the expression, "it is essential

that all the new gates are fully supervised by stewards" (see 2 (j) of                                    the

minutes of the meeting of the 29th July 1985) reinforces my view.



As     regards      the width of the new perimeter fence gate, that would not have

entered my head at the time.                   I was conscious only of the need              for     a    new

gate       in the fence.         The reason I was not concerned about the width of that

particular gate was because I saw the escape routes from                             that    terrace       as

being      to   the       rear, as was existing at that time.                   The introduction of an

additional perimeter fence gate was simply a bonus.                             I saw the purposes         of

the    perimeter          fence gate as being for police access for localised control

and for use for a small scale emergency, such as administering first aid to

someone who had fainted.



I    had    never        been    told    that    there       had been a crushing incident on the

Leppings Lane terraces in 1981.
I never considered the possibility of a large scale crushing incident   when

we were discussing the need for an extra gate in the perimeter fence.

 STATEMENT OF:
                       RETIRED FIRE PREVENTION OFFICER

SUBJECT:               SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUND
                       SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB


I was primarily involved with the Club from 1987 and consisted of pre-training
of stewards and ground inspection.

Training was carried out twice yearly on three successive years to train both
stewards and gate men/ancillary staff.

The pattern followed the guidelines as dictated by the Club in their Sheffield
Wednesday   Football Club "Instructions to Stewards" which followed the
recommendations of the general principles of the green guide.

The training consisted of 5 separate areas:-

1.     Open statement by Club Secretary.

2.     First Aid by St. Johns Ambulance Brigade.

3.     Fire Procedures/fire extinguishers relating to persons using the ground.

       The Emergency Procedure, which included      the    code   Mr.   Meadows   was
       explained in detail by the Fire Service.

4.     Police Procedures by the Police.

5.     Club Safety Adviser on the Club Rules and F.A. Rules.

The whole of this training session lasted 2^/2 - 3 hours.


NOTE        In item (3) above all the portable First Aid fire fighting equipment
            was demonstrated in its operation, location and use.


It was my understanding that should an incident arise that         required
evacuation, this would be carried out under the direction of the Police and
the scale of evacuation would depend on the emergency, as decided by the
Police at the time.

In addition last year the Police screened          a video ofa training film on
football disasters to all stewards and staff.

Following the request of Sheffield City Council in November       1987 an inspection
of the ground was carried out.

In general terms, the means of escape provisions in the ground were
satisfactory.   However I was concerned regarding       the   perimeter   gate
fastenings.   It was felt at that time any pressure on any gate from the
spectator side would not allow the bolts to operate and the gate open for any
reason.   Therefore a recommendation to improve this locking arrangement was
made and the improved locking arrangement to be fitted to all perimeter gates.

My name is Ronald Grimshaw.                   I   am   a    Divisional         Officer     in    the     Fire

Prevention          Section      of    the    South Yorkshire County Fire Service.                     I have

been with the fire services since 1964.




In February 1985, i              was    appointed      to   the       post     of    Headquarters       Fire

Prevention Officer in the rank of Divisional Officer following a period of

10 months serving in that position on a temporary basis.




One of       my     responsibilities         whilst     serving        in     that    position    was     to

represent         Fire      Service     Headquarters on all the District Officer Working

Parties set up within South Yorkshire with                        a    view    to     ensuring    that      a

common       fire      service    policy was applied throughout the county.                      The fire

service was also represented on the Officer Working Party by officers from

the division in whose area the respective sports stadia were situated.




It    was      in that capacity that I attended a meeting of the Officer Working

Party (Sheffield District) on 23rd January,                       1985,       along     with    Assistant

Divisional        Officer       Robbins      (Headquarters)           and    Station Officer

representing 'C' Division.                The purpose of the meeting was to carry out an

inspection        of     the    stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly

visits to football league grounds in South Yorkshire.                               I have however only

a    vague     recollection           of the reference in the minutes to that meeting to

the provision of temporary barriers for crowd segregation behind the                                    west

stand and that the club were to consider a scheme for permanent barriers.




On      18th      April,       1985,    following      receipt        of     outline     proposals       for

modification of entrance routes at the Leppings Lane end of                               the    stadium,

(Plan       N o . 6705/2)      along     with     Station     Officer         Vicars     ('C'    Division

representative),         I attended a meeting of the Officer Working Party at                            the

Police Sports Club, Niagara, Sheffield, to discuss those proposals.
The        police           were     already       familiar with the proposals and indicated that

they had              instigated          them     because       of   their    desire     to     allow        greater

flexibility                 in     the    use    of     the terrace and stand by both home and away

supporters, allowing them to vary the neutral area between                                       opposing           fans

as        circumstances              dictated         and     to achieve such arrangements for ingress

that would allow turnstiles to be dedicated to                                 specific        areas.         As     the

turnstiles                 were fitted with counters, greater control over the numbers of

spectators entering each area would have resulted.

     a-         —


At the meeting, the police suggested the provision of two                                       further        radial

fences,              one     dividing       the existing central area in half and running from

the tunnel entrance to the                         pitch side security fence with gates to                     permit

entry           to     either            section as appropriate, the other dividing the existing

north end of the terrace in half and running from the front to the back of

the t e r r a c e .




In        addition,          the     two     new       pens    created by the provision of the radial

fences were to be                    provided with additional exit gates                 through        the        pitch

perimeter             fence,             the new radial fence at the north end of the terrace to

have two gates and the existing radial fence to                                   the   north    side         of    the

tunnel to have a second gate.




The        provision             of two gates in each of the two radial fences to the north

of the tunnel was to allow sideways movement/evacuation along the                                         terrace

should          an     emergency           situation        occur,    the     normal     access route to the

terrace having become obstructed for any reason (this considered unlikely)

and also to allow police access to all parts of the terrace to control any

crowd disturbances.                      It was felt by the fire service                however,    that           only

one gate in each fence would be necessary for means of escape.




If        the    above           features       were    implemented,        the    proposed radial barrier
running parallel and 2 metres from the existing barrier at the                                   north        end

of     the terrace could be dispensed with as the police felt that they would

have more than adequate control for segregation purposes with the creation

of     the     smaller     pens.The creation of smaller pens was also seen                                  by the

police to be a bonus in               that by having smaller sections of                       crowd,their

job in maintaining order would be made easier.



At     the   meeting,        the      proposals    outlined      above were sketched in to the

drawing and on seeing the resulting layout, the main concern of myself and

Station Officer Vicars were (a) whether the external gates and exit routes

created at the rear of the stand would be                   adequate      for      the          numbers        of

spectators         in each section of the west stand and terrace, (b) whether the

numbers of spectators being allowed into each section of the terrace could

be     controlled        to prevent overcrowding, and (c) what arrangements were to

be made to ensure that the gates in the radial                     fences         would         be      readily

available for use should lateral movement along the terrace to alternative

exits become necessary.



Items (b) and (c) above were specifically put to the police as they, along

with     the     club,     were     responsible for ensuring that emergency evacuation

procedures were adequate and controlled and had experience with                                       the    club

of     ensuring correct crowd density packing.                  We were assured by the police

that all the gates included in the proposals for the terrace part                                       of    the

scheme       would    be     manned    by them at all times during games in order that
                                                                          '   '     ■— — — r     -a


evacuation procedures could be initiated should this become necessary.                                         As
                             V   “________________                                        —-            "
far     as     correct     density     packing    was     concerned, the police stated that

arrangements that they had with the club were satisfactory and                                   they        felt

that     the provision of smaller sections on the terraces would make overall

control of the terrace easier.



With the knowledge that in              addition     to   the    police       manning            all        gates

through      the     pitch       perimeter   and having good and close contact with the
whole terrace, there would be additional police manning all gates                                   in   the

radial        fences,    that police controlling the area had direct communication

with the police control room, and those manning the                          police     control          room

had     direct      vision     of    the   terrace      on    closed        circuit television, the

proposals were accepted in principle subject to                           closer     scrutiny       of   the

means       of    escape     arrangements       behind       the west stand referred to at                (a)

above, the capacities               of   each   section       of     the terrace      and     thus       the

anticipated numbers to use those exit routes behind the west stand.



On     examination       of the plans, it was found necessary to indicate that the

exit gates behind the west stand needed to be of a specific width to allow

for     the      number of spectators that had been calculated would use them and

to     specify that the gates would be supervised by                        either    the     police       or

club     officials.          With    regard to the terracing arrangements, it was felt

that the proposal for the new radial fence                      at    the    tunnel     position          had

little        effect on the existing situation, the capacities, travel distances

and exit arrangements from the two new central pens                           did    not    change.        In

fact a new gate through the pitch perimeter fence was to be provided.                                     The

new radial fence at the north end of the                      terrace did          actually     slightly

increase the travel distance to the normal route of exit i.e. the way onto

the terrace otherwise there was no change.



There were no exit signs at any point                   along       the    terrace     when        the   new

proposals        were    being      considered.      With the police control of the gates

through       the    radial      fences,    and   the     pitch       perimeter       gates,        police

surveillance         of the whole of the terrace both close at hand and by closed

circuit television; the use of a public address system to give                                directions

to    the     whole or certain sections of the stadium during an emergency; the

easy identification of the normal routes of                        ingress    and     thereby       normal

routes      of    exit     i.e. around the ends of the stand or through the tunnel;

and the fact that this was an open concrete terrace                          in     front     of    a    non

combustible         stand,    it was not considered necessary to make any provision
for exit signs.




The gates through the perimeter fence were                  considered        to    be     essential,

this    being reflected by the request for two additional gates in the newly

created pens.        The use of the gates was under the direct                   control        of    the

police    and      was     to   allow their        access   into   the        terrace       should any

disturbance arise and to relieve any local build up                      of     pressure        at    the

front    of    the       pens   or     allow     any person becoming ill or overcome to be

removed by that route.               The police, who had control           of      the    gates,       had

always been happy that the gates were adequate for these purposes.



Because       of   the lack of any risk from fire in the whole of the west stand

and terrace, and the measures that were in being for preventing ingress in

to the ground of numbers of spectators greater than that calculated for in

each section of the ground i.e. high                  perimeter    wall,        substantial          gates

that are stewarded, computer controlled turnstiles providing a smooth flow

into the ground, plus the presence of police and stewards and provision of

closed     circuit        television facilities, it was never considered necessary

that the gates through the pitch perimeter fence onto the pitch                             would       be

used     for evacuation of the total capacity of each section.                           It was always

felt that should any situation arise that necessitated total evacuation of

any     sections,        evacuation would in the first case be by way of the normal

ways on to the terrace i.e. the tunnel and around each end of                             the     stand.

Should any of these routes of exit be obstructed for any reason, the gates

in the radial fences and under police control would be used as directed by

the police using the public address system



Forward       evacuation        on    to   the    pitch by large numbers of spectators was

considered to be unnecessary because of the provision of alternative means

of     evacuating        each area, therefore the marking of the gates as exits and

the improvement of the stepping arrangement though                    the       gates      were      also

considered to be unnecessary.
With     regard     to     the   gradient        of    the     tunnel access to the terrace, as

referred to above, it was never envisaged that a                          large          crowd   of        people

would     pass down the tunnel on to the terrace as the rate of entry to that

section would be at a rate controlled by the turnstiles.                                 To    plan        for    a

large     number     passing        on   to     the     terrace      would     be        impracticable and

undesirable due to bottlenecks caused by crush barriers in emerging on                                           to

the     terrace.      As      far     as the effect of the gradient on people egressing

from the terrace, it is totally                 under        cover     therefore         not     subject         to

becoming slippery in inclement weather and as it is at the immediate entry

point to the escape system, what slight delay it may cause is at                                       a    point

where     people     are      still      held    in     a    relatively safe place, i.e. on the

terrace but once entering the escape route there                         are        no     further         points

that    may   hinder         escape flow.       Had the gradient been at the other end of

the tunnel then          a    hazard     would        have    undoubtedly       been          caused       in    an

undesirable        position      and     therefore          measures    would        have been taken to

rectify the situation.

X first began work as a                      fire           officer      with     Halifax      County       Borough      Fire

Brigade      in        1963.           I    started          working        for    the     fire      authority in South

Yorkshire in               1979.        I    was      a       Station       Officer      in    the    Fire       Prevention

Department            of       the    then      'C'          Division       of the South Yorkshire County Fire

Service from November 1979 until early 1982.



I attended the meetings of the Officer Working Party for                                             that     division     on

the 11th September, 1981, the 7th October, 1981 and the 4th February, 1982.



At   the      first and third of those meetings, I recall the new radial barriers

being discussed.                 I was aware when I attended the meetings                              that      there    had

been     a   crushing                problem       at        the Leppings Lane end at the April 1981 semi

final.            *                             ~



I understood that the radial barriers were                                       being   introduced         to    segregate

supporters.                I    cannot       honestly remember it being suggested that they were

being introduced to reduce the risk of crushing.



We discussed the gates to be installed at the rear of the radial                                                  barriers.

It     is    my       distinct             recollection              that    at one meeting ( I cannot remember

which) a representative of South Yorkshire Police (I                                          cannot        remember     who)

said     that         the gates would be manned at all times by police officers.                                         That

was important because one of the                                 means      of    escape      from    the     terrace     was

through those gates.



I    note that the minutes for the 11th September, 1981 make reference to "the

use of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter                                              security           fence atthe front

of     the    terrace"               being     discussed.                However, I        cannot in all honesty now
                                                        -    1   -
remember if I had any views about the adequacy or otherwise of the gates          in

the    pitch   perimeter   fence.    However, the means of escape were considered

satisfactory at the time and in accordance with the       Green   Guide.    A   mass

evacuation would be at the rear and sides of the terracing and not on to the

playing area.     The terrace and stand were mainly of concrete     and    presented

very    little in the way of fire hazard.     I never foresaw the pitch perimeter

fence gates having to be used for mass evacuation.

                                STATEMENT OF JOHN RAY

I was with the South Yorkshire Brigade from 1981 to November 1983 at                                which

date     I retired.       Prior to that I was with Oxfordshire Fire Service and had

been in the fire service since 1957.



The first meeting of the Officer Working                   Party        that     I   attended    was    on

11.09.81.         I believed my terms of reference at the time was to monitor and

report     back    to     the    Chief     Officer       any    matters        associated    with      fire

protection,        fire    prevention and means of escape in case of fire and other

associated fire           related    matters.        I    feel     that    these      minutes    clearly

established        for me my terms of reference.                 As this was my first meeting, I

contributed little and merely sat and listened.



In the early days of my joining the committee there was informal talk about

the crushing at the 1981 semi final. There was nothing as I recall of such
         11
a nature in these discussions that led me to believe that I should need to

consider     improvements           to    the   layout     of     the     area   where      the incident

occurred.



I am aware that the minutes of the meeting of 08.06.81 gives assurance that

the    Working Party will be consulted when the crushing incident in the 1981

semi final had been considered.                 During my period on the              Officers    Working

Party, this statement was never acted upon.



I am aware that the Officer Working Party agreed to the installation of the

radial barriers subject to them being under the control of the police.                                  The

impression I got from this was that the police would man these gates.                                  This

is minuted in the meeting of 11.09.81.



I attended the          meeting      on    07.10.81.       At     that     meeting,      there   was     no

discussion regarding the west stand.
I    did not attend the Officer Working Party meeting on 04.02.82 (Mr Johnson

my deputy attended on my behalf) and rely on the minutes of this meeting to

advise    me   of    what transpired.    Similarly I did not attend the meeting on

10.05.82 (Mr                  attended on my behalf.      He was one of my deputies)



I attended the meeting on 24.08.82.            There was nothing in this meeting that

was pertinent to the west stand and escape there from.



On     16.09.82     I sent a memorandum to the Chief Executive of South Yorkshire

County Council following an attendance at a football match at               Hillsborough

when     we had occasion to question the adequacy of amongst other things, the

fire routine and emergency evacuation procedure and confirmed in my opinion

they were in contravention of the conditions laid down in Schedule 2 of the

General Safety Certificate.        These are fully set out in my        memorandum.      I

recall     that     as a result of this complaint, the situation was rectified by

direct involvement between fire officers and club             officials     to   generally

improve     the safety standards.       Certain on site training was carried out by

a number of fire officers.        The situation was rectified to my          satisfaction

and I during my period of office had no further occasion to criticise their

methods.



During the whole of the time I served on the Officer Working Party, I never

considered the gates in the perimeter fence as forming part of the means of

escape procedure.        They were adequate in my opinion for         the   purpose   they

served,     namely     communication    gate    for   first   aid and rapid response to

localised incidents on the terrace.



I recall the reasons given for the radial fences              being   installed    was   to

obtain     better     crowd   control   and monitor crowd behaviour.        Positioned as

they were, I did not see them as in any way impeding movement of persons in

an outward direction in an emergency situation.
I did not consider that the terrace and its mode of construction was a high

fire risk.    The    stand   was   concrete   and   there   was   little   combustible

material     with   or   without   radial barriers.    I consider that the means of

escape from the terrace was in an outward direction adequate           with    correct

policing/stewarding.         Movement   on to the pitch was not considered a means

of escape.     Egress was via the gates by which the spectators had entered.



Provided that the gates at the head of the radial           fencing   were    correctly

supervised in accordance with the recommendations as set out in the minutes

of the Officer Working Party, I did not foresee these gates would create              a

problem.

                            DIVISIONAL OFFICER MALCOLM JOHNSON

                                       NORTH DIVISION HQ

I joined the Fire Service in December 1963 in Leeds City.                 In June of        1974

I    joined       South   Yorkshire    Brigade.   Prior to that I had been in Glasgow.

From January 1979 - August 1981, I was seconded to Fire                 Service   Technical

College,      Morton-in-Marsh, Gloucs.          I returned to South Yorkshire in August

1981.       In February 1982 I was promoted to Divisional         Officer    part      of    my

reference was to monitor the divisional work involving the Safety of Sports

Grounds.



On the 4th February, 1982, I attended a site meeting of the Officer Working

Party       at Hillsborough Stadium together with Stn.O Horner and Waterhouse of
                                                             y
'C' Division F.P. Section.



The meeting had been arranged to discuss differences              of     opinions     between

police       on    the    one   hand   and   Messrs   Eastwood and partners representing

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.



One of the differences of opinion involved the West Terrace.                 Recently        new

radial       barriers had been installed and the police were concerned that some

of the existing crush barriers extended through the               new    radial     barriers.

This, they thought, would enable fans to climb from one pen to another.



It    was     eventually agreed, despite the fact fans may climb over the radial

barrier, that it was preferable to maintain the crush barriers which passed

through       the    radial     barriers and to review the position at the end of the

season.       My understanding of the decision being that it was safer from                  the

point       of view of preventing crowd surges if the crush barriers remained as

they were.
That was the only matter under discussion in the area of the                           west    terrace

at this particular meeting.



I    had not been involved with the original calculations and implementations

of the radial barriers and did not at this meeting consider them as                                I    was

there    to       look    at     a number of specific items.            The crush barriers on the

west terrace being one of these items. The other matters related                              to    other

parts of the ground and did not involve the west terrace or west stand.



The capacities of various parts of the ground would have been calculated at

an earlier date.                These       capacities   would   have    been    revised      when       any

variation occurred.



At    the     time       of    this      inspection,     although   I was not there to consider

specifically means of escape, I did not consider that there was any                                 danger

to     fans      on   this      terracing       providing   that    numbers      were controlled. I

considered that the means of escape from the central pen                         was    the        tunnel,

the     gate provided           with radial barriers and the gate in the fence onto the

pitch.        The whole situation looked right at the time.



At this point I was not aware there had been crushing in                          1981.       I became

aware       of    this        when     in   order   to acquaint myself with my new job I read

through my current files.                   I concluded from reading       the    appropriate           file

that subject to the pens not being over crowded the dangers of crushing was

greatly reduced by the installation of the radial barriers.



Danger from fire was virtually none existent, as the                        terrace     was        in   the

open     and      the     stand       to the rear was of concrete construction.               It.was my

understanding that the gates provided on to the pitch would                            be   under       the

control          of   police         officers   and    that the gates in the new radial fence,

would be under the control of either the police or ground marshals. This is
a    standard          condition            that   is placed upon control of any gates which the

police or club require to be kept closed.                            This is so they      can    be   opened

quickly          in an emergency.              My understanding of the words "under the control

of" is that there should be a permanent presence.                             In the case of the        gate

onto       the        pitch this is                the police's responsibility andinthe case of any

other gate it would most likely be a marshal who                             shouldbe    identifiable.

If     I   was        at       a    match     and there was no such manning, I would make it my

business to ensure that the gate was immediately manned and this                                  would   be

followed         by        a       letter    to    the   club.       In   1984 I moved to East Division

Headquarters and ceased to have any responsibility for Hillsborough.



There were no exit signs on any of the exits but in view                                of the    permanent

manning          of    gates          and that other exit ways from the area were via routes
                                                             "   “


which fans would have arrived by, it was not considered and not                                  considered

necessary.            I    was in fact endorsing the recommendations of my predecessors

who had arrived at a similar conclusion

On the 11th September, 1981, I attended a meeting at Division                Street    Fire

Station with other representative bodies, the purpose of the meeting was to

consider plans submitted by Messrs Eastwood            &   Partners    to   the   proposed

erection    of    radial    barriers on the west terrace for the purpose of crowd

control.



It was my understanding that to the rear of each barrier, gates were to                  be

installed    to    allow      lateral egress to other pens should a need arise, and

that these gates would always be manned by             police   or    stewards    on   match

days.                   ~



In addition to these gates, the means of escape from the terrace was deemed

to be satisfactory, the large double gates on the curtilage wall leading to

Leppings Lane, and the perimeter road running around the rear of the stands

leading to Penistone Road.            The existing gates in the perimeter fence         were

considered       reasonable     for    limited   numbers   to evacuate onto the premier

track.



From the point of view of the Fire Service, the risk of fire was considered

as a low risk because of the structure being hard standing, in the open and

maintained by police and stewards

                           SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF M R B A ELLIS




I was employed by the               South    Yorkshire        County     Fire     Service      until        28th

February,         1986.      When     I     retired      I   had attained the rank of Divisional

Officer.



Regarding 11th September, 1981, Officer Working Party.                             The meeting was the

only meeting that I recall attending.



I was aware that there had been problems at the April, 1981 semi-final.                                      As

far as I can remember, I was not aware and was                          not     made    aware     that       the

problem       had     been    one     of     crowd      crushing.       I understood that the radial

barriers were          required         simply     to    break    the    crowd     down     into       smaller

manageable groups.



My       understanding       of     the condition that "the new gates at the rear of the

terrace also being under police control” was that they would be                                  constantly

manned during each match.                  We would not have accepted anything less because

it was important that an officer be there to give guidance to                                  the     problem

with       respect to lateral movement in the event of an emergency.                             Although I

cannot remember the exact words used at the meeting of the 11th                                   September,

1981,       the     decision      was      along     the     lines indicated above and the police

accepted the position.



I saw these gates in the perimeter fence                         primarily      for     access       into    the

crowd.        I     did    consider however that they would serve as an exit point in i
     ■

the event of a minor emergency e.g. an ill person having to be                                   passed      out

of       the crowd.       However, I considered the primary exits from the terrace as

being through the tunnel or laterally                        through     the    gates     in     the    radial j

fences and round the sides of the stand.
At   the meeting of the 11th September, 1981, I did not apply my mind to the

problem of/crowd crushing nor was my mind directed to that problem.

                                MEETING 18.04.85 AND VISIT 26.04.85



My namp is                                         and I am employed as a Station Officer               in

the Fire Prevention Section of the South Yorkshire Fire Service, serving in

the Sheffield Division.                    I have been in    the    fire   service    for    20    years

always in the Sheffield Division.



I   was     instructed          to     attend a meeting of the Officer Working Party to be

held at the Police Social Club, Niagra, on 18th April, 1985, as                             Divisional

representative.             I    accompanied Divisional Officer Grimshaw, the nominated

Headquarters Officer, to the meeting and this was to be my only involvement

with      safety    matters           at    this   ground,    I    was in fact substituting for a

colleague who was unavailable..                    My personal recollection of the details of

this      meeting     are       now rather vague, but after re-examining the records, I

feel able to state the following:-



The purpose of the meeting was to consider proposals                        put      forward      by   the

club,      and supported, I understood, by the police, to provide more flexible

arrangements for crowd control and segregation at the Leppings Lane end                                 of

the ground.



The proposals comprised two main elements:-



The     first   was     to       erect new radial fences on the terrace and thus create

pens to      accommodate             spectators     and   provide     flexible    arrangements          for

segregating home and visiting supporters.                     This included the provision of a

manned gate at the end of the access tunnel to the central terrace area, by

which      supporters        could be diverted to either the left or right hand pens,

according to the dictates of the day.                     My understanding was that          the       gate
would     be   manned      by     either     the     police or a club steward.               Each pen, in

addition to the normal means of ingress,                    was    to    have        gates       supervised

again     by   police      or stewards which would allow lateral movement along the

terrace.       Additionally, extra gates were proposed in                     the     pitch       perimeter

fence, primarily for police access.



The second element of the proposals was to rearrange turnstiles, exit gates

and fences at the rear of the stand, so that                      crowd       segregation         could    be

effected prior to entry to the ground proper.



After     discussion        of       the   scheme,    Divisional Officer Grimshaw and myself

informed the meeting that the proposals                     appeared     to     be        satisfactory     in

principle,        subject       to     a more detailed examination of the means of escape

implications and on the understanding that all gates (which would                                    normally

be    secured      for     crowd       control purposes) would be manned by either police

officers and/or responsible club officials.                       It was stated that             a   written

reply to the Licensing Authority would be given and the meeting was closed.



On    subsequent         consideration of the proposals, potential capacities of the

pens were calculated and it was decided that the normal means of ingress to

these     areas     would        satisfy    the requirement for means of escape and hence

total evacuation.           This decision was taken in light of the                       fact    that    the

terrace    was an open concrete area and that the ingress/egress route passed

through non-combustible structures.                   The gates in the          radial       fences      were

considered to be necessary to provide adequate alternative means of escape,

by allowing lateral movement along                   the    terrace     to     alternate         points    of

egress.



The   pitch       perimeter       gates     were     not    calculated        as forming part of the

recognised      means      of     escape,     but    were     acknowledged           as    providing       an

additional facility, particularly for alleviating localised difficulties.
It    was not thought necessary to sign any of the exit routes because a) the

principle ingress/egress route would be that already familiar to users                                   and

b)     fence gates would be manned and under the control of police or stewards

on the spot, who would be able to assess local conditions and who could                                   be

made     aware,    via the established emergency procedure of conditions outside

their immediate supervision.



The proposed entrance gates to the ground                      ,    sited   at       the   rear   of     the

Leppings Lane stand, were assessed for required widths, based on the likely

numbers of people for which they would have to cater.



On 26th April, 1985, I visited the ground with Station Officer                                           who

was     normally the Divisional representative with respect to these premises,

and Inspector Calvert of South Yorkshire Police.                       Although I have no              clear

recollection        of    the substance of this meeting, I feel sure that it was to

consider any on site implications of the proposals put forward on                                 plan     at

the     meeting     of    18th       April, 1985.      I also feel that this visit confirmed

that the proposals were satisfactory in principle as no record was made                                   of

any     additional       requirement       to    those    considered          at the meeting of 18th

April.



A written reply, including a marked copy of drawing number 6705/2, was sent

to the Licensing Authority on the 30th April, 1985.                         After this point I had

no     further     involvement         with     the   matter       although      I    understand,        from

subsequent        examination of records, that the proposals were not implemented

in the original format.

                      ASSISTANT DIVISIONAL OFFICER BRIAN COPLEY 344



I have been in the South Yorkshire Fire                  Brigade     or        its    predecessors           in

title for 24 years.

Attended       "summer" inspection meeting 7th August, 1985, in the roll of Fire

Service Headquarters representative.                  This was my       first        involvement          with

Hillsborough          stadium.        Ipossibly may     have    been asked to go as Iwas                   the

only    available        officer.         I attended thismeeting           with        S.O.

                     He is now with one of the Welsh Fire Brigades.

At   this time I was Temporary AssistantDivisional Officer, attached                                     to the

Fire Prevention Department               atF S HQ.



Having read the minutes of the meeting, I am                    able      to     confirm          that     the

following items regarding the west terrace were discussed and agreed:-



(a) that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence allowing access to

       the sterile zone should either be extended or have                            steps       to    provide

       easier        access    from    the new 2m wide gap (the sterile zone) formed by

       the new radial fence I understood                from the       comments        of        the     senior

       police        officer     present,that    it    would    be     the      policy           to have two

       policemen posted within the gap in order for them to monitor the crowd

       on    the      adjacent     terrace.     The    gap     could be used by the police to

       direct the crowd onto the pitch in the event of a                        crowd        disturbance.

       I     did not consider that an exit sign was needed, because the need for

       mass evacuation could not be foreseen. This was because                               I    could    not

       see     any     fire hazard in this area and I was primarily concerned about

       escape in the event of fire.



(b) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be                              provided          from

       the new south central terrace pen.                I do not know whether one was ever

       fitted.
        I cannot recall any comments made regarding the adequacy of the        gate,

     but     I felt that because the crowd would leave the terrace by the same

     way as they entered, the use for this gate would allow the         police    to

        gain access to the terrace and for them to remove any trouble causers.

        It was stated that policewomen could be used to man the gate.        The use

        of exit signs was thought not to be necessary.



During the discussion, no comments were made regarding any games other than

those involving Sheffield Wednesday.     I   was   not   aware   of   any   previous

incidents at Hillsborough

During 1985 I held the reference within "C" Division of Planning Officer.
The main duty of the reference was to liaise with the Department of Land
and Planning of the Sheffield City Council with regard to Fire Service
comments appertaining to applications for planning permission and/or
Building Regulations approval.

Early each week the City Council would forward to me a copy of the "Plans
List" in order that I could prepare our comments in time for the plans
meeting (colloquially called the "look-see") which would be held every
Friday morning at the Town Hall.

Prior to making comment on any submitted plan it was my usual practice to
peruse our records in order to ascertain whether or not the Department had
previous knowledge of the premises concerned or more specific details of
the scheme involved and whether or not any colleague was currently
involved with the premises.

In the case of Building Regulation Application No. 85/2549B appertaining
to alterations to the rear of the West Stand at Hillsborough Stadium which
was listed for Building Regulations approval on 19th July, 1985, I would
have discussed the proposals with the appropriate Officer (the Fire
Service were in possession of duplicate plans) prior to making comment.
My note for file dated 19th July, 1985 refers to my indications that our
comments to Building Control would be delayed pending further discussions
and consideration.

The Officer concerned would be responsible for liaising with the   Building
Control Authorities and/or architect as necessary.

    Hillsborough Disaster - Compensation Payments


    Thank you for your letter of 26 January in which you asked
    whether this Department has any views on the funding of
    settlements above the statutory bereavement provision.

    As you know, the Lord Chancellor is conducting a review of the
    level of bereavement damages and he will be issuing a
    consultation paper shortly which will invite views on whether the
    present level should be raised and, if so, what new level would
    now be appropriate.

    I am aware that in some recent cases settlements have been made
    for sums above the present statutory level.    However, I do not
    think it would be proper for me or anyone else in this Department
    to comment on whether a higher sum would be appropriate in any
    particular case, since settlements must always be a matter for
    the parties.

    I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful.

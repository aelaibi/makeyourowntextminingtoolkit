           On Saturday the 15th of April               1989 <150489)      I was at th^r Hillsborough

            football    stadium.       I was employed as sales assistant ^ J h y

                        who have the/catering franchise at the ground,



            I reported to tharground at about                11.30 am     <1130) and picked up my

            cash float.       I / h e n walked around the pitch area end w^rft up to the

           Lower South\grt,and.         I was working        in the kiosk knowrr as               I was

           working alongside                              All we were doing was selling the hot

            pies to the supporters.            We were kept very busy right up until the

            kick off time.         It is normal      practice for myself and              to take it

            in turns to watch the game.              We normally have 15 minutes or so each,



            I remember that              went off to see the game just a few minutes
                                                                                   PAGE      2
                                                                                   S3629

before 3 pm (1500).         I began to clean and tidy up.          After a few

minutes    I became aware of an unusually high number of fans standing up

in the South Stand rather than being seated in their seats.                    I left

the kiosk and went up the stairs.             1 looked at the pitch and could see

that there were one or two persons milling about on the pitch at the

rear of the Liverpool        goal.     I thought it was hooligans        causing

trouble.     I went back to the kiosk and carried on cleaning up.                   I

remember that a Notts Forest fan came to the counter and he was

commenting about the Liverpool           fans unruly behaviour.        He obviously

d i d n ’t know the real    problem.     I went back up to the stand a few

minutes    later and saw that the game had stopped.              I saw that there

were now more fans spilling onto the track.                 I went back to the kiosk

and after a few minutes when it was obvious that no more customers

were    coming,   I pulled the shutters down,         locked the door and went

back to the stand.         I found         and then we saw the St Johns

Ambulance Brigade attempting to resuscitate              people on the pitch.           It

was obvious now that something very serious had occurred and people

were obviously injured and distressed.              1 saw the St Johns Ambulance

being driven to behind the goal           posts and tften me and            went down

and onto the pitch.         We ran down the stai/s and stepped over the wall,

I could see that people were making use/of the advertising hoardings

to carry people away.  Me and      de/ided to do the same.  We ran up
       O f T                                               -----------
to the Spion Kop end and got a hoarding.  We then ran back up to the

Leppings Lane end.         There were people lying a b o u V e v e r y w h e r e and it

was a scene of chaos and confusion.             We stopp^a alongside a youth who

was    lay i ng on the pitch,    on the 18 yard 1 iy te .    There were 3 or 4 other

fans with h i m .   We lifted him onto the roardi n g .          We picked the board

up and carried it up to behind the North Stand.                 There was myself,

       and 3 other supporters who I d o n ’t know except that they all had

Scouse accents.       I carried the rear nearside           corner of the makeshift

                         got behind the North Stand and laid the youth down outside the gym,

                                 had already started to go back into the ground.      I noticed a

             young lad laying on a board,                  he was only 7 or S years old.    There was

             an ambulanceman helping him.                   I said,   “Will he be OK," and he said

             that he would.



             We then both went back down to the Leppings Lane end and looked

             around for another hoarding.                   We found one and then went over to a

             youth who was being tended to by a police officer.                     He was a young

             white youth with a red Liverpool j e j / s e y            on.   I think he was alive but

             d i d n ’t seem to know what was goin<g on.               We lifted him onto the

             ’stretcher’ and carried him off /to the same place we had taken the

             other lad.                  I think there were/6 of us carrying that one,     one on each

             corner and two in the middle,/                  The re was a uniformed policeman helping

             us      .

             We laid this youth down in the same place as the other one.                        I think

             he was alive.



             We then went back down to the Leppings Lane end but there seemed

             nothing else we could do.

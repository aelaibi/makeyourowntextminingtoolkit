MRS WILLIAMS & MR BRUDER

Thank you for your fax today. The document which I sent you
yesterday is not a ‘statement’ by Mr Bruder but the transcript of his
discussion with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on 6 October 1997. Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith has completed his report and given it to the
Home Secretary, and his work on the Hillsborough Scrutiny is over.
He took full account of what Mr Bruder told him.

I understand that the Home Secretary is currently considering Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith’s report. If there are any submissions which you
would like the Home Secretary to take into account I suggest that you
make them to the Home Office at Room 528, 50 Queen Anne’s Gate,
London SW1H 9AT, fax 0171 273 2703. Or you could make them to
me, and I will pass them on. It would as you suggest be helpful if
you could do that within the next 24 hours.


                    IF ANY PART OF THIS FAX IS UNCLEAR
                       PLEASE TELEPHONE: 0171 273 2512

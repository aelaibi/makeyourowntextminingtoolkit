The members of the Police Authority have resolved to make the offer of financial
assistance for legal representation to officers who may be in jeopardy from Hillsborough
Disaster related prosecutions. If you wish to use this facility you must apply.

The members have agreed to allow the Chairman, the Clerk and I to decide on such
applications on their behalf. For simplicity, I suggest that you endorse this letter with words
to the effect of, “I wish to apply for financial assistance for legal representation as outlined
in this letter", sign and date. As soon as I receive your reply the Clerk and I can consider
your application.

The Chief Constable has used Winckworth Pemberton Solicitors, 35 Great Peter Street,
Westminster, London, SW1P 3LP (Telephone 0171 5935000) in connection with Sir
Murray’s Scrutiny. They came well recommended and have been of great assistance. Nick
Owston, Ailsa Lawrence and Simon Eastwood have mastered the complexities of the
disaster and subsequent enquiries. I suggest that you use their services.

If your application for financial assistance is approved and you are happy to use
Winckworth Pemberton their bills will come direct to us.

I have already asked Simon and Ailsa to research the procedures by which a private
prosecution is initiated; who does what, where, when and how. If you are content to use
their services, Simon suggested a meeting at an early opportunity. It would help me to be
at that meeting and perhaps the three of us could attend together.

If I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. This must be a worrying
time for you. I am on leave 2-6 March 1998 but we are not going away and my secretary,
                  will phone me daily with any news.

            The members of the Police Authority have resolved to make the offer of financial
            assistance for legal representation to officers who may be in jeopardy from Hillsborough
            Disaster related prosecutions. If you wish to use this facility you must apply.

            The members have agreed to allow the Chairman, the Clerk and I to decide on such
            applications on their behalf. For simplicity, I suggest that you endorse this letter with words
            to the effect of, “I wish to apply for financial assistance for legal representation as outlined
            in this letter”, sign and date. As soon as I receive your reply the Clerk and I can consider
            your application.

            The Chief Constable has used Winckworth Pemberton Solicitors, 35 Great Peter Street,
            Westminster, London, SW1P 3LP (Telephone 0171 5935000) in connection with Sir
            Murray’s Scrutiny. They came well recommended and have been of great assistance. Nick
            Owston, Ailsa Lawrence and Simon Eastwood have mastered the complexities of the
            disaster and subsequent enquiries. I suggest that you use their services.

            If your application for financial assistance is approved and you are happy to use
            Winckworth Pemberton their bills will come direct to us.

            I have already asked Simon and Ailsa to research the procedures by which a private
            prosecution is initiated; who does what, where, when and how. If you are content to use
            their services, Simon suggested a meeting at an early opportunity. It would help me to be
            at that meeting and perhaps the three of us could attend together.

            If I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. This must be a worrying
            time for vou. I am on leave 2-6 March 1998 but we are not going away and my secretary,
                              [will phone me daily with any news.

            Yours sincerely

   Dear Chairman,

   I was present at the Police Authority meeting last Friday, (27 February 1998) when
   you and your colleagues voted unanimously to support police officers - serving and
   retired - who may find themselves the subject of private prosecutions brought against
   them in connection with the Hillsborough disaster.

   On behalf of all those concerned and on behalf of the Police Federation, I thank you all
   very much. Knowing that, should it become necessary, legal fees will be paid by the
   Police Authority is an immense relief for the people involved and their families who
   have suffered so very much over the last nine years.

   With very best wishes.
             /

I have considered the applications submitted by David Duckenfield and Trevor Bichard for
financial assistance towards the legal expenses which they may incur in the event of
private prosecutions being brought against them in connection with the Hillsborough

matter. Acting on their behalf I am accordingly prepared to approve the applications
made. I will write personally to both officers informing them of my decision.

Dear Simon

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

Firstly, please accept my apologies for the late payment of your previously proffered bill for
services. By now, a cheque is on its way to you under separate cover. Please feel free to
submit bills at whatever frequency you think fit.

As you know, the South Yorkshire Police Authority agreed to the principle of meeting any
reasonable legal expenses incurred by past and present police officers who may face a
private prosecution in connection with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.                 Chief
Superintendent (retired) David Duckenfield applied for such assistance and it was granted.
He has asked you to represent him. Obviously Mr Duckenfield is a private citizen and I
must not favour his interests. However, I have a duty to ensure that the Force’s finances
are wisely spent and that proper provision is made for foreseeable eventualities. For that
reason, it will be useful if we continue to share information, without infringing confidentiality
rules.

I am obliged to you for your efforts to keep to a reasonable sum the costs that Mr
Duckenfield is obliged to spend. If I become aware of any public developments that may
affect the situation I will advise you.

Yours sincerely

20 April 1998

Mr. Ian Daines,
Assistant Chief Constable,
South Yorks Police HQ,
Snig Hill,
Sheffield S3 8LY.


Dear Mr. Daines,

     I refer to our telephone conversation of late the 2nd of April morning. You will recall my
original inquiry was prompted by an article written by yourself in ‘Police Review’ (issue date
March 13th 1998). For the record I shall quote the passage that refers to me.


       I will turn now to the principal evidential issues that were put before Sir Murray Stuart-
       Smith. Dr. Ed Walker treated some o f the victims that were taken to the Northern
       General Hospital at Sheffield during the tragedy. After the broadcast o f the drama
       Hillsborough in 1996, he wrote in a letter that he ‘was not contacted by the West
       Midlands police nor asked to appear at the inquest’. He also said that he had treated
       people after 3.15 pm, some o f whom later died. Dr. Walker appeared to have new and
       important evidence to offer.
        However, on July 20, 1989, Dr. Walker wrote a seven-page statement on West Midlands
        Police witness statement stationery. It was countersigned by a staff nurse and a police
        officer. In July 1997, Dr. Walker authorised South Yorkshire Police to give his statement
        to the solicitor o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG). Accompanied by the
        solicitor to the HFSG, Dr. Walker was interviewed by Sir Murray Stuart-Smith and
        agreed that he had forgotten about his 1989 statement when he wrote his letter in early
        1997. He also agreed that it is normal procedure at inquests fo r the consultant to give
        evidence on behalf o f the medical team and that his non-attendance at the Hillsborough
        inquests was therefore not significant.


     The bulk of our conversation as you will recall concerned details of the police statement. You
declined to comment on the issue of WPS Appleton adding her signature in my absence, saying
that this had been dealt with in depth by Stuart-Smith. It is in feet dealt with by him in four
sentences in the transcript of our meeting - the matter is not referred to in the body of the report
at all. You did however concede that there is some dispute over the matter, as you had
deliberately used the word ‘countersigned’ rather than ‘witnessed’ when referring to the
signatures in your article.
     I am unclear why, if you felt able to go into such detail about the timing of my statement in
a rather obvious attempt to paint me as an unreliable witness, you did not feel it necessary to
mention the highly irregular behaviour of one member of West Midlands police, especially when
such behaviour would have been of particular interest to the readership of the publication in
question (‘Police Review’), and the source of some stimulating debate.
     At one point in our conversation you expressed some surprise that if I had forgotten making
the statement at all, I could be so sure who had or had not been present. I pointed out that the
staff nurse who was present will confirm that no police officer was in the room.
     I got the distinct impression that you seem to believe that there was something deliberate
about my having forgotten the police statement, and you say in your article ‘Dr. Walker appeared
to have new and important evidence to offer. ’ When I told you that it was a simple mistake on
my part, you said that in your opinion it was more than that, and then went on to say that you
believed that as a result of my having come forward and claiming to have new evidence
(something that I have never to my knowledge actually done) the families’ hopes were built up
and things were put into motion which would not otherwise have been put into motion.
    My response to this was to ask that if you really believed this to be the case, why did South
Yorkshire police not come forward at an earlier stage to let relevant organisations and individuals
know that they were indeed in possession of a statement? As I recall, your eventual reply to this
was that you could not check every public statement made regarding its veracity.
     Please would you be good enough to let me know exactly when S. Y.P. became aware that
they had on file a copy of my statement, and when, and to whom, they made this feet known. I
should remind you that the press conference at which I originally asserted that I had not made a
statement was on Wednesday February 26th 1997.
    I      should be grateful if you could confirm this as a roughly accurate account of our
conversation, and for any other comments you wish to make.
    I     am copying this letter and all future correspondence to Mrs. Ann Taylor, MP for Dewsbury
and Leader of the House of Commons, who has kindly expressed an interest in my concerns.
    Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH DAMAGES SETTLEMENT

I write with reference to your letter dated 24 March 1998 addressed to the Director of
Finance and Administration of South Yorkshire Police which has been passed for my
attention.

I would advise you that a structured settlement was considered in the case of

who had the task of not only satisfying the Court as to terms of settlement but also the
Court of Protection.

The solicitors who are acting on behalf of the Police Authority in respect of the
Hillsborough claims are Messrs Weightmans of Richmond House, 1 Rumford Place,
Liverpool, L3 9QW. I understand that they use the services of chartered accountants to
advise in connection with the settlement of claims. However, I have passed them a copy
of your letter and no doubt they will contact you should they consider it appropriate.

                                                                                 20 May 1998




Dear Dr Walker

I refer to your letter of 20 April 1998 and to my acknowledgement of 24 April. You ask me
to confirm as accurate your summary of a telephone conversation between us a few weeks
ago. I did not make any record of the conversation so I shall have to rely on memory.

You say the conversation was late in the morning of 2 April; that would be about right. We
discussed the issues to which you refer but my recollection is a little different to yours. It
may help if I set down the chronology which led up to our conversation.

a)    The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster occurred on 15 April 1989. You treated some of
       the victims who were taken to the Northern General Hospital at Sheffield.

b)    The West Midlands Police were appointed to investigate the Disaster. On 20 July
       1989 you hand wrote a seven page statement on West Midlands Police stationery.
      You signed each page.

c)    On 6 December 1996 the drama programme “Hillsborough” was broadcast on
      national television. In early 1997, you said publicly that you had not made a
      statement to the police. Your letter refers to a press conference on 26 February
      1997 and I attach some press cuttings.

d)    In July 1997 you authorised South Yorkshire Police to release your statement to the
       solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG). A few days later you
       telephoned me to enquire when it would be released. While we were talking, I said I
       was puzzled that you had authorised the release of your statement when only a few
       months previously you had been saying publicly that you had never made a
       statement. You replied that you had remembered making a statement.

e)    On 30 June 1997 the Home Secretary announced the establishment of a scrutiny
      under Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to look into reports that relevant new evidence had
      been brought forward. You were interviewed on 22 October 1997 and the report
      was published in February 1998. You agreed with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith that
      your statement contained everything you wished to say.




               Direct Tel: 0114 2523405   Direct Fax: 0114 2523481
f)     In February and March 1998 I published three articles on the Hillsborough Disaster
       in the Police Review. Two paragraphs referred to you (the two paragraphs quoted
       in your letter of 20 April).

g)     It was that passage which prompted you to ring me to ask the origin of a quotation.
        I explained that it is quoted in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny report.

Now I can turn to our telephone conversation of early April. Your account does not refer to
the fact that you rang me (not the other way round) nor does your letter say why you
telephoned me (see g above). You ask when South Yorkshire Police became aware that
we have your statement and you ask why we did not come forward at an earlier stage to
say that we had your statement.

You wrote the statement. You forgot about it. You said publicly that you had not made a
statement. Your press conference comments led some people to believe that important
evidence had not been considered at the 1990-91 inquest (see the press cuttings). You
later remembered making a statement but, to the best of my knowledge, have not come
forward publicly to correct your error.

In March 1997 I became aware that you had made a statement in July 1989 and that it had
been considered by the proper authorities at the appropriate time.

In the early part of 1997, there were many false reports about alleged new evidence. We
did our best to put the record straight and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report is adamant
that there is no new relevant evidence.

In your telephone conversation you said that it was my responsibility to correct your error: I
do not agree.

Yours sincerely

    Dear Mr

    I refer to your letter of 11 May 1998 addressed to Constable Greenway, Discipline &
    Complaints Department. You ask for copies of all statements made by St Johns
    Ambulance staff and also statements by Ambulance men and women. I think you are
    referring to statements made in connection with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15
    April 1989 and your second reference to Ambulance staff pertains to South Yorkshire
    Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

    It is normal police practice to seek the permission of a statement maker before releasing it.
    This would mean that I would have to write to every statement maker and await their reply
    before being able to pass on the information to you. You may find it quicker to write to the
    people named below and ask them for their assistance in contacting their staff, particularly
    as the addresses and even the names of some of the staff may have changed with the
    passage of time.

     Thank you for your letter dated 20thMay (copies of which are attached to the other recipients
of this letter), and for the attached press cuttings although they are, at least as far as I am
concerned, redundant. I am also quite happy to confirm that I telephoned you, and not the other
way around, if this is important.

    You do not of course make any reference at all to the ‘Appleton signature’ question. (For
the record WPS Julie Appleton of West Midlands police (who were charged with gathering
evidence about the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in 1989) ‘witnessed’ a statement made
by myself when in fact I have never met her.) This is perhaps of lesser importance as I am now
pursuing it separately.

    I am glad that you recollect becoming aware in March 1997 that I had made the statement,
as I have a copy of a fax sent to the Home Office on March 3rd 1997, exactly five days after the
press conference where I mistakenly asserted that I had not.

    The tax in question is a typed version of my statement (obviously prepared on a current-day
word processor, with different font sizes, not available in 1989) and bears the fax -header ‘From
SYP’, which I assume means ‘From South Yorkshire Police’, along with the date and the time
of 15:47. The first page of my statement is page nine of the fax. I received this copy on the 21st
July 1997, after having been made aware of the statement’s existence by the secretary to Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith. Our conversation around that time concerned the handwritten, not the
typed, version.
                                                                                               P age 2


    South Yorkshire Police’s professed position at all times has been to be as helpful as possible
to the families. I put it to you that by sending details of my statement to the Home Office (to the
Operational Policing Policy Unit - the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny did not at that time exist) without
informing the families of my error, you were being anything but helpful. I am disappointed that
you do not feel it was your ‘responsibility to correct [my] error’ as you say in the last line of your
letter. I take the exactly opposite view. You were in possession o f knowledge which in your
submission would have helped the families, by not allowing their hopes to be built up in error
(although to suggest that my part in recent events may have unnecessarily upset those involved
betrays a risible underestimation of the amount of anguish they already bear.) And yet you chose
not to share this knowledge with them.

    You also say that you are not aware that I have come forward publicly to correct the error.
On page 179 of the Stuart-Smith report (a public document), I state twice that I had completely
forgotten making the statement.

    Without a doubt my biggest regret is that had more openness and honesty been shown by
some nearer the time, most of the bereaved would be able to put the disaster if not behind them,
then at least to one side. As it is, this matter will continue, and no doubt reach levels of acrimony
not yet seen.

    I       suspect there is little point in continuing this correspondence further. After all I have been
through as a result of my involvement with the Hillsborough disaster (for which I did not, like
some other professionals, seek compensation) I will simply not tolerate any suggestion that I have
ever acted in any other way than in good faith and with the true interests o f the families at heart,
whether made now, or in the future.




    Yours sincerely,

Dear Dr Walker

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

Thank you for your letter of 1 June 1998. On the principal points we are in full agreement.

I agree with you that the bitterness of the disaster of 15 April 1989 has been compounded
by some people’s behaviour in the months and years after that disaster. Lord Justice
Taylor’s interim report (published 1 August 1989) identified some of those failings. Others
became apparent in the months and years that followed. Evasions of personal
responsibility magnified the suffering of the victims of the disaster. On this, we agree.

I agree with you that professionals should not seek compensation for doing their job. Of
the hundreds of police officers who were affected by the disaster, a handful have sought
compensation. The Chief Constable has resisted their claims and is appealing to the
House of Lords. In contrast, the Chief Constable agreed to settle genuine claims by
spectators and their families. Over £12 million has been paid and we continue to settle
cases for as much as £1 million per case.

In one area I am puzzled. You asked me when South Yorkshire Police became aware
that you had made a statement in 1989. I replied that it was in March 1997. You now tell
me that you are “glad” I refer to March 1997 as you have some paperwork which shows
that South Yorkshire Police faxed your statement to the Home Office on 3 March 1997. It
looks as if you asked me a question to which you already knew the answer.

In one area I think we will have to agree to disagree. In February 1997 you gave a press
conference to say that you had not made a statement. By July 1997 you had realised you
were mistaken. On 22 October 1997 you had a private interview with Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith in which, as you quite rightly say, you acknowledged that you had remembered
making a statement. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report was published in February 1998,
the content of the interview is indeed recorded (Appendix 5, pages 177 - 197). You have
told me what you think I should have done to correct your error. However, it appears that
you did not act to correct your error. I fear that we will continue to disagree on whether
your error became my responsibility before you became aware of it or after you became
aware of it or indeed at any time.

You are probably right in saying that we have exhausted any useful purpose in carrying on
this correspondence. Nonetheless, please accept my best wishes for the future.

Dear Ian

D avid D u ck en fle ld - p rep a ra tio n fo r p ossib le p rivate p rosecu tion

I refer to your conversation last week with           I know that she confirmed to you that
nothing substantive has happened in relation to t le progression by the Families of any
prosecution. I believe that they may still be considering the information placed in the House
of Commons Library before deciding whether or not to institute proceedings, whether against
David or any other party.

In spite of the fact that nothing substantive has occurred we have nevertheless met with David
for a second time. We had a long and fruitful discussion and David certainly seems to feel
more confident than he did the first time we met. We discussed, amongst other things, who
should be instructed as Counsel to act on his behalf. He gave me the name of Paul Isaacs,
who had been instructed by Eversheds, and said that he had been very impressed with his
performance at the Inquest hearing and would be happy for him to be instructed in relation
to any prosecution. I therefore travelled to Leeds to meet Mr Isaacs and had a very helpful
(and free) briefing with him culminating in my instructing him to act on David’s behalf in
any proceedings.

Mr Isaacs felt, as I do, that if the Families laid an information now to start any proceedings
it would probably be between 6 and 9 months before any committal proceedings took place.
At that stage counsel confirmed that it is likely that a case to answer would be made out and
the matter would go to trial. He felt that a full trial could last for between 3 and 6 months.

We will continue to prepare, slowly, for the possibility of proceedings being brought, although
without alerting the Families to the fact that we are doing so and also without incurring
unnecessary costs. Eversheds are letting us have all their old files, 12 boxes in total, and we
will also obtain copies of some of the statements placed in the House of Commons library by

   situation and generally keep in touch with him.

   You mentioned to          when you spoke to her that you were aware that our most recent bill
   had not been paid and that you had received a reminder from our Accounts Department. You
   may, by now, have received a further reminder as I believe that the bill still has not been
   paid. Do let me know if there is a problem. In addition I would propose to submit a further
   bill at the end of this month. I think it was at one stage agreed that bills would be rendered
   on a quarterly basis to prevent too much time building up without being billed. This next bill
   will be addressed to David himself, as our client, although we will send it to you for payment
   by the Police Authority as agreed.

   I will be on holiday now for the next two weeks. David will be on holiday for one of those
   weeks as well. Should anything occur during that tim e,        will be on hand to deal with
   it. As we have now instructed Junior Counsel he would also be able to deal with any
   aggressive action instigated by the Families if and when it happens.

   With kind regards

Dear

I refer to your letter of 11 May 1998 addressed to Constable Greenway, Discipline &
Complaints Department. You ask for copies of all statements made by St Johns
Ambulance staff and also statements by Ambulance men and women. I think you are
referring to statements made in connection with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15
April 1989 and your second reference to Ambulance staff pertains to South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

It is normal police practice to seek the permission of a statement maker before releasing it.
This would mean that I would have to write to every statement maker and await their reply
before being able to pass on the information to you. You may find it quicker to write to the
people named below and ask them for their assistance in contacting their staff, particularly
as the addresses and even the names of some of the staff may have changed with the
passage of time

      Dear

      I refer to your letter of 11 May 1998 addressed to Constable Greenway, Discipline &
      Complaints Department. You ask for copies of all statements made by St Johns
      Ambulance staff and also statements by Ambulance men and women. I think you are
      referring to statements made in connection with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15
      April 1989 and your second reference to Ambulance staff pertains to South Yorkshire
      Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

      It is normal police practice to seek the permission of a statement maker before releasing it.
      This would mean that I would have to write to every statement maker and await their reply
      before being able to pass on the information to you. You may find it quicker to write to the
      people named below and ask them for their assistance in contacting their staff, particularly
      as the addresses and even the names of some of the staff may have changed with the
      passage of time.

Dear Bill

Retired Police Superintendent Bernard MURRAY

The South Yorkshire Police Authority recently resolved to provide financial assistance for
legal representation of serving and retired police officers who face private prosecutions
arising out of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989. The members of the
Authority delegated to you the power to deal with specific requests.

Chief Superintendent (retired) David Duckenfield and Sergeant Trevor Bichard applied for
financial assistance for legal representation and it was granted. I attach an application
from Superintendent (retired) Bernard MURRAY. He was second in command to Mr
Duckenfield at Hillsborough Stadium. Mr MURRAY has received summonses to appear
before Bootle Magistrates on 17 July 1998 to answer criminal charges arising out of the
disaster. Mr Murray received the summonses on 27 June 1998.

In 1990 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ruled that there should be no
prosecutions arising from the disaster. In February 1998 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, an
Appeal Court Judge, found no reason to recommend that the DPP reconsider his ruling.

Mr Murray acted in good faith in his policing of the football match that became the
Hillsborough Disaster. Nine years after the tragedy he faces a prosecution for unlawful
killing which can carry a prison sentence. He will contest the charges. It would be
damaging to the morale of the Force if Mr Murray were left to meet his legal costs without
assistance.

I support Mr Murray’s application for financial assistance for legal representation . I would
be obliged if you could write to him as soon as possible at his home address and fax your
letter to his solicitor;

                                              28mJune 1998


Dear Mr Wells,

On 15th April 1989 I was a superintendent of the South Yorkshire Police,
stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station and was on duty in charge o f
the control room at the F.A. cup semi-final at Hillsborough football
stadium, before and during the terrible events that occurred on that day. I
have always maintained that I acted in good faith and to the best of my
ability. I gave evidence at the public enquiry that followed the tragedy,
and gave evidence at the subsequent Inquest, which resulted in a verdict of
accidental death on those who lost their lives. At the Inquest I was legally
represented by Mr Richard Manning o f Walker Morris, solicitors of
Leeds. After representation, the legal costs incurred were met by South
Yorkshire Police Authority.

As a result o f the trauma of the events of 15th April, 1989, and the
subsequent pressures, South Yorkshire Police retired me on ill health
grounds in August 1992,

On 26th June 1998, my wife accepted a summons on my behalf, a copy of
which is attached. I deny all the allegations and it is my intention to
contact Mr. Manning and seek his advice, but in order to seek proper
representation I would request that the Police Authority is approached,
with a view to reimbursing me any legal expenses that I may incur in
defending myself.

Yours sincerely




B.D. Murray.

Acting on behalf of the Authority I wish to inform you that the Authority will meet such

Dear Assistant Chief Constable

Thank you for spending significant time with me on the telephone on 29 June
consequent upon the instructions that I have received to act on behalf of Bernard
Murray in relation to the summons issued against him by the Hillsborough Family
Support Group. I note the action that you have taken in response to the request from
Mr Murray for some assistance for his fees which you anticipate will be approved by
the South Yorkshire Police Authority, who have already approved assistance to Mr
Duckenfield.

I obviously accept that your position must be one of neutrality. Equally within that
stated position I am grateful for such assistance as you are able to provide to my
Client. I was surprised to note that Mr Hicks had told a Reporter from the Sheffield
Star that it was intended to start a Prosecution against your Chief Constable. I can
only ask that you keep me advised in that regard.




                                                                                                                                      (\s           0 1 \& £ S

                    Dear Ian                                                                                               BY FAX 0114 252 3481 and POST

                    Hillsborough Scrutiny - Subsequent Actions

                    Over the weekend I -have given this matter further thought, I have received your fax, and
                    thank you for the kind sentiments you have expressed. What I set out below does have an
                    effect on the contents of your letter. It may be that by the time you receive this letter I will
                    have already spoken to you over the telephone.

                    We have various problems over accepting instructions from David Duckenfield and, as will
                    have been apparent from our meeting on Friday, we have also discerned problems over
                    continuing to act for South Yorkshire Police.

                     In the first place David Duckenfield quite rightly questioned our credentials as lawyers
                     acting for him and for him alone. In other words protecting his interest as a discrete issue
                     compared to protecting the interests of South Yorkshire Police either at the time of the
                     incident or after it.

                     You quite rightly explored the various scenarios which were possible although I think
                     everybody must accept that it is almost impossible to foretell the future or to anticipate the
                     way in which a private prosecution might develop once an information has been made.

                     My concerns really are on the following lines:-

                     (a)             The professional situation that this firm would be in if there was something we
                                     wanted to use in David Duckenfield’s defence which we had only leamt about when
                                     acting for South Yorkshire Police. The professional conduct rules relating to
                                     solicitors provide that any information acquired by a solicitor whilst acting for a
                                     former client is confidential and cannot be disclosed to a new client without the
                                     former client’s consent. However, a solicitor is tinder a duty to the present client to
                                     inform the client of all matters material to the retainer. Consequently, a solicitor in
                                     possession of confidential information (which under this rule amounts to anv
                                     information) concerning a former client which is or might be relevant is put in an
                                     impossible position and cannot act against that client- The rules go on to say that
                                     express consent by a client to disclose of information relating to his or her affairs
                                     overrides any duty of confidentiality.

                              As a result of having acted for South Yorkshire Police we will be in possession of
                              information which we may wish to use in the defence of David Duckenfield and in
                              order to do so we need the consent of South Yorkshire Police. In all the likelihood
                              the giving of this consent will not prejudice the position of South Yorkshire Police
                              as there is very unlikely to be a divergence of interest. If your consent is given,
                              however, and this consent is required to enable us to act for David Duckenfield as
                              referred to above, there might be a situation in which there is a divergence of
                              interest and you $hould be aware that in giving your consent for us to act for David
                              Duckenfield and to use information we have come by as a result of acting for South
                              Yorkshire Police we would also be entitled to use information which might be
                              detrimental to your interests. At the moment it is difficult to think of examples,
                              particularly since you are so keen to make sure that David Duckenfield is well
                              represented in any proceedings which may be brought. However should the situation
                              arise we would need to be free to act wholly in Mr Duckenfield’s best interests and
                              you need to be aware of this possibility and confirm your consent to our using any
                              confidential information as necessary.

                   (b)        Following on from the above, SYP as the funding authority for the reasonable legal
                              costs of David Duckenfield in defending a personal prosecution against him might
                              find themselves acting at odds with their other financial and accountable
                              responsibilities. In other words SYP might get to the point that they should not be
                              funding David Duckenfield.

                              One way of getting round that would be to have a contract of indemnity between the
                              authority and David Duckenfield which would survive any changes in mood or
                              understanding once the proceedings were well advanced- Then the question might
                              arise as to why the police authority had entered into such a contract and bound itself
                              in respect of future conduct in a way which was not in the authority’s interest and
                              which might not be within its power.

                              There is a Home Office Circular on this subject. It takes into account the fact that
                              s. 88(4) of the Police Act 1996 (re-enacting $.48(1) of the 1964 Act) does not apply
                              to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless the Circular goes on to highlight s. 111(1) of
                              the Local Government Act 1972 which does apply to police authorities and gives
                              them a discretion to fund anything ..."which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive
                              or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions". This only underlines the
                              fact that there is a discretionary power to fund the defence of a retired police officer
                              but not if the interests of the defence of that police officer begin to diverge from the
                              current interests of the police force/authority.

                   (c)        The question of potential reimbursement from central funds, in the event of an
                              unsuccessful prosecution also needs to be borne in mind. You will recall the
                              reference to this in our detailed advice forwarded last week. Assuming this firm is
                              instructed by David Duckenfield any entitlement to a defendant’s cost order would
                              be his on the basis that he has "incurred" costs, notwithstanding the fact that they
                              may be paid by the authority. Such entitlement would be jeopardised if there was

                             any agreement, express or implied, binding ourselves not to seek to recover costs
                             from David Duckenfield in any circumstances. It is therefore crucial to this
                             entitlement that no such agreement is entered into, although it is perfectly acceptable
                             for the authority to indemnify David Duckenfield’s costs foT the accounts to be
                             forwarded to you for settlement.


                   I think all these elements need to be thought about carefully and I would like the
                   opportunity of a further discussion with you. Simon has spoken to David Duckenfield who
                   appreciates that there are several formalities arising out of Friday’s meeting and understands
                   they are to be dealt with before entering any formal agreement. I look forward to hearing
                   from you to clarify these points at the earliest opportunity.

              Dear Simon

              Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

              Firstly, please accept my apologies for the late payment of your previously proffered bill for
              services. By now, a cheque is on its way to you under separate cover. Please feel free to
              submit bills at whatever frequency you think fit.

              As you know, the South Yorkshire Police Authority agreed to the principle of meeting any
              reasonable legal expenses incurred by past and present police officers who may face a
              private prosecution in connection with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.                 Chief
              Superintendent (retired) David Duckenfield applied for such assistance and it was granted.
              He has asked you to represent him. Obviously Mr Duckenfield is a private citizen and I
              must not favour his interests. However, I have a duty to ensure that the Force's finances
              are wisely spent and that proper provision is made for foreseeable eventualities. For that
              reason, it will be useful if we continue to share information, without infringing confidentiality

      •       rules.

              I am obliged to you for your efforts to keep to a reasonable sum the costs that Mr
              Duckenfield is obliged to spend. If I become aware of any public developments that may
              affect the situation I will advise you.

              Yours sincerely

                  Dear Nick

                  Hillsborough Scrutiny - Subsequent Actions

                  Thank you for your letter of 17 March 1998. Before responding to your specific points, I will
                  try to provide some background information.

                  The Chief Constable retained your firm to provide him with legal advice in connection with
                  the conduct of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny. As it happened, we needed your help
                  on only a handful of occasions but it was tremendously useful to know that you were
                  familiar with the issues. The advice you gave was timely, succinct and useful. You did
                  receive some information that is not in the public domain but I can think of none that I
                  regard as critically confidential. You have some material of ours and arrangements are in
                  hand for it to be collected shortly.

                  The Chief Constable has released vast amounts of materia! to interested parties and has
                  seldom declined requests for access to Hillsborough Disaster material.

                  The Home Secretary has accepted the recommendations of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
                  Scrutiny. The reaction of a few people has been to talk of commencing a private
                  prosecution against Mr Duckenfield for manslaughter. At my request, the South Yorkshire
                  Police Authority passed a resolution agreeing to fund legal representation for retired and
                  serving officers who may face the threat of a private prosecution arising out of the
                  Hillsborough Disaster. The members of the Authority can only agree to provide funds for
                  individuals who apply. They delegated that approval power to their Clerk in consultation
                  with the Chief Constable and Chairman of the Authority. In other words, the Authority
                  approved the principle, individual cases are left to the Clerk.

                  Mr Duckenfield applied as did Sergeant Trevor Bichard. I supported their applications. I
                  showed that they acted in good faith and that a refusal to fund their legal representation
                  would be damaging to the morale of the Force. "Good faith" and "morale” are two tests that
                  are required by the Home Office Circular The Clerk approved their applications.




             S3    JUN     ’ 98        8:49                                                  0114        £963020    PAGE.004

                I cannot see any situations where the interests of the Chief Constable would come into
                conflict with those of Mr Duckenfield, nor do I think that you have come by information that
                could create a conflict of interests. For those reasons, I am happy to consent to you using
                information acquired from the Chief Constable in your advice to Mr Duckenfield

                In respect of your question about the continuation of funding, I attach a copy of the letter
                from the Clerk of the Authority to Mr Duckenfield, There is no limitation placed upon the
                quantum, the time span or divergence of interests.

                I think I have dealt with the issues you raise but please contact me again if I have missed
                something

                   Dear' lan

                   David Duckenfield - preparation for possible private prosecution

                   I refer to your conversation last week with         , I know that she confirmed to you that
                   nothing substantive has happened in relation to the progression by the Families of any
                   prosecution. I believe that they may still be considering the information placed in the House
                   of Commons Library before deciding whether or not to institute proceedings, whether against
                   David or any other party.

                   In spite of the fact that nothing substantive has occurred we have nevertheless met with David
                   for a second time. We had a long and fruitful discussion and David certainly seems to feel
                   more confident than he did the first time we met. We discussed, amongst other things, who
                   should be instructed as Counsel to act on his behalf He gave me the name of Paul Isaacs,
                   who had been instructed by Eversheds, and said that he had been very impressed with his
                   performance at the Inquest heating and would be happy for him to be instructed in relation
                   to any prosecution. I therefore travelled to Leeds to meet Mr Isaacs and had a very helpful
                   (and free) briefing with him culminating m my instructing him to act on David’s behalf in
                   any proceedings.

                   Mr Isaacs felt, as I do, that if the Families laid an information now to start any proceedings
                   it would probably be between 6 and 9 months before any committal proceedings took place.
                   At that stage counsel confirmed that it is likely that a case to answer would be made out and
                   the matter would go to trial He felt that a full trial could last for between 3 and 6 months.

                   We will continue to prepare, slowly, for the possibility of proceedings being brought, although
                   without alerting the Families to the fact that we are doing so and also without incurring
                   unnecessary costs. Eversheds are letting us have all their old files, 12 boxes in total, and we
                   will also obtain copies of some of the statements placed in the House of Commons library by
                   partner*

           the Home Secretary. We will also have another meeting in July with David to review the
           situation and generally keep in touch with him.

           You mentioned to          when you spoke to her that you were aware that our most recent bill
           had not been paid and that you had received a reminder from our Accounts Department. You
           may, by now, have received a further reminder as I believe that the bill still has not been
           paid. Do let me know if there is a problem. In addition I would propose to submit a further
           bill at the end of this month. I think it was at one stage agreed that bills would be rendered
           on a quarterly basis to prevent too much time building up without being billed. This next bill
           will be addressed to David himself, as our client, although we will send it to you for payment
           by the Police Authority as agreed.

           1 will be on holiday now for the next two weeks. David will be on holiday for one of those
           weeks as well. Should anything occur during that time,          (dll be on hand to deal with
           it. As we have now instructed Junior Counsel he would also be able to deal with any
           aggressive action instigated by the Families if and when it happens.

           With kind regards

Dear Mr Owston

YOUR CLIENT : DAVID DUCKENFIELD
MY CLIENT : BERNARD MURRAY

I was glad to have the opportunity to speak to you on the telephone during 29 June.
I think it will be possible to continue to liaise notwithstanding the fact that our Clients
are not jointly charged because it has almost always been the case that our respective
Clients had no conflict of position.

You will appreciate that it is quite some time ago since I was significantly involved
in this case and I had no part in the judicial review from the Coroner’s hearing let
alone the more recent enquiry by Lord Justice Stewart Smith. I have already got
copies of Hansard to consider the Home Secretary’s statements to the House of
Commons. I have ordered a copy of the report. I hope to be able to set aside the
necessary time to do the required reading. I would then intend to look at the various
options that may be open to our Client including an approach to the Director of Public
Prosecutions. If that were a possible course but the Director would not take the case
over, then there is a very strong argument for abuse of process of the Court. I think
a decision will have to be made fairly quickly about what approach is made to the
Prosecution with regard to the return date. There will obviously have to be an
adjournment for one of a number of reasons and in view of the obvious hostility that
there will be to our respective Clients at Bootle, I would like to try to avoid their
attendance even if I have to go over personally.

Yours sincerely

YOUR CLIENT : DAVID DUCKENFIELD
MY CLIENT : BERNARD MURRAY

I he:ive spent the last couple of days working on the papers in this case. Incidentally I
do have a huge amount of archive material from the inquest itself, in case you feel that
thei e is any particular piece of information that I might have that may be of assistance.

At ibout 1,30am on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, I finished my reading of the
Lord Justice Stewart Smith report. I had previously read the Hansard Statements of the
Home Secretary. I have also considered Section 6 of the Prosecution of Offences Act
198(5.

As you are aware, Section 6(2) of that Act provides that the Director of Public
Pro >ecution may take over the conduct of proceedings instituted by a private Prosecutor
which he may have instituted himself. That is certainly the position here. If the
Director finds that the evidence is insufficient or that the proceedings would be contrary
to oublic interest or for any othei good reason, the Director may discontinue the
proceedings.

The decision of the Director or Public Prosecutions not to prosecute is based upon the
opinion of two imminent Queen’s Counsel. The scrutiny of evidence of Lord Justice
Stewart Smith, found nothing which would have caused the Director of Public
Prosecutions to have reached a different decision. It follows therefore that if the
evidence was considered to be insufficient it must now be insufficient. I also feel that
sue i proceedings are contrary to the public interest in that they are only a means of
trying to circumvent the decisions that there should not be another full public enquiry
esta blished nor should the inquest be reopened or a new inquest held. The Home
Secretary said “I do not believe that any further enquiry could or would uncover new
significant evidence or provide any relief for the distress of those who have been
bereaved”. In talking about a further enquiry the Home Secretary said that this would
“lead simply to further anxiety to a deepening of the wounds of grief, that it would be
no Itindness to the families or their communities on Merseyside and elsewhere”.

I think therefore that these proceedings would be contrary to the public interest.

    I w rnder if you have reached the same conclusion. Have you managed to obtain advices
    from Counsel.

    You suggested a mefeting. I could be in London on 9 July, Would this be soon enough
    and would it be convenient to you?

Dear Madam                                                        BY HAND

D a v id D u c k e n fie ld

We represented South Yorkshire Police in connection with the recent Scrutiny carried out by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. As such we are familiar with the facts and the history of the
Hillsborough disaster although we no longer act for South Yorkshire Police, having accepted
instructions on behalf of the above to represent his interests in the event of any further
proceedings directed at individuals.

Mr Duckenfield was the superintendent of police with operational command of Hillsborough
football ground on the day of the disaster. He retired from the police service in 1991 on
medical grounds.

We are enclosing a copy of a Summons dated 26th June 1998 indicating that informations
have been laid before Bootle Magistrates Court by Ann Adlington on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group. Our client is summoned to appear on Friday 17th July
to answer the informations which amount to two counts of unlawful killing, one count of
wilful neglect to perform a public duty and one count of doing an act which had a tendency
to pervert the course of justice.

We are enclosing a copy of a letter we have today sent by fax to the Clerk to the South
Sefton Magistrates Court questioning the validity of the Summons. We do not have their
response yet. However we think this letter is necessary in any event in view of the steps
which have been taken by the Hillsborough Family Support Group because a private
prosecution of some kind now seems more than likely.

In the light of the history of this case and the previous consideration given to the matter by
the Crown Prosecution Service, the unrelenting media coverage, the Taylor Reports, the civil
litigation and compensation claims which have also been made and ultimately the Stuart-Smith
Scrutiny we think you may find this a proper case to take over the conduct of.

Under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 s.6 you are entitled to take over the conduct of
proceedings instituted by a private prosecutor in circumstances where you could have
instituted those proceedings yourself and you are able to discontinue them under s.23 if the
evidence is insufficient or if the proceedings would be contrary to the public interest or for
any other good reason.

Apart from the actual reports and findings referred to above, many other recommendations
and investigations have taken place in connection with the Hillsborough disaster and, as you
will be aware, extensive changes have been put into practice over the management and
policing of football grounds and matches.

The joint opinion of Counsel dated 6th August 1990, referred to in paragraph 52 of the Stuart-
Smith Scrutiny, led to a decision, taking into account all the other circumstances, on the part
of your office not to prosecute Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield - amongst others. The Stuart-
Smith Scrutiny concludes that there is no material new evidence which has come to light since
the Taylor Reports which would influence the decision not to prosecute. The "accidental
death" verdict of the inquest jury must also be a highly relevant consideration.

We should perhaps point out that we understand that similar proceedings (but not including
the fourth item) have been instituted against Mr Murray who is separately represented.

Although it is legally a separate issue we also need to draw to your attention the intensity of
media coverage and the effect that has had on public opinion. Indeed the television
drama\documentary which appears to have reinvigorated public attention to this disaster was
the principal promoting factor behind the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny and in those circumstances
a fair trial - so long after the event - would be impossible to achieve. The amount of detailed
investigation and scrutiny that the events relating to this disaster have been subjected to are
such that the amount of evidence of the actual things which occurred on the day are recorded
in more detail in the reports and investigations than could ever be recalled by an individual
so long after the event. Detail of the nature which is now recorded in the investigations and
reports far exceeds the ability of the human mind’s recollection over the passage of time
which has occurred. The other very real factor which needs to be taken into account is of
course the emotional stress that these two individuals have been under not only at the time
of the disaster but in all the subsequent investigations including the Inquest.

In all the circumstances we would ask you in the first place to take over the conduct of these
proceedings under s.6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and then to discontinue
these proceedings under s.23(3) of the same Act on the basis that continuation would be
contrary to the public interest and from the point of view of the individuals concerned
(including members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group) the trauma of this dreadful
event is being unnecessarily prolonged.

In our view after the enormous effort which has been expended to establish the causes of this
disaster and to prevent a repetition, insofar as that is possible, the public interest would not
best be served by expending more money on a criminal trial and pouring more effort into
apportioning blame which would be processes which would achieve nothing in addressing the
causes of the disaster itself.

This letter is written to you on the instructions of David Duckenfield and without any

instructions on behalf of Bernard Murray who is separately represented by Richard Manning

We would also request access to the original statements for the purposes of serving the

We are concerned that we do not have a complete set of the statements as a consequence of
the way the various investigations have been conducted up to now.

 We look forward to hearing from you.

For the attention of D Luty



Dear Sirs

D a v id D u ck en fie ld

We are enclosing a copy of a Summons purportedly issued on 26th June 1998 in your Court
bearing the number 2270.

In our submission this Summons was not validly issued. Under the Magistrates Courts Act 1980
s. 1(2) -

         "A Justice of the Peace for an area to which this section applies may issue a
         summons...under this section -

         (a)       If the offence was committed or is suspected to have been committed within the
                   area, or

         (b)       It appears to the Justice necessary or expedient, with a view to the better
                   administration of justice, that the person charged should be tried jointly with, or in
                   the same place as, some other person who is charged with an offence, or who is in
                   custody, or who is being or is to be proceeded against, within the area..."


We act for Mr Duckenfield who we understand has been summoned with Mr Murray in connection
with allegations of offences in Sheffield. Consequently the proviso at s.l(2)(b) does not apply.


The Summons should not have been issued as on its face it is clear that the allegation is that Mr
Duckenfield committed the offence at a place outside the jurisdiction or area of the County of
Merseyside.

We also have regard to s.2(3) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 -
                                               - 2 -


        "A magistrates court for a county...shall have jurisdiction as examining justices over any
        offence committed by a person who appears or is brought before the court, whether or not
        the offence was committed within the county..."

The words "appears...before the court" have been considered in the case of Blandford (1955) All
ER 681 where the same provisions of the 1952 Act were considered.

        "...in our opinion the words "who appears" must mean "appears on a summons lawfully
        issued""

We therefore maintain that the enclosed copy Summons was not validly issued and ask you to
quash it without the need for an attendance.

If you do not agree that the Summons should be withdrawn and nullified without an attendance
then we would ask please that a date be fixed before or after 17th July (in which case the hearing
would have to be adjourned) so that our submissions on the invalidity of the Summons may be
heard.

In the event that you are not prepared forthwith to quash the Summons and you require us to
submit arguments on the validity of the Summons then we would ask that Mr Duckenfield will
not be required to attend. It would seem quite improper that he should have to attend court to
answer a summons which he contends and is advised was not validly issued.

May we ask you please to let us have your response without delay because we will have no
alternative but to apply to the Divisional Court if you do not confirm that the Summons is invalid
and may be regarded as a nullity or you require submissions on the validity of the Summons to
be made in court. Pending consideration of such an application to the Divisional Court, in the
unlikely event that this course of action is necessary, would also result in an application to your
Court for the first hearing to be adjourned.

Dear Mr Daines

David Duckenfield

Thank you for your letter of 30th June. I am enclosing a copy of a letter of 1st July written to
the Magistrates Court in question which I hope means that the Summons may be annulled or
failing that the date will be postponed and failing both those things neither David Duckenfield nor
Bernard Murray will have to attend.

Anyhow your concern is greatly appreciated.

I also wish to confirm a conversation I had with the Clerk to SYP, Mr Wilkinson this morning
when he agreed that the purchase of a fax machine by David Duckenfield for the purposes of
speedy and detailed liaison with us would be a proper expense. He will not be obtaining an
elaborate one - just the basic necessities of keeping the lines of communication open.

Yours sincerely

                1 act on behalf of Bernard Murray, who together with David Duckenfield has been
                summonsed to appeared before the South Sefton Magistrates1 Court on 17 July 1998
                at 10.00am in relation to charges arising from the Hillsborough Disaster. I am aware
                that Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines of the South Yorkshire Police has been in
                touch with you about the possible logistical consequences of any appearance at that
                Court. There is of course likely to be strong media presence as well as members of
                the public.

                Certain submissions have been made to the Court and at the moment it is not possible
                to know whether Bernard Murray and David Duckenfield will personally have to
                attend on 17 July. When 1 know definitely whether they will have to attend, I will
                contact you again. I will seek to persuade my Client that he should travel with me
                in the event that our attendance is required because I apprehend that that may be a
                simpler course for' you as to any necessary Police deployment.

                Yours sincerely

                 Dear Sirs

®                OUR CLIENT : BERNARD MURRAY

                 We write to advise you that we have been instructed to act on behalf of Mr Bernard
                 Murray in relation to a summons purportedly issued on 26 June 1998 in your Court.

                 We have been made aware of a letter written to you by W inkworth and Pemberton
                 who act on behalf of Mr David Duckenfield. The three summons'’ against our Client
                 are identical to three of the four summons’ against Mr Duckenfield. Although we
                 have only been instructed very recently, we wish to say immediately that we associate
                 ourselves with the views that have been put forward by W inkwo^th and Pemberton.
                 We shall be considering the matter urgently over the course of the next few days and
                 it is likely that we shall then write to you again, although the ne«d for such further
                 submission would obviated if you promptly agree that you must cpyash this summons.

                 Yours faithfully

    Dear Mr Owston

    PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS RE: HILLSBOROUGH

    Thank you very much for your letter of 1 July together with the two copy letters
    therewith. What I have done at this stage is to indicate to both the Clerk to the
    Justices at South Sefton and to the Director of Public Prosecutions that I have recently
    been instructed in this case. In attaching copies of the two letters sent, you will see
    that I have expressed support for the petition that you have adopted. I expect to see
    Bernard Murray very shortly and I would also expect to have completed the necessary
    research on both of these points. In anticipation that my Client will want me to
    continue to liaise with you as hitherto, I will let you have copies of the further
    submissions that I make.

    I confirm that I will call on you at your office at 3.00pm on Thursday 9 July.

    Yours sincerely

     Thank you for your letter of 30 June. As you point out, the private prosecutions were
     commenced in Bootle which is in CPS Mersey, under the Chief Crown Prosecutor Graham
     Brown. I have spoken to him and he tells me that he will have no part in dealing with the
     matter which, as you also know, is in fact being handled by George Croston in Special
     Casework at York. No doubt Croston will be advising the Director in due course and she
     will take the final decision as to what action is appropriate. I do not anticipate that I shall
     be involved in any way.

     Of course I understand your desire to be given an early intimation of the Director’s decision
     and I have, therefore, copied your letter and my reply to Croston so that he can let you know
     as soon as a decision is made. I am sure that he will need to look at the evidence available
     to the private prosecutors, and in particular that whether or not there is anything that amounts
     to substantial new evidence additional to that already considered by the Crown Prosecution
     Service. I imagine that process will take some considerable time.

     If you think I can help in any other way please let me know.

Dear Madam

OUR CLIENT : BERNARD MURRAY

We act on behalf of Mr Bernard Murray. Hje has received a summons dated 26 June
1998 which required him to appear in Bootle Magistrates’ Court on 17 July 1998.
There are three matters alleged against him. They are the same three matters numbers
one to three on the summons against David Duckenfield which we know has been
provided to you by a letter from Winkworth and Pemberton of 1 July 1998.

This firm acted on behalf of Mr Bernard Murray at the Coroner’s Inquest. However,
we were not instructed in relation to the scrutiny carried out by Lord Justice Stuart
Smith. As such we ■came into this case literally within the last few days.

We have been provided with a copy of the letter of 1 July 1998 from Winkworth and
Pemberton to you and we would say at this stage that we fully associate ourselves
with the matters set'out therein. We would anticipate that we will very quickly be
setting out our own representations at length.

Yours faithfully

Many thanks for your letter of 2nd July. I think that you may have intended to enclose copies
of the letters that you have written. If that is the case it would be useful if you faxed them

I have a meeting with David Duckenfield on Tuesday 7th July and I would have hoped, by
that time, we would have received a reaction from the Magistrates Court and quite possibly
some kind of indication from the DPP’s office.

Dear Mr Metclaf

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 15 April 1989

I attach a letter from Watts Leather on the above subject. I also attach my fax reply to
them. I would be obliged if you could advise me on this subject.

Can I, should I, must I release this letter to the solicitors acting for Mr Duckenfield and Mr
Murray? I ask this because it seems strange to me that prosecutions have been started
and now the prosecutor wishes to gather evidence.

Can I, should I, must I reveal this letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)? Mr
Croston, CPS special casework, is looking at this case in view of the DPP’s 1990 decision
that no prosecutions should be undertaken. I would be obliged to receive an urgent
telephone reply to this question.

On a logistical note, over 3,700 statements were taken. Many have no relevance to the
charges against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray. For example, statements identifying the
bodies of other victims have no obvious relevance. Over the years, we have supplied to
the Hillsborough Family Support Group and to people connected to that group, a large
number of statements. To avoid duplications, should we ask them to tell us which
statements they already have?

Yours sincerely

earlier letter of 2 July and ask you to make reference to that letter.

In our submission this summons has not been validly issued and should be quashed.

We respectfully refer you to Section 1 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. That
provides inter alia that “a Justice of the peace for an area to which this Section applies
may issue a summons... under this Section:

a. “if the offence was committed or is suspected to have been committed within the
area”.

The alleged offences relate to events in Sheffield.

b. “if it appears to the Justice, necessary or expedient with a view to the better
administration of Justice, that the person charged should be tried jointly with or at the
same place as some other person who is charged with an offence and who is in
custody, or is being, or is to be proceeded against within the area”.

Sofar as we are aware, the only other person against whom a summons has been
issued is David Duckenfield. Three of the four allegations against him are identical
to the allegations against our Client and the fourth matter also relates to Sheffield.
That has been confirmed by his Solicitors, Winckworth and Pemberton. Mr
Duckenfield is not in custody.

c. “if the person charged resides or is believed to reside or be within the area”

Our Client does not reside in the petty sessional division of South Sefton.
                                                                           FAO D Luty
                                                                            3 July 1998
                                                                                 Page 2



d. “if under any enactment a Magistrates’ Court for the area has jurisdiction to try the
offence”.

The allegations are all contrary to common law and therefore there is no such
enactment providing the Magistrates’ Court for the area with jurisdiction.

e. “the offence was committed outside England and Wales and where it is an offence
exclusively punishable on summary conviction...”

The allegations relate to England and Wales and are not exclusively summary offences

In our submission therefore the matter is quite clear. This summons should not have
been issued and in our submission, should be quashed.

It may be thought that the Prosecution could be carried on the basis of Section 2 (3)
of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. That provides inter alia “ a Magistrates’ Court
for a County... shall have jurisdiction as examining Justices over any offence
committed by a person who appears or is brought before the Court whether or not the
offence was committed within the County...”

We would respectively draw your attention to the words of Lord Chief Justice
Goddard in the case of R v Blandford 1955 All England Reports Page 681 at Page
683. “In our opinion the words “who appears” refer to a person appearing on a
summons and the words “is brought before the Court” refer to a person brought before
the Court in custody as the result of an arrest with or without a warrant. Sofar as this
case is concerned we are dealing with a summons and in our opinion the words “who
appears” must mean “appears on a summons lawfully issued”.

The authority for the proposition that the responsibility for determining jurisdiction
lay on the Single Justice (as seems to be the case in this instance) or Clerk, is the case
of Turf Publishers Limited v Davis, The Weekly Notes June 18th 1927 Page 190.
That case was considered in R v Abergevenny Justices ex parte Stuart Barratt and
Graham Barratt, the reference to which is the Criminal Law Review October 1993 at
Page 785. Even if the Single Justice had wrongly been advised of the place of
commission, the summons itself has the words “ at Hillsborough Football Stadium
Sheffield on the face of it”.

We would ask that our submission (and those of Winckworth and Pemberton on
behalf of Mr Duckenfield) be considered with all urgency and that the decision be
reached that the summons has not been validly issued and it therefore should be
quashed.

We see no reason why such action should not be able to be taken in the absence of
both the Defendant and ourselves and this is in the interest of saving public expense.
If notwithstanding these submissions before you, you do not agree to these
submissions then there seems to us to be one of two courses available.

1.       That you wish verbal submissions to be made.

2.       That your decision against us is a final one.

In the event of the first view being taken, we would ask for a date to be fixed for
attendance and for that date to be one upon which our Client would not be required
to attend. If the date fixed is after 17 July, then we would ask for the adjournment
of the hearing fixed on 17 July and in the absence of our Client.

If you are not persuaded by the arguments set out and do not invite verbal
submissions then again we would ask for the adjournment of the proceedings on 17
July in the absence of our Client and ourselves. These proceedings either should be
adjourned sine die or to a date sufficiently far in advance to allow the determination
of an application to the Divisional Court against the refusal to quash the summons.

Dear Madam

O U R C L IE N T : M R B E R N A R D M U R R A Y

We refer to our letter of 2 July 1998, which for ease is copied herewith.

We attach to this letter a copy of the summons dated 26 June 1998, issued against our
Client Bernard Dean Murray. It alleges three offences all of which are said to arise
from events at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield on 15 April 1989.

We are aware of a letter of 1 July 1998 delivered by hand to you by Winckworth and
Pemberton Solicitors acting on behalf of David Duckenfield. As indicated in our
letter of 2 July, Mr Owston of Winckworth and Pemberton has been good enough to
provide us with a copy of his letter to you. We too have sent by fax, a letter to the
Clerk of the South Sefton Magistrates’ Court. We attach a copy of that letter.

In our submission, the matters that we have set out in our letter to the Clerk to the
Justices at South Sefton provide a clear statement of law and we believe that the
summonses should be quashed.

We also believe that even if the present summonses are quashed, the Solicitor acting
on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group will simply seek to issue
proceedings in the appropriate petty sessional division in Sheffield. The purpose of
this letter is therefore to ask you to invoke the provisions of Section 6 of the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. You will be fully familiar with your ability under
Section 6 (2) of that Act to take over conduct of proceedings instituted by a private
prosecutor which you may have instituted yourself. Our request to you is then to
consider the issues in this case so that you can properly arrive at a decision under
Section 23 (3) of the same Act that the proceedings should be discontinued. The
discontinuation under Section 23 may be because the evidence is insufficient or if the
proceedings would be contrary to the public interest. As you will undoubtedly be
aware, the report or the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure (1981) (Command
8092) Page 161 Para 7.50 says “it provides a useful and effective safeguard against
“improper action” by the prosecuting authority.
                                                             Dame Barbara Mills QC
                                                                       3 July 1998
                                                                            Page 2



May we respectfully draw your attention to the following facts:

1.      Following the tragedy on 17 April 1989 by 15 May 1989 Lord Taylor had
        begun his public enquiry. 174 witnesses gave evidence. There were 72
        hours of video film and much other material in written form. The interim
        report of Lord Taylor was published on 4 August 1989.

2.      West Midlands Police investigated as an independent investigating force.
        They took 3,776 statements from witnesses.

3.      The Director of Public Prosecutions considered all of the evidence that had
        then been gathered. Advice was taken from two very experienced Queen’s
         Counsel who advised that there was not sufficient evidence to justify criminal
        proceedings against any person.

4.      On 19 November 1990 the adjourned Coroner’s Inquest resumed and at the
        Inquest some 200 witnesses gave evidence and the Inquest also received
        documents, the Jury saw videos and inspected the ground including the
        control room.

5.      In 1992 the Attorney General was invited to order new Inquests on the basis
         of new evidence. The Attorney General refused.

6.      In April 1993 application was made by families for Judicial Review to quash
         the Inquest verdict and seek a fresh Inquest which application the Divisional
         Court dismissed.

7.      Civil claims were made and the litigation concluded. These included claims
        by Police Officers as well as by families.

8.      Lord Justice Stuart Smith was appointed to scrutinise the evidence including
        to consider “new evidence”.

We invite attention to the summary to the scrutiny of evidence by Lord Justice Stuart
Smith and in particular the following paragraphs.

Paragraph 4.     Cannot allow compassion to cloud judgement.

Paragraph 5.     I do not consider that there is any material which should be put
                 before the Director of Public Prosecutions which may cause her to
                 reconsider the decision already taken.

Paragraph 6.     None of the evidence that I was asked to consider added anything
                 significant to the evidence before Taylor or the Inquest.
                                                             Dame Barbara Mills QC
                                                                       3 July 1998
                                                                            Page 3


Paragraph 7.     There is no new video evidence.

Paragraph 8.     The suggestion that the Police failed to spot overcrowding was due
                 to faulty CCTV is wrong.

Paragraph 9.     The Police did not give false evidence about CCTV. The evidence
                 of Holdsworth is not accepted.

Paragraph 11.    Not considered that the inquest was flawed.

Paragraph 12.    No improper attempt to interfere with witnesses.

Paragraph 16.    Miss Martin “vague and confused”.

Paragraph 18.     Paul Taylor changed versions in various ways over the years.

Paragraph 22.    No South Yorkshire Police statement rendered misleading. Taylor
                 not inhibited or impeded.

Paragraph 24.     Exclusion of comments in witness statements, did not affect the
                  outcome of the inquest or the decision of the DPP.

Paragraph 25.    No further enquiry involving the examination of witnesses could
                 help after this lapse of time.

Paragraph 32.    Neither of the new points about the height of the crush barriers and
                 capacity of Leppings Lane Terrace would give grounds for re­
                 opening of Judicial Enquiry or any other proceedings.

At Page 9 Paragraph 52 of the scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart Smith, he confirmed
that he had read the joint opinion of Leading Counsel dated 6 August 1990 which
gave the advice to the Director of Public Prosecution on possible criminal proceedings
against Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield. At Paragraph 53 Lord Justice Stuart Smith
said that he had not found any error or omission in the resume set out by Counsel nor
in his view was any particular aspect understated or exaggerated. The Lord Justice
also considered the statement of law as contained in the opinions of Queen’s Counsel
and said they were plainly correct.

In our respectful submission having regard to all of these actions and particularly the
scrutiny of evidence by Lord Justice Stuart Smith and his conclusion that “I do not
consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public
Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider
the decisions that they have already taken”, we would submit that under Section 23
o f the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 you must conclude that the evidence is
insufficient.
                                                             Dame Barbara Mills QC
0                                                                      3 July 1998
                                                                            Page 4


As to the limb which allows you to discontinue if the proceedings would be contrary
to public interest or for any other good reason, may we refer you to the possible
single most important cause for Lord Justice Stuart Smith to be asked to scrutinise the
evidence. This relates to the program on Granada Television “Hillsborough”,
broadcast on 5 December 1996, which incidentally was repeated without any
amendment. It was described as “highly emotive”. Lord Justice Stuart Smith said
that it was “not accurate as to the suppression of Police video tapes”. “It was not
always easy for the viewer to tell what is reconstruction and what is original” and
finally that the program “also relies on Mr Holdsworth’s assertions.... I do not accept
this evidence”. This was only one of a number of television programs. There has
been a huge amount of other media interest.

In addition to the finding by Lord Justice Stuart Smith at Page 37 Paragraph 99 that
he was “unable to accept Mr Holdsworth’s recollection of events as now being
accurate”, Lord Justice Stuart Smith also comments on two witnesses who he saw,
namely Miss Martin who he described as “vague and confused” and Paul Taylor
whose “ version changed in various ways over the years”. It is inconceivable that
witnesses nine years after the unhappy event could now be relied upon as to their
memory. This has been made particularly difficult having regard to the highly
charged and emotional state of so many people and the media involvement with the
points above being some of the worrying factors.

The Taylor report made a large number of recommendations, the vast majority of
which have been implemented so as to both address the causes of the disaster itself
and prevent repetition and for the safety of the public at large in attending sporting
occasions.




In assessing whether the continuation of these proceedings would be contrary to the
public interest we would also respectfully refer to two final points.

a.       Paragraph 5 Chapter 7 of the Lord Justice Stuart Smith scrutiny at page 103.
         Here he says that he has come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis
         upon which there should be:

         1.       A further Judicial Enquiry;

         2.       A reopening of Lord Taylor’s enquiry;
                                                  Dame Barbara Mills QC
                                                            3 July 1998
                                                                 Page 5


3.     A renewed application to the Divisional Court;

4. -   The exercise by the Attorney General of his powers under the
       Coroner’s Act;

5.     Any material to put before the Director of Public Prosecutions which
       might cause her to reconsider the decisions she has already taken;

6.     Any material that should be put before the Police Complaints
       Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decision that
       they have already taken.

When the Home Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, addressed the House of Commons
on 18 February 1998 he made the following comments.

        1.      I, the Attorney General and the Director of Public
                Prosecutions have considered Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s
                report very carefully. We have no reason to doubt his
                conclusions.

        2.      The entire country is united in sympathy with those who
                lost loved ones at Hillsborough. We cannot take the pain
                from them but I hope that the families will recognise that
                the report represents, as I promised, an independent
                thorough and detailed scrutiny of all the evidence that was
                given to the committee.

In his statement to the House of Commons on 8 May 1998, the Home
Secretary made the following remarks.

        1.     Lord Taylor’s enquiry and report were as thorough and
               impartial as one would expect of the work of such a great
               judicial figure.

        2.     The Granada documentary “Hillsborough” presented a
               powerful picture of the tragedy. It suggested that fresh
               evidence that had not previously been considered called
               into question the verdict so the inquest and other decisions.

        3.     Lord Justice Stuart Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the
               Court of Appeal was eminently qualified to conduct and
               independent and thorough scrutiny of the evidence. I gave
               him very wide terms of reference that enabled his to
               establish conclusively whether any material evidence had
               been overlooked and to recommend appropriate action.
                                                              Dame Barbara Mills QC
                                                                        3 July 1998
                                                                             Page 6


                   4.    Anyone who has read the report thoroughly will, I believe,
                         be bound to reach the same conclusion as he did that
                         reopening the enquiries would serve no useful purpose
                         whatsoever.

                   5.    The causes of the disaster were clearly identified by Lord
                         Taylor in his 1989 report. It was right to consider as I
                         have done whether there was any subsequent information
                         that cast doubt on earlier decisions. It was for that reason
                         that I established Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s thorough
                         scrutiny and I am satisfied that he has, after that rigorous
                         examination reached the correct conclusions.

                   6.    I do not believe that a further enquiry could or would
                          uncover significant new evidence or provide any relief for
                          the distress of those who have been bereaved. Although I
                          know that it is difficult for the families to accept that, such
                          a conclusion must be in their best interests. To hold out
                          the possibility of a further enquiry, only and inevitably to
                          have that hope dashed when the enquiry reported would
                          lead simply to further anxiety and a deepening of the
                          wounds of grief. That would be no kindness to the families
                          or to their communities of Merseyside and elsewhere.

We would ask you to agree to take over the conduct of these proceedings under
Section6 (2) of the Prosecution of Offenders Act 1985 and then to discontinue these
proceedings under Section 23 (3) of that same act.

Yours faithfully

    Dear Sirs

    Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

    1.      We act for the prosecutor in this case who has laid the informations with the support
            of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“HFSG”). The Clerk to the South Sefton
            justices has sent us a copy of your letter of 1st July 1998. The point you make is not
            that the court has no jurisdiction to hear the case if either defendant were to appear
            before it; it is rather the technical jurisdictional argument, which has nothing to do with
            the substance of the allegations, that the court has no means of compelling Mr
            Duckenfield and Mr Murray to appear before it. We do not agree with your
            construction of the sections or your interpretation of R v Blandford. The evident
            purpose of section 1(2) and 2(3) of the 1980 Act is to deal with practicalities and there
            is clear acknowledgment of this in Blandford. We have instructed counsel to advise
            further on the point. However, we regard it as essential to set out the practical reasons
            that led us to commence these proceedings in Liverpool and we invite Mr Duckenfield,
            through you, to appear at the court so that, on either view of the law, the court has
            power to hear the matter.

    The reason for commencing proceedings in Liverpool

   2.       In the last nineteen months, we have been in regular contact with the Home Office on
            matters relating to the disaster which formed the subject matter of the “Scrutiny”
            conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, of which you are no doubt aware. In this
            period the Group have been supplied with a large number of witness and other
            statements about the events of 15th April 1989, which its members had never seen
            before. The witnesses who made these statements will form a very substantial part of
            the evidence which we intend to present against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.

3^^    A large proportion of these witnesses come from Liverpool. We intend to call them to
       prove that the decision to open Gate C at the ground was the responsibility of both
       defendants; was causative of the deaths of 96 people; and was grossly negligent. The
       two named victims are representative of all. The prosecution case will be simple, but
       many witnesses will be tendered. The allegation of misfeasance is based on the same
       facts. The allegation of attempting to pervert the course of justice refers to Mr
       Duckenfield’s allegation that the Liverpool supporters forced the gate.

4.     The committal proceedings will of course be held at the court at which the proceedings
       are instituted. It is strongly arguable that those proceedings fall within the old
       committal scheme. The amendments in Schedule 1 to the Criminal Procedure and
       Investigations Act 1996 were brought into effect on 1st April (“the appointed day”) by
       virtue of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (Commencement)
       (Section 65 and Schedules 1 and 2) Order 1997, and apply to any alleged offence in
       relation to which Part 1 of that Act applies. Section 1(3) of that Act makes provision
       in respect of “alleged offences into which no criminal investigation has begun before
       the appointed day”.

5.     It seems to us the better view is that the present proceedings fall within the exception.
        Although no police investigation was in progress in April 1997, a police investigation
        “began” in 1989, and it would therefore appear that either of the defendants, or indeed
        the prosecution, would be entitled to call live evidence at committal. If either
        defendant required us to prove a prima facie case, we should have the task of calling a
        large number of eye witnesses whose statements will form part of the substantial
        bundle of evidence that we shall serve on you in due course in order to justify
        committal for trial.

6.     It will therefore be apparent to you that the factor of convenience tells overwhelmingly
        in favour of committal proceedings in Liverpool. Among our witnesses, some are in
        dubious health. Not all are young. Many have little money, and would need the
        reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses if the proceedings are held
        outside Liverpool. We doubt that we would be required to call evidence of forensic
        pathologists, or the witnesses who produce the transcripts of the evidence that the two
        defendants gave to the inquest or the Taylor Inquiry.

Submission to the jurisdiction

7.     Whatever the court chosen, there will be inconvenience to some. We accept of course,
       that attendance at committal proceedings will be inconvenient for Mr Duckenfield if
       held anywhere other than near his home. Your client may decide to submit to the
       South Sefton jurisdiction in the interests of saving time and money. It is undoubtedly
       open to him, or Mr Murray to do so. If either “appears” or is “brought before” the
       court by virtue of section 2(3), and seeks to join issue with the other party on the
       merits, as opposed to some arid technicality as to the efficacy of the summons, the
       court has jurisdiction on any basis; and by virtue of section 1(2)(b) the court would
       have jurisdiction over the other defendant, however widely or narrowly the two
       subsections fall to be construed.

8.      In a matter of such importance as the Hillsborough disaster, surely it is essential that
       prosecution and defence concentrate on the substance of the case rather than captious
       technicalities. Do you suggest that South Sefton is an inappropriate court?

Alternatives to Liverpool

9.     If, contrary to our view, section 1 of the Magistrates Court Act 1980 is to be
       construed as you contend, it would be open to the informant to commence
       proceedings in the County of South Yorkshire, where the alleged offences were
       committed (section l(2)(a); or where either defendant resides, that is, West Yorkshire
       in the case of Mr Murray, a n d i n the case of Mr Duckenfield (section l(2)(c).
       We are inclined not to lay the informations in Sheffield, because, among other reasons;
       (a) proceedings in that city would revive painful memories for relatives of the victims,
       (b) it is unlikely that many witnesses from Sheffield would be called at the committal,
       and (c) neither defendant lives there.

10.    The options would appear to be, therefore, Sheffield or some other part of South
       Yorkshire, even though neither defendant resides in that area, and few witnesses do;
       Pontefract or some other part of West Yorkshire; or            t is hard to imagine
       another location in        if         vere chosen, more suitable than
       An important factor would be cost. We should wish the proceedings to be held in a
       place where hotel accommodation would be cheap and plentiful. For this reason,
                      out of season, seems an obvious possibility, and there may be other
       locals in Yorkshire which may be suitable on the same grounds.

11.   There would be the further advantage that a court at                   would commit for
      trial to a sitting of the Crown Court on the Western Circuit; and no doubt both
      prosecution and defence would argue that it would be fairer to all parties if the trial
      were held at some venue outside Yorkshire, Merseyside and Lancashire. We should
      tell you that we would not resist an argument by the defence in due course that, in the
      interests of fairness, wherever the committal were held, the trial itself should not take
      place in Merseyside.

12.   These ideas are no more than suggestions. We have not yet weighed the pros and cons
       finely. We will consider constructively any suggestions you or Mr Murray might wish
       to make as to venues for committal proceedings away from Sheffield, where
       informations might sensibly be laid.

13.   We invite you to keep us informed of your intentions. If you decide to apply for
      judicial review of the South Sefton summonses, we shall have to consider whether it is
      right to allow the matter to be delayed for several months, so that a technicality can be
      determined at great expense, when we could be proceeding expeditiously at another
      venue to which your argument cannot apply.

14.   We are sending a copy of this letter, with uncontroversial covering letters, to the

                                              -3-
solicitors for Mr Murray, who support your position, to the Clerk to the South Sefton
Justices and to the Director of Public Prosecutions, whom we have already notified of
the existence of the summonses. The return date at the South Sefton court is 17th July.
We invite you to reply to this letter by 10th July, so that we can make our decisions
before 17th.


Yours faithfully

      Deaar Mr. Daines,
                                                                             Hillsborough

      Thank you for your fax of 3 July. Here are some preliminary thoughts.

      I believe that the letter should be formally referred to the DPP for guidance. Under S.3(2)(e)
      Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 it is one of the functions of the DPP to “give, to such extent as
      he considers appropriate, advice to police forces on all matters relating to criminal offences”.

      Although the wording gives a discretion to the DPP as to whether to offer guidance the subsection is
      otherwise unqualified and there is no reason for the present circumstances to be excluded.

      I believe that the foregoing provides the answer to your first question. I do not think that the letter
      should be immediately copied to the solicitors acting for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray. We could
      be accused of partiality. I think that in writing to the DPP you should ask for guidance on this point
      also, make the point made in your letter to me and suggest that fairness requires a disclosure of the
      letter to those solicitors.

      If the DPP advise that access should be given then I think it would be fair to take account of
      logistics. If there is a comprehensive statement index there is no harm in providing a copy but I do
      not think it would be right to copy the statements wholesale. I would be inclined to offer the
      solicitors the opportunity to read the statements and to mark for copying those which they consider
      relevant. If there is a large volume I see no reason why the question of charging for copying should
      not be raised although there may be a PR issue about this.

      I can draft appropriate letters to the DPP/solicitors if you wish. As I mentioned to your secretary, I
      have a meeting in Manchester this afternoon but I can be reached on my mobile number
               which will accept messages if unavailable. If I have not heard from you before I will try and
      call you after my meeting and if we fail to speak today I am quite happy to be called at home over
      the weekend on                       I should also mention that I will be in Sheffield on Monday
      afternoon for a meeting at 3.00pm. I could meet you either before or after that meeting which will
      probably take an hour or so.

                                                Yours sincerely,

SHEFFIELD S3 8LY

Dear Ian

David Duckenfield

I refer to your fax which was waiting for me when I came into the office!

I am enclosing a copy of my letter to the DPP of 1st July, Richard Manning’s letter to me of 30th
June and his faxed letter of 1st July, my letter of 1st July to Mr Croston, Richard Manning’s letter
of 2nd July and my letter to him of 3rd July. Also enclosed is a copy of Richard Manning’s letter
to the DPP and his letter to the South Sefton Magistrates Court Clerk. Finally a copy of the letter
of Watts Leather of 3rd July, the response from South Sefton of 3rd July and an important letter
from Richard Manning together with his letters to the Magistrates Court and the DPP of 3rd July
are enclosed.

As I mentioned on the telephone, the DPP’s office in York have indicated that they look upon our
letters with some sympathy but we should not expect any early decision.

Whilst I regard that as being encouraging it does not really help over the way we handle the
situation at South Sefton.

In that regard we are considering closely the whole question of challenging the decision of the
Court to issue the Summons, continuing to question the Court’s ability to issue the Summons and
the arguments which Watts Leather have put up. If you think about the issues which need to be
put before the Court and proved in evidence in order to establish the prosecution case, the
Liverpool witnesses may be witnesses of fact over what everybody knows happened but it is
difficult to see how they add to an understanding of police operational duties and the chain of
causation.

Our policy will be to keep you informed as long as no conflict of interest is discerned and as long
as David Duckenfield is happy that we should do that. There is also of course the ever possible
discovery of a conflict between Duckenfield and Murray.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH PROSECUTIONS

We are instructed in this matter on behalf of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire.

We attach a copy of a letter received by the Chief Constable from solicitors acting for the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

You will see that they request access to statements relating to the Hillsborough Disaster which are
currently held by the South Yorkshire Police.

This is a matter upon which the Chief Constable would appreciate guidance from the Director under
the terms of Section 3 (2)(e) Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.

By way of background there are something over 3,700 statements many running to several pages,
and it is likely that a large number of the statements have nothing to do with charges which have
been laid against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray. We would appreciate guidance on the following
points:-

1.          Is it appropriate to provide the solicitors with access to the documentation?

2.          If documentation is to be copied is it appropriate to raise a charge for this service?

3.          Should original statements be allowed out of Police possession as appears to be requested by
             the third paragraph of the solicitors’ letter?

4.     Should any form of undertaking be requested as to the return of original or copy material
       when its purpose has been served?

There is another matter which is concerning the Chief Constable. This is the question of whether it is
appropriate for correspondence with the prosecuting solicitors to be disclosed to the solicitors acting
for Mr Duckenfield and for Mr Murray and if so whether they should be entitled also to access to
the statements or at least such of them as are requested by and copied to the prosecuting solicitors.

Obviously the Chief Constable wishes to act fairly, but equally he would not wish this matter to be
dealt with on a different basis to that which might apply to a “normal” private prosection.

We look forward to hearing from you.


Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

The Hillsborough Disaster 1989
Adlington v Duckenfield & Murray

We write to inform you that we are instructed by The Hillsborough Family Support Group
who have taken out summonses against the above named who, as you will be aware, are
former South Yorkshire Police officers. We enclose copies of the summonses for your
information.

You-will appreciate that in a prosecution of this nature, we have an obligation to the Court
and to the defendants to conduct the case fairly and efficiently. Of course we also wish to
have full information for the benefit of the prosecution. We should be grateful, therefore, if
you would provide us with copies of all witness statements in your possession. We realise that
it may take some time for you to comply with this request but at the very least we would ask
you to supply us, as a matter of urgency, with a comprehensive index showing the names and
addresses of statement makers and the dates of statements.

We would also request access to the original statements for the purposes of serving the
relevant originals.

We are concerned that we do not have a complete set of the statements as a consequence of
the way the various investigations have been conducted up to now.

We look forward to hearing from you.



Yours faithfully

                                 Dear Sir




                                W e have been approached by Mr Roger Greenwood of
                                             Yorkshire, who is a retired Chief Superintendent with South Yorkshire
                                koi ice wno was on duty at Hillsborough on the date of the disaster.


                                In view of recent developments our client feels that he is in need of legal representation.
                                I understand from him that the Police Authority have agreed to indemnify him in
                                connection with his reasonable legal costs.

                                Please confirm that the Authority will be responsible for such reasonable costs.

                                 I await to hear from you.

                                Yours sincerely

      Dear Sir

      OUR CLIENT : BERNARD MURRAY

      We understand from Winckworth and Pemberton that their retainer was on a charging
      basis of £125.00 per hour plus VAT and expenses. Whilst that is less than the
      writer’s personal rate of charges, we will adopt that composite rate for all work that
      is carried out by this firm under these instructions.

      Yaurs faithfully

Dear Assistant Chief Constable Daines

BERNARD M URRAY

The Prosecution have applied to withdraw the Summonses issued in the South Sefton
Magistrates Court. In simple terms they have recognised that the argument advanced
by us is not capable of being overcome.

We have asked the Court to make a Defence Costs Order payable out of Central
Funds. Whilst it may have been possible to have made an application for the
Prosecution to pay defence costs, I took the view that this would be wholly
inflamatory and all circumstances. It will at least mean that the funds that have been
earmarked by the South Yorkshire Policy Authority will have been protected a little,
as to part of the events of the past few days.

If the Prosecution overcomes the emotional problem as to Sheffield, then Sheffield
would be the sensible place for the proceedings to be issued, even if trial does not
eventually take place there. We have not been given any indication by the Prosecution
as to the venue at which they will seek to issue the new Summonses.

I am aware that Winckworth & Pemberton have retained Mr. Paul Isaacs as Junior
Counsel for Mr. Duckenfield. He of course appeared at much of the Inquest for David
Duckenfield.

At a meeting that we held jointly in London on the 9th July, they also told me that
it was their intention to appoint a Q.C. at the earliest time. I concur with the view that
this is a case where a Q.C. is going to be necessary.

I have put this to Bernard Murray and he agrees. When I believe that I have identified
a suitable person who is available, then I will also try to agree a fee structure with his
Clerk.

I have spoken to Superintendent Brereton and I have made him aware that Mr. Murray
and Mr. Duckenfield will not be appearing on the 17th.

I will let him know whether Solicitors are going to attend, in case some arrangements
need to be made by him in that regard.

Dear Assistant Chief Constable Daines

BERNARD M URRAY

I refer to our telephone conversation this, morning. 1 attach a copy of the letter from
South Sefton Magistrates Court confirming the withdrawal of the Summons. The Central
Funds Costs Order means that at least some of the costs incurred since the issue of the
Summonses will be met out of Central Funds, It means that there will be able to be an
off-set against the fees charged to the extent that we have managed to make a recovery.

As agreed 1 enclose herewith a copy of the letter from Watts Leather of the 3rd July. It
is actually addressed to Wirickworth & Pemberton, but was copied to me on the basis
that I had supported the same argument. It is a most curious letter as to certain
representations set out.

I do anticipate that I shall be writing to you with regard to trying to bring together
documents which may be in your possession.


Yours sincerely

                           I refer to our earlier correspondence in relation to the above case and, in particular,
                  your letter of today.

                          The proceedings in respect of the defendants Duckenfield and Murray were brought
                  before the court this afternoon and the magistrates agreed that they should be withdrawn. The
                  court made an order that the defendants ’costs should be taxed and made payable from central
                  funds in accordance with Section 16 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,




                                                           Yours faithfully,

                that the court has no jurisdiction jfo hear the case if either defendant were to appear
                before it; it is rather the techmcaltjur^dictional argument, which has nothing to do with                       i

                the substance of the allegations, that the court has no means of compelling Mr
                Duckenfield and Mr Murray to appear before it. We do not agrjee with your                                           ;

          3.      A large proportion of these witnesses come from Liverpool- We intend to call them to
                  prove that the decision to open Gate C at the ground was the responsibility of both
                  defendants; was causative of the deaths of 96 people; and was grossly negligent. The
                  two named victims are representative o f all- The prosecution case will be simple, but
                  many witnesses will be tendered. The allegation of misfeasance is based on the same
                  facts. The allegation of attempting to pervert the course of justice refers to Mr
                  Duckenfield’s allegation that the Liverpool supporters forced the gate.

          4       The committal proceedings will of course be held at the court at which the proceedings
                  are instituted. It is strongly arguable that those proceedings fall within the old
                  committal scheme. The amendments in Schedule 1 to the Criminal Procedure and
                  Investigations Act 1996 were^brought into effect on 1“ April (“the appointed day”) by
                  virtue of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (Commencement)
                  (Section 65 and Schedules 1 and 2) Order 1997, and apply to any alleged offence in
                  relation to which Part 1 of that Act applies. Section 1(3) of that Act makes provision
                  in respect of “alleged offences into which no criminal investigation has begun before
                  the appointed day”.             -.

          5.      It seems to us the better view; is that the present proceedings fall within the exception
                   Although no police investigation was in progress in April 1997, a police investigation
                   “began” in 1989, and it would therefore appear that either of the defendants, or indeed
                   the prosecution, would be ehtttled to call live evidence at committal, If either
                   defendant required us to prove a prima facie case, we should have the task of calling a
                   large number of eye witnesses whose statements will form part of the substantial
                   bundle of evidence that we shall serve on you in due course in order to justify
                   committal for trial.

          6.       It will therefore be apparent to you that the factor of convenience tells overwhelmingly
                   in favour of committal procfeeJing^n Liverpool. Among our witnesses, some are in
                    dubious health. Not all are youngs Many have little money, and would need the
                   reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses if the proceedings are held
                    outside Liverpool. We doubt that^ve would be required to call evidence of forensic
                    pathologists, or the witnesses whq produce the transcripts of the evidence that the two
                    defendants gave to the inquest or £he Taylor Inquiry,

          Submission to the jurisdiction            ■
                                                   ...       ■


          7.       Whatever the court chosen,' there will be inconvenience to some. We accept of course,
                   that attendance at committal proceedings will be inconvenient for Mr Duckenfield if
                   held anywhere other than near his home. Your client may decide to submit to the
                   South Sefton jurisdiction in the interests of saving time and money. It is undoubtedly
                   open to him, or Mr Murray if©do so. If either “appears”' or is “brought before” the
                   court by virtue qf section 2(3)f, and seeks to join issue with the other party on the
                   merits, as opposed to some arid technicality as to the efficacy of the summons, the
                   court has jurisdiction on any basts; "and by virtue of section 1(2){b) the court would
                   have jurisdiction over the othdr defendant, however widely or narrowly the two

                      subsections fail to be construed

          8           In a matter of such importance as the Hillsborough disaster, surely it is essential that
                      prosecution and defence concentrate op the substance of the case rather than captious
                      technicalities. Do you suggest that South Sefton is an inappropriate court?

        A Itnntatlves to Liverpool

          9.          I£ contrary to our view, section ,1 of the Magistrates Court Act 1980 is to be
                      construed as you contend, it would be ogen to the informant to commence
                      proceedings in the County of South Yo&hire, where the alleged offences were
                      committed (section l(2)(a); or where eiiher defendant resides, that is, West Yorkshire
                      in the case of Mr Murray, and            In jhe case of Mr Duckenfield (section l(2)(c)
                      We are inclined not to lay the informations in Sheffield, because, among other reasons;
                      (a) proceedings in that city would revivfe painful memories for relatives of the victims,
                      (b) it is unlikely that many witnesses fron* Sheffield would be called at the committal,
                      and (c) neither defendant lives there.       ;

          10.         The options w ould appear to be, therefor*, Sheffield or some other part of South

Dear Bill

RE: ROGER GREENWOOD - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I attach a letter from solicitors who represent Mr Roger Greenwood; he was in charge of the
policing operation inside the Hillsborough Stadium on the day of the disaster: 15 April 1989,

Mr David Duckenfield (retired Chief Superintendent) and Mr Bernard Murray (retired
Superintendent) were recently summonsed to appear before Bootle Magistrates to answer
charges arising out of the disaster. Both have applied for and been granted financial
assistance for legal representation. The summonses were issued after information was laid
by the solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG). The summonses were
issued about the time that it became public knowledge that the HFSG had expelled some of
their members. The summonses were issued with no prior warning to any interested party.
The Chairman of the HFSG, Mr Trevor Hicks, has been quoted in the press as saying that
the Chief Constable, Richard Wells, may also be summonsed for an alleged offence.

In all these circumstances, Mr Greenwood is entitled to perceive that he may need legal
advice. He acted in good faith on the day of the disaster and, so long after that day, it would
be damaging to the morale of the Force if he were left to pay his own legal expenses.

I support this application.

Yours sincerely




Assistant Chief Constable

SUBJECT:       HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY

The attached papers represent the current activity with regard to the work undertaken by Police
Constable Ken Greenway in his dealings with the Hilisborough Enquiry both before and since his
suspension from duty on 28 April 1998.             buA

 Agreement was reached that PC Greenway ccurta attend at the Discipline and Complaints Office at
Heeley, after his suspension and on an ad hoc/basis, to use his wealth of knowledge on the subject
to make the appropriate responses to requests for statements and enquiries raised from different
sources such as the Home Office and the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

The large bundle of papers and letters, which have dates of May and June, are those that PC
Greenway has been dealing with effectively and the majority of which have been replied to by
letters signed by ACC Ian Daines.
The ’Jobs to Do’ note attached to those papers indicates the pending action yet to be completed
and there would be a need for consultation with PC Greenway in order to gain a full understanding
of their meaning.

The small bundle of three letters with dates of 1 and 2 July 1998 are those which have recently
been received at this office and which I understand are yet to be dealt with. PC Greenway has been
on annual leave recently and so will not have seen those recent letters.

Further correspondence of this nature can be expected as a matter of routine and in view of the
recent developments with a private prosecution being sought by some of the Hillsborough Families
against the two senior Police officers in charge at the time of the football match, now retired.

The task of researching the Hillsborough files in order to retrieve the relevant documents and
provide the appropriate, objective response would require a comprehensive understanding of the
enquiry and the filing system. It would be best served by someone who has sole responsibility for
the enquiries on a day to day basis without any other distractions, an advantage would be someone
who had an association with the original enquiry conducted by South Yorkshire, and the person
would have to be HOLMES trained in order to research the Major Incident enquiry data base.

The report and attached papers are submitted for your information.

         TRANSCRIPT OF MEETING WITH LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH
         JN 8 OCTOBER 1997


29       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:
30            I absolutely take the point about that they could see with
31            their own eyes and it is an extremely important aspect of
32            the case.
33                 Different people might have taken a different view on
34            the quest ion of prosecution.      I am obviously not going to
35           disclose w h a t I might have thought about it,    I do not
36           know. But quite clearly it might be possible to find


•    2
              somebody who took a different view from the DPP.
                   That does not mean to say that the DPP was wrong or
     3        that his d e cision can now be reversed.     There are
     4        imperfections in our system.       Somebody has to filter and
     5        decide and w h ether prosecutions of this gravity are to be
     6        brought.    That is entrusted to a senior lawyer, probably
     7        he consults wi t h other people.     In this case he had the
     8        advice of two ve r y experienced leading counsel, who also
     9       took the same vi e w as him.
10                 I am not saying that there might not have been who
11           somebody could have taken a different view.        I am not



•
12           saying that I m i ght not have taken a different view,        I do
             not know.     But the problem is that I cannot recommend that
14           that decision b e reconsidered unless there is something
15           which clearly points to a greater degree of responsibility
16           than the evidence hitherto has suggested.       That is the way
17           it is and I am afrai d people may find that unpalatable,
18           but that is the w a y it is.
19                Our criminal prosecution system depends on somebody
20           taking a decisi on that there is enough evidence to warrant
21           prosecution with the prospect of success.       That is
22           entrusted to a, as    I say, very responsible senior person
23           in a case of this gravity.     I doubt whether he considered
             it alone,    he had the advantage of leading counsel's
             opinions and there w e are.    That is his decisions, that is
             the way the criminal justice system works.       You will think
             it is inadequate,    you will go on thinking it is inadequate
             for the rest of your life I dare say?

Dear Assistant Chief Constable Daines

BERNARD MURRAY

Thank you for sparing your valuable time to discuss issues with me on the 13th July.

I have noted that you have advised the Clerk to the Justices at Sheffield that if an approach
were to be made by the Hillsborough Families Association to issue a Summons against
your Chief Constable, then you would wish to be advised so that you could arrange
representation. May we please liaise in this regard because although our Client is clearly
in a different position, nonetheless we too would like to be party to the representations that
are made to the Clerk to the Justices.

We mentioned to you disclosure of documents.

We have been asked by the C.P.S. to advise whether we believe that he has all relevant
material. He has not told us what material he does have. In our view we should be made
aware of at least the major items of material that are held by the Police, whether they are
in their own right or as storers for other bodies.

It also seems proper insofar as material may already have been made available to any other
interested person, then such material should be made available to us as well. In that regard
we would ordinarily say that we would be responsible for copying charges, but we are of
course aware that our fees are being met by the South Yorkshire Police Authority. We
leave you to guide us as to whether in those circumstances there would be any charges
payable for copying.


  ours sincerely

     Dear Ian

     Hillsborough Prosecutions

     I enclose a copy of the letter of guidance received from George Croston at the CPS.

     This is really quite helpful although the suggestion of any originator of any witness statements
     should be contacted before that statement is released could produce a very heavy work load if
     matters develop in that direction.

     As you can see the point is made that the CPS are considering what action to take in respect of the
     prosecutions if indeed they are recommenced in South Yorkshire. They suggest that no action
     should be taken in response to the request until the CPS have completed their deliberations.

     At this stage I propose that I should write to the solicitors indicating that we are following the
     advice in that respect and that we anticipate a further communication from the CPS when their
     review has been completed.


Y    At the same time I would acknowledge George Croston’s letter and ask him to advise when the
     review has been completed and what the outcome is.

     It occurs to me that the CPS themselves will not be hurrying to complete their review when there are
     no actual proceedings extant.

     If the prosecutions are reinstated and the CPS decide not to intervene I think that we should provide
     both sets of solicitors with a schedule of statements giving the names only of those concerned,
     explain that the CPS guidance requires us to attempt to obtain consent in respect of any witness

whose statement is sought and invite them to indicate which witnesses they would like us to
approach.

Before doing that however we will have to reach some conclusion on the question of whether to
charge for this assistance and for any eventual copies required.

I am reasonably confident that it will not be necessary to reach a decision on this point whilst I am
away on holiday which is to say until 3 August 1998.

If you agree that I should write the letters mentioned above to the solicitors and to the CPS then this
can be dealt with in my absence by Simon Hills here.

In the event of some major development taking place and requiring urgent advice the Partner
involved will be Mike Shepherd, as previously mentioned

Yours sincerely

       Dear Sirs

       HILLSBOROUGH PROSECUTIONS

       Thank you for your letter of 6 July 1998 requesting guidance for the Chief Constable of
       South Yorkshire in the matter of disclosure of documems to the Hillsborough. Family Support
       group. This branch has also received a request from solicitors for the HFSG for copies and
       details of all the relevant documents in our possession including advice of counsel.

       As this is a case where the police investigation commenced before 1 April 1997 then the
       disclosure of unused and other material will be governed by the common law rules. It may
       assist you in making your decision if 1 discuss the principles that we will apply in considering
       the request made to us.

       The right to bring a private prosecution does not confer on an intending private prosecutor
       a right to obtain documents from the CPS: R v DPP, ex parte Hallas (1988) 87 Cr App 340.
       Nor would a defendant in such an action have a right to obtain documents from the CPS.
       It must also be that the above will apply to documents in the possession of the police as well
       as any member of the general public. Following a committal, the Crown Court may grant
       the private prosecutor a witness summons to secure the production of relevant material from
       the police or the CPS in order that the private prosecutor should be able to comply with his
       obligation of disclosure to the defence: R v Gregory Pawsey (1989) Crim LR 152.

       The decision whether to give voluntary disclosure of statements or information held by the
       CPS (eg, the names and addresses of witnesses) is governed by certain principles. In normal
       circumstances when a request is received the matter can be approached on the following
       lines:

               •         The police should contact the witness and explain that a bona fide request has
                         been made for a copy of the statement.




                                Crown Prosecution Service   *   Working in the interests o f justice
15/07 '98   17:44      © 0 1 9 0 4 456577            CPS 4th floor




                    The witness should be asked whether there is any objection to his/her name
                    being given to a third party so that the third parry can communicate direct.
                    It should be pointed out that if the witness has no objection, perhaps they
                    could indicate then and there whether any objection would be made to the
                    statement being disclosed by the CPS.

            •       In cases where the witness has no such objection, disclosure can be made.

            •       In circumstances where the witness has no objection to the address being
                    provided but wishes for the third party to communicate direct with them on
                    the question of release of the statement, then the address can be communicated
                    to the third party.

            •       If consent is refused to disclosure of the address, the police should endeavour
                    to obtain in writing the reasons for the refusal. The witness should be warned
                    that the CPS will have to give careful consideration to the matter to decide
                    whether the interests of justice are such that disclosure should nevertheless be
                    made.

    The above steps are only guidelines but the main principle is that wherever possible the
    witness is consulted before decisions to disclose addresses and/or statements are made. The
    general rule is that the CPS should give disclosure whenever it is in the interests of justice
    to do so. Any voluntary disclosure should be even-handed between the parties. Therefore
    if voluntary disclosure is given to the private prosecutor at his or her request then the same
    documents or information should be copied to the defendants, or vice versa.

    Where the CPS do not take over a private prosecution we would notify the private prosecutor
    and the defendants of the existence of the material in our possession and supply it on request
    if right to do so based on the above principles. Where material was subject to either public
    interest immunity ( eg, reports and advice passed between the police and the CPS) or to legal
    professional privilege (advice from counsel to the CPS) then it should not be disclosed
    without the authority of the Chief Constable or the DPP as appropriate.

    You may consider that the above principles are as appropriate for the police as they are for
    the CPS. If voluntary disclosure is to be given then initially it might be best practice to send
    to the parties a full schedule of all the non-sensitive documents in your possession. These
    schedules should already be available to you as part of the police preparation for the Taylor
    and Stuart-Smith Enquiries. Consideration can be given to the relevance of material before
    actual disclosure is made as this should considerably reduce your preparation wrork. I
    understand that much of the material has already been supplied to or seen by the HFSG, that
    in itself should reduce the amount of any disclosure if eventually given. Before the CPS
    consider the issue of disclosure of relevant material in our possession we will first decide on

    taking over a private prosecution. This decision is presently under review.

Yol pose five questions for me, and my advice to the police is as follows:

        •       You may wish to delay any voluntary disclosure at this stage until the result
                of the CPS review is known.

        •       While there have been succcssful challenges by defendants toCPS/police
                charges for the copying of unused material in prosecution cases, I know of no
                similar caselaw for private prosecutions where voluntary disclosure is given
                by a third party (ie, the police). If you make a charge which is contested by
                any of the parties then they could be asked for the legal basis of their request
                for the free provision of documents. It would however be a different matter
                in the provision of material subject to a court order after committal
                proceedings.

        •       The original statements in your possession are part of the record contained in
                a police file involving a criminal investigation. As such T consider that best
                practice would be to retain them within the file but allow access to the private
                prosecutor/defendant malcing the request for the puxposes of inspection or
                photo-copying if requested. If following any voluntary disclosure there was
                a request for original witness statements to be used for the committal
                proceedings, then, subject to witness agreement being obtained as stated
                earlier, it would be more appropriate for the private prosecutor/defendant to
                obtain a new original from a witness that they are to call.

        •       Tf the police retain original statements then the only concern would be the
                 eventual disposal of copy documents. Prior to the introduction of the
                 Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 there was little the
                prosecution could do about the disposal of trial papers and unused material
                 provided to defendants. For investigations that commenced after 1 April 1997
                 Section 17 of the Act makes a provision for the protection of unused material
                 then disclosed. The aim of this section is to preserve the confidentiality of the
                 material and to ensure it is only used for the given purpose. While the
                 c o m m on law does not grant the same protection as under the Act I do not
                 consider that an undertaking will have any great force in the present situation.
                 I accept that the interests of justice can be adequately served by voluntary
                 disclosure of relevant material only, subject to witness agreement.

        •       There may be occasions when it will be appropriate for the Chief Constable
                to copy to one or other parties or to the court correspondence that he has had
                with the other party, so that all parties are aware of the position. If in doubt
                he should confirm the proposed action with the originator of the letter. As
                previously advised what is disclosed to one party should be disclosed to all.

I understand that the summonses issued to Mr Duckenfield and to Mr Murray are being
withdrawn at South Sefton Magistrates’ Court for want of jurisdiction in the issue of process.
I anticipate that fresh informations will be laid in South Yorkshire in the near future,
although for now we have a short breathing space in which to properly consider the available
options.

Dear Mr Metcalf

Hillsborough Prosecution

Thank you for your letter of 16 July 1998 on the above subject.

I agree with your recommendation at paragraph 4: please write to Leather Watts on behalf
of the Chief Constable and tell them that we will take no action until we know the result of
the CPS review.

I agree with your recommendation at paragraph 5: please write to Mr Croston and ask him
to advise when the review has been completed and its outcome.

On Saturday 18 July 1998 David Duckenfield advised me that he had just received a
further summons through the post. It was issued by Leeds Magistrates Court on Monday
13 July and is returnable on 20 August. It is for the same offences as before but with
slightly amended wording.

Yours sincerely

  Dear Sir

  The Hillsborough Disaster

  I would inform you that I have now taken over the conduct of the above matter from Watts
  Leather, Solicitors.

  I refer to their letter to you of 1“ July 1998 and enclose a copy for ease of reference. I also
  enclose a copy of a letter we have today written to the Director of Public Prosecutions which
  sets out the reasons why we are requesting documents and information. The same
  considerations apply obviously to statements and documents in your possession.

  There are two specific matters which we wish to raise with you at this stage in addition to our
  general request. The’first relates to originals of witness statements. We have been supplied in
  the last year with dozens of witness statements taken from spectators at the disaster. We are
  now engaged in our selection of witnesses for the committal bundle. We shall obviously need
  all the originals, and request you .to provide them to us.

  The second matter concerns the informal statements given by various officers of the South
  Yorkshire Police, As the extract from Hansard which is attached to the letter to the Director
  of Public Prosecutions makes clear, we have now been able to see both edited and unedited
  versions of these statements. We are studying them. We shall wish to speak to some o f these
  officers individually, and may wish to call some of them as witnesses. Their statements are not
  in proper form. We should therefore be grateful if you could provide us with addresses (work
  addresses if preferred) where we can contact them to put questions to them on an individual
  basis for investigative purposes and to prepare the magistrates court papers. For convenience
  we attach a list of the names and stations (so far as is known from the existing statements) of
  those whose current addresses we want to establish. Can you also confirm you will not seek
  to raise any charge for our seeing witnesses.

 Dear Sir

 Adlington v Murray: Adlington v Duckenfield

 I would inform you that I have now taken over conduct of the above matter from Watts
 Leather, Solicitors.

 I refer to their letter to you of 30th June 1998 and enclose a copy, and write to you now to
 report the most recent developments. The defendants intimated a long technical argument as
 to whether a justice at the South Sefton Magistrates Court could compel by summons
 defendants who now live in West Yorkshire and              o attend court in Liverpool. It was
 not disputed, we believe, that any magistrates court in England and Wales has jurisdiction to
 hear committal proceedings in respect of indictable offences committed anywhere in the
 country, provided that a defendant appears before it.

 Solely in order to avoid delay, we have withdrawn those summonses, but taken out
 summonses in Leeds, the area in which Mr Murray lives. We enclose copies for your
 information. We hope that you are now in a position to provide us with the documents and
 information we seek. The return date for summonses is 20th August.

 We wish to be able to study your documents well in advance of that date, so that, as the
 prosecution, we can assist the court with timetable, an estimate of the number of witnesses to
 be tendered at committal, and so on. We also have some copy witness statements, but
 obviously will require the originals. We note from the recent newspaper reports of the
 Stephen Lawrence enquiry in London that when the solicitor for the Lawrence family
 announced that he was intending to begin a private prosecution, the relevant officer at the
 Crown Prosecution Service immediately opened the entire contents of his files to him.

 We hope that you will raise no objection to the disclosure to us of all documents in your
 possession. We can inform you that in the last year, the Hillsborough Family Support Group

                                                1
              Phone 0151 236 1919. Fax 0151 236 1936. E Mail info@hfsg.org
            1st Floor Central Buildings 41 North John Street Liverpool L2 6RR
has received many copies of witness statements from spectators at the ground. The Home
Office has made available to us this year large numbers of unsworn statements from officers of
the South Yorkshire Police. We already know the names and have statements of many of the
witnesses who will be called or tendered at committal, but there are significant gaps that we
must fill.

The Home Office has adopted a deliberately open policy of making available the information in
its possession. We enclose a copy of extracts from Hansard for 18th February 1998. You will
note from the last paragraph of page 1088 the importance the Home Secretary attached to the
publication of material which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith had examined. We invite you to do
the same.

This prosecution has not been undertaken lightly. We have considered with care the new
material disclosed to us by the Home Office, and the recently revealed witness statements. We
have taken careful and detailed advice from leading and junior counsel.

We regard the prosecution case as strong. It is evidently much stronger than the case against
the alleged killers of Stephen Lawrence, in which the DPP disclosed everything. The
comments of Lord Taylor in his 1989 report into the Hillsborough disaster are as powerful
today as they were then. He considered that the order to open the gates, combined with
failure to close off access to the tunnel, was a “blunder of the first magnitude”, remarking:

               “The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was
               the failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the cental pens which
               were already overfull.”

Since then the House of Lords has held that in offences of involuntary manslaughter not
involving an unlawful and dangerous act the appropriate test is as follows:

               “The essence of the matter which is supremely a jury question, is whether
               having regard to the risk of death involved the conduct of the defendant was so
               bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or
               omission” R v Adomciko [1995] 1AC 187E

The South Yorkshire Police has admitted negligence on many occasions. The negligence
found by Lord Taylor caused death. Our case is that the persons responsible for the decision
were the two defendants. The prosecution argument here is that, in the words of Lord
MacKay, [1995] 1AC 187E, it is “supremely a jury question” whether, having regard to the
risk of death involved, the undoubted negligence was so bad as to amount to a criminal act or
omission. We simply want the jury to judge this matter “in all the circumstances”. We are
invoking the right, enshrined in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to conduct a private
prosecution.

We do not know why a decision not to prosecute was made in 1990, but we suspect that your
office, and therefore counsel who advised, were given incomplete information. We attach a
transcript of further comments by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith of 8th October 1997 as to the
question whether a prosecution might originally have been brought.
The allegation of misfeasance is based on the same and other facts and the allegation of taking
steps to pervert the course of justice refers to Mr Duckenfield’s “disgraceful lie” as Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith called it, that the supporters had broken down the gate.

I would be grateful if you would reply quickly to our letters. We are writing in similar terms
to the South Yorkshire Police and the West Midlands Police.


Yours faithfully

Dear Assistant Chief Constable Daines

BERNARD MURRAY

I spent much of Monday afternoon researching what right we might have as a
proposed Defendant, to seek to get before a Stipendiary Magistrate or Justices Clerk
in relation to the issue of a Summons.

I know that you too had written to Sheffield Magistrates Court in case a Summons
were to be issued against your Chief Constable.

I now learn that Summonses have been issued at Leeds City Magistrates Court, which
will be returnable on the 20th August.

I am also told that the Firm of Watts Leather are no longer instructed in this matter,
and all correspondence is to be directed to Keva Coombes, the Legal Advisor to
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

At this stage I cannot say definitely whether we will accept the venue of Leeds City
Magistrates. Whilst strictly               does not fall within the Petty Sessional
Division, Leeds would be the proximate High Court centre.

We will not be able to make a final decision for a little time yet, but I wonder
whether it would be appropriate for you to have a word with your opposite number
in West Yorkshire to make some provisional arrangements.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Hills

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I attach a fax dated 20 July 1998 from Ms Keva Coombes, Solicitor for the Hillsborough
Family Support Group. I also attach my acknowledgement of her letter.

Ms Coombes seeks access to documents and witnesses. At this stage, I think we should
tell her that we will wait for the outcome of the DPP’s review before taking any action. If
you agree that we should respond in such terms, I would be obliged if you could write to Ms
Coombes on my behalf.

Ms Coombes asks if there will be charges for seeing witnesses. I think she is referring only
to currently serving police officers. Please advise her I have made no decision yet on
charges for access to documents and for interviews with serving police officers or any other
services. I will await the DPP’s advice.

I also attach two letters I have received from Mr Richard Manning, Solicitor for Bernard
Murray. At paragraph 4 of the letter of 16 July 1998, Mr Manning asks me to advise on
what material we hold. To answer that question would in itself be a major task. I think we
should await the outcome of the DPP’s review. If you agree, I would be obliged if you could
write to Mr Manning in those terms.

Mr Manning obliquely asks for copies of material we have supplied to other parties. We
have supplied vast amounts of material to all sorts of interested parties over the years. It
would be a major task to compile a schedule of that material, let alone copy it. I think we
should await the outcome of the DPP’s review. If you agree, I would be obliged if you could
write to Mr Manning in those terms.

Mr Manning asks whether there will be any charges for copying. To be equitable, I think we
should treat private prosecutor and defendant in the same manner. I will await the DPP’s
advice.

Please advise Mr CROSTON, CPS Special Casework, York, of the letters received and
your replies to them.

Finally, I would be obliged if you could send to me copies of the letters to which you refer in
your letter dated 21 July.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Manning

BERNARD MURRAY

As you may be aware we, and in particular Peter Metcalf of this firm, have been asked by Assistant
Chief Constable Daines to act on behalf of the Chief Constable.

I have seen copies of your letters of 16 and 21 July 1998 addressed to Mr Daines who in turn has
asked me to respond to you.

Regarding the whole question of disclosure of documents, witness statements and access to
witnesses we have sought the advice of DPP/CPS.

The CPS is reviewing the decision whether or not to exercise the power under the Prosecution of
Offences Act 1985 to take over a private prosecution. We have advised, and are instructed
accordingly, not to take any further action until that review is complete. I trust you will appreciate
the sense in this approach, not least in view of the enormity of the tasks involved in responding to
the requests/suggestions contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter of 16 July.

I have asked the CPS to write again once their review is complete.

Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Coombes

T H E H IL L S B O R O U G H D IS A S T E R

I refer to your letter of 20 July 1998 addressed to Mr Daines, Assistant Chief Constable and his
response to you dated 22 July from which you will be aware that Mr Daines has asked us to act on
behalf of the Chief Constable.

I note that you have taken over the conduct of this matter from Messrs Watts Leather. I enclose
copies of our letters of 6 and 21 July addressed to that firm.

Regarding your request for access to documents and witnesses, our advice and instructions remain
the same, ie we will await the outcome of the CPS review before taking any action.

Regarding charges for access to documents and/or interviews with serving police officers, or indeed
any other services, again Mr Daines has informed me that he will not make a final decision until he
has DPP/CPS advice.

I trust this clarifies the position.

Yours sincerely

Dear Assistant Chief Constable Daines

BERNARD MURRAY

Thank you very much for sparing the time to speak to me in what was a long
conversation on the 22nd July. I do thank you sincerely for putting aside the time to
discuss this difficult case, and I will try very hard not to trespass too greatly into that
precious time.

May I start by thanking you on behalf of Bernard Murray for your offer to meet with
him. I will convey that message to him straight away.

I note that you feel it would be impossible:

1.       To advise the contents of your archive.

2.       To tell me what papers have been provided to various interested persons over
         the 9 years since the tragedy.

I accept your decision that if papers are provided to me, then for the sake of equality
you would have to raise an account, having done so to others.

I am grateful to you for speaking to Assistant Chief Constable Paul Garven of West
Yorkshire Police, with regard to the provision of any security at Leeds. I will let you
know as soon as possible whether the Leeds hearing is to go ahead, and if so whether
the two Defendants are going to be present.

With regard to costs, I note that you are not aware that any agreement has been
reached with Winckworth & Pemberton as to the remuneration to be paid to Junior
Counsel retained by them. I have retained Mr. Simon Myerson as Junior Counsel for
Bernard Murray and I am likely to retain Mr. Michael Harrison, Q.C. to lead for the

Dear Sirs

H IL L S B O R O U G H : A d lin g lo u v D u ck en field an d M u rra y

Thank you for your letter of 20 July 1998 addressed to Mr C.H.Enzor and informing us that
you have taken over the conduct of the case from Watts Leather. Mr Enzor has asked me
to reply on his behalf as I am involved in the CPS review of the papers.

Following the receipt of the Watts Leather letter of 30 June we had been in communication
with them and were about to send a more substantive reply. I shall incorporate that
information in this letter.

I am aware that the original summonses issued at South Sefton Magistrates’ Court have been
withdrawn because of perceived problems with the court’s jurisdiction. Thank you for your
confirmation that summonses were issued on 13 July returnable for 20 August 1998 at Leeds
Magistrates’ Court.

You may already know that the two firms of solicitors acting separately for Mr Duckenfield
and for Mr Murray have formally requested the Director to exercise her power under section
6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the conduct of the proceedings
instituted by the private prosecutor for whom you act, and then to discontinue under section
23 of the Act.

It may help if you were acquainted with our policy in cases of this type. The Code for
Crown Prosecutors contains the principles that apply to the CPS review of criminal
proceedings started by the police. There are two stages in the decision to prosecute. The
first being the evidential test. If the case does not pass that test, it must not go ahead, no
matter how important or serious it may be. If the case does pass the evidential test then a
Crown Prosecutor must decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest. This second
stage is the public interest test which I shall come to later.
The evidential test is an objective one and a Crown prosecutor must be satisfied that there
is enough evidence to provide a ‘realistic prospect of conviction’ against each defendant on
each charge. In other words a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance
with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the offence charged.

Where there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction the public
interest must be considered. Crown Prosecutors must balance the factors for and against
prosecution carefully and fairly.

The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private prosecutor builds on that
contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The right to bring a private prosecution is
preserved by section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 subject to the power under
section 6(2). The CPS will take over a private prosecution where there is a particular need
for it to do so on behalf of the public.

As you know the original review decision released in August 1990 was made following the
joint advice received from two leading counsel. The advice was that there was "no sufficient
evidence to support criminal proceedings of any kind against those mentioned in the West
Midlands Report". The subsequent Press release made on behalf of the Director of Public
Prosecutions was that there was "insufficient evidence to justify the institution of proceedings
against any officer in the South Yorkshire Police Force or any other person for any other
offence".

Following the showing of the Jimmy McGovern drama documentary on national television
in December 1996 and the representations made to us by a number of parties including the
HFSG on 4 March 1997, the CPS commenced a further review of what was said to be ‘new
evidence’. Our responsibility focused on whether or not there was new material, which, if
properly investigated, might lead to a realistic prospect of conviction of any person. The
conclusion that was reached was that there were no grounds for reopening the police
investigation into the Hillsborough disaster. In the subsequent Scrutiny set up by the Home
Secretary, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was asked to ascertain whether any evidence exists
relating to the disaster which was not available to the Director of Public Prosecutions for the
purpose of discharging her statutory responsibility. His conclusions are laid out in detail in
his report and in Chapter 7 he says that he does not consider there to be any material that
should be put before the DPP or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them
to reconsider the decisions they had taken. These decisions were made in accordance with
the principles laid down in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. It was decided that there was
insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.

In the instant case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over the prosecution
in order to discontinue it, we would do so if one (or more) of the following circumstances
applies:

•      There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution commenced in these
       circumstances would be unfounded, and would, therefore be an abuse of the right to
       bring a prosecution.

•      The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those
       factors tending in favour.
•      T h e p r o secu tio n is clearly lik ely to d am age the in terests o f ju s tic e .

The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our policy.

If none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to become involved and we
would not interfere with the private prosecution.

Clearly there is a distinction between the "realistic prospect of conviction" test in the Code
and the "clearly no case to answer" test mentioned above. Accordingly we recognise that
there will be some cases which do not meet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will
not intervene. It has been considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions
would unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.

Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be assured that all relevant material
has been considered. While we have access to material available to the Taylor Enquiry, the
Inquests, the judicial review hearing in the High Court and that submitted to us by the
Hillsborough Family Support Group, it may be that other important evidence is not known
to us. You have kindly provided the CPS with schedules of evidence in your possession and
we have asked the solicitors for the defendants for the same information. Where there is
evidence that we have not seen we shall be asking the relevant party for voluntary disclosure
of the same.

Until there has been a detailed review of the many papers in the case the Crown’s position
cannot be determined. This review will of necessity take some little time to complete. I
regret that at the moment we are not able to give a date for the promulgation of the decision
but I can assure you that our review will be expedited.

In order to be assist your review of the papers involved in the private prosecution I shall
arrange for a schedule of our papers to be sent to you as soon as possible. However this will
not apply to those documents subject to either public interest immunity or to legal privilege.

Under the circumstances outlined above we do not feel that it is appropriate for us to
consider your request for voluntary disclosure of our case papers until our decision has been
made.

We have advised the Chief Constable for South Yorkshire Police on disclosure of documents
in his possession in similar terms to those above.

I shall be writing to the solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray enclosing for them a
copy of this letter.

Following our review I should be able to advise in more detail as to the stance we take on
the other issues raised by yourselves.
Please let me know if there is any way in which I can assist you further.

Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Henderson

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter of 15 July 1998 on the above subject.

Private prosecutions have been started by the Hillsborough Family Support Group against
retired police officers who were in charge of policing on the day of the disaster. Mr Kelly’s
statement may well be central to one of the charges against one of the former officers. The
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is considering whether to become involved.

I have asked for legal advice on whether I should accede to your request.

I will write again as soon as practicable.

Dear Mr Metcalfe

Hillsborough Stadium Prosecutions

On 26 June 1998 Ms Ann Adlington, Solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group
(HFSG), laid information before Bootle Magistrates alleging that David Duckenfield and
Bernard Murray committed offences of unlawful killing at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15
April 1989. Information was also laid that Mr Duckenfield attempted to pervert the course
of justice in respect of what he said about Gate 3.

The information led to the issue of summonses. They were withdrawn because of a
dispute over jurisdiction and summonses have been obtained from Leeds Magistrates for
return on 20 August 1998.

The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is reviewing the case to determine whether to
take over these private prosecutions.

I have received a number of requests from the HFSG for the release of a handful of
statements. When they asked for all the statements, I took your advice and declined to
consider supplying them until the DPP’s position was clear. I think we should do the same
in respect of any release of statements.

The Football Association (FA) has written to ask for a copy of the statement of Graham
KELLY, the Chief Executive of the FA. As the disaster unfolded Mr Kelly asked Mr
Duckenfield what was happening and Mr Duckenfield replied that Gate C had been forced.
Those words form the nub of the allegation that Mr Duckenfield attempted to pervert the
course of justice. I feel we should decline the FA’s request until the DPP’s review is
complete.

I have written to the HFSG and the FA to advise that I am taking legal advice. If you agree
with me that I should not release statements, while the DPP is reviewing the case, I would
be obliged if you could write on my behalf to the HFSG and the FA.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Richard

 B ern ard M u rray

 Thank you for your letter of 23 July 1998.

 In connection with the Summonses issued against your client and David Duckenfield, requests for
 documentation and information have been received from a number of persons.

 The Chief Constable sought guidance pursuant to Section 3(2)(e) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
 1985 from the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to those requests.

 The response was that the Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing the question of whether to
 intervene in the private prosecutions and that the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary
 disclosure of documentation until that review was complete and a decision was made.

 The Chief Constable has accepted that guidance and accordingly will not respond to any requests for
 documentation or information until the CPS review has been completed and the decision of the DPP
 is known.

 Dear Ian,

 D a v id D u ck en fie ld - p rep a ra tio n o f p ossib le p rivate p rosecu tion

 We have generally discussed matters recently, and I confirm we have instructed Mr William
 Clegg QC a 3 Hare Court to act on behalf of David Duckenfield, with Paul Isaacs as junior.
 We will make decisions later in terms of how we deal with the Leeds Summons returnable
 on 20th August, and will do so after liaising with Richard Manning at Walker Morris, in the
 light of any response to the enclosed copy letter to HFSG. I will let you know the outcome
 of discussions.

 I appreciate, in the light of the response from the DPP and particularly the copy letter to the
 HFSG dated 27th July which we have been sent, South Yorkshire Police will not be making
 voluntary disclosure of any contentious material to any of the parties. When we discussed
 disclosure previously you did, however, indicate that you would be prepared to make available
 copies of the following:-

 1.               Full transcript of the Taylor Inquiry.
 2.               Full transcript of the Inquest.

 May I reiterate our request for that documentation (in duplicate - separate copy for Walker
 Morris), although there is no particular hurry on that as I write This, of course, could change
 at any moment!

 Please do let me know if, in the light of recent correspondence, this request presents any
 difficulty.

 Yours sincerely,

 Adlington -v- Duckenfield and M urray

 We refer to recent correspondence and most recently your letter of 3rd August 1998.

 With regard to the Summons returnable at Leeds City Magistrates Court on 20th August 1998
 our present view can be anticipated by the comments made in respect of the original
 Summons issued at the South Sefton Magistrates Court, and that is the Summons has been
 wrongly issued, as the court does not have proper jurisdiction to consider the matter.

  Accordingly on a technical level at least, we cannot agree that the proceedings have been
  properly instituted. It is our view that there are only three proper places that a summons
  could be properly issued, and those are              (relating to Mr Murray),
  (relating to Mr Duckenfield), and Sheffield which has always been the logical venue pursuant
  to s.l(2)(a) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980.

 We do not wish to be unhelpful, but you will understand our keenness, given the importance
 of these proceedings, to ensure that they are commenced on a proper footing and that any
 technical defects are corrected. Having said that, it would be helpful for us to know your
 reasoning for commencing proceedings in Leeds, and specifically as to whether there are any
 local relevant factors in terms of the magistrates court management that we ought to take
 account o f In this context, it is our understanding that Leeds is a distinct magistrates court
 area from

 We are aware of the views expressed previously by Messrs Watts Leather in regard to the
 venue of any magistrates court proceedings, but note that no mention was made of Leeds, in
 terms of the interests of any of the persons involved, and would be grateful if you could
 advise us your reasons for approaching the court there.

 We are more than happy to establish and promote a spirit of openness between us, and
 accordingly look forward to yoiur further comments so that we can consider your views before

    We refer to recent correspondence and most recently your letter of 3rd August 1998.

    With regard to the Summons returnable at Leeds City Magistrates Court on 20th August 1998
    our present view can be anticipated by the comments made in respect of the original
    Summons issued at the South Sefton Magistrates Court, and that is the Summons has been
    wrongly issued, as the court does not have proper jurisdiction to consider the matter.

    Accordingly on a technical level at least, we cannot agree that the proceedings have been
    properly instituted- It is our view that there are only three proper places that a summons
    could be properly issued, and those are               Relating to Mr Murray),____________
    (relating to Mr Duckenfield), and Sheffield which has always been the logical venue pursuant
    to s.l(2)(a) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980.

    We do not wish to be unhelpful, but you will understand our keenness, given the importance
    of these proceedings, to ensure that they are commenced on a proper footing and that any
    technical defects are corrected. Having said that, it would be helpful for us to know your
    reasoning for commencing proceedings in Leeds, and specifically as to whether there are any
    local relevant factors in terms o f the magistrates court management that we ought to take
    account of. In this context, it is our understanding that Leeds is a distinct magistrates court
    area from Pontefract

     We are aware o f the views expressed previously by Messrs Watts Leather in regard to the
     venue of any magistrates court proceedings, but note that no mention was made of Leeds, in
     terms of the interests of any of the persons involved, and would be grateful if you could
     advise us your reasons for approaching the court there.

     We are more than happy to establish and promote a spirit of openness between us, and
     accordingly look forward to your further comments so that w e can consider your v ie w s before

Dear

David Duckenfield

I refer to your fax of the afternoon of 7 August 1998 on the above subject.

Solicitors for the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) have started private
prosecutions against two retired police officers (Bernard Murray and David Duckenfield)
arising out of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 1989. The Chief Constable holds a
large archive of material relating to that disaster. Since starting the prosecution, the HFSG
have asked me for various documents from the archive, as have the solicitors representing
Mr Murray. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is considering whether to take over
the prosecution. This review may take some time. On the advice of the DPP, the Chief
Constable will not release material from the archive until that review is complete. This will
ensure that the Chief Constable’s impartiality is not compromised. If the DPP takes over
the prosecutions and discontinues them, the Chief Constable will not have used valuable
resources in releasing documents for a purpose that has ceased to be relevant.

When we spoke about the transcripts of the Taylor inquiry and the inquest, I said that they
were records of events that occurred in public. They are not confidential but they are bulky.
To copy them would be quite a logistical exercise.

In view of the DPP’s review the Chief Constable’s need to remain impartial and the
logistical problems of copying large documents, I must decline to supply a copy of the
transcripts at this stage.

Yours sincerely
                                                                          ACC(ID)/EMP

Dear Assistant Chief Constable Baines

BERNARD MURRAY

  I have received a letter from Hammond Suddards explaining the advices given to the
  Chief Constable as to the disclosure of further documents. I have to record my
  disappointment at what seems to me to put the Hillsborough Family Support Group
. in an advantageous position. It is known that over a period of time various requests
  have been made for disclosure of statements and documents and if all of those have
  been brought together the Prosecution aredistinctly at an advantage. I understand that
  you would not be able to tell me of the totality of the disclosure that has been made.

I understand that Winckworth and Pemberton have previously had a full set of the
Taylor papers and transcripts and also similar documents from the Coroner’s Inquest.
I am told that these were returned to you when it appeared that their instructions had
been concluded. I believe that they are going to ask for those papers to be copied for
their continuing use. I would also make a request for a full set of those papers and
for convenience I am sure that the two sets can be copied at the one time. I do not
see that these are in any way covered by the advice given by Hammond Suddards to
the Chief Constable and I hope therefore that papers will be able to be provided at the
earliest time.                                                         . \

               Dear Ian,
                                                                                Hillsborough - Documentation

               1 attach copics of:

               1. Letter dated 11,8,98 from Walker Morris

               2. Letter dated 11.8.98 from CPS, vviih enclosures.

               3. Letter dated 12.8.98 from Keva Coombcs for HFSG.

           As~tu~t. If you were to provide Winckworth & Pemberton with documents (even documents they
           had already seen previously) then it would plainly be right to do the same for Walker Morris.
           However, to supply either or both of them would breach your stated policy of awaiting the CPS
           decision and I do not recommend that you do this.

           As to 2.1 see no reason to object to CPS copying to H.FSG any letters that 1 or you send to CPS.

           As to 3. I believe that there is no reason to alter your stated policy. 1 am reasonably confident that
           we could quash any witness summons as inappropriate or premature. There is however a question as
           to whether we simply reiterate the position in a short letter or whether wc attempt to answer the
           mish mash of slur and innuendo contained in the letter. On the whole I favour the former course but
           stating also in our response that none of the points which they make are accepted but that they will
           be addressed if appropriate once the decision of the DPP is known.

           Perhaps you can telephone me when you have had the chance to consider. If a meeting will help 1
           can come to Sheffield today or tomorrow.

           Yours sincerely,

           Dear Peter

           BERNARD MURRAY

           Thank you for your letter of 7 August following our telephone conversation, I have
           noted the advices tendered to the Chief Constable. It is obviously unfortunate and
           difficult for my Client that those who have made requests for papers over a long
           period of time have been provided with copies of these and if those have found their
           way to the Hillsborough Family Support Group, they will have a distinct advantage
           over the defence. It was for this reason that I asked the Assistant Chief Constable to
           let me have a schedule of and then copies of papers that had previously been disclosed
           and I think that is not an unreasonable position.

           I know that Winckworth and Pemberton (who represent David Duckenfield) have
           previously had a complete set of papers relating to the Taylor enquiry and the inquest.
           They returned these when it appeared that their instructions had been concluded in
           relation to a particular aspect of work. They are making a request for the return of
           those papers to them and I think at the very least a full set of those papers should also
           be provided to me. I have sent a letter to the Assistant Chief Constable with a formal
           request which I hope will be agreed and acted upon.

           Yours sincerely

            I

     Dear Sirs,

     RE:       HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD and MURJR VY

     I enclosc a copy of the letter dated 31 July 1998 from the Legal Advisor to the Hillsborough
     Family Support group.

     In correspondence with HFSG, I have indicated that the Crown Prosecution Service intends
     to be as fair and open in its handling of this matter as possible. They have indicated that
     they have no objection to disclosure of their correspondence to us, provided they are supplied
     with copies of correspondence to the CPS from the solicitors for the defendants and South
     Yorkshire Police.

     I propose to supply them with copies unless you indicate that you object to doing so.



     Yours faithfully,

              Thank you for your letter of 27111July. You do not invite a reply of substance, but we
              ’wish to deal with some of the issues you raise. Obviously, you do not wish to conduct
              an elaborate trial of the issues involved, taking evidence and representations from the
              prosecution and defence in turn, before making a decision. Neither does the
              Hillsborough Family Support Group, but I ask you to bear the following matters in
              mind.

              The Criteria/or discontinuance: insufficiency.

              In my last letter I set out the basis on which we had brought the prosecutions. In
              contrast to this case, you will know that the prosecution of the youths who were
              alleged to have killed Stephen Lawrence in London was brought on an apparently
              speculative basis with little supporting evidence. At the public enquiry into that case,
              Mr Youngerwood of the Crown prosecution Service said, according to The Times and
              The Independent of 2nd July 1998, that he was so “desperate” at the decision to bring a
              private prosecution which, if it failed, would prevent for all time a prosecution of the
              youths, that he “collapsed in the street”. We enclose copies of the articles, from which
              it is clear that the Crown Prosecution Service considered that there was no proper
              basis for the prosecution at all.

              Nonetheless, the CPS did not then take over and discontinue the prosecution. We
              have some difficulty in reconciling that decision with the criterion you set out at the
              foot of the second page of your letter, namely, that you would take over and
              discontinue if “There is clearly no case to answer” . We would have far greater
              difficulty in understanding how you could apply such a test in the present case, given
              the findings o f Lord Taylor, so emphatically reinforced by the recent “Scrutiny"’ when
              there is clearly, applying the Adomako, test a powerful “case to answer7’.

               The criteria fo r discontinuance: “public interest fa cto rs",

      4        If there is sufficiency of evidence, we should be grateful if you could tell us what
               “public interest factors” might impel you to take oyer and discontinue a prosecution.
               The history of case,'reinforced by the recent conduct of the defendants, suggests that
               every technical and delaying device will be employed by them to prevent a criminal
               court from examining these cogent and well-supported allegations. It is not difficult to
               foresee familiar and well-worn “abuse of process” arguments under the following
               headings, to which we make brief observations, relevant to your present decision.

      5        Passage o f time. This surely cannot be a factor of weight. We told you in our last
               letter of the new material that has been disclosed to us in the last year. Regularly
               prosecutions take place where relevant events have occurred much longer ago than the
               Hillsborough Disaster. For example, there are a number of cases of alleged sexual
               abuse, prosecuted by the CPS, in whish complainants have waited many years, even
               decades, before laying their complaints before the police. The War Crimes Act deals
               with alleged crimes committed between fifty and sixty years ago. There are fraud
               cases which take place ten years and more after the events complained of, and after
               long and sometimes slow investigation. The CPS has been known to argue in the
               Divisional Court that extraditions arising out of events many years ago should not be
               prevented as being unjust and oppressive on the grounds of passage of time. What
                criteria do you apply to alleged delay?. If you tell us, I hope we can respond. We
               know of no cases in which you have discontinued on grounds of delay: and no
               reported case of Judicial review in which such criteria have been examined.

      6            Surely the question whether there is delay causing prejudice at trial ought not to be
                   considered by you, but by a Court deciding at an inter partes hearing whether the
                   proceedings are an abuse of process?. Our case will be that all the basic facts of the
                   disaster are clear. No-one will have forgotten them. At an inter partes hearing the
                   parties can call evidence. Skeleton arguments can be considered. Oral arguments can
                   be tested by a court with M sight o f the committal evidence. The “abuse of process”
                   authorities are well-known and do not need to be cited here, but you will be aware that
                   the courts and House of Lords have said, over and over again, that a case should be
                   stopped at court on this basis only in the most exceptional cases.


      7        Health Mr Duckenfield escaped disciplinary hearings brought against him by the Policc
               Complaints Authority for neglect of duty on the grounds of “ill-health”. It was then
               thought unfair to prosecute Mr Murray. It was obviously believed that evidence of
               negligence existed against both and the Police Complaints Authority must have
               considered that the evidence of negligence could be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
               Given the Home office disclosures as to police retirements on health grounds, only the
               most naive person w ould accept at face value a statement or written evidence, untested
               in cross-examination or by further scrutiny that Mr Duckenfield ought not to be tried
               for such a reason.

          S       Publicity. We doubt whether you would consider that the publicity that has arisen in
                  the case is a reason why you should interfere: it would be a most dangerous precedent
                  to discontinue a prosecution on this ground. Again, we know of no case in which this
                  has happened or indeed any case in which it has been conceded by the prosecution in
                  court that it should not proceed for this reason­

                  ing criteria fo r discontinuance: “ likely to damage the interests ofjustice "

          9       We do not understand what, if anything, this adds to the “public interest factors”
                  criterion.

                  11ie relevance o f previous investigations

          10      Obviously the history of the investigations is relevant to j ^ur decision. We would
                  argue that even if there was no hint of controversy about them, there would
                  justification for intervening to discontinue. However as I set out in out!; -
                  previous letter, the Group suspects that the CPS was given income1                       n
                   1990. The Group is becoming increasingly disturbed by what v-             .     as more
                  and more gapers are revealed to us. Our purpose in a?'                 jur previous
                  papers, and those held by the two police forces ano                . gain necessary
                  access to original evidence, whether we have see--              ; not. We believe that
                  there is much more evidence, previously concealcd from the Group, w h v ;           cctly
                  relevant to gross negligence issue, and which is probative of guilt of tl-w charges laid, in
                  the possession of the police in South Yorkshire, and West Midlands. We also believe
                  that provision of this information will enable us to prove that the decision in 1990 was
                  taken on a false basis and on the basis of absence of full and frank disclosure,

          u       The task that you have embarked upon of considering whether you have seen all
                  relevant material is a formidable one. We were supplied by you last year with a
                  "Master Witness List (Alphabetical)” with the name and badge of the "West Midlands
                  Police” on it, and the words “Hillsborough Inquiry”. The beginning of the first page of
                  the alphabetical list is dated 4th April 1990. Leading counsel were instructed by the
                  Director on 16* February 1990, but they did not advise until August. It is reasonable
                  to believe that this “Master Witness List” was the list of statements tendered to
                  counsel. We know in fact that the West Midlands Police took 3,776 statements (and
                  did not take any of the hundreds of statements provided by South Yorkshire police
                  officers: see below). The Master Witness List contains statements from supporters,
                  South Yorkshire police and many others.

                  We have recently been examining and selecting witness statements from those that
                  have come into our possession in the last year for the purpose of compiling a
                  committal bundle. We have selected a group of 35 spectators who give clear
                  evidential support to Lord Taylor’s findings as to the “blunder on opening the gates"1
                  and provide further evidence pointing clearly to the guilt of the two defendants.

               13       Leading counsel then checked that list against the “Master Witness List” and
                        discovered that of those 35 only 6 were in the Master Witness List, only 8 were called
                        at the inquest, and only 2 at the Taylor Enquiry, although with a few exceptions their
                        statements were taken in April, May, June 1989.

               14       We suspect the DPP was not supplied with these statements. We enclose for your
                        information a copy of a letter written to the Director on 5th February 1990. It appears
                        that copies of some statements were made available to solicitors acting for some of the
                        injured and the bereaved relatives, but we do not know the extent of this. We invite
                        you to tell us. However it appears also that the Director put a stop to this practice on
                        the ground that the police were investigating potentially “every individual who was at
                        the ground”.

               15       We have therefore concluded that many of the witness statements sent would have
                        been said to be relevant to misconduct by supporters as well as police. Is this why the
                        Master Witness List was compiled?.

                         The two sets o f South Yorkshire Police statements

               16       In my last letter I referred to unsworn statements made by South Yorkshire police
                        officers and sent to us by the Home Office this year. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
                         comments upon this subject in his report. It is clear from Appendix 8 that two sets of
                         statements were made. The first were “of immense value to our [South Yorkshire
                        Police’s] counsel” who was representing their interests in civil and no doubt other
                         areas. However, since they contained “comment and opinion” amendments were
                         made: but the second letter shows that leading counsel to the Taylor enquiry had no
                         objection at all to receiving written statements containing comment (The letters are
                         attached).

               17       Astonishingly, there appears to have been a "personal undertaking” given by the West
                        Midlands Police to South Yorkshire Police that the original statements would not be
                        used. Neither I nor counsel has ever before come across a case in which statements
                        are obtained by an allegedly impartial investigator who is prohibited by an
                        “undertaking” from presenting them to a tribunal.

               18       We believe that the Director was therefore given the edited statements. Lord Justice
                        Stuart-Smith comments on these statements at Chapter 4, pages 77-84, but he seems
                        to accept at paragraph 105 that the Director did not have the unedited statements.
                        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says very little about the material in your possession in
                        1990.

               19       The Group knew virtually nothing about the South Yorkshire statements until after the
                        Report was published. We have now had an opportunity to go through all the
                        statements in much greater detail than, clearly, was placed before Lord Justice Stuart-
                        Smith. The situation is appalling. Dozens of statements omit crucial statements of
                        fact, relevant to the question of negligence. We were not surprised to see that,
                        although many edited statements went to the Taylor Enquiry and, presumably, to the

                                                                4

                    Director, very few of the witnesses who had made such edited statements were called
                    as witnesses to the enquiry or at the Inquest, where they might be cross-examined.

           20       We are preparing a detailed report on the editing, but the attached statement of Chief
                    Inspector Bettison, which was obviously not placed before the “Scrutiny^nor before
                    the Director in 1990, is in itself a deeply disturbing example. See the comments about
                    the responsibility for monitoring the pens at the end of page 3, a critical issue on the
                    question of negligence, and the responsibility of the police and the two defendants. Is
                    there any indication at all in the 1990 material at the Director's office that Counsel
                    advise knew that this “clarification was going on, or had taken place.

                     The Phillips Report

           21       We do not know whether this document was presented to the Director of Public
                    Prosecutions. It is a report commissioned by the South Yorkshire Police from the
                    Devon and Cornwall Police allegedly for the purpose of civil proceedings. The Group
                    has been deeply concerned to hear that, whilst the South Yorkshire Police statements
                    were not made public (except to the extent that the edited versions were given to the
                    Taylor Enquiry), the South Yorkshire Police had clearly been given access by the West
                    Midlands Police to the statements provided by the Liverpool supporters for use in
                    private litigation. Why was such a different policy adopted than was used towards the
                    Liverpool families?.

                     The needfo r early disclosure

           22       These matters make it clear why we wish to see all statements and exhibits in your
                     possession. It will take you weeks or months to make a proper audit of the papers.
                     The statements you have must include statements directly relevant to the offences
                     alleged which we have not seen, and to which we, as prosecutors, are entitled.

           23       In addition, we need to protect ourselves against an abuse of process application, as
                     well as the present application made by the defendants to you, based on an argument
                     that previous authorities have examined all the relevant material.

           24       We see no reason why you should not supply us with material quickly. We have to go
                    to court on 20th August and will be expected to inform the magistrate o f progress. In
                    the Lawrence case, w e read that Mr Youngerwood immediately made his papers
                    available to the solicitor for the prosecutors. Why is this case different?.

                     The Director's advice to the South Yorkshire Police

           25       I have to say that, given the controversy surrounding the South Yorkshire Police and

                     the Director should be offering advice to that force. It has patently looked not for
                     justice in this case, but to the need to protect itself and its senior officers above all
                     other considerations. Surely, when the Director of Public Prosecutions has found no

                    Would it not be better that they should be advised by Hammond Suddards who have
                    acted for that force in the past and told us earlier this month that they act for them
                    now?.

      26            I should be grateful to know whether you have passed a copy of my last letter to the
                    defendants. What are the ground rules?. For our part, we do not mind if you pass a
                    copy of our correspondence to the defendant’s solicitors, provided of course that we
                    see copies of their letters to you.


       27           I look forward to your reply. I suggest that there is no need for you to devote serious
                    and long consideration to the possibility of taking the wholly exceptional course of
                    intervening to stop the prosecution. There are no grounds. If you were to consider
                    depriving the Group unreasonably of its statutory right to prosecute, however, I
                    respectfully suggest that it would be a further wrong to do so before you had
                    completely allayed all the doubts on the matters we have discovered, and continue to
                    discover, about the previous investigations, if it is possible to do so.

       Dear Sirs

       Adlmpton v Murray Adlineton v Duckenfield

       The purpose of this letter is to request to you as a matter of urgency to make available the
       original papers and copies in the possession of your clients in relation to the Hillsborough
       disaster to both the prosecution and defence; alternatively, at the very least, to release them as
       soon as possible to some neutral third party.

       The HSFG is becoming increasingly concerned that all original papers are in the custody of the
       South Yorkshire Police. Such papers as we have received from the Home Office in the last
       year have led us to believe that the South Yorkshire Police adopted a deliberate policy of
       withholding material and not revealing facts as disclosed by its junior officers in their first
       statements after the disaster.

       We have received both edited and unedited versions o f the statements o f the South Yorkshire
       Police officers. The process of omitting material facts extending patently beyond that
       suggested in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report, and makes us suspect that he was misled in
       the course o f Ms “Scrutiny”. We are in the process of preparing a detailed analysis.

       We have also received in the last year statements from spectators whose identities were
       completely unknown to us before. Most of these statements were not on the Master Witness
       List o f statements submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1990 and most of these
       witnesses were not called at the Inquest. We suspect the DPP was given an unbalanced
       account o f the evidence.

       We invite you to explain by what legal process the West Midlands Police entrusted all the
       original papers, including copies of the West Midlands Police report and the advice of leading
       counsel on the subject of prosecutions to a force that was under suspicion and itself had
       admitted negligence? Why should the papers be in the possession of the South Yorkshire
       Police at all?

We have seen a copy of a document called the “Phillips Report”. This is not the occasion to
comment upon it. We do, however, request you to explain to us how material that appears to
have been collected by the West Midlands Police came to be in the possession of the South
Yorkshire Police in 1990 in order that Mr Phillips might be invited to deliver his opinions upon
it?

Assistant C h ie f Constable Dames has already expressed the opinion publically that “ I t is hard
to imagine a private prosecution getting beyond the firs t hurdle” , Is it right in these
circumstances, that he should make, o r be party to decisions about the disclosure to the
prosecutor o f the m aterial in his possession at a tim e when the very existence o f the
prosecution is under challenge.

We invite you to agree, without, of course, the slightest admission o f impropriety, that the
papers should no longer remain in the custody of the South Yorkshire Police. Justice must be
seen to be done. The South Yorkshire .Police have an obvious interest in the outcome of the
prosecution, and there is at the very least a temptation to keep shrouded in secrecy relevant
documentation, especially if it casts the force in a dubious light.

Even if our suspicions are unfounded it is obviously in the interests of all parties to have
simultaneous access to the archive. There may be material exculpating the defendants We
note that the South Yorkshire Police accepted publically the findings of Lord Taylor It must,
therefore, take the position, as Lord Taylor did, as a central finding that the failure to arrange
for the diversion of the supporters from the central pens when the gates were opened was “a
blunder o f the first magnitude”, and the immediate cause of the disaster.

We ask you to explain therefore how it is appropriate that South Yorkshire Police continue to
hold the papers when it has associated itself without reserve with an inquiry which has blamed
at least one of the defendants, acting on its behalf, so comprehensively?

We refer to our letter o f 20* July to Mr Daines requesting the addresses of police officers with
whom we wish to speak. There is no possible bona fide reason why the DPP's review should
prevent you from supplying this information. How can it be contrary to the interests of justice
to give us these addresses so we can progress matters?

The argument that you will no nothing until the DPP has made a decision to take over the
prosecution is unreasonable in these circumstances. We invite you to reply positively to this
letter before the end o f the week, or we shall apply for a witness summons directed to Mr
Daines requiring the production of all relevant documents. If there is another suitable person
on whom the summons should be served, please let us know before 5 pm on Friday 14
August.

Yours faithfully

     Dear Mr Metcalf

     Hillsborough Stadium Disaster: Private Prosecutions

     Thank you for your 24 page fax of 13 August 1998.

     I agree that we should continue to decline to release material to any of the parties
     (Duckenfield, Murray, Adlington). I recently responded to Winckworth Pemberton in these
     terms; I should have done that through you. I apologise for that oversight and attach a
     copy of the relevant letters.

     I am content for CPS to copy to HFSG any letters that you or I send to CPS.

     I agree that we should reply to HFSG that our policy will continue, ie no release until the
     DPP’s review is complete. I also agree that we should make a simple statement that we do
     not accept the points they make. I have come to the conclusion that it is futile to try to
fe   convince the HFSG of our bona fides so I do not think we should contemplate doing so now
     or later. Also, I am not inclined to rush to reply merely to meet their arbitrarily selected
     deadline. Please reply at your convenience, on my behalf, to the letter.

     Thank you for the offer of coming to Sheffield today but I am rather tied up today. I have
     some time free next week so a meeting might be useful. Please ring my secretary (Miss
                      Ind she will make the necessary arrangements.

     Yours sincerely

 Dear Sirs

 Hillsborough Documentation

 Thank you for your letter of 12 August 1998.

 We must advert directly to the final paragraph of your letter. Neither we nor our clients accept that
 it is “unreasonable” to obtain guidance from the DPP and, having obtained that guidance, to follow
 it.

 That policy will continue to be applied impartially to prosecutor, Defendants and to any other party
 seeking information or documents until the CPS review is completed and the decision of the DPP
 known.

 The other points made in your letter (which are not accepted) would in any event only become
 matters for consideration if the prosecutions are to proceed.

 Yours faithfully



 HAMMOND SUDDARDS

 Dear Ian

 Adlington -v- David Duckenfield

 I thank you for your letter of 10th August and note the position regarding the archives.

 I am enclosing an authority from David Duckenfield relating to his occupational and
 employment records, including any medical records and the like relating thereto.

 Accordingly, I would be grateful if you could make available the relevant files, which I
 presume will not be part of the Hillsborough archives. You will appreciate that these files
 relate to his medical condition, and the reasons for his retirement from the Force, and I would
 be very grateful if we could have access at the earliest opportunity.

 If there is any difficulty about this please do not hesitate to let me know, and naturally we
 will pay any consequential costs in regard to the request.

 I am also enclosing copies o f the HFSG letter of 10th August 1998 relating to the prosecution,
 the letters enclosed therewith and an outline of the index of the bundle we have been served
 with.

 In addition I am enclosing herewith copy of the CPS letter of 11th August 1998 and the
 enclosures thereto.

 I am naturally continuing to liaise with Counsel, and Richard Manning of Walker Morris as
 to the appropriate form of responses to the HFSG, and I can confirm that we intend to appear
 at the Leeds Magistrates Court on Thursday 20th August, together with Paul Isaacs of
 Counsel, to respond to the Summons.

 Yours sincerely

        Dear Sirs

        Adlington v Duckenfield Adlington v Murray

        Please find enclosed, in answer to your letter of 7 August, a copy of the information and
        supporting documents sent to the Leeds magistrates court when application was made for
        summonses.

        We have been told that you have asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to take over the
        case, and to discontinue it. We have written letters to the Director, about this, and have
        authorised the supply to you of copies, provided that we receive copies o f your letters to her

        We propose to serve you before 20 August with copies of witness statements, and also
        transcripts of the evidence given at the Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest by Mr Duckenfield and
        Mr Murray We shall offer this as an indication of some, but only some, of the witnesses who
        we currently propose to rely upon at committal.

        You will notice that the authors of most of those witness statements were not called at the
        Inquest nor before the Taylor Inquiry. We know that most of these were not contained in the
        master witness list supplied to the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1990. Their statements
        came to us in the course of the “Scrutiny” conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, or have
        come to us because their makers have made contact with us of their own initiative, told us for
        the first time of their existence, and authorised the South Yorkshire Police to disclose their
        statements to us.

  At present, we cannot sensibly serve you with further material, because the South Yorkshire
  Police decline to hand over to us the material in their possession. They suggest that they are
    Jdng the “advice” of the Director of Public Prosecutions. We enclose copies of the relevant
  correspondence. The Director’s position is that she will not hand over any o f the material in
  her possession at this stage until she has decided whether or not to take over and discontinue
  the prosecution. We see no point in serving you with copies of the transcripts o f evidence of
  witnesses, as opposed to defendants, called before Lord Taylor or by the Coroner, when we
  are seeking copies of their formal witness statements

  We understand that not only have the South Yorkshire Police custody o f all the original
  statements, sworn or unsworn, edited or unedited, and all the exhibits, but they also have a
  copy of the police report which was prepared by the West Midlands Police for the Director of
  Public Prosecutions, and the written advice of leading counsel to the Director in 1990 on the
  subject of criminal prosecutions! This is not the occasion to argue about the propriety of this
  but it is undoubtedly a difficulty facing both prosecution and defence.

   We desire to see this archive because it is obvious that it will certainly contain material which
   is directly relevant to issues which will arise in the criminal proceedings. Since many
   statements have come to us in the last year of which we previously knew nothing there can be
   no doubt that there will be many more such statements.

   We should also tell you that we believe that the South Yorkshire Police have withheld
   evidence pointing to the negligence of their own senior officers, and such evidence would be
   directly relevant, of course, to the allegations in the current criminal proceedings. We offer
   the following matter as an example of this alleged conduct.

   After the publication of the report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith the Home Office made public
   copies of numerous edited and unedited statements made by South Yorkshire Police officers.
   We are conducting a thorough review of these statements, but already we have come across
   dozens of examples where statements of fact were removed from the unsworn statements of
   officers before their final, sanitised, versions were provided, to among others, the Taylor
   Inquiry, the Press, the Coroner and the Director of Public Prosecutions. We have found so
   many instances that we suspect that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith may not have been fully
   informed on this subject before reporting on it after his “Scrutiny”.

   Against this background, we propose to apply for a witness summons directed to Mr Ian
   Daines Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police to produce witness statements
   and exhibits if he does not disclose them voluntarily.

   We raise these matters not just to explain the delay in supplying you with comprehensive
   bundles of papers but also in order to invite you to support us in our application that all
   relevant papers be disclosed. We invite you to write to Mr Daines accordingly and send us a
   copy of your letter. The papers might be kept, after disclosure, in the custody of some agreed
   neutral third party (not being the West Midlands Police) until originals were tendered to the
   court as required, and while inspection by all parties and copying took place. It must surely be
   in the interests o f both the prosecution and defence, and is consistent with all the modern
   Court of Appeal and House of Lords authorities on disclosure, that all relevant material is

                                                  -   2   -

   revealed, and the sooner the better. You may also perhaps consider that early disclosure
   might assist your current application to the Director.

   We should be grateful for a reply at your earliest convenience We are sending a copy of this
   letter to the solicitors to Mr Murray, and to Mr Croston at the York office o f the Director of
   Public Prosecutions.

       Dear Sirs,

       RE:        HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY

       I enclose a copy of the letter dated 31 July 1998 from the Legal Advisor to the Hillsborough
       Family Support group.

       In correspondence with HFSG, I have indicated that the Crown Prosecution Service intends
       to be as fair and open in its handling of this matter as possible. They have indicated that
       they have no objection to disclosure of their correspondence to us, provided they are supplied
       with copies of correspondence to the CPS from die solicitors for the defendants and South
       Yorkshire Police.

       I propose to supply them with copies unless you indicate that you object to doing so.



       Yours faithfully,

              Thank you for your letter of 27th July. You do not invite a reply of substance, but we
              wish to deal with some of the issues you raise. Obviously,, you do not "wish to conduct
              an elaborate trial of the issues involved, taking evidence and representations from the
              prosecution and defence in turn, before making a decision. Neither does the
              Hillsborough Family Support Group, but I ask you to bear the following matters in
              mind.

               The Criteria fo r discontinuance: insufficiency,

     2        In my last letter I set out the basis on which we had brought the prosecutions. In
               contrast to this case, you will know that the prosecution of the youths who were
               alleged to have killed Stephen Lawrence in London was brought on an apparently
               speculative basis with little supporting evidence. At the public enquiry into that case,
               Mr Youngerwood o f the Crown prosecution Service said, according to The Times and
               The Independent o f 2nd July 1998, that he was so “desperate” at the decision to bring a
               private prosecution which, if it failed, would prevent for all time a prosecution of the
               youths, that he “collapsed in the street”. We enclose copies of the articles, from which
               it is clear that the Crown Prosecution Service considered that there was no proper
               basis for the prosecution at all,

     3        Nonetheless, the CPS did not then take over and discontinue the prosecution. We
              have some difficulty in reconciling that decision with the criterion you set out at the
              foot of the second page o f your letter, namely, that you would take over and
              discontinue if “There is clearly no case to answer”. We would have far greater
              difficulty Ln understanding how you could apply such a test in the present case, given
              the findings o f Lord Taylor, so emphatically reinforced by the recent “Scrutiny"’ when
              there is clearly, applying the Adomako, test a powerful “case to answer”.

       The criteria fo r discontinuance: "public interest fa cto rs’’.

4      If there is sufficiency of evidence, we should be grateful if you could tell us what
        “public interest factors” might impel you to take oyer and discontinue a prosecution.
        The history o f case, reinforced by the recent conduct o f the defendants, suggests that
        every technical and delaying device will be employed by them to prevent a criminal
        court from examining these cogent and well-supported allegations. It is not difficult to
        foresee familiar and well-worn “abuse o f process” arguments under the following
        headings, to which we make brief observations, relevant to your present decision.

5      Passage o f time This surely cannot be a factor of weight. We told you in our last
        letter of the new material that has been disclosed to us in the last year. Regularly
        prosecutions take place where relevant events have occuiTed much longer ago than the
        Hillsborough Disaster. For example, there are a number of cases o f alleged sexual
        abuse, prosecuted by the CPS, in whish complainants have waited many years, even
        decades, before laying their complaints before the police. The War Crimes Act deals
        with alleged crimes committed between fifty and sixty years ago. There are fraud
        cases which take place ten years and more after the events complained o£ and after
        long and sometimes slow investigation. The CPS has been known to argue in the
        Divisional Court that extraditions arising out of events many years ago should not be
        prevented as being unjust and oppressive on the grounds of passage o f time. What
        criteria do you apply to alleged delay?. If you tell us, I hope we can respond. We
        know of no cases in which you have discontinued on grounds o f delay: and no
        reported case o f Judicial review in which such criteria have been examined.

        Surely the question whether there is delay causing prejudice at trial ought not to be
        considered by you, but by a Court deciding at an inter partes hearing whether the
        proceedings are an abuse of process?. Our case will be that all the basic facts of the
        disaster are clear. No-one will have forgotten them. At an inter partes hearing the
        parties can call evidence. Skeleton arguments can be considered. Oral arguments can
        be tested by a court with full sight of the committal evidence. The “abuse of process”
        authorities are well-known and do not need to be cited here, but you will be aware that
        the courts and House o f Lords have said , over and over again, that a case should be
        stopped at court on this basis only in the most exceptional cases.


       Health Mr Duckenfield escaped disciplinary hearings brought against him by the Police
       Complaints Authority for neglect of duty on the grounds of “ill-health”. It was then
       thought unfair to prosecute Mr Murray. It was obviously believed that evidence of
       negligence existed against both and the Police Complaints Authority must have
       considered that the evidence o f negligence could be proved beyond reasonable doubt
       Given the Home office disclosures as to police retirements on health grounds, only the
       most naive person would accept at face value a statement or written evidence, untested
       in cross-examination or by further scrutiny that Mr Duckenfield ought not to be tried
       for such a reason.

Publicity. We doubt whether you would consider that the publicity that has arisen in
the case is a reason why you should interfere: it would be a most dangerous precedent
to discontinue a prosecution on this ground. Again, we know of no case in which this
has happened or indeed any case in which it has been conceded by the prosecution in
court that it should not proceed for this reason.

The criteria fo r discontinuance: “ likely to damage the interests afjustice "

We do not understand what, if anything, this adds to the “public interest factors”
criterion.

The relevance o f previous investigations

Obviously the history of the investigations is relevant to yuur u-.oision. We would
argue that even if there was no hint of controversy about them, there would H ™
justification for intervening to discontinue. However as I set out in out1:
previous letter, the Group suspects that the CPS was given income1
 1990. The Group is becoming increasingly disturbed by what v.                ..ug as more
 and more papers are revealed to us. Our purpose in a:-'               our previous
papers, and those held by the two police forces aru:                  gain necessary
 access to original evidence, whether we have see-              ; not. We bcM". • hat
there is much more evidence, previously concealca from the Group, wN                  or!v
 relevant to gross negligence issue, and which is probative o f guilt of the charges laid, in
the possession of the police in South Yorkshire, and West Midlands. We also believe
that provision of this information will enable us to prove that the decision in 1990 was
taken on a false basis and on the basis of absence of full and frank disclosure.

The task that you have embarked upon of considering whether you have seen all
relevant material is a formidable one. We were supplied by you last year with a
“Master Witness List (Alphabetical)” with the name and badge of the “West Midlands
Police” on it, and the words “Hillsborough Inquiry”. The beginning of the first page of
the alphabetical list is dated 4* April 1990. Leading counsel were instructed by the
Director on 16* February 1990, but they did not advise until August. It is reasonable
to believe that this "Master Witness List57was the list of statements tendered to
counsel. We know in fact that the West Midlands Police took 3,776 statements (and
did not take any of the hundreds of statements provided by South Yorkshire police
officers; see below). The Master Witness List contains statements from supporters,
South Yorkshire police and many others.

We have recently been examining and selecting witness statements from those that
have come into our possession in the last year for the purpose of compiling a
committal bundle. We have selected a group of 35 spectators who give clear
evidential support to Lord Taylor’s findings as to the “blunder on opening the gates”
and provide further evidence pointing clearly to the guilt of the two defendants.

       13       Leading counsel then checked that list against the “Master Witness List” and
                discovered that of those 35 only 6 were in the Master Witness List, only 8 were called
                at the inquest, and only 2 at the Taylor Enquiry, although with a few exceptions their
                statements were taken in April, May, June 1989.

       14       We suspect the DPP was not supplied with these statements. We enclose for your
                information a copy of a letter written to the Director on 5* February 1990. It appears
                that copies of some statements were made available to solicitors acting for some of the
                injured and the bereaved relatives, but we do not know the extent of this. We invite
                you to tell us. However it appears also that the Director put a stop to this practice on
                the ground that the police were investigating potentially “every individual who was at
                the ground”.

       15       We have therefore concluded that many of the witness statements sent would have
                been said to be relevant to misconduct by supporters as well as police. Is this why the
                Master Witness List was compiled?.

                 The two sets o f South Yorkshire Police statements

       16       In my last letter I referred to unsworn statements made by South Yorkshire police
                 officers and sent to us by the Home Office this year. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
                 comments upon this subject in his report. It is clear from Appendix 8 that two sets of
                 statements were made. The first were “of immense value to our [South Yorkshire
                 Police’s] counsel” who was representing their interests in civil and no doubt other
                 areas. However, since they contained “comment and opinion” a m e n d m e n t s were
                 made: but the second letter shows that leading counsel to the Tayior enquiry had no
                 objection at all to receiving written statements containing comment (The letters are
                 attached),

       17       Astonishingly, there appears to have been a “personal undertaking” given by the West
                Midlands Police to South Yorkshire Police that the original statements would not be
                 used. Neither I nor counsel has ever before come across a case in which statements
                 are obtained by an allegedly impartial investigator who is prohibited by an
                 "undertaking” from presenting them to a tribunal.

       18       We believe that the Director was therefore given the edited statements. Lord Justice
                Stuart’Smith comments on these statements at Chapter 4, pages 77-84, but he seems
                to accept at paragraph 105 that the Director did not have the unedited statements
                Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says very little about the material in your possession in
                1990.

       19       The Group knew virtually nothing about the South Yorkshire statements until after the
                Report was published. We have now had an opportunity to go through all the
                statements in much greater detail than, clearly, was placed before Lord Justice Stuart-
                Smith. The situation is appalling. Dozens of statements omit crucial statements of
                fact, relevant to the question of negligence. We were not surprised to see that,
                although many edited statements went to the Taylor Enquiry and, presumably, to the

                                                        4

               Director, very few of the witnesses who had made such edited statements were called
               as witnesses to the enquiry or at the Inquest, where they might be cross-examined.

      20      We are preparing a detailed report on the editing, but the attached statement of Chief
              Inspector Bettison, which was obviously not placed before the “Scmtiny”nor before
              the Director in 1990, is in itself a deeply disturbing example. See the comments about
              the responsibility for monitoring the pens at the end o f page 3, a critical issue on the
              question of negligence, and the responsibility of the police and the two defendants. Is
              there any indication at all in the 1990 material at the Director’s office that Counsel
              advise knew that this “clarification was going on, or had taken place.

               The Phillips Report

       21     We do not know whether this document was presented to the Director of Public
              Prosecutions. It is a report commissioned by the South Yorkshire Police from the
              Devon and Cornwall Police allegedly for the purpose o f civil proceedings. The Group
              has been deeply concerned to hear that, whilst the South Yorkshire Police statements
              were not made public (except to the extent that the edited versions were given to the
              Taylor Enquiry), the South Yorkshire Police had clearly been given access by the West
              Midlands Police to the statements provided by the Liverpool supporters for use in
              private litigation. Why was such a different policy adopted than was used towards the
              Liverpool families?.

               The need fo r early disclosure

       22     These matters make it clear why we wish to see all statements and exhibits in your
               possession. It will take you weeks or months to make a proper audit of the papers
               The statements you have must include statements directly relevant to the offences
              alleged which we have not seen, and to which we, as prosecutors, are entitled.

       23     In addition, we need to protect ourselves against an abuse of process application, as
               well as the present application made by the defendants to you, based on an argument
               that previous authorities have examined all the relevant material.

       24     We see no reason why you should not supply us with material quickly. We have to go
              to court on 20* August and will be expected to inform the magistrate of progress In
              the Lawrence case, we read that Mr Youngerwood immediately made his papers
              available to the solicitor for the prosecutors. Why is this case different?.

               The Director’s advice to the South Yorkshire Police

       25     I have to say that, given the controversy surrounding the South Yorkshire Police and
               its approach to the collection and editing of evidence, we regard it as surprising that
               the Director should be offering advice to that force. It has patently looked not for
              justice in this case, but to the need to protect itself and its senior officers above all
               other considerations, Surely, when the Director of Public Prosecutions has found no
               sufficient evidence of any crime, it is inappropriate to say that you can advise the South

               Would it not be better that they should be advised by Hammond Suddards who have
               acted for that force in the past and told us earlier this month that they act for them

               copy of our correspondence to the defendant’s solicitors, provided of course that we
               see copies of their letters to you.

               and long consideration to the possibility of taking the wholly exceptional course of
               intervening to stop the prosecution. There are no grounds. If you were to consider
               depriving the Group unreasonably of its statutory right to prosecute, however, 1
               respectfully suggest that it would be a further wrong to do so before you had
               completely allayed all the doubts on the matters we have discovered, and continue to
               discover, about the previous investigations, if it is possible to do so.

      Yours Sincerely

 Dear Ian

 Hillsborough Prosecutions

 Following our meeting on Tuesday and my telephoned report of the outcome of today’s proceedings
 at Leeds Magistrates Court, I enclose copies of :-

 1.          My letter dated 19 August 1998 to the Clerk to the Justices relating to the threat to issue a
             Witness Summons;

 2.          A further communication received from the HFSG dated 19 August 1998;

 3.          My letter to Bernard Murray’s solicitors declining to recommend any alteration in policy as
             regards provision of documentation.

At the hearing today the Prosecutor stated that he was not ready to proceed and also mentioned the
CPS review and the possibility of this leading to intervention. On those grounds alone the hearing
was adjourned to 30 October 1998, although it was also indicated that if the case does proceed and
there is to be an old style committal dates of 7 - 17 December 1998 have been set aside.

Our representative found himself sat amongst the families in the public gallery and was not in a
position to take a verbatim note. However, I am told that the Prosecutor did make reference to the
Hillsborough archive and the possibility that he would on 30 October 1998 be seeking a Witness
Summons for production of the documentation. He also referred to the “editing” of witness
statements and suggested that this may have caused the DPP and the Coroner to have been misled in

their earlier decisions about tha case. The Magistrate apparently indicated that it was not for him to
make any comment on these points.

The Defence were asked whet ner it was their intention to argue that the issue of process at this stage
amounted to abuse of the process of the Court. Richard Manning on behalf of Bernard Murray said
that that might well be argued but it was not being advanced today.

My understanding is that reporting restrictions were not lifted although it seems that there were
television cameras outside the Court which leaves me uncertain as to whether restrictions were lifted
at some other time although I would be surprised if this was the case.

I do not think there are any further major issues to address at this point although I have received a
copy of a letter from Simon Eastwood requesting the release of David Duckenfield’s personnel file.
Clearly this is not part of the Hillsborough archive as such and therefore there should be no problems
about disclosing it. However, I am still slightly uneasy about this simply because it could be
presented as breaching the stated policy of impartiality and awaiting the outcome of the CPS review.

On the whole however I think this is a defensible distinction and if it would be your policy to provide
such documentation on request in other circumstances (as I assume it probably would) then I think
that that policy should be followed here.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or indeed if you would like me to have a
word with Simon Eastwood informally in the hope of persuading him to postpone the request until
the outcome of the CPS review is known.

Finally, I do not think that the further letter from the HFSG calls for any reply.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Sir

 Addlington -v- Duckenfield
 Addlington -v- Murray
 Hearing : 20 August 1998

 We have been instructed by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire in relation to the above
 prosecutions, which relate to the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

 The Chief Constable has custody of a very substantial archive of papers relating to the disaster.

 Both the Prosecutor and the Defendants have sought access to this archive of documents.

 The Chief Constable has sought guidance from the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to S.
 3(2Xe) Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. The response has been that the Crown Prosecution
 Service are conducting a review in order to decide whether the Director should intervene to take
 over these prosecutions. The guidance to the Chief Constable is that he may wish to delay any
 voluntary disclosure of the archive until the CPS review has been completed and the decision of the
 DPP is known.

 The Chief Constable has determined to follow that guidance. That decision has been communicated
 both the Prosecutor and to the Defendants.

 Since that communication we have received a letter from a Mr Keva Coombes, apparently on behalf
 of the Prosecutor, renewing a request for access to “the original papers and copies in the possession
 of your clients in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster”. The letter concludes:

      “We invite you reply positively to this letter before the end o f the week or we shall
      apply fo r a Witness Summons directed to M r Daines requiring the production o f all
      relevant documents”.

Mr Daines is the Assistant Chief Constable charged with the responsibility of dealing with this matter
on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police.

Having considered the letter with our clients we have replied to the effect that the Chief Constable’s
decision remains unchanged.

We do not know whether any application for a Witness Summons has been made. We have carefully
considered the terms of S. 97 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the various High Court
decisions made on cases arising out of the operation of that Section.

We should say that there are many thousands of documents in the archive and while some items will
no doubt be relevant to the present prosecutions it must also be the case that some will not.

On our consideration particularly of the case of R -v- Greenwich Juvenile Court Ex Parte
Greenwich London Borough Council [1977] 76LGR99 a person seeking a Witness Summons for
the purpose of brining documents before the Court must be able to justify the production of each
individual document by reference to its relevance to the case. Further, it is clear from R -v- Sheffield
Justices Ex Parte Wrigley [1985] RTR78 that a Witness Summons cannot be issued to compel an
attendance except when the justices intend to proceed with a hearing, whether by way of committal
or summary Trial.

We would respectfully submit that it would be inappropriate for any Witness Summons to be issued,
directed either to Mr Daines or to the Chief Constable requiring production of the Hillsborough
documents at Court.

We would respectfully submit that if an Application for the issue of such a Summons be received it
would be appropriate for the Justices to adjourn the matter, provide a copy of the Application to
ourselves and to convene a hearing at which representations on behalf of the Chief Constable could
be advanced.

Yours faithfully



HAMMOND SUDDARDS

 Dear Richard

 Bernard M urray

 Thank you for your letter of 11 August 1998. I have also received a copy of your letter of the same
 date addressed to Ian Daines.

 I have to say that I have maintained my advice that the guidance received from the CPS should
 continue to be applied impartially to any requests for documentation from the Hillsborough archives
 until the CPS review is completed and we know whether the DPP will intervene in the prosecutions.

 I am sure you will appreciate that it would be impossible for the Chief Constable to provide
 documentation to the Defendants without at the same time offering access to that documentation to
 the Prosecutor.

 That clearly must apply just as much to documents previously in the possession of Winckworth &
 Pemberton for a different purpose as to all other documents.

 Yours sincerely

Dear Peter

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I attach a letter from                                      and my reply to her. In recent days
we have received about a dozen identical letters.

Keva Coombes is a legal advisor not a solicitor. Should I release the statements at all? If
yes, should I send them to the deponents or to Keva Coombes? Please advise me.

Yours sincerely

Dear Peter

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

I refer to your letter of 20 August 1998. I am obliged to you for the update on what
happened at Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 20 August.

I would prefer not to release any material at all, including David Duckenfield’s personal file. I
agree that it is not disaster related in a direct sense but it would keep life simpler if Simon
Eastwood withdrew that request; could you speak to him for me?

Yours sincerely

           TYPED NOTES OF COURT ATTENDANCE AT LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT

                                                  20 AUGUST 1998

        10.10.am.
       Stipendiary Magistrate: Nigel Cadbury
       Alun Jones QC for Anne Adlington, Informant
       Paul Isaacs for David Duckenfield (Instructed by SBE of Winckworth & Pemberton)
       Richard Manning o f Walker Morris Solicitors for Bernard Murray

       Both Defendants identified and confirming places of residence.

        Charge read.

       AJ:          I will report on events since the Summons was issued. At the end of last week we
                    served on the Defendants tentative committal bundles, the core of the material
                    involving statements from 35 spectators and 3 Police Officers, one o f whom is dead.
                    This is the core of the case but I emphasise that this is tentative because the whole
                    papers, the original copy statements together with videos, etc, are held by South
                    Yorkshire Police (SYP) for whom the Defendants worked in April 1989.

                    It is essential for us to progress the prosecution to get the original statements o f the
                    35 witnesses, and other documentary evidence, such as plans, photos, operational
                    orders, etc. HFSG does not have this, only has a few of the items. It is necessary to
                    consider the type of committal proceedings (and the Defendants know of our position).
                    This is a pre 1996 case because the Police investigation was from 1989 - 1991 - West
                    Midlands Police and South Yorkshire Police. Intermittently the forces have been
                    involved since, and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith conducted a scrutiny in 1997-1998. As
                    we read the 1996 Act, if the Police investigation was commenced before 1st April
                    1997 then the committal must be under the old form, and then we have to establish
                    by oral evidence, sufficient evidence for committal for trial.

                    Before we can sensibly proceed we need the originals of the statements and all the
                    original statements of the West Midlands Police in 1989 which have now been sent
                    to South Yorkshire Police. Last year we were given a witness list by the DPP running
                    to 400-500 names, which apparently formed the basis of the 1990 decision (not to
                    prosecute). We are now aware of more than 10 times that number of statements that
                    were obtained by West Midlands Police, and apparently not sent to the DPP. We
                    question how many were sent to Lord Justice Taylor, how many were considered by
                    the Coroner? We have our core bundle but we want to access all material which we
                    know is directly relevant to the issues.

                    We have written to the South Yorkshire Police Solicitors, Hammond Suddards, on this,
                    but we have been unable to obtain the documentation.

                    The Solicitors for Mr Murray, Walker Morris, asked the DPP to take over the
                    prosecution, ' tervene and discontinue pursuant to the Prosecution of Offences Act,

                 and Winckworth Sc Pemberton Solicitors for Mr Duckenfield have supported that
                 request.

                 The DPP was asked by South Yorkshire Police what to do with the papers. The CPS
                 have offered guidance under the Prosecution of Offences Act, on the basis that they
                 are considering the matter and accordingly, SYP might take the view that it is
                 inappropriate to provide access at the present time. We went to the DPP in London
                 and we are deeply concerned that SYP hold the papers. The DPP said that she
                 understood but it was inappropriate for guidance to be given because the CPS are only
                 considering the matter and are not yet intervening. We have considered an application
                 under Section 97 of the Magistrates Court Act for witness summons directed at lan
                 Daines, Assistant Chief Constable of SYP, to produce documents for inspection.

                 However, since the DPP is not in a position to give guidance, there is an obvious lack
                 of logic in regard to the CPS and we hope to resolve the position without the need to
                 take this course. (His witness summons).

                 Surely the Defendants have the same interest as the prosecution in uncovering the
                 statements of West Midlands Police, because the information my exculpate them.

       SM:       The Defendants have them, then?

       AJ:       No, not now.

                 It seems that an old style committal, pre 1996 is appropriate. If the Defendants are
                 happy for statements to be read, the Prosecution may still wish to call some witnesses
                 live. The Court may wish to consider pencilling in several weeks later in the year for
                 committal proceedings, and a call over date in the near future to see where we are.
                 We don’t know when the DPP will make a decision. Richard Manning o f Walker
                 Morris says that a decision might be made by the 30th September but we have not
                 heard that

       SM:       I can assist here. The CPS have been in contact with the Clerk to the Justices and
                 said that the case worker in York would be able to advise the DPP by the end of
                 September as to his views. I don’t know how written in stone that is, or whether it
                 is guidance.

        AJ:      And then the DPP herself will be involved, and will need time and it may be later in
                 October, so we may not get a decision until late October.

                  Our submission is that we should not await that decision. The DPP can intervene
                  pursuant to Section 6.2 of the BOA "at any stage" (the section read). The significance
                  of this to the Defendant is the capacity under Section 27 to discontinue.

                  That’s how we see the scheme of things. The DPP could take over at any time, and
                  why ghnnlH the proceedings wait until that is done, because it must be in the interests
                  of all parties to have access to all material to make submissions. Now we say, pay
                  no heed to the DPP’s timetable, pencil in the date, and arrange a call over. (In

     SM:      I imagine the Defendants may wish to argue abuse of process and if so, before an old
               style committal is embarked upon. It may be sensible to discuss that.

     RM: The proceedings are relatively straightforward but tragic. Here a prima facie case is
          required. Normally, under Section 6.2 proper statements would be required... it is
          common ground between 1989 and 1991 there was investigation, so it is possible for
          deposition evidence and an old style.

               The prosecution have not served Section 6.2 statements. They say cannot do without
               voluntary disclosure by SYP or witness summons.

      SM:      They could serve the copies now, but they need the originals for the day of the
               committal.

      RM: Yes, so they can’t get to Section 6.2 stage.

               Mr Croyston of the CPS told me this morning his advice as indicated by the Court.
               The representative in York of the CPS will expect to formulate his advice by 30th
               September 1998, and in the meantime, the DPP is not prepared to advise whether the
               papers are to be released. What can the Director do?

               She can discontinue, and if that is the case, the papers will be irrelevant and the
               prosecution’s only option is for judicial review.

               On the other hand if the DPP does not intervene, because she has already made it clear
               that she will not prosecute the case herself, the documents will then be in the public
               domain subject only to Public Interest Immunity.

                   What we say is, where is the need for witness summons when we know that close to
                   the end of September a decision is going to made. The Defendants have no wish to
                   delay a decision - the maximum "justice delayed" is very applicable here. But legal
                   procedures must be complied with.

                   If the Court accedes to the request for mid-September then we are no further forward
                   than today. If you could go to a date in mid October we will know the exact position
                   regarding the DPP, whether it is discontinued or else. It is an issue for the Court to
                   deal with. Depending on the decision, the prosecution can deal with the issue of
                   witness statements as appropriate, and we can consider the arguments in that context.
                   We suggest adjournment to a date when we can reasonably expect to know the DPP
                   decision, and if the CPS will finish their review by 30th September 1998 and the DPP
                   will take say up to a month, perhaps a date at the beginning o f November.

       SM:         What about abuse of process?

       RM:         We have considered this, it is more likely than not that the argument will be taken,
                   if we are left with arguments here it would be sensible to take the point but remains
                   open as to whether it would be taken in this Court or in another place.

       SM.         After we know the DPP view, we need to consider the question of abuse before talk

                     o f a committal.

        RM:          Certainty is needed, and the first certainty we would need to know is the DPP
                     decision.

        PI:          I adopt RM’s submissions.

                     We are concerned that the matter should not be unduly... with respect of 1989 matters
                     and the DPP decision not to bring criminal proceedings in 1990. The prosecution
                     have had considerable time to consider the decision.

                     The Summons was issued on 10th July, it is now only 20th August. My learned
                     friend says, notwithstanding the absence of a large body of material, statements of
                     others will be served not in the kemal, let us fix a tentative date for committal without
                     the Defendants having the opportunity to consider. In the past 8 or 9 years the
                     Defendants have not been preparing for this matter. Only since 10th July, The
                     Defendants will need a long time to consider material which, (according to my learned
                     friend) could amount to as much as 10 times 500 witness statements.

         SM:         One only needs to consider whether the prosecution have made out a prima facie case.

         PI:         O f course but we don’t know how much or how many statements there will be. It is
                     not right that the prosecution "kicks in" and the Defendant is left trailing in their wake
                     to catch up.

                       The second point is regards convenience. Mr Clegg QC wishes to be available at the
                       further hearing, and can be available in the week commencing 26th October (not
                       Wednesday 28th). We would ask you to bear that in mind as not a crucial but
                       important aspect.

                       Senior Counsel can assist better in regard to the question of abuse, but this is a
                       question we have considered and no decision has been taken as to when we will make
                       an application.

         SM:         Have you got Mr Clegg’s dates until the end of the year.

         PI:         No. Not at this stage but we can check as the Court requires.

         SM: What’s going through my mind is that we should make the next date in October, that
             is past the DPS decision, but that we pencil in a week or two later on for the
             committal to be taken if one gets to that stage. I am dealing with the timetable as
             flexibly as possible.

         PI:         There might be a difficulty in terms of leading Counsel squaring diaries. I understand
                      that leading Counsel did speak recently and there was some suggestion they may not
                      be jointly available until the New Year. (AJ shook his head as if to say no that was
                      not the position).

          PI:        Well I will leave the matter there.

       AJ:           I have some further observations. To suggest that the prosecutor has all this time is
                     not true. It is only in the last year that the Home Office has adopted a different policy
                     and the dozens o f witness statements have been disclosed These are unknown to us
                     and the 35 spectator’s (statements served with the bundle) are from that group who
                     directly support the Lord Justice Taylor conclusion that there was a blunder in the
                     opening o f the gates followed by an on rush through the tunnel. O f these 35 less than
                      10 gave evidence at the inquest or was sent to West Midlands Police in 1990.

                     Further in regard to abuse of process,... two versions of statements, South Yorkshire
                     Police should be made available to the families.

                     There are dozens and dozens and dozens of examples of SYP statements, not in C.J.
                     Act form, from April 1989 which contain factual matters with respect to senior
                     officers which have been ruthlessly struck out and pruned. So the DPP was given an
                     edited version.

                     There are 44 examples of assertions of fact we have found so far. There are few
                     involving Police Officers, 44 Statements sent by South Yorkshire Police where factual
                     criticisms o f Senior Officers admitted, we believe that the DPP and the coroner were
                     misled and the truth deliberately misled by SYP. If that is the position we are deeply
                     concerned that SYP have all the papers, including the West Midland Police File, and
                     Counsel’s view on the prosecution. It is an astonishing state of affairs that they should
                     have this file compared to the families. And it is only because of the new Home
                     Office policy that we have found this out.

                     Mr Duckenfield’s lawyers, represented by Winckworth & Pemberton, acted for South
                     Yorkshire Police with regard to the Scrutiny. They know what the history of the
                     investigation is and what the position is.

                      Now, it is our case that the DPP ought to decide as to the true state of affairs, and
                      there be a larger factual investigation. There is no reason to wait for this.

         SM:         You have copies from the 38 but you are missing originals?

         AJ:         It goes further than that. We were contacted by 3 Nottingham Constables supporting
                      spectators’ statements. Arrangements were made to interview, but Nottingham say
                      they can only be interviewed with the force Solicitor and they will charge £84 for
                      each witness.

         SM:         Do you need the new witnesses to substantially improve the case for committal, or
                     do you have enough at the moment to establish a prima facie case?

         AJ:         It might do, but not sure. The prosecution is entitled to pursue the material.

         SM:         It is premature for witness statements.

                      (SBE note AJ was very animated at this second stage of submissions).

          SM: I will fix a date foT late October and that may concentrate the DPP’s mind with

                   respect to a decision.

        RM:        It is unconscionable to expect a decision by the DPP within a matter of days (from the
                   CPS review completion).

        SM:        I have a 10 day case listed and others will have to be dealt with so it will be the end
                   of October.

                   (short delay while Court Clerk and other staff check the Court diary).

        SM:        I propose to adjourn matters to 30th October 1998 at 9.45am and set aside the whole
                   day, in case there is extensive argument regarding witness statements, and I have also
                   pencilled 7-17 December for possible committal proceedings. I will ensure that as at
                   30th October, those December dates will still be available to accommodate if we get
                   to that stage.

                   (In answer to RM query)

                   The dates are not fixed in stone but available. As much effort should be made as
                   possible to ensure that the parties are available for those dates. Solicitors should
                   contact Counsel’s Clerk and explain the possibility of a committal at that time, I do
                   not want it too tentative, to wander on. This is a sensitive case involving events a
                   long time ago, and there is a delay from October to the date I have considered, and
                   it must not be allowed to drag on.

        RM:        I have no idea of availability of dates of my Counsel I will draw matters to their
                   attention as necessary, when and if papers are served. One point to make is that we
                   may need more time compared to the receipt of the bundle of papers I only received
                    last Friday. It is a very important aspect of moving forward. The last thing we would
                    want is ... (referring to late service of further papers). I was not involved personally
                    in the Lord Justice Stuart-Taylor inquiry-

        AJ:        (reiterating that all parties will be assisted by early disclosure).

         RM:       This matter is a prosecution. The onus is on the prosecution to bring forward the
                   evidence.

         SM:       (Further comment regarding dragging of witness statements).

         RM:       We will review any matters objectively. All witness statements before calling for
                   deposition evidence.

         PI:       One point to make is that although we acted for SYP, we are presently subject to the
                   same constraints as the prosecution in regard to access of the documents. They do not
                   make the documents available to us presently.

         SM:       The Defendants will be released on unconditional bail until 30th October 1998. Their
                   attendance is required then and failure would amount to an offence and punishable.

 Dear Ian

 H illsb o ro u g h P rosecu tion s

 I attach copies of a further letter received from the HFSG with attached letter from HFSG tothe
 CPS. I have not copied the lever arch file referred to but can do so if you wish.

 The tenor of the letter is that my and my firm’s previous involvement with Hillsborough in itself
 renders it inappropriate for me now to be advising the South Yorkshire Police. The sub-text, in so
 far as I can discern it, must relate to the editing of statements of South Yorkshire Police officers
 prior to submission to the Taylor enquiry.

 That is a matter which was considered by Lord Justice Stuart Smith as part of his scrutiny and I was
 more than happy to accept his conclusions both personally and on behalf of the firm.

 Obviously it is a matter for you who you appoint to advise you. All I can say is thatif I perceived a
 conflict I would most certainly withdraw and explain my reasons for doing so.

Dear Mr Metcalf

We have written today to Mr Croston at the Crown Prosecution Service in York. We enclose
a copy of our letter and of the file.

Winkworth and Pemberton, from whom Mr Duckenfield now has the advantage of receiving
appropriate professional advice, represented the South Yorkshire Police during the “Scrutiny”
of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. No doubt the reason that you did not advise the force last year
was because of the prominent part your firm had played in giving advice in 1989-91, and no
doubt later in the various civil and other proceedings in which the force had interests. It was
probably thought that your firm, and you yourself, had been too close to events.

It is utterly inappropriate that you are involved now. The DPP will not make a decision on
this matter before October. We want to uncover further evidence to support the charges. We
believe that much of that evidence has been suppressed. It is wrong that you should advise the
South Yorkshire Police to maintain exclusive custody of the archive, when you and your firm
have been so deeply concerned in the way in which information and evidence has been
collected, edited and presented to outside tribunals, courts and law enforcement authorities
over the years. We are considering, with leading counsel, all legal options in respect of your
and your firm’s conduct, and we contend, meanwhile, that you have a clear conflict of interest
in continuing to advise the South Yorkshire Police.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Croston

A dlington v M urray: A d lin gton v D uckenfield

I look forward to your letter confirming the contents of our telephone conversation today.
For the purposes of your review of the documents in this matter, and with reference to our
continuing concerns that the South Yorkshire Police have custody of the relevant documents,
we enclose a file of questionnaires, statements and letters. Tab 1 contains different versions of
the questionnaire sent out to South Yorkshire officers soon after the disaster by Chief
Superintendent Wain 'of that force for the purposes of their unsworn statements. Tab 2 is a
sample of the different questionnaire used by West Midlands Police to put to spectators when
formal witness statements were taken from them.

Tab 3 contains a draft of the statement with a date of 17* July 1990 prepared by or for Chief
Inspector Betti son, a copy of which we have sent you already. The following tabs contain the
original and edited statements of a number of officers, with highlighted marks for your
convenience. You will see that the passages removed from the first three officers’ statements
(Holmes, K. Frost, and Wilson) show careful excisions of factual matters which are adverse to
the South Yorkshire Police, whereas many obvious comments, which are not adverse to that
force, or which are adverse to Liverpool supporters, remain unedited in the second versions.
A statement from Wilson was sent to the DPP in 1990, and occupies 9 pages according to the
Master Witness List. Both the edited and unedited statements are 8 pages long.


              Tel: 0151 236 1919. F a x 0151 236 1936. E M ail info@ hfsg.org

On page 63 and 68, we have highlighted an important sentence from the first statements of PC
Guest (one of the few South Yorkshire officers who made a formal witness statement to the
West Midlands Police) indicating that it was obvious at 2.40 pm that the crowds outside
Leppings Lane could not be accommodated. This would also have been obvious to the
defendants in the current case. However, it was the case for the South Yorkshire Police at the
inquest that the overcrowding was not evident before the match started at 3 pm. This was a
critical issue at the inquest, and the Coroner took the view on the evidence called before him,
that the overcrowding was not evident before the match started at 3 pm. We note from the
Master Witness List of April 1990, that five or six pages of statements only from PC Guest
were sent. Guest died before the inquest, but no statement was read to the jury.

The statements of PC Titterton show the removal of important factual observations from the
end of the first statement, including, at page 88, matters going to the heart of all investigations
into the disaster. A statement from him is listed in the Master Witness List.

Inspector White’s first statement tab 9, included passages at page 100-1 that were deleted
from the second edited statement. (The ftrst document came to us with the lines through the
relevant paragraphs). You will see that the first deleted paragraph contains the evidence that
White would always monitor the build-up of spectators in the Leppings Lane pens by climbing
the steps to the control box (occupied on the day of the disaster by the two defendants and
others) to get a good view.

There can be no honest reason for the deletion of this evidence. It is the kind of assertions
that Bettison at tab 3, pages 17-8 suggested, the following year, must be "clarified” where it
appears on other officers’ statements. The statement of the next witness, PC Woodcock, tab
 10, demonstrates the central importance of the deleted parts of Inspector White’s evidence.
The passage at the middle of page 112 asserts that Inspector White normally irted
spectators from the central pens, but on this occasion was told not to. If true, it proves that
paragraph 4 on page 15 in the statement of Bettison was wrong.

This issue is at the heart of the case. The South Yorkshire Police claim that the diversion of
oncoming supporters from the central pens in 1988 was unknown to senior officers. Lord
Justice Taylor had found in his 1989 report that the failure to divert the spectators in 1989,
after the decision had been made to open the gates, was a "blunder of the first magnitude” and
the immediate cause o f the fatal crushing. The 1988 events prove foreseeability, which is of
course critical to civil and criminal allegations of negligence. They are of the most obvious
relevance to the manslaughter issue in the prosecutions.

We have also received a very poor copy of a 3 page statement of Inspector White dated 6lh
may 1989 which we expect to be deciphered for us soon by technical experts.

Faced with the evidence o f White and Woodcock, the honest course for the officers preparing
the evidence would have been to ask Inspector White to say whether Woodcock’s account
was true, and to produce his answers, Instead, the passages in both statements were excised
and the truth was suppressed. A seven page statement of White appears in the Master Witness
List. This may have been the first statement, submitted with the lines deleted.
On the other hand, the Wilson statements, described above, were both eight pages long but
occupied 9 pages according to the Master Witness List. This would suggest that only the
second, six page statement of White might have been sent, and the extra page, in his and
Wilson’s cases were a title or introductory page in the original bundles of evidence sent to the
DPP. We note that, in either event, no statement of Woodcock appears in that list.

Associated with this subject is the statement of PC Lang at Tab 13. Neither the important
matters at the end of page 163 in the six page statement, nor any of the statement of 2"d June
1989, appears in the five page amended report at pages 167 to 171 of the file. The Master
Witness List shows that only a five (or possibly four) page statement of Lang was sent to the
DPP. It appears clear that the DPP did not know, therefore, ofLang’s 1988 experience,
which confirms the facts set out in the original statements of White and Woodcock.

We are not surprised to note that none of White, Woodcock or Lang was called to give
evidence to Taylor or at the inquest, at which they would have been cross-examined. Their
unrevised evidence shows that a senior officer used to monitor the pens; that a diversion from
the central pens took place in 1988; but that there was a failure to take this known and
obvious precaution in 1989, resulting in ninety-six deaths.

The statements ofPattison, Tab 11, Tissington, Tab 12, Kennedy, Tab 14, Dunn, Tab 15 and
Royle, Tab 16, show important deletions of factual observations adverse to the interests of the
South Yorkshire Police, and are samples of the dozens of examples we have discovered. Of
these, Tissington was called before the Inquest, and a statement from him was contained in the
Master Witness List. None of the others referred to in this paragraph were called at the
Inquest, nor were their statements recorded in the Master Witness List.

Although the West Midlands Police Questionnaire asked spectators for “Views or
Observations” (question 53, page 12), we know of no cases in which such observations were
removed from their witness statements. There are innumerable examples of police statements
which, even after editing, contain hearsay and comment adverse to Liverpool supporters. You
will see that the process of amendments and deletions to the police statements of matters
prejudicial to their own force goes far beyond that referred to in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
report. We believe he was misled.

It is only at the insistence of the Home Secretary himself that we have been given access to
these statements this year. Before the report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s “Scrutiny” we
knew virtually nothing of all this. We shall send you a comprehensive analysis of all the
statements by 8* September, but you will see why we are so concerned that the South
Yorkshire Police are holding all the material, and, as the correspondence at Tab 17 shows, are
acting under the advice of Hammond Suddards, and particularly Mr Peter Metcalf. This is the
solicitor who, according to the Bettison statement at Tab 3, pages 15 to 18, was taking a
leading part in what Bettison describes as “clarification” of witness statements, in the context
of civil proceedings in July 1990. At the same time, of course, leading counsel was preparing
to advise the DPP in relation to criminal liability on the basis of a large number of unsworn
statements which had already been similarly “clarified” to the advantage of the South
Yorkshire Police, the year before.
 •
We%e sending a copy of this letter and the file to Hammond Suddards. If you cannot compel
the police to hand over the material, can you at least give them some guidance? Your review
will take several weeks as it is. The South Yorkshire Police are at present acting under the
guidance (see page 202) that you have given them, namely, that they might not wish to hand
over the material until your review is complete. Surely, in the light of this material, you can
revoke that guidance.

Q ttis custodiet ipsos custodes?

DRAFT LETTER TO MISS A ADLINGTON, HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT
        GROUP FROM PETER METCALF, HAMMOND SUDDARDS



Dear Miss Adlington


Thank you for your letter of 24 August 1998.


I have brought your letter to the attention of my clients. This letter, however, is in response to
the points which you make about this firm.


I cannot comment on your second paragraph save to note that the first sentence is factual and
the remainder mere surmise on matters which are not within my (or, I imagine your)
knowledge.


Your third paragraph is unclear. Although you (twice) state that it is wrong for this firm to be
advising the South Yorkshire Police your only specific criticism is of the decision of the South
Yorkshire Police not to provide access to the Hillsborough archive pending the CPS review
and the decision of the DPP. However, as you acknowledge in your own letter of the same
date to the CPS, that policy is based on CPS guidance in response to the request of the South
Yorkshire Police.


The reference to a consideration of “legal options involving your and your firm’s conduct”
sounds unpleasantly like a threat. Perhaps you will explain what you mean. Your letter implies
without saying so in terms that it has the sanction of your Leading Counsel. Is this correct? At
all events if you have anything more concrete to say then I suggest that you spell it out clearly.

Yours sincerely

    Dear Peter

    Hillsborough Prosecution

    Thank you for your letter of 25 August 1998. I have no objection to your draft response.
    However, I would not respond to their paragraph 3 in the same way. I would settle for;
    “Neither I nor the Chief Constable see a conflict o f interest’.

    I have no strong views either way.

 Dear Ian

 Thank you for your fax of 27 August 1998. We also spoke.

 Here is a copy of the final version of the letter to Ann Adlington.

 Having amended the final paragraph it seemed to me that the reference to “my firm” in the original
 draft no longer made a lot of sense and I therefore removed it. I trust this is in order.

 Dear Miss Adlington

 Yourself - v - Duckenfield & M urray

  Thank you for your letter of 24 August 1998.

 I cannot comment on your second paragraph save to note that the first sentence is factual and
 the remainder mere surmise on matters which are not within my (or, I imagine, your)
 knowledge.

 As to your third paragraph neither I nor The Chief Constable can see any conflict of interest.

 Yours sincerely



 P C METCALF

proceed. The only effect o f non production at this stage will be the potential for delay, The material
sought by David Duekenfield, by contrast, is uniquely relevant to the D PP decision as to whether to
intervene. I f it Is not made available now, it will be o f no relevance,

4. The: proposal for disclosure solely to a nominated medical expert provides a further d e a r
distinction between treatm ent o f this and other material.

5, T he only material factor militating against refusing the request is the possibility o f deliberate



On this basis I believe that it would be appropriate to accede to the request as and when an expert is
nominated. Perhaps we can discuss this over the next day or so.



and copied with your letter to me o f 20 August) this is already covered by the advice from CPS
dated 15 July in response to our original request for guidance. The third buliei point on p3 o f that
letter refers. Briefly the guidance is that all original statements should be retained by the Police and
that (if and when access is to be allowed at ail) the correct course is to allow copying o f the
statements by the prosecutor/defendant so as to allow them to obtain new original signed copies



M y only additional comment is that where a statement has been copied and identified as relevant
then there might well be justification for the M agistrates to issue a witness summons for the
production o f that docum ent at a committal hearing. This might be a preferred alternative course to
retaking all the statem ents for the prosecutor in this case. However, that situation does not arise at
p re se n t.

I suggest that there should be a reply to each letter, including the following:

               “ The C hief Constable has received guidance from the CPS in relation to requests for
               docum entation forming part o f the Hillsborough archive, which includes your statement. The
               guidance is that it may be appro riate to delay providing any such docum entation until the
               CPS has com pleted a review oi . ac evidence and the D PP has decided w hether o r not to
               intervene in the prosecutions. The guidance goes on to state that as o rig in al statements form
               part o f a file involving a criminal investigation best practice would be to retain them within
               the file.

                 This would not of course rule out providing access to the statement and /or a copy and a
                 decision on this will be made, if necessary, once the decision of the DPP has been made”

                                     TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
                                               Re.
                               THE HILLSBOROUGH RELATIVES CAMPAIGN
  1.         I have seen men dying in their hundreds in the Arctic Ocean, & helped to rescue
         some.    I have helped to recover mangled young bodies, maimed, dead & dying. I am
         no hero, far from it. That is not false modesty.       Others experienced much more.
         'Counselling' was unheard of. We did not seek vast sums of money in compensation.
         We got on with our lives, thankful that we had survived.
  2.         That is by way of preface to this letter, which will surely raise outrage from
         much of present day Britain, - but SOMEBODY has to say it! The Hillsborough relat­
         ives are giving grief a bad name. Let them go home, treasure the memories of their
         loved ones, & get on with their lives as best they can.
  3^.        Instead they are seeking blood, demanding a human sacrifice. Whether mistakes
         were made or not - & hindsight ALWAYS has 20/20 vision - they surely must concede
         that those they accuse were doing what they believed to be right at the time. To
         hound & persecute them in this way is sadistic.
  4.         Trevor Hicks in particular, the leader of the campaign, should be asked a very
         hard - & cruel - question. Must you not accept that you played SOME part, however
         innocently, in the death of your daughters? Had YOU been able to see the future,
         would YOU. not have acted differently?
  5_j_      A father who enthusiastically encouraged his daughters to take up mountaineer­
         ing should not try to blame others if they get killed on Mount Everest. There are
         parents whose pony & horse mad sons & daughters havediedindulging in the sport
         they loved. They do not try to blame others.
  _6j.       The real cause of the loss of life at Hillsborough was the high fence round
         the pitch which turned congestion into a tragedy. You must then ask why was that
         fence there?
  7j_       Large football crowds, with varying degrees of hysteria, are dangerous places.
         Heysel Stadium, in 1985, when 38 died, 437 were injured:Bradford  (1985) 56died:
         Ibrox (1971) 66 died: & Bolton (1946) with 33 victims.
^Ls_     Why are the campaigners so reluctant to give up? Will they be satisfied if
w    those they seek to crucify are driven to suicide? Or could it be the vision  of
     large sums of money? Others have showed the way.
             There was great difference between the Heysel & Hillsborough disasters. Heysel
         was caused deliberately by rioting Liverpool fans, who charged at the Juventus sup­
         porters. The Belgian Minister of the Interior said "We took more precautions than
         for any other match, because we feared violence from the British, but we had no
         idea it would be so brutal."
  10.        The Liverpool Club Chairman blamed the Belgian police (of course).    Someone
         else said "They should have known what we were like, & taken better precautions!"
         Complaint was also made that "THE DIVIDING FENCE WAS ONLY 4 FOOT HIGH". !!!!!
  11.        25 Italians & 7 Belgians were among those killed (none British). Liverpool
         supporters should hang their heads in shame at the very mention of the word
         'disaster'.

Dear Sir,
     I am a disinterested party in that I have no brief either for or against
the police. However, I am concerned when decent, honourable men, who did
their job to the best of their ability, are hounded, persecuted & vilified.
     The open letter which is enclosed was sent to all the London Press & to
the Yorkshire Press about ten days ago. I doubt any will publish it. I seem
to recall that one paper (The Sun I believe) did publish a report at the time
which was critical of the Liverpool supporters. The sales in Liverpool
dropped alarmingly, & the paper was forced to recant & apologise.
     I       ask that you give consideration to having copies of my open letter
(preferably enlarged to A3 size) posted on your police notice boards.
     Enclosed you will also find envelopes containing copies of the letter,
addressed to Mr. David Duckenfield, & Mr. Bernard Murray, the two former
police officers currently facing criminal prosecution. I would be most
grateful if you could complete the addresses of those two gentlemen & forward
them for me.

Hillsborough - Mr David Duckenfield

Further to our telephone discussions regarding this matter, I have now discussed the position
with my Senior Partner Mr Nicholas Owston who is particularly experienced in police
organisational and constitutional issues.

It must of course remain a matter for the Police Authority as to any appropriate response to
the Press inquiry, but our view is that in the light of the Home Office Circulars, it is entirely
appropriate for the Police Authority to respond in terms that the provision of financial
assistance to police officers in these circumstances is a matter of discretion to be exercised
by applying the appropriate Home Office guidelines, and that of course the authority is subject
to public accountability in regard to its actions. Notwithstanding this, it not being the policy
of the Police Authority to comment on individual cases, it would not be appropriate to depart
from standard practice in this case notwithstanding its high profile.

I would be grateful of course if you could let me know of the terms of any information given
out to the Press so that we can advise Mr Duckenfield accordingly.

Dear Sirs

OUR CLIENT : MR BERNARD MURRAY

We refer to the telephone call from Maureen Oakes this morning. You told us that
you had received an enquiry from                     of the Star, asking whether you
were giving financial support to our Client and his co-Defendant.

We understand from you that it would be not normal for you to make any comment
to the press in relation to any Officer or former Officer. We would like you to
consider that this is still the appropriate way to respond to this particular enquiry. We
would suggest that you could add that just because this is a high profile case, does not
mean that you should depart from your normal procedure.

We would be grateful if in due course you would advise of the decision that you have
made in relation to the enquiry and the response given.

          Dear Sirs

          Adlinaton v Murray: Adlinpton v Duckenfield

          Yesterday we received a letter by fax dated IS**1September 1998, to which we sent you a
          short reply (copy attached). This morning w e have received by second class post another
          letter on the same subject dated 14,h September. You refer in the last paragraph o f that letter
          to the possibility that we might provide a set o f documents to Winckworth and Pemberton,
          who you suggest you “are sure would want to make a similar request to ourselves” [sic],

     *             In fact Winckworth and Pemberton made a similar request on 11* September. We told them
         that we would be prepared to supply copies o f these documents, provided that they met our
         photocopying and incidental expenses, that they assured us that South Yorkshire Police
£)       Authority was not funding Mr Duckenfield’s defence, and that they undertook not to discuss
         the contents o f the files with any serving or former South Yorkshire Police officers, or their
         solicitors, until the outcome o f the CPS review was known.. We requested this last
         undertaking because we believed that the CPS are consulting with the South Yorkshire Police
         about the matters we have raised. We have heard nothing from Winckworth and Pemberton
         since.

         The position o f Assistant Chief Constable Daines is that, following “guidance” from the
         Director o f Public Prosecutions and advice from Hammond Suddards, he proposes to disclose
         no documents at present, whether to prosecution, defence, potential witnesses, or to the

It has been suggested to us that the South Yorkshire Police Authority is funding the defence
o f both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray pursuant to a request made by Mr Richard Wells in
1997. If this is correct the expressions o f neutrality by Mr Daines are, to say the least,
unconvincing.

Y ou will know from our letter o f 24’h August that we believe that the previous investigations
into the Hillsborough disaster have been seriously misled by the South Yorkshire Police, and
indeed the West Midlands Police. We believe it is for this reason that Mr Daines has adopted
his unhelpful stance. Neither you nor Winckworth and Pemberton, we note, have offered any
hint o f protest about South Yorkshire Police’s control o f the archive. Neither has a word o f
support been offered on behalf o f either defendant in support o f our request for access to
documents for the purposes o f (a) the prosecution and (b) our opposition to your request to
the Director o f Public Prosecutions to discontinue the case.

We believe that at present the two defendants and the South Yorkshire Police have identical
interests in refusing us access to papers that have been collected on behalf o f the following
four bodies:

            a)     Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry o f 1989

            b)     The Director o f Public Prosecutions in 1989 and 1990

            c)     The Coroner’s Inquest between 17th April 1989 and the end o f April 1991

            d)     The Police Complaints Authority’s supervision o f investigations made by
                    officers from a variety o f police forces into complaints made against a number
                    o f South Yorkshire officers.
7'
 We regard it as legal nonsense to assert that the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire owns
 all these papers and therefore has the right to seek to frustrate our constitutional right to
 prosecute.

 You will. I hope, understand why if the South Yorkshire Police Authority is indeed funding
 your defence we are reluctant to supply you at this stage with copies o f the documents you
 seek. The bereaved families have been deprived o f important information, statements and
 documents for nine years because o f the fiction that in conducting all their enquiries for the
 four different bodies above, the West Midlands Police have been in law the “agents” o f the
 South Yorkshire Police, whilst at the same time the West Midlands force has presented itself
 publicly as a wholly independent investigative body.

     A t last, at the conclusion o f the “Scrutiny”, th e Home Secretary has insisted that a small
 proportion o f this archive should be made available to the HFSG. Seven months later we find
 that Mr Daines is refusing to disclose statements within the category o f material which the
 Home Secretary said should be disclosed. However, for the first time, the limited disclosures
 have enabled us to see something o f the whole picture o f these investigations, even if the
  structure is blurred by the continuing refusal to allow us to see more, a refusal which it
•appears to us that both defendants support.
                                  01512361936


, Jn any event, if the South Yorkshire Police Authority is funding Mr Murray’s defence, it seems
  absurd that they should be asked to pay us for copies o f primary documents which are in Mr
  Daines' possession. It must surely be in the interests o f the taxpayer that you request copies
  o f these documents from Mr Daines yourself. You may tell him that we have no objection to
  that course, and we have no objections to your providing him with a copy o f this letter.

 For these reasons we will only supply you with copies o f these documents at this stage upon
 the undertakings and assurances we have asked o f Winckworth and Pemberton. We are
 providing copies o f this letter in the circumstances to Winckworth and Pemberton and Mr
 Croston.


 Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V- MURRAY AND DUCKENFIELD

We refer to your letter of 17 September. We keep having to remind you that our
Client is accused of most serious alleged offences in a Prosecution initiated by you.
We are sure that you have acquainted yourself of the duties of a Prosecutor which
inter alia require you not only to serve evidence but to make a disclosure of all
material save if it is subject of a Public Interest Immunity Certificate granted by a
Judge.

You keep trying to draw inferences or indeed in this letter reach conclusions from any
instance where you perceive the Defence will not assist the Prosecution. That is
wrong.

The fact that there are bereaved families is a tragedy and indeed we are conscious of
all of those whose lives were touched by the events at Hillsborough. However, as has
been said many times, the proceedings are governed by the law and one cannot turn
a blind eye to the obligation to comply with Statute Case Law and Rules of Evidence.
A very simple example of this was the way in which you issued summonses in South
Sefiton Magistrates’ Court and then sought to justify and perpetuate a position that was
wrong in law.

You said that you were prepared to disclose submissions to the Crown Prosecution
Service in relation to their reconsideration of this case. What is the “secret material”
annexed to your letter? Why is it that we are only allowed the letter and not the
documents? We have undertaken and repeat our undertaking to pay reasonable
copying charges for the same.

The conditions that you now seek to attach to a perfectly straightforward request for
disclosure are wholly unacceptable. There are no conditions which the Prosecution
can attach to answer such defence request. If you will not meet the request then there
may be consequences which flow from that refusal.

Regrettably, the whole substance of your long letter seems to be an attempt to
besmirch characters of individuals and of bodies and essentially to allege that all of
these persons and bodies are conspiring against your clients.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH - PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS

Whilst this case is not going to be determined on the exchange of correspondence, I
think it may be sensible for you to see a letter which I have received from HFSG
dated 17 September. I also attach a copy of my reply. I specifically provide these
both because of the content and because it is said by the writer that she has no
objection to you having a copy. That is very kind of her since she has no right to say
whether you should have a copy or not. If there are any matters which arise, no
doubt you will let me know.

Ypurs faithfully

 CHIEF INSPECTOR




 I am     a Chief     Inspector      in    the    South Yorkshire          Police   and work at Force

 Headquarters, Sheffield.             From time to time I attend a football match as a

 spectator.        I had     few commitments            during    the weekend       15-16 April      and    so

 obtained       a ticket    for   the F.A.       Cup     semi-final       game between Liverpool and

 Nottingham Forest.

My ticket was        for seat NN 28 in the South Stand uncovered enclosure.                            (The

 seats number 1-230 from West to east, my seat was therefore relatively close

to the Leppings Lane enclosure on the 13th row from the front).

The day was fine and sunny, I left the city centre about 1.20 p.m. in my car

to travel to the ground.               I drove from Bridge Street out of the city via

West     Bar,    Gibraltar    Street      and    Langsett        Road.     I had    allowed    for   heavy

traffic but was surprised that there was very little problem until the usual

bottleneck at Hillsborough corner traffic lights.                           I travelled through the

junction towards Hillsborough Football Stadium.                           There were no hinderances

as   I    travelled    down       Leppings       Lane    onto     Penistone    Road    and    left    into

Claywheels Lane.

I parked my car in Claywheels Lane and walked towards Hillsborough Stadium.

The time would be about 1.45 p.m. (1345).

Many people were milling around, but there were no large crowds as I made my

way to the Penistone Road roundabout and along Leppings Lane.                                All the way

along my journey I was continually asked for 'spare' tickets and 'swaps' by

young male Liverpool supporters.                  I politely answered the first few but the

number    of    enquiries    became       so    overwhelming       that    I simply    walked   past       or

shook my head.

My ticket was green in colour and showed admission by a South Stand gangway

closest to the South West corner of the stadium.                          I consulted the schematic

map on the rear and the natural route appeared to be via Leppings Lane and a
service road which leads to the South Stand.                        The ticket bore no           mention of

colour coding - I assumed          until a long time after the event that ALL tickets

were green.

I saw no reference to colour coded direction boards.                          Furthermore, I reached

the   South    Stand    service    road and       found       the    way   barred     by    a     serial     of

officers,      under    the   command      of     Inspector         Harvey,    ensuring         the     proper

segregation     of fans.      I was      allowed        to pass      through but an awful lot of

supporters were        invited to walk round the block and enter the South Stand

from Penistone Road.          The point         of relating this           is to indicate             that the

information      provided     on   the     ticket        itself      could    have    been       much     more

comprehensive and the direction boards more prominently displayed.

I took up my seat and saw from the electronic clock behind me that the time

was 1.54 p.m.      (1354).     The ground was very sparsely populated.                           There was,

however, a quite densely packed area in the two centre enclosures behind the

Leppings Lane end goal.

I bought and read a match programme as I waited for the game to begin.                                        I

remember at one stage, looking across to the West stand terraces and seeing

the   supporters       patting     a   multi-coloured             beachball      around         the     centre

enclosure.      The significance of this is that the crowd were not so tightly

packed as they were able to raise their arms and bounce the ball around.

The   two teams came onto the pitch for a warm-up session.                            I don't remember

the   time    precisely   but remember          that    it was      early,    perhaps       2.30      p.m.   or

2.35 p.m.      (1430-1435).      When the teams left the pitch I                     remember that the

ground seemed more full.

About 2.45 p.m.        (1445) I can't remember precisely,                    I saw several fans from

the   centre    enclosures       scaling    the        wall   and     climbing       into       the    seating

enclosure.      I interpreted this as mischievous rather than arising because of

overcrowding.      I saw about four or five police officers, one an Inspector
standing     in the aisles of the seating enclosure close by the front of the

stand.       I was       not    surprised        to    see     the    officers       move    to     prevent      this

activity     and    thought       it    proper      that      officers       should    eject      those who       had

managed to climb into the stand.                      He escorted the young man up the aisle and

out    of   the    stand.        The    climbing        from    the    standing        to   the     seating      area

ceased, apart from a very occasional person.

There appeared to be sufficient officers on the perimeter track around the

ground.

The two teams returned to the pitch at about 2.55 p.m. and I considered it

unlikely     that       the   game would      be able         to start        at    3.00 p.m.       however,      the

preliminaries       were       curtailed     and       the    teams    were    in position          to kick off

around that time or a minute afterwards.                            The crowd in the South Stand were

all standing.           I sat down before many around me and thereby did not see the

kick-off.        As people began to sit down there was a cheer from the crowd and

my    attention     was       drawn     to   the       'players       tunnel'.         I    guessed       that   the

Nottingham Forest Manager was taking his seat but could not see the subject

of this interest.

I saw very little football played because, seconds afterwards, my attention

was drawn to fans being allowed out of the Leppings Lane enclosure and onto

the   pitch.        I     immediately        assumed         that    the     centre    closure       had    become

overcrowded       and    that     the   Police        there    were    transferring          fans    to    another

enclosure.        I became concerned when I saw that the fans were just sitting on

the   pitch and were           not moving      towards other enclosures.                     Other fans were

scaling the perimeter fencing and dropping onto the perimeter track.

Members     of    the    public    around      me      who were       less     than    100 yards          from   the

incident interpreted this as a pitch invasion and there were many calls for

strong police       action      to get       the      fans    back    into    the     enclosures.          The man

sitting beside me suggested putting police dogs into the enclosure.                                        Because
the police officers were not just allowing but assisting the fans over the

fence and out of the emergency gates, I realised that this was not a pitch

invasion and was definitely a matter for concern.

I recall that the football players and officials continued the game for an

inordinate period after I had realised the need for the game to be halted.

Fans were actually sitting on the pitch.                The football match was not helping

the officers attempts to deal with the situation because there were cheers

and surges and the attention was drawn away from the matter at hand.

I saw Superintendent Murray come from the direction of the Police control

room and go to the perimeter           track.         He went   to the area behind Leppings

Lane goal and then walked very quickly, almost ran, to the linesman in front

of the South Stand.           He clearly wanted the game to be stopped.            I would have

thought    the   linesman could not have misinterpreted Superintendent Murray's

intentions and yet he simply ran away from him keeping up with the play on

the pitch.

My attention was now totally fixed on the Leppings Lane end of the ground

and I saw at one point           that Superintendent Greenwood ran onto the playing

area and ensured that the match was stopped.

More and more people streamed onto the playing area via the emergency gates

at   the   front   of   the    enclosures   or   by    climbing   over   the   fencing   at   this

point.     The first indication I had of the extent of the problem was when two

Constables,      one was Police Constable Marsh,            'F'   Division,    carried a young

boy from that area to the pitch immediately below where I was sitting and

began to give mouth to mouth resuscitation to the boy.                    They worked with a

member of the public           to resuscitate the boy for some time and appeared to

have   been successful as the crowd which had gathered round turned towards

the stand and cheered.

It seemed to be a long time until the single St. John's Ambulance appeared
on the playing area.                     The scene was becoming more and more chaotic although

there were more than enough Police Officers who were doing everything they

possibly could to deal with the situation.

I thought that, as there were so many Police Officers                                on the pitch there may

be     a    lack        of     control           around    the     back    ofthe     stand         so,        at   about

3.25-3-30 p.m. (1525-1530) I left the stand and went to a point at the South

West corner, immediately behind the Police Control tower.                                     There were other

Police       officers          there,     none of whom had radios.                  I imagined      that all the

injured would             have       been       brought onto the pitch and would                  be evacuated at

this point.             It being the nearest access point for ambulances,                                I therefore

looked towards making                    the casualty station.             There was a Police landrover

parked       in just the spot where                     I considered the ambulances may park and I

wasted an awful lot of time getting the landrover moved - there were no keys

in the vehicle.

At   this        time    a middle             aged man with       a stewards    tabbard rolled up in his

jacket pocket walked up to the young steward who was wearing his tab,bard and

dutifully manning the gate at this point.                               The older man said "Oi, get that

jacket      off,        some    supporters         just    beat    a couple     of our lads          up when they

found out they were stewards."

When I next looked around there were two casualties at this point.                                             One male

about       6    feet        tall       and    heavily    built,       28-30   years,       laying       on    a   metal

stretcher.          He was obviously dead.                      I helped a Policewoman and a member of

St. John's Ambulance in their attempts to revive him but was struck at that

time       by the futility of the operation.                           The other casualty was very much

alive,          holding        his      arm.       An     ambulance       arrived     and     after       attempting

resuscitation            for        a   few     seconds    on    the   deceased     man     the    ambulance        crew

suggested putting him in the ambulance, I helped them to do that and then

told the group of 4-5 Police Constables at this point that I wanted one o^
them    to    accompany       the     body.       A   young    male    constable       who    spoke        with   a

Merseyside       accent,      but     who       I'm   sure,    was   wearing     the    uniform       of    South

Yorkshire Police,           said "I'll go, I know his family."                      I was amazed at this

comment but had not time to follow it up.

The other slightly injured man got into the same ambulance and the ambulance

left.        There was       nothing      to do at       this point so I instructed the Police

Constables       to    keep     the      area    clear   for    ambulances       and    walked    along       the

service      road     towards      Leppings      Lane    to ensure     unrestricted          access    for    the

emergency services which I expected to arrive.

As I turned a corner of the service road walking towards Leppings Lane I was

met by the full tragedy of the situation.                        There were a row of ambulances at

this point beside            the perimeter wall of the stadium, numerous people were

receiving medical attention.                    But at least ten male bodies were laid out in

attempted recovery position along the fence beside the river and no one was

paying them any attention whatsoever,                     they were obviously dead.               Their skin

had a mottled blue paller and their limbs were completely limp.

There were      literally dozens,               if not a hundred or more,              Police Officers at

this    point    under       control      of     Chief   Inspector      Purdy.         I was     in   civilian

clothes without a radio and felt completely helpless in this situation.                                           I

continued       to    the    end    of    the     service     road    and   there      encouraged      several

supporters who were trying to walk down the Service road that they could not

do   so until        the    emergency       services     had departed.         I arranged        a group of

Police Officers who were not engaged with anything, into a cordon across the

mouth of the junction.

I now found myself outside the cordon and had felt of little use inside, I

decided to leave the stadium to telephone my wife to reassure her that I was

uninjured.       The telephones in Leppings Lane were, not unexpectedly, full and

had queues of people outside.                    As I walked along Leppings Lane there were
groups        of   Liverpool        supporters        standing        around     and     they    appeared    very

aggressive.           A Police car was driving up and down Leppings Lane, asking via

the P.A. system, for fans to clear the way for ambulances.                                      I saw more than

one supporter kick out at the slowly patrolling car.                                   I returned to my car

parked at the junction of Claywheels Lane with Niagara Road.                                     I decided that

I would drive to Hammerton Road,                      telephone my wife from there and assist in

any way I could at the Police Station.                             I arrived at the Police Station to

find it much calmer and well staffed than I had anticipated.                                       I telephoned

home.         After    a    short     time   the      talk was        of   relatives      and    friends    being

received       at Hammerton Road.                I decided         that    this was an area in which I

could offer useful assistance.

Together       with     other     officers,        notably         Detective     Chief    Inspector Agar,       I

helped to transform the                 'new' CID Office at Hammerton Road into a relative

reception area.             In the early evening friends and relatives began arriving

at Hammerton Road,            I don't        know how they had got there                  or who had decided

upon Hammerton Road as the                   point ofreception.             It quickly          became apparent

that     we    would       need   a     larger     area      for    them    to   gather     and    wait.     The

Hillsborough Boys Club Hall was suggested, the keyholder was known and so it

was    arranged.        All the Social Workers/Helpers gathered there and received

the friends and relatives of supporters when we had obtained a formal report

about a missing friend or relation.

The system worked as follows:                    Somehow      (?) people who had lost contact with

friends/relatives            at   the    time    of    the    incident      were directed         to Hammerton

Road Police Station.              The team of officers working with me would complete a

M.F.H.    report and we would                then pass the person making                 the report    over to

the Social Workers at the Boys Club.

During the course of the evening/night our growing list of 'missing' persons

was checked with lists of casualties at hospital and with lists of arrested
persons.      About 1.00 a.m. the stream of friends/relatives ceased and, after

contacting Chief Superintendent Mole at the makeshift mortuary, I closed our

operation down.

The   final duty was            to drive     to the mortuary and check the M.F.H.                   reports

against the list of deceased.                 I handed all documents to Detective Inspector

Charles who was working at the mortuary and who said he would be working the

following day.         I left duty at 4.00 a.m. on Sunday 16 April 1989.

As    a postscript         to   this    report    about    the   incident,    I am reminded          of an

earlier visit to Hillsborough Football Stadium in my youth when there was a

very large crowd.

The match was a first division league game between Sheffield Wednesday and

Manchester City.           It was the last game of the season and Sheffield Wednesday

needed to win the game to remain in the first division.                              It would be about

1971.

It was an all         ticket evening         game and my ticket was for Leppings Lane.                     I

arrived with a friend in good                 time and took up      my position on the terracing

behind the goal but, before the start of the game, the terraces had become

so full that not only was I unable to see much of the pitch, but it was a

very uncomfortable situation.                   There was no room to move and I remember, at

one   time,    being    squashed        against    a barrier       to such an extent          that I was

exerting      all     my    energies       toprevent      injury    and     quickly       became    totally

unconcerned about the game.                I dreaded any goals or near misses as this was

followed      by    a surge       of   people    which    caused me    to    be   squashed        painfully

against the barrier.

By half time I had seen very little football and was thoroughly fed up with

the     situation.         Half    time    was    the    first   opportunity      I had      to    move   my

position      and,    after       fighting       my way through       the    crowd    I    found    a more

comfortable position at the front of the south west corner of the Leppings
Lane terracing.   I had been in very large football grounds before and since

but had never experienced anything quite like the pressure that was created

in this crowd at Hillsborough. J

Dear Mr. Daines

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER 1989

Further to our conversation on the 20th October, I enclose herewith a copy of an article
from the Yorkshire Evening Post of the 17th September 1998.

I actually think that these are probably the same people as H.S.F.G. but have had to
pretend that this is a break-away group so as not to embaiTass H.F.S.G. in it’s apparent
attempt to proceed through legal process.


jyours sincerely ^

       Dear Miss

       Thank you for confirming that Chief Supt Terry Wain headed this unit, and that one of the
       Superintendents was Mr Nettleship. Is it possible you could tell me Mr Nettleship’s first name
       and the names of the officers who made up this small unit. Although I don’t know the ranks it
       may help if yon search under the following names;

Dear Sirs

RE:         FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS -
            MR B MURRAY AND MR D DUCKENFIELD

I write with reference to the previous correspondence with you concerning the Authority’s
policy on the disclosure of information concerning applications for financial assistance.

I would advise you that at a recent conference convened by the Association of Police
Authorities representatives of the Hillsborough Family Support Group lobbied the Home
Secretary and the Chairman of the Authority with regard to the decision made by the
Authority concerning the funding of legal costs of officers in connection with the
Hillsborough Disaster. This followed the Hillsborough Family Support Group being
provided, at their request, with copies of minutes relating to the Hillsborough Disaster, the
Chief Constable’s Annual Reports, Statements of Account and Home Office circulars
relating to the provision of financial assistance for police officers. Following the
conference an article has appeared in the Police Review dated 13 November 1998
relating to representations made by the Group to the Home Secretary and to him having
“ promised to look into why South Yorkshire Police was funding the defence costs of
officers involved in the inquiry” . An enquiry has also been received from the Home
Secretary’s Department for information to assist the Home Secretary in responding to the
matters raised by the Group. Furthermore information has been received that the Group
intend to lobby the Authority in the near future.

In the circumstances it is considered that the Authority should now identify Mr Duckenfield
and Mr Murray as being the recipients of the financial assistance provided with an
explanation of why this decision was taken. In view of our earlierfcprrespondence I felt it
necessary to draw this matter to your attention.
I am given to understand that in the event of the Attorney General not quashing the
prosecutions which have been brought against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray
consideration would be given to an application to the Divisional Court for Judicial Review.
I would point out that the decision to fund the defence of the prosecutions would not
extend to financing such an application for Judicial Review or for that matter to an appeal
against the findings of the Court. If these steps were to be taken and your clients wished
to receive financial assistance from the Authority further applications would have to be
made.

Yours faithfully




M V Gades

      Dear S irs

      F IN A N C IA L     A S S IS T A N C E TO   P O L IC E    O F F IC E R S                                                        IN         LE G A L

      We refer to your letter by fax of 19 November, First I would restate that it is wholly
      proper in my view that former Superintendent Murray should have the support of the
      Police Authority insofar as Ms legal costs are concerned when the allegations made
      against him arise from his duties as a then serving Police Officer with your force. I
      believe that there are numerous precedents for this view. It would be unconscionable
      for my Client to have to use what savings he may have and to even sell his house to
      defend himself.________________________________________________________




      I bear in mind the substantial sums paid to some of the people who form the
      Hillsborough Families supporters Group and the fact that apparently £0.5 million was
      raised at a pop concert in Liverpool last year 1 leave you to decide the appropriate
      way in which you will provide the information as to the financial support that has
      been given.

      May w e now turn to the issue of an application to the Divisional Court for Judicial
      Review. We have already spoken to Leading Counsel. He is strongly of the view
      that if the Director of Public Prosecutions decides to allow the Prosecution to continue
      and not to intervene to take over the proceedings and then quash them, then this is a
      matter that should go to the Divisional Court. It has also been made clear by HF8 G
      that if the DPP intervenes to take over the proceedings and quash them, the} will
      immediately make application to the Divisional Court for Judicial Review.

      Either way, there is going to be the need for Client to be represented either as
      Applicant or Respondent in Judicial Review proceedings.

          MR BERNARD MURRAY

          I attach a copy of the letter from H.F.S.G* Clearly the hearing on Monday is going to
          go ahead so I would be grateful if you could make the necessary arrangements. I am
          trying to ascertain against whom they intend to seek a Witness Summons. I rather
          suspect that you might be the target. I am sorry that a letter addressed to you yesterday
          has wrongly been addressed to the Police Authority. In case it has not been forwarded,
          a copy is attached.

         Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Oades

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
OUR CLIENT: MR B MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of the 14th December, and we note the decision of the
Authority. Obviously we all anxiously await the decision of the Director of Public
Prosecutions. We are glad to know that our Client’s application can be brought before
the Authority without delay because it seems to us that either way he is going to be
a party to judicial review proceedings. If the Director’s decision is to take over these
proceedings quash them, then H.F.S.G. will undoubtedly take the matter by way of
judicial review and our Client will be a party. On the other hand if the Director’s
decision is not to intevene, Leading Counsel has already advised that our Client should
himself take the matter by way of judicial review. That was why we had sought the
decision in principle.

May we also respectfully refer to the supplementary request for financial assistance,
namely in relation to the challenge to the refusal of the Clerk to the Justices at South
Sefton to pay costs out of Central Funds. If that position is not challenged, then not
only will the Police Authority have to meet costs that in our view properly should
have been paid by Central Funds, but in the event that the D.P.P. does take over this
case and some Order is able to be obtained for further costs to be paid out of Central
Funds, the South Sefton refusal might be a precedent upon which no payment is
actually able to be obtained. What could be even more damaging would be if the
D.P.P. did not intervene, the case went to trial and at some stage, either by way of
submission or even a finding of not guilty by the jury, a similar Order were to be then
made for payment out of Central Funds, and again the South Sefton decision used as
a precedent.

At this moment in time, the costs involved are going to be relatively modest because
it will simply mean the liaison of the Cost Draftsmen of ourselves and Winckworth
to make a submission to the Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton.

Dear Miss Oades

Adlington -v- Duckenfield and Murray

I refer to your fax of 19 November and our subsequent telephone discussion.

I am grateful for your advice and courtesy in letting us know the position which of course if
now in the public domain.

In regard to any judicial review proceedings, I note your advice, and have seen Mr
Manning’s letter of 23 November. I echo his comments that it would appear that whatever
decision is taken by the DPP regarding intervention, it is likely that judicial review
proceedings will ensue. I would be grateful therefore if you could consider this letter as a
formal request for financial assistance to Mr Duckenfield to be continued to meet his legal
costs and disbursements in those proceedings. I will naturally provide further information
once we have any formal correspondence from the DPP or the CPS, and would be happy to
clarify any queries that you have.

When we spoke recently, I also raised the question of our claim for costs from central funds,
pursuant to the Prosecution of Offences Act which we are pursuing with the Clerk to the
Justices, South Sefton Magistrates Court in regard to the original proceedings. At the
present time the Clerk to the Justices has not accepted the claim, and has requested further
comments. I am attending to those submissions, but in the event the Clerk makes a formal
decision to deny the claim it is my view that a challenge to that decision is justified, both on
legal and commercial grounds, given the potential implication for the Leeds proceedings. I
will naturally keep you advised of the progress of that application but thought it may be
helpful to raise the question with you now for your early consideration.

Dear Ian

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Further to our telephone conversation of 21 December, I now enclose herewith a copy
of the letter that 1 have sent to Maureen Oades and I have included a copy of the
letter from the Crown Prosecution Service together with a copy of Leading Counsel’s
advices. In that regard, I retain the privilege in that advice for in no way do I want
any document received by you in this way to then have to be the subject of a
disclosure to the Prosecution or any other person.

I would appreciate your assistance in trying to get this authority approved as quickly
as possible.

Yours sincerely

            Dear Miss Oades

            We refer to recent letters namely ours of 2 0 November and your response of 14
            December. You are aware of the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as
            communicated through the Crown Prosecution Service not to intervene, a copy of which
            letter is attached hereto. The case came before Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 21 December
            and the proceedings have been adjourned to 7 January. That hearing is for a decision as
            to be made as to the issue of a witness summons inter alia against the Assistant Chief
            Constable of South Yorkshire and requiring the production of a vast amount of documents.

            At the Court Leading Counsel for Mr Murray and Counsel for Mr Duckenfield both
            indicated to the Stipendiary Magistrate that in view of the wholly unsatisfactory decision
            of the Director of Public Prosecutions it was intended to proceed by way of an application
            for Judicial Review.

            There is now attached to this letter a copy of the advice of Leading Counsel and Junior
            Counsel for Mr Murray, The way in which they put their veiy strong opinion is that this
            is not only of great importance to the Defendants in this case but raises a matter of public
            policy sofar as all Police Officers are concerned.

           We ask the authority to give most urgent attention to this request since it is intended to
           start work on Thursday morning at a meeting between ourselves and Leading Counsel.
           The application for Judicial Review will also include an application to stay the
           Magistrates’ Court proceedings pending determination of the Judicial Review so to that
           extent if it is granted, it may effect a saving of costs in the M agistrates5 Court
           proceedings. We expect to be able to give you an indication of costs within the next
           couple of days.

   D ear Sirs,



   RE;        ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY
              LEEDS MAGISTRATES* COURT - 21 DECEMBER 1998


   lit early July 1998, you wrote to the Crown Prosecution Scrvice asking that we take over, in
   order to discontinue, the criminal proceedings against your client which have been brought,by
   Ms Ann Adlington on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

   We have considered this request in detail,

   Mr, Duckenfield faces two charges o f manslaughter, one o f wilful neglect to perform a public
   duty and one o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice. Mr. Munray faces two charges o f
   manslaughter and one o f wilful ncglect to perform a public duty.

   Wc have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and all the
   surrounding circumstances o f the case. We have concluded that we should not intervene to
   take over any o f the charges.

  For your information I enclose a copy o f a press notice.

  Yours faithfully,




  Christopher H. Enzor
  Branch Crown. Prosecutor
                       A D L IN G T O N -v- D U C K E N FiE LD and M U R R A Y




                                                ADVICE



1.      The parties were notified on 18 December 1998 o f the decision by the C P S. not to
intervene to take over the conduct o f this prosecution and withdraw the charges. We consider
that decision to be plainly wrong. N o reasons were given, By letter ] 8 December 1998 from M r
Murray’s solicitors, the C.P.S. has been asked to explain both the factual basis upon which they
have acted and the policy which they purport to have applied, and to respond by 10 00am today.

2.     In our view, the decision is open to challenge in the High Court by application for judicial
review- Before finally advising and formulating the basis o f such a challenge, we would wish to
consider any response the C.P.S. cares to make, although it is likely that we already know how
they have come to their conclusion in view o f what they said to H FSG in earlier correspondence.

3        We can indicate that the principal basis o f the challenge is likely to be directed to:
         [a] the decision o f the D.P.P. in August 1990 that there would be no prosecutions arising
out o f the Hillsborough tragedy;
         [b] the Inquest verdicts in March 1991 of'acciden tal death’;
         [c] the February 1998 conclusion o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny that there was
not any material to be put before the D P P which might cause reconsideration o f the 1990
decision not to prosecute,
         [d] the statement o f the Horne Secretary to the H ouse o f Commons on 18 February 1998
that he, the Attorney-General and the D.P.P, had considered Lord Justice Stuart-Sraith’s Report
very' carefully, and that they had no reason to doubt his conclusions;
         [e] the absence o f any genuinely ‘new 5 evidence to undermine the earlier decisions.

4        The application is likely to raise questions o f law o f general public importance upon which
there is, as yet, no clear authority:
         [a] the scope o f the right to bring a private prosecution;
         [b] the duty o f the D.P.P, to institute and have the conduct o f any case where it appears
to him that ( I ) the importance or difficulty o f the case makes it appropriate, or (ii) it is o therwise
appropriate for proceedings to be instituted by him: s,3(2)(b) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act
1985;
         [c] the exercise o f the D P P . ’s powei to take over a prosecution where not under a duty
to do so: s.6(2);
        [d] the exercise o f the power to discontinue proceedings under $.23(3);
         [e] the policies adopted by the D.P.P/C.P.S. with regard to the above, with particular
reference to the facts and circumstances o f this case;
                                                                                           MU
                                                                                            n 0
      •n o n. no                                                                              Jf.0'flJ1
                                                                                                      1

            [f] the partiality o f the private prosecutor,

    5.       W e must take account o f the alternative couise open to us, namely to submit to the
    Magistrate that the proceedings should be stayed on the basis that they are an abuse o f the process
    o f th e court. I f judicial review failed, this submission would be made It cannot realistically be
    made before judicial review.

    6.        Obviously the chief constable will be concerned about the additional costs involved in a
    High Court action. From M r Murray’s standpoint alone, w e are satisfied that ft is proper to pursue
    such an application. One o f the arguments we shall advance is that it is inappropriate for the
    D P P to stand aside and let this particular private prosecutor continue the conduct o f a
    prosecution o f this seriousness and complexity. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found that HFSG
    submissions included propositions which he characterised as ‘irresponsible' Our own assessment
    is that their claims to have ‘new evidence' are contrived and spurious These are not the hallmarks
    o f responsible prosecution which every citizen charged with criminal offences is entitled to expect.
    In our view, they are not fit to have continued conduct o f the case, and that alone is sufficient
    reason for the D P,P. to have intervened.

    7.       But there is a broader issue which the chief constable mightwish to take into account. We
    are satisfied that the C.P.S./D.P.P. are applying inappropriate policies on the question o f

4^     Dear Miss Qades

       FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
       OUR CLIENT ! MR B MURRAY

       We refer to recent letters namely ours of 20 November and your response of 14
       December. You are aware of the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as
       communicated through the Crown Prosecution Service not to intervene, a copy of which
       letter is attached hereto. The case came before Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 23 December
       and the proceedings have been adjourned to 7 January. That hearing is for a decision as
       to be made as to the issue of a witness summons inter alia against the Assistant Chief
       Constable of South Yorkshire and requiring the production of a vast amount of documents.

       At the Court Leading Counsel for Mr Murray and Counsel for Mr Duckenfidd both
       indicated to the Stipendiary Magistrate that in view of the wholly unsatisfactory decision
       of the Director of Public Prosecutions it was intended to proceed by way of an application
       for Judicial Review.

       There is now attached to this letter a copy of the advice of Leading Counsel and Junior
       Counsel for Mr Murray. The way in which they put their very strong opinion is that this
       is not only of great importance to the Defendants in this case but raises a matter of public
       policy sofar all Police Officers are concerned.

      We ask the authority to give most urgent attention to this request since it is intended to
      start work on Thursday morning at a meeting between ourselves and Leading Counsel,
      The ^application for Judicial Review will also include an application to stay the
      Magistrates’ Court proceedings pending determination of the Judicial Review so to that
      extent if it is granted, it may effect a saving of costs in the Magistrates' Court
      proceedings. We expect to be able to give you an indication of costs within the next
      couple of days.

                                               ADVICE



 1.     The parties were notified on IS December 1998 of the decision by the C P S, not to
intervene to take over the conduct of this prosecution and withdraw the charges, We consider
that decision to be plainly wrong. No reasons were given. By letter 18 December 1998 from Mr
Murray’s solicitors, the C.P.S, has been asked to explain both the factual basis upon which they
have acted and the policy which they purport to have applied, and to respond by 1 0 .0 0 am today,

2.    In our view, the decision is open to challenge in the High Court by application for judicial
review. Before finally advising and formulating the basis of such a challenge, we would wish to
consider any response the C P.S, cares to make, although it is likely that we already know how
they have come to their conclusion in view of what they said to HFSG in earlier correspondence.

3      We can indicate that the principal basis of the challenge is likely to be directed to;
          [a] the decision of the DP.P in August i 990 that there would be no prosecutions arising
out of the Hillsborough tragedy,
         [b] the Inquest verdicts in March 1991 of ‘accidental death1;
         [c] the February 1998 conclusion of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny that there was
not any material to be put before the D.P.P, which might cause reconsideration of the 1990
decision not to prosecute;
         [d] the statement of the Home Secretary to the House of Commons on 18 February 1998
that he, the Attorney-General and the D.P.P. had considered Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Report
very carefully, and that they had no reason to doubt his conclusions;
         [e] the absence of any genuinely 'new' evidence to undermine the earlier decisions

4       The application is likely to raise questions of law of general public importance upon which
there is, as yet, no clear authority:
        la ] the scope o f the rig h t to bring a private prosecution;
        [bj the duty of the D.P.P. to institute and have the conduct of any case where it appears
to him that ( I ) the importance or difficulty of the case makes it appropriate, or (ii) it is otherwise
appropriate for proceedings to be instituted by him; s.3(2)(b) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
1985;
        [c] the exercise o f the D.P .P.’s power to take over a prosecution where not under a duty
to do so; s.6(2);
        [d] the exercise of the power to discontinue proceedings under s.23(3);
        [e ] the policies adopted by the D.P.P/C.P S w ith regard to the above, w ith particular
reference to the facts and circumstances o f this case;
         [fj the partiality of the private prosecutor.

5.      We must take account of the alternative course open to us, namely to submit to the
Magistrate that the proceedings should be stayed on the basis that they are an abuse of the process
of the court. Ifjudicial review foiled, this submission would be made. It cannot realistically be
made before judicial review.

6.        Obviously the chief constable will be concerned about the additional costs involved in a
High Court action. From Mr Murray’s standpoint alone, we are satisfied that, it is proper to pursue
such an application. One of the arguments we shall advance is that it is inappropriate for the
D,P,P. to stand aside and let this particular private prosecutor continue the conduct of a
prosecution of this seriousness and complexity. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found that HFSG
5ub™$sfons included propositions which he characterised as 'irresponsible*. Our own assessment
is that their claims to have ‘new evidence’ are contrived and spurious, These are not the hallmarks
of responsible prosecution which every citizen charged wiih criminal offences is entitled to expect.
In our view, they are not fit to have continued conduct of the case, and that alone is sufficient
reason for the D.P.P. to have intervened.

7.      But there is a broader i$$ue which the chiefconstable might wish to take into account. We
are satisfied that the C.P.S./D.P.P. are applying inappropriate policies on the question of
intervening to take over and withdraw prosecutions launched by private prosecutors. If the
present position is allowed to pass unchallenged, in every case where police officer is accused of
a criminal offence, but a CPS decision is taken not to prosecute, the aggrieved complainant will
be encouraged to launch a private prosecution in the knowledge that the C.P.S. will stand a$ide
and let the proceedings continue.

8.     Our arguments are already substantially prepared because we deployed them in our
submissions to CP,S.

            Dear Sirs,


            RE;      ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY
                     LEEDS MAGISTRATES" COURT - 21 DECEMBER 1998


            Tn early July 1998, you wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service asking that wo take over, in
            order to discontinue, the criminal proceedings against your client which have been brought,by
            M* Ann Adl&agtoa on behalf Of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

            We have considered this request in detail.

    A       Mr, DuckcnUeld faces two charges of manslaughter, one of wilfUl neglect to perform a public
    ^       duty and one of attempting to pervert the course ofjustice, Mr. Murray laces two charges of
            manslaughter and one af wilful ncgleet to perform a public duty.

            Wc have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and all the
            surrounding circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we should not intervene to
            take over any of the charges.

            F o r you*   information I enclose a copy of a press notice.

            Yours faithfully,

        Dear Miss Oades

        Adlington -v- Duclumfieid and Murray

        I refer to my letter of 10 December last in regard to judicial review proceedings, and
        confirm that we now have the advice from the Crown Prosecution Service regarding our
        request for intervention and enclose herewith a copy of their letter of IS December 1998,

          I have discussed this matter with Leading Counsel and am pleased to enclose herewith a
          short memorandum of advice regarding the desirability of making an application for judicial
          review of this decision.

          On the basis of that advice, which I strongly echo, may I formally request that the Police
          Authority agree to underwrite Mr Duckcnfield's costs of an application for judicial review
          of the CP S,'DPP decision not to intervene in this matter.

          It may assist you to know that we anticipate the framework for this will involve initially
          preparation of an Application with a supporting Affidavit wiiich Counsel hopes can be
          prepared withm the first 2 weeks of January. The documentation would then be submitted
          to the Crown Office of the High Court here in London, and it is likely that an oral
          application will have to be made before a Judge, requiring the attendance of Counsel, for
          leave to move for judicial review. The prosecution may or may not be heard on that
          application, depending upon the Court's approach, and we arc confident that leave will be
          granted. It is likely that the Court will order that the judicial review proceed expeditiously,
          and there is some possibility that the full substantive hearing, which will take several days,
          could be heard before the present committal date of 19 April 1999. A very rough and ready
          cost estimate for this exercise 1 would put in the region of £1Q,000-£15,000.

I hope the above assists, and naturally my client would be greatly reassured by an early
positive response from you in regard to the Police Authority decision. In the short term,
however, I would be grateful if you could let me know the mechanics of consideration of
this request so that we have some idea of the relevant timetable.

Yours sincerely

            Dear Sirs


            RE:      ADL1NGTON V DUCKENFlELD and MURRAY
                     LEEDS MAGISTRATES* COURT - 21 DECEMBER 1998


            In early July 1998, you wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service asking that we take over, in
            order to discontinue, the criminal proceedings against your client which have been brought by
            Ms Ann Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

            We have considered this request in detaiL

            Mr. Duckenfield faces two charges of manslaughter, one of wil ful neglect to perform a public
            duty and one charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Mr, Murray faces two
            charges of manslaughter and one of wilful neglect to perform a public duty,

            W s have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties aad all the
            surrounding circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we $hould not intervene to
            take over any of the charges.

            For your information I enclose a copy of a press notice.

            Yours faithfully,

                 Allowed to continue which have 'no realistic prospect

                 of conviction* and are contrary to tht teras of the

                 Code       for        Crown    Prosecutor*.               indeed    we    can   be

                 satisfied that if the Code had been applied to the

                 facts Qf hit case then the proceeding* would have been

                 discontinued.               we con assert this with some confidence

                 because we know that following the Taylor Inquiry the

                  joint advice of two leading counsel concluded that

                  there was mno sufficient evidence to support criminal

                 proceedings             of    any    kind".         Furthermore          following

            u nsupported                and     unsustained          allegations           of    the

                  suppression            of     evidence          before     the     inquiry     and

                  allegations of fresh evidence, a scrutiny was conducted

                  of all the relevant materiel by Lord Justice stuart-

                  Saaith who concluded that there was not any material

                  that should be placed before the Director of Public

                  Prosecutions which might cause her to reconsider the

                  decision taken n o t to prosecute.




                           It Is against this background that we need to

                  e*attdne the decision of the Director not to intervene.

                  If correct than the effect of the decision would be to

                    subject Hr* Bucke»£ieldr hie Co-defandant Mr. Murrey,

                    the     witnesses         end     fami lie*     of       the     bareaved     to   e

                    lengthy      end        costly     trial      that        had     "no    realistic

                    prospect of conviction". It would involve a system of

                    criminal law that would place anyone against whom a

                    scintilla of evidence existed in jeopardy for the rest

                    of their live* against a private prosecution motivated

                    by santimsnta far removed from any objective sense of

                     justice.




                            I   ma satisfied that the law does not penult a

                     private prosecution               to be brought               in circumstances

                     where there is "no realistic prospect of conviction".

                     To conclude otherwiee would render the likelihood of

                     a citizens prosecution dependant upon the depth of his

                     victims puree and his desire for revenge.




                             X am fortified             in my view by                a study of the

                     relevant Act.            The*Director of Public Prosecutions is

                     created by statute and derives all of his powers from

                     statute.          By virtue of Section 10 of the Prosecution

                     of     Offences          Act     1965     “the          Director       of    Public

rendering the decision not                to discontinue open                 to

r*vlew on that ground as trail*



         in roy opinion    Mr.   Duekenfield             ought          to   seek

judicial review o£ the decision by t.he Director of

      Dear Sirs,

      FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS -
      YOUR CLIENT: MR B MURRAY

      I write with reference to recent correspondence and wish to thank you for the detailed
      information disclosed in your most recent letter dated the 22 December 1998,

      Arrangements have been made for the Authority to consider your Client’s further request
      for financial assistance to meet his legal costs and disbursements in relation to the
      intended Judicial Review proceedings at the Authority’s next meeting which is to take
      place on the 8 January 1999. For the purposes of the report which will be submitted to the
      Authority,! shall be grateful if you will provide me with details of the response received
      from the C.P.S to your request that they explain both the factual basis upon which they
      have acted and the policy which they purport to have applied. In addition ! await receipt of
      your indication of the costs which wilt be involved in the Judicial Review proceedings.

      It is also my intention to advise the Authority of the difficulties being experienced in
      relation to the claim for costs from central funds. In this regard I shall be grateful if you will
      provide me with an update. If the Clerk to the Justices makes a formal decision to deny
      the claim, is it the case that any challenge to that decision would also be to the Divisional
      Court? Are you able to give any indication of the costs that would be involved?

Dear Mr Eastwood,

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS -
YOUR CLIENT M R D DUCKENFIELD

I write with reference to your letter dated the 10 December 1998, making a formal request
for financial assistance towards Mr Duckenfield’s legal costs and disbursements in relation
to Judicial Review proceedings. Since receipt of that letter, and following the decision of
the Director of Public Prosecutions not to intervene to take over the conduct of the
prosecutions, I have been advised by the Solicitors acting for Mr Murray that Judicial
Review proceedings are to be instituted in respect of the DPP's decision. In view of the
developments that have taken place I have arranged for the requests for further financial
assistance made on behalf of your Client and Mr Murray to be considered by the Authority
when it next meets on the 8 January 1999.

For the purposes of the report which will be submitted to the Authority I shall be grateful if
you will provide me with an indication of the legal costs and disbursements that will be
involved in proceeding with an application for Judicial Review.

I shall also be grateful if you will provide me with an update on the claim for costs from
central funds in connection with the proceedings before the South Sefton Magistrates
Court. Again if the decision of the Clerk to the Justices is to deny the claim, I shall be
grateful for an indication of the costs involved in challenging such a decision.

                   Dear Sir




                   1.          I am the prosecutor in the above ca se , in which the defendants are charged before the
                                Leeds M agistrate* C ourt with serious offences arising out o f the disaster at the
                                Hillsborough Football G round in April 1989, I w rite on the advice o f leading counsel,
                                as solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support G roup to express concern about the
                               decision to fund the defence o f these tw o men. As you know, the defendants w ere
                                senior police officers on duty at the ground when the disaster occurred. Both are
                               chargcd with manslaughter o f two representative victims, and with misfeasance. Mr
                                Duckentieid is also charged with attempting to pervert the course o f justice.

                   2,          (t has recently been admitted publicly by M r Ian Dairies, Assistant Chief Constable,
                               that the Snuth Yorkshire Police Authority has agreed to fund the defence o f these two
                               men We have suspected this for som e time. The purpose o f this letter is to argue that
                               the decision to provide finance appears to have been made irrationally and unlawfully.

                   -V          W e refer to the following documents, all o f which are in your possession.

                             J          A docum ent headed “ Standing Orders. Interpretation, Issued January 1906"
                                        on the headed paper o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority,

               4             The Home Office Circular No 77/87, suggests that, in the case o f a private
                             prosecution, where a police officer has been acquitted and has not been awarded all his
                             costs, the police authority may make up the difference. It also suggests that, in the
                             case o f a private prosecution, the authority should provide or fund legal advice and/or
                             representation if the authority is “satisfied" that the officer has acted “in good faith”
     0                       *n<* k * 5 exercised his judgm ent “reasonably” .

               T~~           The Home Office Circular           February 1998,4/1998, replaces with immediate
                             efleet the 1987 circular, and suggests that under the very w ide terms o f section 111(1)
                             o f the Local Government Act 1972, “ it could be argued’* that payment o f money to
                             "officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal proceedings would in some
                             way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority's broad functions,*’ The Circular
                             emphasises that a police authority must take its ow n advice. It is noticeable that the
                             “guidance" has been prepared after consultation with "A C PO ", the Superintendents
         So                  Association, the Police Federation, and the Association o f Police Authorities, it does
                             not purport to be an independent ic&al opinion

                          This Circular seem s to have coincided almost exactly w ith the report o f the “ Scrutiny”
                          o f Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith in February o f this year. I note that on 27,h February this
                 ^        year, your authority agreed to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to consider
                   , x, 7 applications from officers, serving or retired, for financial assistance in relation to

               7.        For a reason which is not clear, the Resolution was taken under the replaced 1987
 ^              .         Circular There is therefore no lawful authority to validate the decision taken on that
          x^        '    day. The assertion, recorded in the minutes, that the members o f th e Authority
                          “remain o f the opinion that the officers acted in good faith” is extraordinary, The
                          Enquiry o f Lord Justice Tayior o f 1939 found that there had been negligence, and
                          blamed the tw o defendants (am ong other police officers), The failure o f these tw o to
                          seal o ff the tunnel to the central pens at the Leppings Lane end o f the ground was a
                          "'blunder o f the first magnitude*”, and the immediate cause o f death. The then Chief
                         Constable o f South Y orkshire Police, unequivocably accepted these findings.

                               Sheffield Wednesday, at a time when he knew there w ere fatalities {and that there
     t                        would therefore be an inquest and no doubt other formal inquiries). Duckenfield
                              indicated that a gate had been forced and there had been an inrush o f supporters, and
                               pointed out to them the fate allegedly forced on the screen,

               ^              In 199s. Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith upheld these findings after his “Scrutiny” , referring
                              scathingly to Duckenfield’s “disgraceful lie” .

                       Hi     In July 199 l , the Police Complaints A uthority directed that charges o f neglect o f duty
                         ~    be preferred against both men. These charges w ere never determined because the
                               Cfiief Constable ofS tm tfrY orkshire retired M r Duckenfield on “health grounds", and
                               it was thought to be unfair to try M r Murray,

                       VI     It is impossible in the light o f this history to understand how your authority could have
                              been satisfied in February 199$ that ‘"the officers had acted in good faith"; and also
                              impossible to understand how the other condition in the (987 Circular, namely, that
                              the officers had exercised their judgm ent reasonably, could be thought to have been
                              satisfied, The minutes show that this condition was not even considered.

                       i2     The ! 998 Circular was not appl& dL Jfit had been, it w ould have become clear in my
                               view that ita term s w ere not met, and that there was no lawful authority for the
                               provision o f tax-payers' money in this way to fund the defence in this case. There is
                               no statutory authority. There is a limited pow er in relation to civil proceedings to pay
                               dam ages and costs; but no pow er even jn civil proceedings.to fund an action brought
                               against an individual officer. Section 88 o f the Police Act 1996 deals with “Liability
                               for wrongful acts o f constables", and allows for the provision o f costs incurred and not

                            excluded from that part o f the meeting when this m atter w as dealt with as it was a
                            m atter relating to "any action taken in connection w ith the prevention, investigation or

                            assistance that there w as no crime at all, and that the officers had acted in good faith,
             j             In any event it is submitted that paragraph 14 o f Schedule l2A_to the Local

                 17,       Furtherm ore, I do not understand how such a decision, even if it could be lawfully
                          made, could be delegated to the Clerk and Treasurer. The Authority resolution o f 27
                           February 1998 purports to delegate, absolutely, the decision making process to the
                          "Clerk and Treasurer 11 who is one and the same person. -The report presented to the

                          would thus understand the danger o f granting open-ended financial provision

                 18       You also ."uggest in that letter that this delegation “w as not viewed as a delegation
                          which w ould extend beyond six months” . This may have been because Mr Dairies,
                          Assistant C hief Constable o f the South Yorkshire Police, publicly asserted earlier this
                          year that he believed that any private prosecutions would “fall at the first hurdle” Did
                          he repeat thi& at the meeting o f 27* February? We do not know w hat applications have
                          been made by Mr M urray and M r Duckenfield, but w e assume, for reasons that appear
                          below, that authority has been given for any judicial review proceedings o f the CPS

                          old style committal proceedings, as well as at trial.

                 19       On IK1" December 1998, the Crown Prosecution Service.’after five months o f careful

                            ptosectitions. It is clear* that the criminal proceedings are now likely to be protracted,
                            complex and very expensive.




            20    ,         The prosecutions are straightforward. W e enclose for your guidance a copy o f the
                            informations presented to the Leeds M agistrates C ourt last July on the basis o f which
                            the sum m onses w ere issued. You will see that the allegations are based upon the
                            findings o f the Taylor Enquiry in 1989, supported by evidence that has com e to the
                            Family Support G roup in I W - 9 8 . Negligence has been adm itted again and again by
                            the C hief Constable in court proceedings, it has never been disputed that the acts
                            alleged against the defendants w ere the acts o f negligence that caused the deaths o f the
                            % people.

                            Before the decision o f the Crow n Prosecution Service was announced on ! 8 'il
                            December, the solicitor for M r M urray indicated that it w as highly likely that an
                            adverse decision o f the CPS would be challenged by judicial review proceedings. At
                            the hearing o f the case before the Leeds M agistrates C ourt on 21*' December, it was
                            made clear by leading and junior counsel for Mr Murray, in the presence o f his
                            solicitor. Mr Manning, and by junior counsel for M r Duckenfield, that a decision had
                            already been made to seek judicial review o f the CPS decision. The magistrate was
                            told this by counsel for the defendants when he was dealing with the questions o f
                            timetable and voluntary disclosure o f documents

                            H ow evei. it was also made clear, although a concluded decision had been made to
                            apply for judicial review, that the defendants had asked the CPS for their "reasons";
                            alternatively, their “policy*' behind the decision, and that those reasons or policy might
                            be received by 2‘1Ih December,

            23.             No legally-aided lawyers could proceed in this way, Professional obligations exist
                            which require that a lawyer must assess the prospects o f success before committing
                            hard-pressed public funds to an expensive application for judicial review. I am advised
                            by leading counsel that the prospccts o f quashing the CPS decision in such proceedings
                            are small on the following, among other, grounds. The C PS have told us all what
                            criteria (hey w ere applying; the defendants argued that the CPS w ere in a good
                            position to assess the public interest involved in the prosecution; the CPS, Police
                            Complaints Authority and C oroner w ere aillnisled by a cover-up by ihe South
                            Y orkshire police, the magnitude o f which has become apparent only after the Home
                            Office or dered the release o f document? this year; and the defendants have alternative
                            remedies in the M agistrates’ coun.

                            The tact that the court was assured that applications for judicial review would be made
                            suggests that the South Yorkshire Police Authority has already agreed, before the CPS
                            decision, to fund these applications, irrespective o f their merits. Counsel would not
                            have told the court that the applications would be made, if funding w as not in place.
                            Neither would they have told counsel for South Yorkshire Police o f their decision to
                            apply to the High Court ; they knew that the fact o f impending applicstions-was

                     material to decisions that the South Y orkshire police and the CPS were making that
                     day about voluntary disclosure to the prosecution o f docum ents in their possession It
                     is clear that both those bodies decided to defer any decision on voluntary disclosure
                     because o f the assurance from counsel that judicial review applications would be
                     lodged (“in the first tw o w eeks o f January") on behalf o f both defendants,


           25       The prosecution and the C ourt have also been told that both defendants have estimated
                    that four w eeks at least wil! be needed at committal proceedings. The court has set
                    aside four weeks beginning I 9 lh April 1099, and the time was chose to accord with the
                    convenience o f leading counsel for the defence. The court has been told that tw o
                    leading counsel will appear, one for each defendant. No doubt tw o juniors will also
                    appear, and tw o solicitors. Leading counsel for M r M urray has indicated that there
                    will also be an abuse o f process application to the m agistrate to stay the proceedings.
                    Ho intends to argue that this should be heard on a different occasion from the
                    com m ittal and before it. I suspect that the defendants will seek leave to move for
                    judicial review o f any adverse decision upon this issue. This is hardly surprising as
                    your Authority does not appear to have placed any restriction as to the am ount or
                    duration o f the financial assistance to the defendants.

            20.     I am advised by leading counsel that the prosecution has ¥ strong prima facie case on
                     the charges alleged, and that an abuse o f process application is likely to fail. We have
                     a mass o f evidence in our possessiorrw hich has com e to vis in the last year* indicating
                     that the South Y orkshire Poliue force h ascovered up facts which are embarrassing as
                     to the nature ynd extent o f its admitted negligence, and that the CPS, C oroner and
                     Police Complaints Authority, infer aha, w ere misled when they w ere pursuing their
                     various enquiries between 1989 and 1992. I shall willingly help you further about this
                     on request .

            27       O f eouhsc, the trial o f this m atter could take many months. From all these facts, you
                     will see that the exposure o f the South Y orkshire taxpayer (in relation to its own costs,
                     let alone ours) is o f the order o f millions o f pounds, I should make it clear that neither
                     I nor the Hillsborough Family Support Group, on w hose behalf 1 act, wish in any way
                     to deprive either defendant o f the means to ’conduct a proper defence to these charges.
                     They should surely apply, like anyone else, for legal aid if they sure unable to fund the
                     costs o f the defence themselves. In that event they w ould be subject to the usual
                     restraints and disciplines o f the legal aid system. I believe that the defence, with access
                     to public funds from your authority, are seeking at present to inflict unnecessary
                     expenses upon us by recourse to every possible type o f legal hearing, in the knowledge
                     that we do not have such access, and are instead dependent on private donations and
                     fund-raising events. N either defendant lives in South Yorkshire, but the South
                     Y orkshire Police has a strong interest o f its own in the discharge o r acquittal o f these
                     defendants,

     N ow that the DPP has decided not to intervene in the prosecutions the South Y orkshire Police
     w ould like to progress the issue o f disclosure o f copies o f relevant material from the Hillsborough
     archive.

     It has been suggested that the decision o f the DPP may be the subject o f judicial review proceedings
     by the Defendants, The South Yorkshire Policc do not propose to delay disclosure on the basis that
     such proceedings are being considered but will review the position if such proceedings are actually
     instituted and reserve the right to suspend disclosure pending the outcom e in that event.

     I should m ake clear that this decision has no effect on our position in relation to the application for
     the issue o f a witness summons directed to the Assistant Chief Constable. That application is due to
     be considered again on 7 January 1999 and if it is proceeded with it will be resisted.

     Reverting to the m atter o f disclosure the following points are relevant:

     1.                   A vast amount o f material has been requested, I must ask that you indicate your priorities so
                          as to enable attention to be directed first to the material which you consider m ost important.

     2.                  We have considered carefully the guidance o f the CPS to the effect that the consent o f a
                         witness should be sought before a copy o f his or her statem ent is made available. We believe

             that in the circumstances o f this particular case that may be an unreasonable requirement and
             subject to the safeguards set out in the following three paragraphs the Police are prepared to
             supply material w ithout that requirement being fulfilled. The safeguards are:

             2.1       The material supplied and any further copies taken will be used only bona-fide for the
                       purposes o f the present prosecutions and not for any other purpose whatsoever.
                       Aside from actual use in court it will be made available only lo legal representatives
                       o f the prosecution and, w here necessary, to expert or other witnesses.

             2.2       At the conclusion o f the prosecution all such material and any copies taken will be
                       returned to the South Yorkshire Police. The C hief Constable will be prepared to
                       consider alternative proposals for safe custody o f the material provided that such
                       proposals clearly continue to satisfy condition 2 . 1 above.

             2.3       In the case o f each item we shall require a brief explanation o f the relevance o f the
                       material tq one or more o f the charges.

                       Item 2.1 and 2.2 must be supported by your w ritten undertaking as a solicitor.

    3.       There will be a substantial cost in providing this material. R ather than charge on an item by
             item basis the South Yorkshire Police propose to use the services o f a docum ents officer and
             to charge his time at £30.00 per hour plus VAT. For the avoidance o f doubt the time charge
             will apply for any work in connection with provision o f docum ents or dealing with any other
             requests raised by the prosecution w hether dealt with in this letter or otherwise. That charge
             will include the cost o f all black and white A4 copying but an additional charge will be levied
             in respect o f the copying o f any videos, tapes, photographic prints or any other non-standard
             material including black and white photocopies o f non-A4 size. An account will be rendered
             to you every fortnight following commencement o f copying and this must be paid within 7
             days failing which provision o f material will be suspended. Given that the Hillsborough
             Family Support Group, who w e believe are your Clients, do not appear to have a legal
             personality, w e will require your personal solicitor’s undertaking that these charges will be
             met as outlined above.

    4.       Express guidance from the CPS is that there must be equality between prosecution and
             defence so that all material supplied will be copied at the same time to the tw o Defence
             solicitors. This will be chargeable to you on the basis set out above.

    5.       CPS guidance is that original statements should not be released from the archive. We are
             prepared to consider making appropriate arrangements for the inspection o f specific
             individual statem ents or other original material if good reasons are put forward.

    There is no reason why this process should not now commence quite quickly once th e term s above
    have been accepted,

    I look forward to hearing from you.

I have received your Setter of 30* December 1998 sent by facsimile,

I had spoken to Mr Crostoii of the CPS last week and to a different CPS lawyer yesterday,
before receipt o f your letter, I have been told that the intention of the CPS is to disclose the
material in their possession subject to any convincing objection in law that you might raise on
behalf o f South Yorkshire police, but Tam pleased to say that they will not be charging £30
per hour. No doubt you have also been in touch with Mr Crostort or his colleagues and been
told of their attitude already, 1 had assumed from the terms of your letter that you would not
be advancing any such objections but I am surprised to read in a letter from the CPS which I
received this morning that you are suggesting that the CPS should postpone their disclosure
pending the outcome of judicial review proceedings. There is no sense in proposing the
voluntary disclosure of material in possession of South Yorkshire police and asking the CPS
to withhold theirs.

 The reservation m the third paragraph of your letter makes the prospect of early disclosure by
your clients more apparent than real in any event. It is not correct to say that judicial review
proceedings are "being considered". On 21* December, leading counsel for Mr Murray and
junior counsel for Mr Duckenfield both told the court in unambiguous terms, in the presence
of the prosecution and your counsel, that an application for judicial review would be made and
Mr Harrison QC told the court that be intended that it would be lodged in the first two weeks
of January, He told the court this after Miss Varty had indicated that voluntary disclosure
would be withheld if such an application were to be made, and after prosecution counsel
protested at the potential delay in the disclosure process. (Miss Vaity Liter appeared to adopt
a more amenable attitude when the Magistrate suggested that many of the documents might be
disclosed by agreement between the parties so that the committal proceedings would be
conducted in an orderly and efficient way.)

                I am sure that, if the defence had changed their minds, or were now undecided as to whether
                to apply for judicial review, they would have told us, because they know that ihe CPS decided
                   delay a decision as to voluntary disclosure on the 21“' only by reason of the declared
                intention of the defence to challenge the CPS decision.

                The prosecution considers it wholly unreasonable o f the defendant to form, and act upon, a
                concluded decision to apply for judicial review, when they believe that the decision-maker may
                or will provide reasons for his decision within a short time. We must, however, accept the
                reality that attack upon the rationality of the decision is to be made whatever the reasons, and
                whether reasons arc supplied or not. I therefore ask you to tell me whether the Chief
                Constable will indeed “suspend” the process when the proceedings are ‘'instituted." (by which I
                surmise you mean lodged with the Crown Office) of it least explain why you cannot tell me
                now. 1 am sure that your clients will agree that it would be pointless to spend time and incur
                expense in setting up a procedure, and in installing a “documents officer”., if the arrangements
                were to be put into abeyance within a few days. I hope that you will throw more light on this.

                1 also request that you clarity the following mattery,

                (A)    Whai is the “guidance" to which you refer in paragraph 1 I understand that the
                       present position of the CPS is that they have no guidance to offer because they have
                       decided not to intervene. However, since last July the makers of statements have
                       requested copies u f their statements from South Yorkshire police, May w e please see
                       a copy o f the ^guidance” to which you refer, which apparently you have b e e n ignoring
                       for the last six months. Why were the statements not disclosed if such g u idan ce w as
                       given and the makers consented.

                (B)    What limitation is the proposed undertaking specified in para 2.1 intended to add, if
                       anything, to such undertakings as are implied in relation to disclosure by common k w 7
                       We note that you are not suggesting that the Defence give similar undertakings
                       Please explain why not.

                (C)    in para 2.3, you suggest that your client will “require*' a brief explanation o f the
                       relevance of the material to one or more of the charges. Such a position implies that
                       an individual decision on behalf of your clients is contemplated in relation to each item,
                       e ith e r to disclose or withhold. Do you propose to apply the test embodied tn section
                       v7A of the Magistrates Court Act, or some looser standard? if the test is to be
                       “materiality’’ you will understand that a court, after applying the same test, does nor
                       charge the prosecution for photocopying at a rate equivalent to a salary exceeding
                       £50,000 a year, and then make a further charge at the same rate for supplying copies
                       of the same material to the defence, I suspect also that the application o f the
                       ^materiality" test would be rather less generous in your hands than the Court’s. If the
                       proposed criterion is different, please set it out.

                (D)    The basis on which the exorbitant charge is to be levied is unclear The HSFG could
                       find a competent and trustworthy person to do the job for nothing except travel
                       expenses, or at a commercial rate of under £5 an hour. You may well be right to say
                       that VAT is chargeable, but I should like to know on what basis, and how the hourly

            rate has lr*e«s£t calculated, so that the HFSG can inform itself properly before deciding
            whether to authorise this tmuSwal expenditure, Please also iiiftifrn me of the detail in
—■          which the invokes will be drafted, so that we can be assured thaii the time and
            activities o f the documents officer will have been reliably set out,

(E)         You tell me that all material disclosed to us will also be disclosed to both defendants,
            Fortunately we can relieve you of that responsibility, At all three hearing hYo; e the
            Leeds District Magistrates5 Conn., the prosecution has raised the diffieultks a has
            experienced in obtaining documents front the South Yorkshire police and CPS, On
            each occasion it has openly Invited the defence to support its request to both these
            bodies that documents be disclosed, The prosecution, has pointed out that the
            defendants might reasonably expect that such disclosure might assist their case.
            However, on each occasion, perhaps mindful of cost, rhe defence have declined to
            support the request Instead they lave argued, that it: is for the prosecution to disclose
            to them all relevant material in their possession.

            Miss Varty will be able to confirm this in relation to 21wDecember, and Mr Manning
            will, we trust be prepared to confirm that this was also his expressed position at the
            earlier hearings. It is therefore wholly unnecessary for you to supply the defence with
            capias and to charge us for doing so.

            I f this does not cays© you to change your mind, please confirm that it is also proposed
            to supply the defence with any material that they may request, on what ^rxrfsn sad
            whether it is intended that such material will also he copied to the prosesriu-.fi ■« Ae
            expense of the defence (ie toe expense of the South Yorkshire Police Authtva'cy). You
            do not say if you have written, in swnilar terms to the defence solicitors, as opposed to
            merely sending them a copy of your letter to us,

(F) ■ Please inform me, in any event, why you propose to charge us for the &ry .
            deferf.ee o f the same material aus you send to us.. Such an arrangement -
            i.noekw y o f the “equality between prosecution and defense” which you i . . . .
             ■fie impaniality which you have professed in earlier letters,. Surely the defeats
            ;V■■v tbr their own copies. The prosecution have obligations of disclosure of ail relevant
            vuerial to the defence, which it wilt abide by, and at a fraction of the cost of your
               -.pensive “documents officer”. Fortunately as 1 have said, the defence will look to us,
            and not to you to disclose.

(U)         Who h it proposed will be rhe ‘‘documents officer”? Will he; have had m y previous
            connections with the Hillsborough inquiries and an interest of his own to protect? We
            have, already been alarmed to hear that the former custodian of the archive, PC
            Greenway, has been suspended from duty on suspicion of serious misconduct, but was
            nevertheless invited by your clients to inspect documentation in the archive on the 18!h
            December,

'There is a further objection to your proposal to charge us for copying material to the defence.
You know that the defendants! are in receipt of public money for their defence, namely, fund*:
from the South Yorkshire Police Authority, It .is ohvjniisj from Hi* fact that the defendants
      '98'    14:24    FAX 0113 284 7001                         SlT?f>AKI>^_ _                               ® 006




           have already announced a concluded decision to apply for judicial review, rhat the Authority is
           liberal with its money. It will obviously meet the reasonable copying of the defence, and, on
               basis of recent experience, there is every reason to believe that the Authority will accept
           even your proposed rates of charging, particularly when the money will be coming back to a
           body which it finances.

           When the prosecution applies in due course for its costs, it is unlikely that, upon conviction,
           the defendants would be ordered to pay the whole sum. In that event, or in rhe event of
           acquittal the prosecution would have to look to recover it$ costs from public funds, and will
           Face taxation. The taxing authority is unlikely to regard the costs which you stipulate for a
           pen.pn who is essentially a photocopier as in any way reasonable. The proposal we make to
           finance the cost? o f copying to the defence is undoubtedly more reasonable, and conducive to
           the saving of public money.

           I agree with you that the question of the issue of witness summonses is separate, and that any
           agreement we may reach does not prejudice our right to apply for such summonses, or your
           right to object to them, However, it is possible that we may agree about disclosure, and so
           avoid the necessity o f the application on 7,h January. The prospect of this will obviously be
           improved i f you reply to this letter today. If the hearing of the Th is unnecessary we would
           wish to inform the Leeds Court, which has always been helpful to us, as early as possible. No
           doubt the Court will con clu d e its business today Earlier than usual;

            We should tell you that the decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority to fund the
            defence vi one that we have challenged. We suggest that it was made unlawfully and
           'h rationally, as you liave no doubt heard. We shall be making further forma! representations to
            the Authonty, and will be copying the file as a matter of courtesy to the Chief Constable. If
            you have been advising either the Authority or the police in that matter, please let me know,
            so that: 1 can serve the papers on you directly.

           Yours sincerely

              Thank you for your fax of todays date at 2.18 pm asking whether the CPS would
              object to disclosure of the advice to your clients dated 15 July 1998. I appreciate the
              opportunity to comment.

              At this stage I would prefer it if the advice were not disclosed. The reason is that
              correspondence between the police and CPS is normally regarded as being privileged
              and would not normally be disclosed, particularly where that correspondence contains
              advice. My immediate concern is that disclosure of this document could lead to added
              pressure to disclose other documents which also attract privilege, such as other
              advices, including counsel’s advice. It may also cause problems if subsequent court
              proceedings are taken in order to force disclosure.

              Perhaps we can discuss this in more detail next week ,once you have had the
              opportunity of taking instructions.

*of your letter of 15 July 1998. We have no iastructioas on
this point at present but can you let us know if CPS would

           Dear Sirs

           R E : ADLINGTON v DUCKENJTELD AND MURRAY

           Thank you for your letter o f 23 December 1998.1 note the indication you have given
           o f the Assistant Chief Constable’s view on the question of voluntary disclosure in this
           case.

           The position o f the CPS is that we would wish to give voluntary disclosure of
           appropriate material to the HFSG as soon as possible. By 'appropriate’ I mean that
           material which would normally be disclosed, such as copy witness statements and
           copy exhibits. It is not our intention to make voluntary disclosure of documents which
           attract either public interest immunity or legal privilege. Therefore we will not
           voluntarily disclose advices or correspondence between us and the police.

           We have considered carefully where we believe the interests o f justice lie in relation
           to disclosure and we have concluded that they lie in favour. Accordingly we propose
           to indicate to the HFSG on 6 January 1999 that we will make disclosure o f material to
           them as soon as possible after that date.

           I appreciate the position o f the Assistant Chief Constable but we can see no proper
           grounds for withholding voluntary disclosure at this stage. In particular, we do not see
           that the commencement of judicial review proceedings is in itself a sufficient, ground
           for withholding disclosure. We are not aware of any other legal obstacle which would
           operate to prevent disclosure at this stage.

           We are tiying to be fair to ail involved in this case and, given the contents o f your
           letter o f 23 December 1998, we thought it only right to give you an opportunity to
           make any further representations which you consider might affect our decision about
           voluntary disclosure. Accordingly, if there is anything you wish us to consider please
           would you let me know by noon on 6 January 1999.

        I apologise for the tight deadline but I am aware that there is a hearing on 7 January
        1999 and I have indicated that as far as possible a decision will be made before then.

        Y ours faithfully

            Dear Sirs,

             RE;     ADJL TNGTON v D U C K E N FIE L D A N D M U R R A Y


             Thank you for your letter of 30 December 1998 addressed to Mr. Croston and I refer
             to our subsequent telephone conversation.

             I note that you have offered disclosure of evidential material to the Hillsborough
             Family Support Group. I also note particularly the point you drew to my attention,
             i.e. that you do not consider it necessary to obtain the consent of the maker.

             1 am consulting with others within the CPS about this position but I can tell you that
             my view is that there is a very strong public interest in ensuring that a fair trial takes
             place. Accordingly, my view is that it is not necessary to obtain the consent of the
             maker of the statement before proceeding to make voluntary disclosure.

             As discussed wilh you on the telephone, I will seek to assert privilege for a number of
             documents, such as counsel’s opinion, internal memoranda etc. I understand that you
             agree that this is the appropriate course and you will adopt a similar approach should
             there be any such material contained in the Hillsborough archive.

             Thank you for your assistance.

             Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr Enzor

I thank you for your letter of 3 P1December 1998. As you know there is a hearing listed at
Leeds District Court for Thursday 7,h January, which it may be possible to avoid, in the
interests of saving costs. We enclose a copy of the letters that have heen exchanged between
us and Hammond Suddards.

We should be very grateful to receive tomorrow your written confirmation that the voluntary
disclosure procedure will proceed in relation to CPS material. You will see that Mr Metcalf
has not indicated any objections to this CPS disclosure.

You will note that Mr Metcalf still claims to be relying on your “guidance”. I should be veiy
grateful if you could guide him so far as to suggest that he should not look to us to pay his
exorbitant costs o f copying to the defence the material we seek.


Yours sincerely

             Dear Ms Adlmgton

              Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989
             P riv a te P rosecu tion s - Release of Documentation



              Thank you for your tetter of 31 December 1098.



              It is disappointing that you do not indicate clearly an intention to accept the proposals which have

             been put forward but instead raise a number of issues many of which are at doubtful relevance,



             What ever may have been said in Court about a Judicial Review my understanding is that no

             proceedings have been commenced, [f such proceedings are commenced and/or leave is obtained

             the legal position will again arguably revert to v^ktt it was before the DPP’s decision was

             announced. In other words there will again be the possibility of intervention and tl is arguable that

             th© South Yorkshire Police should then revert to the original guidance of the CPS which was to

             await the decision before considering release of documentation.

       I am bound to point out that had you simply accepted the offer instead of raising this and the other

       queries the process of disclosure could by now be underway.



       You have askod for clarification on other matters and i am observing your paragraph lettering:-



       (A)        Guidance requested for the CPS by the Chief Constable is provided pursuant to the

                  Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and is confidential. You will have to take on trust that it

                  has been accurately summarised in our correspondence.



       (B)        1 do not know what undertakings could possibly be implied at common law. Unless it is your

                  intention to misuse the material you should have no problem giving the required undertaking.



                  7Tie difference between prosecution and defence is that you are asking for the material

                  whereas the defence is not        li is part of the CPS guidance that material be copied to the

                  defence if requested by and provided to the prosecution       Cleariy an undertaking cannot be

                  requested in circumstances where the CPS guidance requires that material be supplied,



       (C)        I suggest that you raise this point if and when, material which you request is refused on

                  grounds of lack of materiality.



       (P)        The proposed charge is a reasonable one, You ignore the fact that it will include the cost of

                  black and white A4 photocopying (both to yourselves and the defence), You also ignore the

                  fact that a documents officer cannot exist in a vacuum but requires office facilities and

                                                                                                   3
                                                                                     4

                                                                Hillsborough Family Support Group
       secretarial support. As to the drafting of invoices these will simply indicate the amount of

        hours spent in each period.        Under English law an explanation is requited if VAT is not

        chargeable rather than if it is.



(E)    This has being dealt with under (B) above.



(F)    This has been dealt with under (ft) above.



(G)    Quite $urtply this is none of your business.



1 do not think the balance of your letter requires co m mem save to note Llmi we are in agreement that

the question of voluntary disclosure is a separate matter from the Application for a Witness

Summons.



Turning to the latter we have reserved Counsel to appear at Court on 7 January 1999 and we do

need to know as soon as possible whether the hearing is to pioceed. Obviously we will be seeking

to recover costs if Counsel appears and tiie matter is then adjourned.



Yours sincerely

          Dear Ian,
                                          Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989: Release of Documents

          Here is the HFSG response to my fax of yesterday. 1 also attach a copy of a letter from Richard
          Manning asking for information about damages payments.

          Dealing first with the HFSG, two new questions are raised. On the face of it, it would seem
          reasonable to allow inspection of documents by specified individuals (who would have to be
          qualified solicitors or counsel) but on reflection it seems to me that there would still be a cost to
          SYP in sorting out the papers, providing a reading room and making arrangements for access, There
          would also be the question of whether supervision would be needed. There is also the point that
          besides listing numerous individual documents, which I understand are available, the Index to the
          Schedule to the draft witness summons requires production o f Li all witness statements on the master
          witness list compiled by West Midlands Police”, There is a major task here if all such items are
          intended to be included in the request.

              As to the second request 1 would have thought that there could be no objection xo providing relevant
              original documents to a court engaged in dealing with serious criminal proceedings. I would not be
              happy about providing such documents to a private prosecutor without authority either from the
              court or by way of guidance from the CPS,

              Turning to the request from Richard Manning I do not have the information sought. I believe that
              only the insurers are likely to have comprehensive information and they may or may not wash to
              reveal it Are you happy for the request to be passed to them? If so I will ask them to make clear
              that although the SYP insurers have dealt with all payments, they have done so on the basis of a
              confidential agreement with the insurers of the other parties concerned. All settlements have been
              expressed to be made not only on behalf of the Chief Constable but also on behalf of the other
              potentially liable parties.

              Yours sincerely,

      I note that you are concerned about the costs of Thursday’s hearing, My understanding o f the
      attitude to costs taken by the South Yorkshire Police Authority in this case leads me to believe
      th;u they are unlikely to leave you exposed.

      I should point out that the South Yorkshire police appeared at the hearing on 21*' December
      because the magistrate requested it. I had assumed that you were proposing to appear or be
      represented on 7* on the same basis. An application for a witness summons is usually made ex
      parte. You are not, o f course, obliged to be present, and we are not obliged to inform you of any
      application we make for such a summons.

      If you instruct counsel, that is because you have chosen to appear voluntarily at the hearing, and
      you cannot expect us to meet you costs, nor, if you threaten us with applications tor costs, can
      you expect us to inform you o f our intentions in relation to summonses in future.


      I look forward to your reply,



      Y ours sincerely.

          1. He wanted to discuss the letter from HFSG. We talked through the various issues and
          agreed on the points which needed to be made in response. We agreed that 1 would draft,
          something for his approval and that it should go out today I also told him about the exchange
          of correspondence with CPS. He reminded me that we ought to respond formally to the
          request for our views about disclosure. I said that 1 would send a response which would advise
          on our attitude without seeking to compel CPS to follow our lead.

          2. I referred to the telephone call 1 had received on 29 December and asked what was the
          position about Thursday, He said that (he relevant clerk was engaged bur would call back

          3. She said that LV was available and reserved tor Thursday. I said that so far as I knew we
          were going ahead but if there was any change 1 would lei her know, 1 would in any event call
          on Wednesday to agree a time to meet,

          4. He was happy with the draft and wanted it to go out today. In relation to Thursday he was
          available to attend court if need be. Assuming he was not required initially he was available to
          come to Leeds at short notice if developments indicated a need for this. I said that if there
          were no further developments I would let him have a report on Thursday

          We both thought that a further communication from the HFSG was likely although it seemed
          less likely that this would be a simple acceptance of our proposal.

Dear Mr. Croston
                                    H illsb o r o u g h S ta d iu m D isa ste r 1989: D o cu m en ts

1 refer to our telephone conversation today. 1 also acknowledge receipt o f Chris Enzor’s third fax
(14.40) o f 31 December 1998.

Developments since 24 December caused me to overlook the fact that you had been promised a
formal response to your earlier letter o f 23 December relating to privilege.

M y view is that none o f the material requested from South Yorksliire Police is in fact privileged and
I would prefer not to deal with the point until it arises. At that stage my view is likely to be that
before considering the question o f privilege it will be necessary to consider relevance. Generally I
would not expect correspondence between police forces and CPS and/or CPS and counsel (including
opinions) to be relevant to a prosecution because it usually represents comment on evidence rather
than evidence in itself.

I assume from our conversations and from Chris Enzor’s earlier faxes o f 31 December that CPS
will be taking a broadly similar approach in relation to disclosure. Clearly there can be no objection
to that course from the South Yorkshire Police. If, however, there are specific items which give rise
to uncertainty please do not hesitate to contact me.


Yours sincerely,

        Dear Ms Adlington

        RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

        Further to our telephone conversation of yesterday, I can confirm that the Crown
        Prosecution Service is now ready to give voluntary disclosure of relevant documents
        in our possession having considered representations from the South Yorkshire police.

        This disclosure will be in accordance with the procedure noted in our letter of 31
        December 1998 to you and which was copied to the solicitors for both defendants. It
        will be evenhanded as between the parties and will not include documents subject to
        legal privilege or public interest immunity.

        We consider that it would be right and proper to make a charge for this voluntary
        disclosure based on the cost price of the service provided to this office by our
        photocopying contractor. This would be a charge of 1.9 pence per page. However,
        we have decided that the first £50 of charges to any party will be paid by us . A bill
        for the remaining amount, if any, will be sent direct to that party from the contractor,
        Alphagraphics.

        I note your request in the last paragraph o f your letter of 5 January 1999. I regret that
        I am unable to advise the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire on any matter unless a
        formal request has been made by him or those acting for him. That is not the case
        here.

        Please contact me to arrange a date and time for your inspection of our documents at
        this office. I understand that Monday 11 January 1999 may be suitable to you.

        Yours s in c ^ ly ^           , ^

           RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

           Thank you for your two letters of 5 January 1999 addressed to this office.

           Your request to be given the reasons why the CPS is not intervening in this private
           prosecution is still being considered. I regret that I am unable to give you a date when
           a decision will be made however I shall contact you as soon as it is known.

           Attached is a copy o f our latest letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

           The Crown Prosecution Service is now ready to give you voluntary disclosure of the
           documents in our possession on the same basis as for the other parties to this
           prosecution. It is a matter for you whether you wish to accept this offer or not.

           In order to assist you I have enclosed a copy of the Schedules of the material in our
           possession at this office.

           Please contact me to arrange a date and time for any required inspection of these
           documents.

           Yours faithfully

    Dear Sirs

    We have been told in the last couple o f hours (although we still await written confirmation),
    that the CPS are prepared to give voluntaiy disclosure within the next few days. Indeed, they,
    were prevailed upon to give this decision in advance of tomorrow’s hearing. To a large extent
    this now obviates the need for a witness summons at this stage as there is likely to be an
    overlap between the CPS material and the material in your archive. The possibility that this
    might happen was pointed out to the Stipendiary on 21” December. We have therefore
    informed the Leeds District Magistrates’ Court that we do not propose formally to apply for
    summonses tomorrow. We await confirmation that the Stipendiary Magistrate agrees that
    tomorrow’s hearing be vacated without attendance by any party.

    Finally, I have just received your fax, to which I shall respond as soon as reasonably
    practicable.


    Yours faithfully

        Dear Ms Adlington

        H illsb orou gh S tad iu m D isa ste r 1989
        P rivate P ro secu tio n s - R elease o f D ocu m en tation

        Thank you for your fax timed at 11:47 on 5 January 1999.

        1 must say at the outset that your request for a response by 5:00 pm yesterday was unrealistic. Both
        I and, more particularly, the Assistant Chief Constable have other responsibilities besides dealing
        with your correspondence. It seems to me that your request for an urgent response has been
        dictated by your linking the issue of disclosure of documents from the Hillsborough archive with the
        hearing dealing with your Application for a Witness Summons.

        We have already made it clear that we do not regard the two issues as connected and the
        Application for the Witness Summons will be resisted if persisted with.

        If you are linking the two issues then it was clearly not sensible for your Leading Counsel to urge the
        Stipendiary Magistrate to re-list the matter for hearing so quickly, bur that is a problem entirely of
        your own making

        Turning to the substance of your letter 1 note that you stiJl do not actually indicate whether or not
        you will be taking up the disclosure offer which was made a week ago.

        To deal with the different points which you do raise.-

         1,          Subject to the previously mentioned points made at 1 (priority) and 2.3 (materiality) of my

                    yourself to be involved you must state who they are and confirm their legally qualified status.
                    If the Defence wish to inspect documentation they will have to ask.

                    What must be clearly understood is that there are cost implications in providing the
                    documentation for inspection and the same charge as previously mentioned will apply in
                    respect of the sorting of documents to and from the archive, the provision of inspection
                    facilities and the presence of the documents’ officer to deal with any queries.

           2,       Turning to the question of production of original documentation the first point to be made is
                    that if a Court of competent jurisdiction orders the production of any documentation then
                    such an Order will of course be complied with.

                    Subject to that I should say that the original CPS guidance was that it would be
                    inappropriate for original statements to be removed from the main Hillsborough archive.
                    Their suggestion was that if copy statements had been provided then it should be a simple
                    matter for new originals to be prepared by the prosecution and used in Court proceedings.

                    As to other evidence I have not inspected the archive but I believe that a very large number
                    of the items in it will themselves be copies rather than original items. Where however an item
                    is clearly identified as original and is required for production at Court then subject to the
                    Court agreeing to accept custody of that item 1 would not anticipate this presenting any
                    problem.

 Dear Ian

 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989 - Private Prosecutions

 Further to our telephone conversation the prospect of a lull in activity leads me to try and tidy up my
 file and ensure that you have copies of the most recent letter from the HFSG announcing the likely
 postponement of the hearing and also copies of earlier correspondence with the CPS which I have
 mentioned over the phone but not actually copied to you.

 Copies of these items are now enclosed to complete your file.

 If they give rise to any queries please do not hesitate to telephone me.                                                                      ^ 7^

          Dear Sirs

          HILLSBOROUGH: Adlington v Duckenfield and M urray

          Enclosed is a copy of our latest letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group and which
          exp'ains the policy that will be applied in this case. While we would wish to complete the
          CPS review as soon as possible we do need to be assured that we have all the relevant
          evidence before us when coming to our decision.

          Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH: Adlingtou v Duckenfield and M urray

Thank you for your letter of 20 July 1998 addressed to Mr C.H.Enzor and informing us that
you have taken over the conduct of the case from Watts Leather. Mr Enzor has asked me
to reply on his behalf as I am involved in the CPS review of the papers.

Following the receipt of the Watts Leather letter of 30 June we had been in communication
with them and were about to send a more substantive reply. I shall incorporate that
information in this letter.

I am aware that the original summonses issued at South Sefton Magistrates’ Court have been
withdrawn because of perceived problems with the court’s jurisdiction. Thank you for your
confirmation that summonses were issued on 13 July returnable for 20 August 1998 at Leeds
Magistrates’ Court.

You may already know that the two firms of solicitors acting separately for Mr Duckenfield
and for Mr Murray have formally requested the Director to exercise her power under section
6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the conduct of the proceedings
instituted by the private prosecutor for whom you act, and then to discontinue under section
23 of the Act.

It may help if you were acquainted with our policy in cases of this type. The Code for
Crown Prosecutors contains the principles that apply to the CPS review of criminal
proceedings started by the police. There are two scagcs in the decision to prosecute. The
first being the evidential test. If the case does not pass that test, it must not go ahead, no
matter how important or serious it may be. If the case does pass the evidential test then a
Crown Prosecutor must decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest. This second
stage is the public interest test which I shall come to later.
The evidential test is an objective one and a Crown prosecutor must be satisfied that there
is enough evidence to provide a ‘realistic prospect of conviction’ against each defendant on
each charge. In ether words a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance
with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the offence charged.

Where there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction the public
interest must be considered. Crown Prosecutors must balance the factors for and against
prosecution carefully and fairly.

The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private prosecutor builds on that
contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The right to bring a private prosecution is
preserved by section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 subject to the power under
section 6(2). The CPS will take over a private prosecution where there is a particular need
for it to do so on behalf of the public.

As you know the original review decision released in August 1990 was made following the
joint advice received from two leading counsel. The advice was that there was "no sufficient
evidence to support criminal proceedings of any kind against those mentioned in the West
Midlands Report". The subsequent Press release made on behalf of the Director of Public
Prosecutions was that there was "insufficient evidence to justify the institution of proceedings
against any officer in the South Yorkshire Police Force or any other person for any other
offcnce".

Following the showing of the Jimmy McGovern drama documentary on national television
in December 1996 and the representations made to us by a number of parties including the
HFSG on 4 March 1997, the CPS commenced a further review of what was said to be ‘new
evidence’. Our responsibility focused on whether or not there was new material, which, if
properly investigated, might lead to a realistic prospect of conviction of any person. The
conclusion that was reached was that there were no grounds for reopening the police
investigation into the Hillsborough disaster. In the subsequent Scrutiny set up by the Home
Secretary, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was asked to ascertain whether any evidence exists
relating to the disaster which was not available to the Director of Public Prosecutions for the
purpose of discharging her statutory responsibility. His conclusions are laid out in detail in
his report and in Chapter 7 he says that he does not consider there to be any material that
should be put before the DPP or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them
to reconsider the decisions they had taken. These decisions were made in accordance with
the principles laid down in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. It was decided that there was
insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.

In the instant case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over the prosecution
in order to discontinue it, we would do so if one (or more) of the following circumstances
applies:

•      There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution commenced in these
       circumstances would be unfounded, and would, therefore be an abuse of the right to
       bring a prosecution.

•      The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those
       factors tending in favour.
•      The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.

The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our policy.

If none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to become involved and we
would not interfere with the private prosecution.

Clearly there is a distinction between the "realistic prospect of conviction" test in the Code
and the "clearly no case to answer" test mentioned above. Accordingly we recognise that
there will be some cases which do not meet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will
not intervene. It has been considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions
would unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.

Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be assured that all relevant material
has been considered. While we have access to material available to the Taylor Enquiry, the
Inquests, the judicial review hearing in the High Court and that submitted to us by the
Hillsborough Family Support Group, it may be that other important evidence is not known
to us. You have kindly provided the CPS with schedules of evidence in your possession and
we have asked the solicitors for the defendants for the same information. Where there is
evidence that we have not seen we shall be asking the relevant party for voluntary disclosure
of the same.

Until there has been a detailed review of the many papers in the case the Crown’s position
cannot be determined. This review will of necessity take some little time to complete. I
regret that at the moment we are not able to give a date for the promulgation of the decision
but I can assure you that our review will be expedited.

In order to be assist your review of the papers involved in the private prosecution I shall
arrange for a schedule of our papers to be sent to you as soon as possible. However this will
not apply to those documents subject to either public interest immunity or to legal privilege.

Under the circumstances outlined above we do not feel that it is appropriate for us to
consider your request for voluntary disclosure of our case papers until our decision has been
made.

We have advised the Chief Constable for South Yorkshire Police on disclosure of documents
in his possession in similar terms to those above.

I shall be writing to the solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray enclosing for them a
copy of this letter.

Following our review I should be able to advise in more detail as to the stance we take on
the other issues raised by yourselves.
Please let me know if there is any way in which I can assist you farther.

Yours faithfully

Dear Ms Jackson

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

Thank you for your letter of 15 February 1999 in which you seek information about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster (1989). You ask for clarification of some issues as you
"intend to raise the matter in the Commons today" (para 3). Clearly I could not answer your
letter (which arrived on 16 February 1999) in time to clarify issues before you raised the
matter in the House of Commons.

Your questions are ones which can only be answered by the Clerk to the South Yorkshire
Police Authority and I wonder if you could redirect your queries to him.

You wrote on 1 February 1999, I replied by fax on 3 February 1999. I wrote to you again,
fully and in confidence, on 11 February 1999. I trust that you have now received my letter
of 11 February 1999. When you write to the Clerk he may find it useful to be supplied with
copies of those earlier letters.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Hedges,

I wrote to you recently - on 1st February about my concerns with regard to
the Police Authority expenditure on making an open ended funding
commitment to former Police Officers Duckenfield and Murray to support
their defence against the private prosecution being taken by the
Hillsborough Families support group.

I am aware that since then the Authority has met and decided to look
further into the legal and political base for this spending. I understand
that your response has been to seek to challenge this decision in the High
Court.

I intend to raise the matter in the Commons today, and would be grateful
for further clarification.

Was the commitment agreed in the report to the Authority following the
Stewart Smith enquiry cash limited ? If so at what figure ?

What expenditure has been authorised during this financial year on
defence costs for each o f the two former officers ?

How many and to what value have the officers’ solicitors submitted
invoices which have not been met yet ?

                Tel: 0114 232 2439 Fax: 0114 285 5808
Why was such a huge commitment delegated to Officer confirmation ?

What money has been spent on legal defences o f Police officers apart from
those connected to the Hillsborough tragedy over each of the past ten
years ?

What money has been spent to date, year by year, on defending the
officers involved at Hillsborough ?

What is the estimated cost o f the High Court action which you have
authorised following the Police Authority decision two weeks ago ?

I look forward to hearing from you


                             Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Jackson

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

Last week I wrote to you and promised to write again after the Police Authority meeting on
5 February 1999. I am now able to provide a more detailed response to the points you
raised. It may help if I summarise some of the principal facts of the disaster. I will then go
on to make some observations about these specific private prosecutions and then make
some general observations on private prosecutions.

On 15 April 1989 an FA cup semi final football match was due to be played at the home of
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club; the Hillsborough Stadium. Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest were the two teams.

Overcrowding occurred in the areas behind the Liverpool goal in the period immediately
before and after the 3.00 pm kick off. The crowd crush caused the deaths of 96 spectators
(95 people died that day, one person lived in a vegetative state until his death in 1993).

The disaster happened in full view of over 50,000 spectators. It was transmitted, as it
unfolded, by BBC Television. It was recorded by the football club’s CCTV system and the
police CCTV system. Sports photographers took hundreds of still photographs. The
impact of the Hillsborough Disaster is unique because it was beamed live into the homes of
millions and was recorded so graphically.

Lord Justice Taylor was invited to conduct a public enquiry and the West Midlands Police
were commissioned to gather evidence. The Taylor enquiry considered 3,776 statements,
1,550 letters, 71 hours of video tape, hundreds of photographs and the personal and public
testimony of 174 witnesses. Taylor’s interim report (published 4 August 1989) analysed the
causes of the disaster and apportioned blame.

In March 1990 the West Midlands Police submitted a report to the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP). In August 1990, Mr Allan Green, then the DPP, concluded that there
should be no prosecution of any person for any matter arising from the disaster.

Between November 1990 and March 1991 the Sheffield Coroner and jury heard 230
witnesses. The jury returned verdicts of accidental death. In 1993, relatives of six of the
deceased applied to the High Court to quash the inquest verdict; the High Court turned
down the application. In December 1993, the West Yorkshire Coroner returned a verdict of
accidental death of the 96th victim who had recently died.

CONFIDENTIAL

In December 1996, Granada Television broadcast a drama programme titled,
“Hillsborough”. The drama purported to show the discovery of significant evidence which
had not been considered by previous enquiries. The Hillsborough Family Support Group
(HFSG) is an association of some of the relatives of some of the deceased. They pressed
for a fresh enquiry into the disaster.

In June 1997, the Home Secretary announced the establishment of a scrutiny to look into
the reports that fresh and relevant evidence had been found. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, an
Appeal Court Judge, reported in February 1998. He found that there was no relevant
material which should be put before the DPP which might cause her to reconsider the
decision not to prosecute. The DPP, then Dame Barbara Mills, considered the position and
decided there should be no prosecutions. The Home Secretary, and other Government
Ministers, accepted Stuart-Smith’s findings.

In June 1998, the solicitor to the HFSG, Ms A Adlington, began a private prosecution at
Sefton (Merseyside) Magistrates against David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray. Mr
Duckenfield was a chief superintendent at the time of the disaster and was in charge of the
police operation. Mr Murray was a superintendent and was in charge of the control room
arrangements. They are each charged with the manslaughter of two named individuals
and with the criminal offence of, being a public servant, neglecting their duty (culpable
malfeasance in public office). Mr Duckenfield is also charged with attempting to pervert the
course of justice.

The Police Authority agreed to pay the costs incurred by Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray in
defending themselves against these private prosecutions.

Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray challenged the jurisdiction of Sefton Magistrates, the case
was withdrawn and Ms Adlington started them afresh at Leeds Magistrates.

The DPP has a legal right to intervene in a prosecution initiated by a private person. He
can take over the prosecution and pursue it or take it over and discontinue the prosecution.
Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray invited the DPP to take over the prosecution and discontinue
it. On 18 December 1998 the DPP, now Mr David Calvert-Smith, announced that he would
not intervene to continue or discontinue the prosecutions. If the DPP had been satisfied
that there was sufficient evidence to be confident of a conviction and that the public interest
required a prosecution, Mr Calvert-Smith would have been obliged to take over the
prosecution and conduct it through the Crown Prosecution Service.


Some Observations on the Private Prosecution

Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have not been living abroad, they have not been in hiding;
they have been available for prosecution throughout the (nearly) ten years since the
disaster. One must therefore ponder why the private prosecutions were not started earlier.
CONFIDENTIAL

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny was established largely because of claims by the
Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) that they had uncovered significant fresh
evidence. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith decided those claims were not accurate and referred
to some of their arguments as ‘irresponsible’. After his report was published, HFSG again
claimed to have uncovered fresh evidence.

After beginning the private prosecutions, Ms Adlington wrote to me to ask for copies of all
the witness statements. It is normal procedure to gather evidence before launching a
prosecution, not after. This leads me to conclude that HFSG do not have the relevant fresh
evidence they claim to have discovered.

Three Directors of Public Prosecutions (Mr Green, Dame Barbara Mills and Mr Calvert-
Smith) have each reviewed the case and decided not to prosecute.

The HFSG are not just conducting a prosecution against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray,
they also lobbied the Authority to cease funding the cost of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s
legal defence. Thus the HFSG are seeking to impose a financial penalty on Mr Duckenfield
and Mr Murray and to limit their ability to defend themselves.

Members of the HFSG have said that it is unfair that they have to struggle for funds while
Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have access to the Authority’s funds. I do not know what
funds are held by HFSG or whether they publish accounts. In summer 1997 a pop concert
raised a reported £500,000 for their funds. It is incumbent upon the prosecutor to be in a
position to sustain the prosecution. Neither I or my legal advisors have before encountered
a case where a solicitor prosecuting a case has tried to influence the funding arrangements
for the defence. In her submission to the Authority, Ms Adlington made it clear that she
sought a revocation of funding in order to influence the defendants’ ability to defend
themselves.


General Observations on Private Prosecutions

Police officers have to make split second decisions which affect people’s liberty and even
their lives. Those decisions are open to challenge through the police complaints
procedure, action in the civil courts and action in the criminal courts.

Private individuals can initiate prosecutions, that is a valuable safeguard against official
inertia. The DPP can terminate a private prosecution, that is a valuable safeguard against
capricious prosecution.

Home Office Circulars offer Authorities guidance on how to deal with applications from
officers for funding to meet the cost of defence against a prosecution.
CONFIDENTIAL

Some commentators have suggested that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s costs are taking
funds away from the policing of South Yorkshire. In a superficial sense that is correct but
that is not a situation of their choosing. However at a more profound level the decision to
pay their costs sustains the morale of the Force and its efficient functioning.

I consider it vital to the morale and good management of the Force that officers should
know that, if they act in good faith when performing their dangerous duties, the Chief
Constable and all the Police Authority will do whatever it can to support them. If officers do
not have that confidence, they will push decisions up the rank structure, thereby delaying
resolution of problems and reducing the ability of managers to manage. In medical circles,
the fear of litigation is prompting talk of “defensive medicine”; using valuable resources to
eliminate every conceivable cause of illness. In policing terms, “defensive policing” would
mean that officers would be less inclined to make those necessary split second decisions of
life and liberty if they thought that, years after the event, after previous enquiries, they
might face the cost of defending themselves against the action of a private individual.

At it’s meeting on 5 February 1999 the Police Authority members received independent
legal advice to the effect that there was no power in law for them to fund the legal
expenses of police officers (serving or retired) who face private prosecutions. The Chief
Constable’s legal advice is that they do have such a power. Indeed, Home Office Circulars
offer guidance on how Police Authorities should exercise that power. This implies that the
Home Office accept that there is such a power.

The Chief Constable has received letters from the President of the Association of Chief
Police Officers, the Chairman of the Superintendents’ Association and the Secretary of the
Police Federation, all of which refer to the long standing understanding that Police
Authorities across the country have this power and have exercised it. Because this is an
important matter of national interest highlighted by this specific case, the Chief Constable
has applied to the High Court for a legal determination of whether the power exists.
Unfortunately, this clarification of the power will itself involve substantial legal bills. The
Chief Constable will be writing to the Home Secretary to ask for central government funding
and any support you can offer would be much appreciated.

I hope this more detailed response provides a fuller picture than I was able to provide in the
limited time available last week.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Jackson

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989:
Private Prosecutions of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray

I refer to your letter of 1 February 1999 to the Chief Constable on theabove subject. I refer
also to our telephone conversation of midday, 3 February 1999.

A number of issues have been raised about the South Yorkshire PoliceAuthority’s decision
to meet the defence costs of retired officers who face private prosecutions. The Authority
will meet on Friday 5 February to discuss that advice.

I cannot say any more at this stage but we were able to discuss matters informally and
confidentially. I hope I was able to shed some light on this complex issue.

I will write again next week, after the Authority’s meeting.

Yours sincerely

Dear

Funding of the legal costs of former Police Officers, Duckenfield and
Murray.

I was most concerned to hear from my colleague, Maria Eagle about the potential cost
to the Police Authority of South Yorkshire Police’s intentions to start to fond the civil
defence case of former Police Officers, Duckenfield and Murray.

I unfortunately only heard about it after we had our meeting in the Commons, and was
sorry not to be able to talk directly to you.

It does seem to me that it is hard to justify as one of the Authority’s top priorities just
now, when you are making some good efforts to build up community confidence in the
Force.

I understand from the newspapers that the decision is to be reviewed. I should be
grateful if you could let me know exactly what the situation is and when a decision on
this spending will be made.


                                     Yours sincerely

 Dear Bill

 Financial Costs Involved in the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

 I refer to your letter dated 18 February 1999. Please find attached a copy of a letter I have
 sent to Peter Metcalf concerning costs of advice to the Chief Constable.

 The Chief Constable has written to the Home Secretary to ask for central government
 assistance towards the cost of the judicial review of the Authority’s recent decisions. A
 reply is awaited.

 My reading of your letter is that you are collating the costs incurred by David Duckenfieid
 and Bernard Murray. I trust I have got this right.

 Yours sincerely

                          num ber of changes to the recorded comments of p olice who w ere at the H ills b o ro u g h ground has been
                          uncovered by T he Sunday Telegraph.
 "no officer, senior or otherw ise, c a m e to inform us of what had happened", w as removed.
              How ever, his words: “Radio traffic was non-existent all through this tim e, as w as a lack of direction from supervisory
     officers,” w ere changed to: “Radio messages being passed w ere more difficult to understand an through this time,"
             M r Hicks said the paper’s study had uncovered new revelations which Justified a public inquiry into the H ills b o ro u g h
     tragedy. "W e are concerned that adverse references to the behaviour of the fans [on the day of the tragedy] were left in but any
     derogatory rem arks about the p o lic e service, particularly senior officers, w ere sanitised or dim inished.”
             T h e original written recollections w ere drawn up by officers within days of the tragedy but m any w ere am ended - on the
     advice o f solicitors acting for the South Y o rk s h ire police or in som e cases the force itself - when they w ere presented formally
     as statem ents to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry, which began the following month. Within three months Lord Taylor had concluded
     in an interim report that ’’the main reason for the disaster w as the failure of police control".
             T h e 222-p age report by Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith, requested by M r Straw shortly after Labour cam e to power, led the
     H o m e S ecretary to decide that there was no need for a public Inquiry to review alleged new evidence. However, relatives of the
     victims suspect that M r Straw 's private concerns over th e report's findings may have led him to open docum ents on the tragedy
     for public scrutiny.
              Lord Stuart-Sm ith referred to som e am ended statements w here he concluded "it would have been preferable for the factual
     matters not to h ave been excluded, or the com ment elucidated". Parts of original and revised statem ents from 11 officers which
     caused him concern are listed in the appendix.
              T h e appendix includes the altered statem ent of Pc David Frost, who told the "scrutiny of evidence” that he, and other
     unnam ed officers had refused to sign their am ended statements. “This was an attem pt by senior m anagem ent to sanitise and
     protect them selves; and any honour that the South Y o rk s h ire P o lic e , which I thought at the tim e w as considerable,
     disappeared fo rm e ."
              Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith also heard from Professor Phil Scraton, a legal expert from Edge Hill University College in
     Orm skirk, Lancashire, who described the taking of officers' statements as "highly Irregular and leaves itself open to accusations
     of w idespread and institutional malpractice; it does sm ack o f ‘ getting our stories right before they go to the investigation force’ .,
                 Yesterday Prof Scraton, who has conducted his own exam ination of more than 1,000 p o lic e and witness statements
     since Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith's report w as published, said: 'T h e re is no question that statements were changed which went
      far beyond com m ent and opinion." He said the judge's report had vastly underestim ated the extent o f om issions and alterations.
              Prof Scraton aiso said that the final chapter of his new book, H ills b o ro u g h : the Truth, to be published next month,
     “com pletely takes the lid of the statem ent-taking process”.
              Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith acknowledged in his report that the South Y o rk s h ire force was on "the defensive" and was keen
     "not to give anything a w a y ”. H ow ever, he dismissed the allegations from Pc Frost, who left the force shortly after H ills b o ro u g h ,
     and Prof Scraton in his report. Th© judge said that the statements had been altered by the force’s solicitors to clear up
     am biguities and rem ove hearsay, com ment or inappropriate language.
              H e noted, too, that the South Y o rk s h ire force had suggested further changes to the statem ents, without referring them to
     th e solicitors, but concluded that in most cases the alterations w ere “trivial" and there had been no cover-up.
              "in no case is the statem ent rendered misleading. I am quite satisfied that Lord Taylor's inquiry w as not in any way inhibited
     or im peded by w hat happened . . . I am also satisfied that the exclusion of these comments did not affect the outcom e of the
     inquests or the decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to bring criminal charges as a result of the disaster. I do not
     consider that there is any question of misconduct either by the solicitor who gave the pafico advice upon the statem ents or by
     the p o lic e officers w ho suggested the alterations to the statem ents without referring the statem ent to the solicitors"
              T w o form er senior p o lic e officers, w ho have both retired from the force, face a private prosecution from the H F S G for
     alleged unlawful killing and wilful neglect of public duty.
              C h ief Superintendent David Duckenfield and Superintendent Bernard Murray deny the accusations, it is not suggested that
     either w as involved in form er colleagues altering statements to remove criticisms,
              This weekend both Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith and D r Stefan Popper, the coroner at the 1991 inquest, declined to comment
     on the n ew study of p o lic e statem ents by T he Sunday Telegraph.
              Both th e South Y o rk s h ire force and its solicitors denied that there was sufficient new evidence necessary for Mr Straw to
     order a public inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.
              How ever, tan D aines, assistant chief constable of South Yorkshire p o lice , conceded yesterday that with hindsight the
     am endm ents to the statem ents had been unwise. "The great majority of w hat w as am ended w as to rem ove expressions of
     opinion, and in som e cases emotion, rather than expressions of fact. But on balance it would have been better if it were not
     done because it has created a myth and a false suspicion that there was something underhand about the process." Mr Daines
     said the force continues to settle com pensation claims from the those injured at the stadium and had so far paid m ore than
     pounds 13 million to m ore than 100 people. "I say this because there is also another myth, which is that South Y o rk s h ire
      p o lic e has n ever accepted responsibility for its actions or offered compensation."

Mrs H Jackson MP
House of Commons

SW1A0AA

Dear Mrs Jackson

 I am replying - rather belatedly - to your letter dated 19 February, addressed to the
Chairman of the Authority and the Secretariat. The delay seems to be due to some
misunderstanding on my part about a reference in your letter. You refer to enclosing a
copy of a letter to the Chief Constable written following your statement in Parliament.
That was on 15 February, but the letter attached was dated 1 February. I therefore made
a request to your office for a copy of what I thought was the 'missing’ letter, but have now
received a further copy of the letter you received from Ian Daines. It would appear
therefore that I do have the full correspondence. Apologies for the delay.

Turning to the 1 February letter, as you are already aware, the Authority set aside
£500,000 in its reserves to cover all expenditure arising out of the Scrutiny and, following
that, further enquiries and legal proceedings. That now includes the costs which are
being incurred in order to resolve the legal position on powers. However, as the money
was an earmarking of reserves - which exists in every Authority to meet abnormal
contingencies - it has not affected the resources provided to the Chief Constable through
the main revenue budget for operational and community policing in any of the three years
since the money was earmarked. You will have seen that for next year, the Authority has
kept its Council Tax increase down to the 4.5% guideline; that has been achieved without
requiring major cuts in operational budgets (although nearly £4m of efficiency gains and
cash savings will be delivered during 1999/2000). Also the Authority was satisfied that its
revenue reserves (which in aggregate amount to around £9m) are adequate.

Obviously, the outcome and extent of the present legal proceedings is unknown. As
Treasurer I will keep the situation under close review, and would report to members if the
existing funds were inadequate.

The latest position on the Judicial Review is that Court time has been made available on
22 March. We would hope to have the basic legal position clarified within a couple of
days. The position is highly complex. When the Authority’s decision to support was
taken, no-one had any doubt that powers existed under the Police and Local Government
Acts. Indeed this is the line still argued by the Police Service, not just in South Yorkshire
but in a number of other Forces who have made or are currently making legal support
available. Although the Authority’s independent legal advisers ultimately concluded that
the existence of powers was in doubt, this was ‘bn balance’! They themselves
recognised the strength of the counter-argument and that is why they recommended that
the issue should be resolved by impartial Judicial Review. The fact that the Chief
Constable and the Authority are on opposite sides should in no way be seen as
confrontational. At the meeting on 5 February, both legal advisers respected the other’s
views; Judicial Review of the Authority’s decision was simply the mechanism for achieving
clarification.

It is inevitable that costs will rise as a result of that process. It is clear however from
responses from other Forces and Authorities that the issue does affect beyond South
Yorkshire, and that is why the Chief Constable has made his approaches to Home Office,
and I have discussed the position with the Association of Police Authorities.

I hope this letter provides you with a little more of the background.    If there are further
issues, I will do my best to help.

Yours sincerely




Bill Wilkinson
Clerk and Treasurer

Dear

Further to our telephone conversation and your letter of 17 February 1999, please find enclosed
my answers to your questions. I hope they are of use in your dissertation.

I apologise that it has taken me longer to respond than I initially indicated, but I hope you will
appreciate that only working one day per week, I do have to prioritise my time and that has meant
other work has taken precedence over my response to you. I will try to find the time to copy the
newspaper articles I mentioned when I am next at work and will forward them to you separately
when I have done so.

I hope your dissertation goes well and wish you every success for the future.




A Hepworth
Hillsborough Archivist
CONFIDENTIAL FOR USE ONLY BY .            \IN HIS
JOURNALISM DISSERTATION. NOT TO BE REPRODUCED IN
ANY OTHER FORMAT WHATSOEVER

ALAN HEPWORTH SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE

In April 1989 I heM the rank of Chief Inspector and the post of Staff Officer to the
Chief Constable in his role as President of the Association of Chief Police Officers.
This role involved me in carrying out research on a variety of subjects and producing
papers on them. Producing briefing notes on the subject matter at meetings the
President was to attend; attending meetings with him and producing notes of the
discussion, ie very much the role of a personal assistant.

At the actual time of the Hillsborough Disaster I was shopping with my wife in
Sainsburys and learnt of the unfolding tragedy on my car radio. By 4.15 pm that day
I was at work.

1.      Q    What was your immediate reaction when the Interim Taylor report blamed the
             police for the disaster?

       A     A strong feeling of disappointment that total responsibility for the disaster was
             being placed upon South Yorkshire Police and that the shortcomings of other
             parties that contributed to the disaster were neither being recognised nor
             admitted. I am not referring here to the Liverpool supporters.

2.      Q     Many media critics argue that it was the police who fuelled the press with
              reports of mass drunkenness amongst many of the Liverpool fans. A cynic
              might say the police realised very quickly that they could be at fault and were
              anxious to deflect the blame. How do you feel about this comment, and what
              are your personal opinions?

        A     The comment is quite simply untrue. I was present at a meeting on Sunday,
              16 April 1989 when the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police twice
              instructed those present that the police should not be in a position where we
              were seen to be trying to be shedding any responsibility and that if drink
              contributed to the disaster we should let others find that out or say it.
              Nevertheless, when officers produced their statements many did refer to the
              dealings they had with supporters who had been drinking or were the worse
              for drink, but the majority of these statements were made after the media had
              reported, not before.

              In the immediate aftermath of the disaster and the following days, media
              representatives were very active conducting their enquiries in the streets
              immediately adjacent to the ground as well as interviewing householders,
              licensees and anyone else who would give an eyewitness account. I believe
              the stories originally emanated from such sources.

 3.     Q     How good a job do you think Granada TV and Jimmy McGovern did in
              producing a factual drama (Hillsborough - Dec 19996) that convinced the
              viewer that it was NOT Liverpool fans who were responsible for the tragedy,
              but the police handling of the crowds?
South Yorkshire Police originally agreed to co-operate with Granada
Television in the making of a factual programme about the Hillsborough
Disaster.    That co-operation was withdrawn when the nature of the
programme became clear and the police did not receive the guarantees that
were sought. The programme was a drama made for a television audience
and resulted in claims of fresh evidence that falsely raised the hopes of
bereaved families that inquests could be re-opened and a different verdict
reached, or that there could be a fresh enquiry, when in fact there was no new
evidence.

Lord Justice Taylor’s report into the disaster said that a loss of police control
was the primary cause of the disaster long before the Jimmy McGovern
television drama.

Do you think the media amplified the tragedy using graphic photographs, and
biased coverage within the newspapers, radio and television and made the
situation worse, and for what reasons?

 I do not think anything could have made worse a situation where 96 people
lost their lives and many more received injuries from which some of them 10
years later have still not recovered, when they had set out on a sunny
Saturday to support their team in an FA Cup Semi-final. Having said that, I
feel that some editors published photographs on the evening of the disaster
and the following two days without realising that the supporters portrayed
were actually deceased. 10 years ago the publication of such photographs
was not as readily acceptable as it would be today.

The subject of bias is more difficult to deal with as it is just as likely to be in the
mind of the reader as it is in that of the writer. What one reader sees as
biased coverage will be another reader’s factual account depending on their
perception of events, or their loyalties.

Although many believed the police were to blame, do you think the media took
advantage of the situation and created a moral panic within the public
domain and invaded the victims’ families personal privacy, and why?

I do not think that the media either intentionally or unintentionally created a
moral panic in society following the Hillsborough Disaster. I think that the
Disaster was so unexpected and of such a magnitude that the trauma it
caused was not confined to those directly, or even indirectly involved, but that
it reverberated around the world to touch the lives of everyone who heard
about it. In these circumstances it was no surprise that many people had a
view to express. The media was the conduit that allowed them to do so.

That personal privacy was invaded by the media following the disaster is a
fact, not just the victims families but police officers as well and that privacy
continues to be invaded to this day. An example of the personal privacy of
victims being invaded was the reporter who dressed in a white coat gained
access to the hospital bedside of victims of the disaster in order to interview
them. Whilst an example of a former police officer having his personal privacy
invaded was when Roger Cook of ITV’s Cook Report thrust a microphone
into the face of former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield as he
emerged from his car in a car park and started shouting questions at him.
In fact media intrusion became so great that Mr Duckenfield sold his family
home and moved to the South of England, only to be doorstepped some time
later by two reporters from the Daily Mirror, who had tracked him down.

Why does the media do such things? The answer is probably very complex
and bound up in circulation figures for the press, or viewing/listening figures
for television and radio, with the desire of the individual reporter to get their
name under the headline by being the first with a particular story or interview,
but this may just be my jaundiced view.

What was your immediate reaction when The Sun printed the headline
 Hillsborough: The Truth’, where it accused some fans of pickpocketing the
victims, and others of ‘urinating on the brave cops’, only a few days after the
incident? (19thApril 1989)

I cannot recall having an immediate reaction to The Sun article. I had been
working 16 to 18 hour days since the disaster and reading newspapers was a
low priority. However, if you are seeking verification of the truth of the
accusations I can only say that I personally have no knowledge of some fans
pickpocketing victims. The allegation that police officers were urinated on by
fans whilst they were attempting to rescue or resuscitate victims is contained
in the statements of some officers but also extended to being kicked and
assaulted. Some ambulance personnel also made the same allegations.

Did you think all the information printed by The Sun was true, and why?

Please see my answer to Question 6 above.

                       HYPOTHESIS
Moral Panics were created by the media and
personal privacy invaded during and after the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

                       DEFINITIONS
MORAL PANIC: Societies appear to be the subject, every
now and then, to periods of moral panic. A condition,
episode, person or group of persons emerges to become
defined as a threat to societal values and interests; its
nature is presented in a stylised and stereotypical fashion
by the mass media; moral barricades are manned by
editors, bishops, politicians and other right thinking
people;   socially   accredited   experts   pronounce    their
diagnoses and solutions; ways of coping are evolved or-
(more often) resorted to, the condition then disappears,
submerges or deteriorates and becomes more visible.
Stanley Cohen, 'Folk Devils and Moral Panics'.



PRIVACY: Privacy is the right of the individual to be
protected against intrusion into his personal life or affairs,
or those of his family, by direct physical means or by
publication of information.

               With reference to the above Premiership fixture which is the final away match of the
               season for the visitors and is due to take place at Hillsborough. Enclosed are
               specimen copies of leaflets which have been distributed to soccer fans on
               Merseyside by members of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign.
               I have spoken to a colleague at Liverpool and he believes Liverpool supporters will
               travel to Sheffield for the match and he will be able to assess the situation nearer to
               the time of the match. Ticket sales to the vis ito rs sh o uld indicate the level of interest
               of the match to the Liverpool fans. He also believes that several hundred supporters
               of the Hillsborough Campaign will travel with the intention of making a ‘peaceful
               protest' possibly at the site of the proposed memorial in Parkside Road.
               He has indicated that if a request is made to Merseyside Police, additional ‘Spotters'
               will be sent to assist with the Police operation at.the fixture.
               I will submit a further report if information comes to light. (Graded B2)

                 BOYCOTT STILL ON
        The Hillsborough Justice Campaign today repeated its call to all
        Liverpool supporters to stay away from the game at Hillsborough
        on 8 May. The boycott has been called to express solidarity
        between victims (bereaved families and survivors) of the
        Hillsborough Disaster and current Liverpool supporters.     ;


         it was also called as an active means for Reds to show their
        support for the continuing legal, political and social struggle for
        justice and bring attention to the treatment of Liverpool supporters,
        by South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Wednesday on visits to
         Hillsborough since the Disaster, as well as highlighting the need
        for a memorial at the site of the Disaster.


         A proposal has been made by Sheffield Wednesday to build a
         memorial 100 yards from the stadium main entrance, which does
         not appear to be appropriate in its siting, but does show that
         collective action can effect change.


          The Hillsborough Justice Campaign calls on ALL LIVERPOOL
          SUPPORTERS TO STAY AWAY FROM HILLSBOROUGH.
          Leave the Leppings Lane and West Stand empty and allow the
          blank space to represent us all, Hillsborough Victims and
          Supporters.

                 THERE IS       NO AWAY GAME IN MAY
         it is time to 'out' myself. I have never, and will never, understand how so many
         Liverpool supporters can ever turn up at one ground - HILLSBOROUGH.
         Hillsborough was the scene of such carnage, such soul-destroying horror.

         After the McGovern drama documentary, the cause of justice was given a boost after
         years of obstruction from officialdom (In particular South Yorkshire police and
         Sheffield W e d n e sd ay Football Club). Fans returning to Hillsborough bssring floral
         tributes were asked to leave them outside on a crappy wooden table and the
         sponsorship deal with a newspaper that was instrumental in spreading the foul
         propaganda of a police force that killed YOUR fellow Liverpool fans was seen by
         many loyal ‘never m iss’ reds as the final insult.

         And now you are being asked to believe (even by the local press - a betrayal in
         itself) that the same club had a ‘change of heart’, and that the decision to finally build
         a memorial is a ‘kind act’ - despite evidence that suggests they would not even
         consider a memorial until the possibility of legal action against them had been
         removed. They have received no such assurances - so why th® change? Because a
         BOYCOTT by Liverpool fans would have meant a serious loss of revenue to SWFC,
         It Is a fairly safe assumption to make that THIS - not quiet dignity, not diplomacy -
         was the major factor in their about - face.

         S o now a memorial is to be built. Time to return to Hillsborough? NO. Sheffield
         W ednesday FC can make any amount of concessions, but we would still have to deal
         with South Yorkshire Police. Remember Duckenfield and Murray will be In court
         around that time. Can you trust them? The answer surely is no, no « thousand
         times no. THE BOYCOTT MUST STAY IN PLACE.

         It wilt be difficult. The local press has not helped: by reporting the memorial news as
         the end of the matter, without fully reporting the other side of the argument, they have
         made our task so much more difficult. Even people who lost loved ones in 1989 have
         referred to the boycott as “futile” and serving no purpose. This Is total gibberish. Why
         give Sheffield Wednesday any money? Money that could be going toward their court
         costs if or when tie bereaved and the survivors of the Hillsborough Disaster go after
         them. Imagine that, If you will,the money that you paid for a ticket actually ending up
         in the bank account of a lawyer fighting against justice for the 96 Liverpool fans who
         had the very life crushed o ut of them Can you live with that? I know l couldn't.

         So: DO NOT BUY THE SUN. DO NOT GO TO HILLSBOROUGH

              With reference to the above Premiership fixture which is the final away match of the
              season for the visitors and is due to take place at Hillsborough. Enclosed are
              specimen copies of-an extract from a Merseyside fanzine. Red All Over The Land. I
              have spoken to the Liverpool Football Intelligence Officer about the item and he
              states that it is possible that many of the Merseyside visitors to Sheffield for the fixture
              will boycott the match. He believes that regulars will not want to be sighted inside the
              stadium for fear of being singled out in Liverpool after the match. Ticket sales will be
              monitored but I do not believe that it will give a true reflection of what the away
              attendance might be; i would suggest that Liverpool fans may avoid purchasing
              tickets from their cJub for this match, but take the opportunity if they can pay on the
              day at the turnstiles at Hillsborough. It is also likely that others who do boycott the
              match, seek put licensed premises in the area. A further report will be submitted when
              more information com es to light.

     23 April 1999


      Dear Mr. Wilkinson,

      Re: Hillsborough : Financing of Defence Costs

      Further to your letter of 13th January 1999, I have of course read with interest the Law
      Report of the decision of the Divisional Court of the High Court on 31st March.

      In those circumstances I should be grateful if you would please give my client the
      comfort to know that in the event that he were to be prosecuted then the Police
      Authority would indemnify him for costs.

      He would also like to have some indication whether the Authority will also indemnify him
      in the event that he becomes involved in some other capacity, for example as a witness.

      I await to hear from you. Please note the slight change in my firm’s name.

    Dear

    HILLSBOROUGH COSTS

    Further to our recent meeting, I promised I would write with further information on past
    costs. I apologise for not getting back to you sooner.

    The costs fall into several categories,

    1           Costs in connection with the original enquiries and inquest

    The best estimate I can find is around £4m in total. After negotiation with Home Office, it
    was agreed that South Yorkshire would meet a contribution of up to just under £1m
    (based on a product of a rate at that time), and Home Office would meet the rest.

    2           Claims from victims for damages

    These were covered by the Authority’s public liability policy: the insured limit was £8,5m.
    This was reached some time ago, and the Authority has already had to pay out around
    £800,000. There remain a number of claims to be resolved, the total value of which could
    be in excess of £4m. Cash provision for these claims has already been set aside in the
    Authority’s accounts.

    3           Legal costs in dealing with the claims

    The estimated costs to date are around £2m. These have been paid by the insurers. No
    contributions have been requested from the Authority but this cannot be ruled out.
4     Claims by Police Officers affected by the disaster

The successful claims (amounting to around £1,7m plus fees of £0,3m) were met by the
Authority’s employers liability policy.

5      Costs in connection with the Scrutiny

£500,000 was set aside in reserves in 1997. A small amount was utilised in connection
with the Scrutiny itself. The reserve will also be utilised to meet the costs incurred by the
Authority in providing financial support to the officers and the costs of the Authority and
the Chief Constable in connection with the Judicial Review. The amounts required to
cover these liabilities will be reviewed by the Authority in the light of its decision on
funding of future legal costs.

6      Other costs

This covers miscellaneous iegal advice over the years, and officer time, it is by far the
most difficult area to quantify. The Chief Constable and the Authority both have
substantial annual budgets for legal advice, as you would expect. In the period between
the inquests and the initial inquiries, and the build up following the 1996 TV programme
which led ultimately to the Scrutiny, there will have been legal costs in connection with
Hillsborough, but it is almost impossible to identify the sums without considerable analysis
of invoices and payments. I have discussed it with Ian Daines: we do not believe the
sums would have been substantial, and that the information we have given you in this
letter about the earlier years and the most recent period should cover the vast bulk of
liabilities. Having said that, I have asked Police to look at the old files to see if there is
any further detail which is available.

On officer time, this is well nigh impossible. I can say though that over the extended
period, it will have been substantial, to deal with servicing the various enquiries, requests
for information, and the insurers. Most of it will have been at senior level too.

I hope this information is helpful. In case you have not heard, the Authority is meeting on
21 May to revisit the whole issue and to consider applications for future funding.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Mr Dairies

                                             HILLSBOROUGH

 J forward to you a copy of a letter sent to me by the solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group,
 which requests a statement from me for the commencement of committal proceedings on 5 July 1999,

 It appears they already have copies of the interviews conducted and are sending to me those documents.
 You should already be in possession of any statements made by myself which would have been with the
 file prepared for the then Director of Public Prosecutions and as such 1 would expect those statements to
 be used.

 You will also note from the third paragraph a suggestion that questions asked of Mr Duckenfield and Mr
 Murray were provided to them before interview. That was not the case. It is of course possible the
 solicitor is mistaken because of the fact the enquiry did use a questionnaire to elicit information quickly
 from a number of Police and other witnesses for the public enquiry started by Lord Justice Taylor.




MAY   ’99   11:28                                                                                  P A G E .002

  I am aware of the sensitivity of this prosecution and the considerations for the release of statements. You
  will understand my difficulty here bccause 1 am being asked to provide evidence to the Court at Leeds for
  a p ro secu tio n the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided not to discontinue. As 1 see it I have a duty
  to comply as a West Midlands Police Officer, b'*t to do so 1need your authority to provide we with the
  relevant documentation,

  Ttrust the matter can be resolved quickly through your legal advisors.

  Yours sincerely

         Dear Chief Superintendent



         I am the prosecutor of the cases of manslaughter and misfeasance brought against David
         Duckenfield and Bernard Murray, formerly senior officers of the South Yorkshire police force,
         in relation to the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. Committal proceedings are due to Start on 5*
         July at the Leeds District Magistrates’ Court. Summonses were issued last July. The
         defendants applied to the Director of Public Prosecutions to take over and discontinue the
         prosecution. The Director declined to do so, and his decision has been upheld in the
         Divisional Court.

         I am in the course of preparing evidence for the committal proceedings and T wish to produce
         copies of interviews you held with the two defendants, I enclose copies of those interviews

         i should be grateful if you could produce a witness statement in the normal toms exhibiting
         copies in the normal way. I believe from the contents of other interviews hdd with senior
         officers of the South Yorkshire force in the summer o f 1990 that copies of the questions were
         sent in advance to all officers questioned. 1 should be grateful if you could confirm in the
         statement that this is the position., exhibiting if possible copies of the questionnaires sent out.

        If it is necessary for you to give your consent to the South Yorkshire poli.ee to the release of
        this material, I should be fatefu l if you could send such written authorisation to me so that I
        can forward il to the South Yorkshire police

      Dear Sir,


A l l Please find enclosed three video tapes containing interviews of Police Officers in relation to the
      Hillsborough Stadium Incident Inquiry. These were sent to us by West Yorkshire Police for
      them to be archived with the other material and exhibits from the inquiry, but I understand from
      our Chief Superintendent Mick Foster that the material in question is now kept by South
      Yorkshire Police. If that is so I would be most grateful if you would add the enclosed tapes to
      the other material. Many thanks,


      Yours sincerely

              n

         Dear Ms Adlington

         RE: A D L IN G T O N v D U C K E N FIE L D AND MURJRAY

         Thank you for your latest letter o f 10 June 1999. I am now able to give you a
         substantive response to the four requests set out in your letter o fj| June 1999.

         We have taken into consideration the points made in the above letters and the one
         volume of evidential material provided. Both yourselves and the solicitors acting for
         the two defendants have received schedules of all the material in our possession,
         including that said to be legally privileged or subject to Public Interest Immunity. All
         parties have examined the non sensitive material at this office and any requested
         photocopies have been provided as part of voluntary disclosure by the CPS.

         You have invited us to :

         •     Provide a copy of counsels' advice from 1990
         •     Provide a copy o f the final West Midlands Police Report
         •     Make a statement indicating the material received and considered re the closing of
               the tunnel to the centre pens
         •     Give guidance to the South Yorkshire Police under section 3(2) of the Prosecution
               o f Offences Act 1985 re making the whole of the Hillsborough archive available
               to the HFSG, and for the archive to be resited.

         Counsels’ Advice

         Mr C Enzor's letter dated 31 December 1998 and addressed to you set out the CPS
         position on voluntary disclosure. Our view was that we would not voluntarily
         disclose material which attracted either legal professional privilege or public interest
         immunity. This would cover such documents as counsel's advice, internal
         memoranda and opinions, and correspondence with the police. My letter to you dated
         6 January 1999 confirmed that position.
0 6 - JUL. ’ 9 9 ( TUE) 1 4 : 1 9   S. Y, P, CH I E F DEPT                  T E L : 0 1 14 2 5 2 3 4 8 1   8481       P. O i l




                     The above stance is unchanged. In coming to this decision we have considered your
                     representations about the reasons why you require disclosure of counsels’ advice and
                     also your submission that it is highly doubtful whether our relationship with counsel
                     can be described as one between lawyer and client so that privilege can be invoiced.
                     In particular, I find your last point to be misconceived.

                     We do not agree that the disclosure of counsels' advice to either Lord Justice Stuart-
                     Smith's scrutiny or to the police at the time of the Taylor Inquiry would constitute a
                     waiver, whether implied or express, for the purpose of disclosure to you in your
                     private prosecution. You will have noted that counsels’ advice has not been placed in
                     the House Library as part of the material shown to the scrutiny. My understanding is
                     that it was acknowledged as being subject to legal professional privilege. While I
                     accept that you are aware of the conclusions of counsel as to there being insufficient
                     evidence (as this was noted in chapter 1 of the scrutiny report), the body of that advice
                     is plainly hearsay opinion which I do not consider to be relevant to any of the issues
                     either at an abuse of process or committal hearing..

                     It has also been decided that it is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case for
                     the DPP to consider the waiver oflegal professional privilege.

                     F in a l West M idlands Police Report

                     Our previous correspondence with you confirmed that we would not give voluntary
                     disclosure of PII material This applies to any of the police reports to which PH still
                     attaches. Evans -v- C hief Constable o f Surrey [1988] 1QB 588 is the authority for the
                     proposition that a report sent by the police to the DPP seeking the tatter's advice falls
                     within a PH class. K elly -v-Commissioner o f Police fo r the M etropolis [1997] TLR 22
                     August 1997 confirms that proposition. The police and CPS prosecution team must be
                     able to discuss details of cases and give advice freely and frankly without fear of such
                     documentation being disclosed to third parties in other proceedings.

                     I have considered the cases o f Goodridge and A lfred Crompton Amusement Machines
                     that you mention in your letter of 3 June, but I am not persuaded that they contain
                     support for your request.

                    In these circumstances we are declining to give you voluntary disclosure of the
                    requested report in whatever form that we have it. I note your argument that there is
                    no justification for withholding the Final Report when the Interim Report is in the
                    public domain. However, as all the reports were generated by the police you may
                    consider that, as a Chief Constable is the only person that can waive PH (see K elly
                    above), your approach should be to the Chief Constable for the force now holding the
                    Hillsborough archive, that is, the South Yorkshire Police. In the end you have
                    recourse to the courts for an adjudication on disclosure.

                     CPS Statement

                    The statement chat you request concerns the CPS review of parts of the evidence
                    covering the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent judicial hearings and
                    complaints arising. You have received a detailed schedule of all the material
                    considered by various CPS lawyers, including myself, between 1989 and 1998. You


                                                                                                                  7

                      have also had the opportunity to view this material. I consider that your request has
                      been sufficiently actioned by the provision of the relevant information as part of
                      voluntary disclosure, without the need for a formal statement that we perceive would
                      have no relevance to any o f the issues in the case.

                       Guidance to the Police

                      In his scrutiny report at chapter 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the extensive
                      Hillsborough archive held by the South Yorkshire Police. He gave his opinion of the
                      status of that archive in that access to the material not covered by the Coroners Rules
                      was at the discretion of the police. He made no adverse comment on the holding of
                      this material, indeed he stated at paragraph 32 that from his own knowledge he would
                      be surprised if criticisms o f lack o f disclosure (concerning body files) by the police
                      were true.

                      I understand that Mr M G Kennedy wrote to your Mr Coombes on 25 August 1998 to
                      explain that the CPS was not in the position to make any request for alternative
                      measures in relation to the safekeeping of the archive material held by the South
                      Yorkshire Police.

                      I have spoken to the solicitors acting for the Chief Constable and they confirm that
                      they have had no instructions to ask the CPS for advice under the provisions of the
                      Act. The CPS position concerning voluntary disclosure was made known to the South
                      Yorkshire Police in our letters of 31 December 1998 and 6 January 1999.

                      That position still remains the CPS view on voluntary disclosure. The police are
                      aware of it and it is a matter for the Chief Constable, who acts as a third party holding
                      relevant and unused material in your private prosecution, as to how he deals with your
                      requests. Ultimately it is for the court to carry out the exercise of the balance of
                      conflicting interests, a process which you have already used.

                      Conclusion

                     I note your comments on the attitude of the DPP to disclosure. His presentations were
                     o f course directed to our core role o f conducting criminal prosecutions where one of
                     our most important objectives is to scrupulously comply with the duty of disclosure.
                     We fully accept that the same principle applies where, as in this case, we are a third
                     party to the proceedings. We consider that our voluntary disclosure in your
                     prosecution has been in accordance with the relevant law on disclosure and is to the
                     high standard that the Director has envisaged.

                     I have been particularly mindful of the recent case o f R -v- CPS ex pane L e e [l9 9 9 ]
                     unreported, and the duty, among others, of a 'prosecutor' to disclose material which
                     might enable a ’defendant' to make a pre-committal application to stay the
                     proceedings as an abuse o f process. While it may be argued that the same duty does
                     not rest upon a third party, I consider that we have fully complied with it in all the
                     circumstances of the case.




                                                                                                                 3

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your latest letter of 10 June 1999. I am now able to give you a
substantive response to the four requests set out in your letter o f^ June 1999.

We have taken into consideration the points made in the above letters and the one
volume of evidential material provided. Both yourselves and the solicitors acting for
the two defendants have received schedules of all the material in our possession,
including that said to be legally privileged or subject to Public Interest Immunity. All
parties have examined the non sensitive material at this office and any requested
photocopies have been provided as part of voluntary disclosure by the CPS.

You have invited us to :

•   Provide a copy of counsels' advice from 1990
•   Provide a copy o f the final West Midlands Police Report
•   Make a statement indicating the material received and considered re the closing of
    the tunnel to the centre pens
•   Give guidance to the South Yorkshire Police under section 3(2) o f the Prosecution
    of Offences Act 1985 re making the whole of the Hillsborough archive available
    to the HFSG, and for the archive to be resited.

Counsels'Advice
Mr C Enzor's letter dated 31 December 1998 and addressed to you set out the CPS
position on voluntary disclosure. Our view was that we would not voluntarily
disclose material which attracted either legal professional privilege or public interest
immunity. This would cover such documents as counsel's advice, internal
memoranda and opinions, and correspondence with the police. My letter to you dated
6 January 1999 confirmed that position.


                                                                                        1
The above stance is unchanged. In coming to this decision we have considered your
representations about the reasons why you require disclosure of counsels' advice and
also your submission that it is highly doubtful whether our relationship with counsel
can be described as one between lawyer and client so that privilege can be invoked.
In particular, I find your last point to be misconceived.

We do not agree that the disclosure of counsels' advice to either Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's scrutiny or to the police at the time o f the Taylor Inquiry would constitute a
waiver, whether implied or express, for the purpose o f disclosure to you in your
private prosecution. You will have noted that counsels' advice has not been placed in
the House Library as part of the material shown to the scrutiny. My understanding is
that it was acknowledged as being subject to legal professional privilege. While I
accept that you are aware of the conclusions o f counsel as to there being insufficient
evidence (as this was noted in chapter 1 o f the scrutiny report), the body o f that advice
is plainly hearsay opinion which I do not consider to be relevant to any o f the issues
either at an abuse o f process or committal hearing..

It has also been decided that it is not appropriate in the circumstances o f this case for
the DPP to consider the waiver o f legal professional privilege.

Final West Midlands Police Report

Our previous correspondence with you confirmed that we would not give voluntary
disclosure of PII material. This applies to any o f the police reports to which PII still
attaches. Evans -v- C h ie f Constable o f Surrey [1 9 8 8 ] 1QB 588 is the authority for the
proposition that a report sent by the police to the DPP seeking the latter's advice falls
within a PII class. K e lly -v-Com m issioner o f P olice f o r the M etropolis [1 9 9 7 ] TLR 22
August 1997 confirms that proposition. The police and CPS prosecution team must be
able to discuss details o f cases and give advice freely and frankly without fear of such
documentation being disclosed to third parties in other proceedings.

I have considered the cases of G oodridge and A lfre d Crompton Amusement Machines
that you mention in your letter o f 3 June, but I am not persuaded that they contain
support for your request.

In these circumstances we are declining to give you voluntary disclosure of the
requested report in whatever form that we have it. I note your argument that there is
no justification for withholding the Final Report when the Interim Report is in the
public domain. However, as all the reports were generated by the police you may
consider that, as a Chief Constable is the only person that can waive PII (see K e lly
above), your approach should be to the Chief Constable for the force now holding the
Hillsborough archive, that is, the South Yorkshire Police. In the end you have
recourse to the courts for an adjudication on disclosure.

CPS Statement
The statement that you request concerns the CPS review of parts o f the evidence
covering the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent judicial hearings and
complaints arising. You have received a detailed schedule of all the material
considered by various CPS lawyers, including myself, between 1989 and 1998. You
have also had the opportunity to view this material. I consider that your request has
been sufficiently actioned by the provision o f the relevant information as part of
voluntary disclosure, without the need for a formal statement that we perceive would
have no relevance to any o f the issues in the case.

Guidance to the Police
In his scrutiny report at chapter 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the extensive
Hillsborough archive held by the South Yorkshire Police. He gave his opinion of the
status of that archive in that access to the material not covered by the Coroners Rules
was at the discretion of the police. He made no adverse comment on the holding of
this material, indeed he stated at paragraph 32 that from his own knowledge he would
be surprised if criticisms of lack of disclosure (concerning body files) by the police
were true.

I understand that Mr M G Kennedy wrote to your Mr Coombes on 25 August 1998 to
explain that the CPS was not in the position to make any request for alternative
measures in relation to the safekeeping of the archive material held by the South
Yorkshire Police.

I have spoken to the solicitors acting for the Chief Constable and they confirm that
they have had no instructions to ask the CPS for advice under the provisions of the
Act. The CPS position concerning voluntary disclosure was made known to the South
Yorkshire Police in our letters o f 31 December 1998 and 6 January 1999.

That position still remains the CPS view on voluntary disclosure. The police are
aware o f it and it is a matter for the Chief Constable, who acts as a third party holding
relevant and unused material in your private prosecution, as to how he deals with your
requests. Ultimately it is for the court to carry out the exercise o f the balance of
conflicting interests, a process which you have already used.

Conclusion
I note your comments on the attitude o f the DPP to disclosure. His presentations were
o f course directed to our core role of conducting criminal prosecutions where one of
our most important objectives is to scrupulously comply with the duty o f disclosure.
We fully accept that the same principle applies where, as in this case, we are a third
party to the proceedings. We consider that our voluntary disclosure in your
prosecution has been in accordance with the relevant law on disclosure and is to the
high standard that the Director has envisaged.

I have been particularly mindful of the recent case o f R -v- CPS ex parte Lee[1999]
unreported, and the duty, among others, of a 'prosecutor' to disclose material which
might enable a ’defendant' to make a pre-committal application to stay the
proceedings as an abuse o f process. While it may be argued that the same duty does
not rest upon a third party, I consider that we have fully complied with it in all the
circumstances o f the case.




                                                                                         3
I regret that we cannot be of any greater assistance in response to your requests.

Yours sincerely

                     Dear Mr Croston,                                                    YO RK

                                                    Arlington v Duckenfield and Murray

                     On 19thJune 1999 t received a letter from Ann Adlington via the present Coroner in
                     Sheffield enclosing a copy of a letter to you dated 3rt June 1999 with various annexes.
                     She has asked me consider these and write to you.

                     I am extremely reluctant to get involved in Hillsborough again particularly as t have
                     been retired for a considerable period and for obvious reasons the detail is not as clear
                     as it used to be. I also for personal reasons {Including geography) have no ready
                     access to the vast bulk of the material in the Coronal archives

                     It seems to me that the majority of the points made by Miss Adlington are matters on
                     which for various reasons I cannot, need not, or should not comment. I want to
                     make it absolutely clear that merely because I have not commented or mentioned any
                     matter raised by Ms. Adlington cannot and must not be construed that I agree
                     with or accept ( or for that matter disagree with or reject) what is stated.

                      [ also want to make it clear that anything [ say has to be read with the caveat that it
                     must be checked out as in view of the passage of time, my age and any other factor my
                     recall etc* may not be accurate.

                     Before [ turn to her letter I would remind you that in 1997 when the CPS were
                     conducting their own review I was in touch with Mr. Pearson and you, and wrote to
                     Mr. Pearson on !6 “' April 1997. I do not know what became of your review but no
                     doubt you will bear in mind what I then said and act as you think fit. Perhaps on this
                     point for the sake of completeness I might just add that I see from a copy file note in
                     my possession that in early March 1990 1drew Mr. Manning's attention to the
                     relevant part of the statement but he said his client would emphatically deny thjs.

                      That would I suppose have made it impossible to admit the statement in its entirety as
                     documentary evidence under Coronal rules.

                     Turning now to Ms Adlington letter and referring to her numbered paragraphs.

                     1. Paragraph 38. I have no recollection of Mr. Mervyn Jones appearing before me on
                     18‘bApril 1989. He did appear before me on 18thApril 1990. 1 wonder if there is a
                     dating error here.

                     2. Paragraph 42. I am not clear why Mr. Dairies states he is holding papers “on behalf
                     of the Coroner”. Mr. Domes is looking into this. It may be that when West Midland
                     Police handed over their paper work (which was of course much more wide ranging
                     than the coronal enquiry) they passed over copies (and ? originals) of various
                     documents videos etc. which they had held but which had been specifically prepared
                     for the Coroner and it is these he is referring to. As far as I am aware the Coroner has
                     the Coronal documents used in the inquests under his care

                     I hope the foregoing is of help to you.

                          Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

On 19thJune 1999 L received a letter from Ann Adlington via the present Coroner in
Sheffield enclosing a copy of a letter to you dated 3rdJune 1999 with various annexes.
She has asked me consider these and write to you.

I am extremely reluctant to get involved in Hillsborough again particularly as [ have

 I also want to make it clear that anything I say has to be read with the caveat that it
must be checked out as in view of the passage of time, my age and any other factor my
recall etc. may not be accurate.

Before [ turn to her letter I would remind you that in 1997 when the CPS were

Mr. Pearson on 16* April 1997. I do not know what became of your review but no
doubt you will bear in mind what I then said and act as you think fit. Perhaps on this
point for the sake of completeness I might just add that Tsee from a copy file note in
my possession that in early March 1990 I drew Mr. Manning’s attention to the
relevant part of the statement but he said his client would emphatically deny this.
 That would I suppose have made it impossible to admit the statement in its entirety as

Turning now to Ms Adlington letter and referring to her numbered paragraphs.

1. Paragraph 38. I have no recollection of Mr. Mervyn Jones appearing before me on

                     obtained copies of all the relevant police statements including the statement of

Dear Mr Popper

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of 21 June 1999.

I appreciate your concern at becoming involved in the present private prosecution by
Ann Adlington against the above two retired police officers.

 Since my letter to you of 18 April 1997 the CPS have completed three reviews. The
first was as a result of the Granada drama-documentary aired in December 1996.
Your recollections noted in your letter of 16 April 1997 were considered by me and I
obtained copies of all the relevant police statements including the statement of
Inspector Harry White that was prepared for your hearing. My comments on this
point were incorporated in the report of my recommendations that was sent to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in early May 1997. On 30 June 1997 the Home
Secretary was able to announce to the House that the Director considered that none of
the material made available to the CPS would justify fresh criminal investigations.

Further reviews were carried out by me following the publication of the Lord Justice
Stuart- Smith's scrutiny report and the instigation of the private prosecution (when the
Director was asked to take over the case in order to discontinue it). As you know our
decision in declining to take over the case was taken to judicial review resulting in the
private prosecution still proceeding on the manslaughter and wilful misconduct
charges. I understand that the oral committal proceedings commence on 5 July at
Leeds Magistrates' Court.

Ms Adlington has not written to me concerning her requests made to you. I am
unsure as to what advice she considers you are able to give me. On the matter of the
Hillsborough 'archive' held by the South Yorkshire Police, the CPS have indicated to
her on a number of occasions that we did not consider ourselves to be in a position to
make any request for alternative safekeeping measures for the archive. In his scrutiny
report at chapter 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gave his opinion of the status of that
archive in that access to the material not covered by the Coroners Rules was at the
discretion of the police. He made no adverse comment on the holding of all the
material, indeed he stated that from his own knowledge he would be surprised if
criticisms of lack of disclosure (concerning body files) by the police were true.

 I am grateful that you have asked Mr Domes to look into the some of the points
raised by Ms Adlington and I trust that eventually her fears will be laid to rest.

Again thank you for your assistance in this matter. I feel that the CPS must ensure
that all the relevant material has been considered and your contribution has gone to
the core of the allegations before the court. All the non sensitive documents held by
me have been fully disclosed to the two defendants and the Hillsborough Family
Support Group.

Please let me know if I can be of any further help.

                      Dear Mr. Pearson,

                      I understand that you or one of your colleagues are reviewing the evidence in
                      connection with the Hillsborough Disaster.

                      During the conduct of the Inquests I inter alia considered the statements by Police
                      Inspector Harry White. In the light of what I was told about Mr. White’s state of
                      health I decided that it would not be right to ask him to give evidence at the Inquests

                     [ do however seem to recall that there was a comment in a statement of his which
                     differs from the evidence of Mr. Murray as to when the latter became aware that the
                     gates to the tunnel were closed in 1988 . Mr. Murray said he learned about the tunnel
                     being closed off in 1988 after the 1989 disaster while as I recollect it Mr White
                     indicated that he knew about this before.

                     I think that it is in everybody’s interest that your review is as full and comprehensive
                     as possible which is why I have drawn the above to your attention. You may of course
                     be aware of it anyway. Either way it is a matter entirely for you to decide whether this
                     is material and what reliance, weight and significance should be given to this.

                     Finally I would mention that I do not have a copy of the relevant statement by Mr.
                     White . If you do not have this statement already I am sure you can obtain a copy
                     from the Data Base. Please check the accuracy of my recollection.

              Thank you for your telephone call and letter of 16th April 1997 which Mr Pearson has asked

              I am obtaining the statement of Inspector White that you mentioned and also the transcript
              of Mr Murray’s evidence to your hearing.

              I shall certainly consider them for my        review.

              South Yorkshire Police have a set of 186 video tapes made during the inquest and are able

          Dear Mr Metcalf

          RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

          I am writing to confirm the detail of today's telephone conversation.

          On 24 June 1999 I became aware of certain new information concerning statements
          made by Inspector Harry White after the Hillsborough Disaster. Although the CPS is
          not a party to the private prosecution, I consider that we have a continuing duty of
          disclosure under the common law in this case.

          For that reason I enclose a copy of my letter of today to Ms Ann Adlington of the
          HFSG, together with copies of relevant correspondence and other documents. These
          are self-explanatory as to the disclosure I am providing.

          You will note that the new information is of the possible existence of a witness
          statement made by Inspector White and having a date of either 25 February 1990 or
          1991. I have not seen such a statement and the South Yorkshire Police did not bring it
          to my attention in 1997.

          If the Coroner's recollections are correct then the evidence in that statement may be
          material to the present proceedings.

          Under the provisions contained in section 3 (2) (e) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
          1985, the Director has the duty to give, to such extent as he considers appropriate,
          advice to police forces on all matters relating to criminal offences. Following
          consultation with the Head of Casework at York it has been decided that we should
          advise the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that the Hillsborough archive
          and database should be re-examined for the existence of this particular statement and
          that we should then be informed of the results of the search. I have concern that if
          this statement exists in the alleged form then the CPS review may have to be
          reopened.
As your firm is representing the Chief Constable in this matter I would be grateful if
you would pass this advice on to him.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Yours faithfully
 A            ^

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your faxed letter of 24 June 1999.

I can confirm that I have received a letter from Dr Popper, the Coroner for the
Hillsborough Disaster Inquest, following your approach to him. I have
acknowledged his letter and fully considered the points that he drew to my attention.
I telephoned him on the afternoon of 24 June and he gave me some further
information based on the correspondence between us in 1997.

That discussion, and my later telephone conversation with you, has persuaded me that
there is further voluntary disclosure that I should give both to you and to the other
parties to the private prosecution. I have obtained the consent of Dr Popper to
disclose our correspondence to you, and you have agreed that your letters may also
be disclosed to the other parties. I consider that it is in the interests of justice and also
of fairness to all parties that my relevant correspondence with the police is disclosed.
I have spoken to Mr Peter Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards and he has no objection as
long as it is emphasised that PII attaches to CPS/police correspondence as a class of
documents and that a precedent is not being set in this case for the disclosure of any
other documents in the class.

The chronology of this matter is that Dr Popper wrote to Mr Pearson, the then Branch
Crown Prosecutor at this office, on 16 April 1997. Based on his recollections he
expressed some concern about the differences between the evidence of Inspector
Harry White and that of Superintendent Murray as to when the latter became aware
that the gates to the tunnel had been closed in 1988. A copy of that letter is attached
together with my reply of 18 April 1997.

In order to conduct a review of this new information, I sent a fax on 18 April 1997 to
the South Yorkshire Police with a copy of Dr Popper's letter attached and asked for a
response and all copies of any relevant statements. They replied by fax that day and
formally by letter on 21April and 23 May. Copies of these three documents are
attached. The enclosures that were sent to me on 21 April were Inspector White's
statement of 10 June 1989 (number S2223) and Superintendent Murray's undated
statement (number S207). The enclosures sent on 23 April 1997 included an undated
manuscript statement of Inspector White which I was told had been made at the time
of the inquest hearing for the Coroner's viewing. A copy of that statement is also
attached. No other statements were provided to me by the police. I was informed that
no further statements of the Inspector had been found on the database.

My personal file note of 2 June 1997 was made after I had reviewed the new material.
I noted that Inspector White had not given evidence at the inquest and that his
statement(s) were not read out. Superintendent Murray's evidence throughout had
been that he did not know of the 1988 closure of the central tunnel to regulate the
flow of fans into the pens until after the 1989 disaster. The June 1989 statement of
Inspector White did not mention the tunnel. In his later undated statement he says that
during the briefing for the match no mention was made about the tunnel gates being
used to control ingress of the crowd. He goes on to discuss his knowledge of the gates
being used in the past. He gives no indication of the purported knowledge of
Superintendent Murray re the closing of the tunnel in 1988. I made a comment in my
file note that unless there was a statement of Inspector White that is not on the
database but was considered by Dr Popper, then I must presume that the Coroner's
recollection is wrong. I also noted that the police were doing final checks on the
number of statements made by Inspector White and that in the end no more were
found.

I considered the above matters during my 1997 review of the allegations made by
yourself and Mr T Hicks.

On 3 June 1999 you wrote to me and made a number of requests for disclosure. I
replied to you on 15 June 1999. However you copied your letter to Dr Popper and
asked him to consider the papers and then write to me. You sent me a faxed letter on
24 June requesting the disclosure to you of Dr Popper's letter sent in response to your
request to him. His letter to me of 21 June is attached. You will see that he refers to
the 1997 correspondence with myself and Mr Pearson. He also mentions a file note of
which I was not previously aware.

On 24 June I rang Dr Popper at his home and he told me that his file note of 5 March
1991 states that he saw Inspector White's statement, which was said to be dated 25
February 1991, where the officer says that he had discussed the previous closure of
the central tunnel gates with Superintendent Murray before the 1989 match was
played. I understand that there is no detail of the exact time of that discussion. Dr
Popper informed me that he had not told me of the date of Inspector White's statement
because at the time of our correspondence in 1997 his file note was in papers stored
elsewhere and he was working from a recollection only. He only obtained a copy of
the file note in August 1997. On now looking at the chronology of the events, he
considers that he may have made a mistake in his file note in that the date of Inspector
White's statement could be in 1990 and not 1991.
Dr Popper also says that he discussed this statement o f Inspector White with Mr
Manning who was representing Superintendent Murray. Relevant parts of the
statement were shown to Mr Manning on or about 5 March 1991.

Dr Popper tells me that he does not wish to disclose his file note nor does he wish to
make a statement or appear as a witness re these matters.

I have copied this letter to Walker Morris, Winckworth Sherwood, Hammond
Suddards and Dr Popper together with enclosures. I have also advised the Chief
Constable through the solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police that every effort
should be made to confirm o f otherwise the existence o f any other statements made by
Inspector Harry White concerning the Hillsborough Disaster.

Please let me know if I can be o f any further assistance.

Yours sincerely

           Dear ACC Dames

           ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

           I wonder if you could assist me in trying to understand some papers served on me by
           HFSG but which may have originated from your offices. They have the abbreviation,
           at the top “QOR”. What is the full description for which these letters are the
           abbreviation?

           Yours sincerely                                                                 V

Dear ACC Daines

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I wonder if you could assist me in trying to understand some papers served on me by
HFSG but which may have originated from your offices. They have the abbreviation
at the top “QOR”. What is the full description for which these letters are the
abbreviation?

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Manning

Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

I refer to your letter of 27 May 1999 and to my faxed acknowledgement of 2 June 1999, I
have now had an opportunity to take legal advice and am able to reply as follows;

You asked for copies of documents or items which I produced to the Leeds Magistrates
Court in response to a summons. I am advised that it is the responsibility of the court and/or
the private prosecutor to furnish you with copies. The documents I produced included
700 photographs which would take some time for me to reproduce and the control room
audio tape which I do not have the equipment to reproduce. I suggest that you direct your
request to the court and/or the private prosecutor.

You also asked for a list of all material that has been supplied to Ann Adlington or HFSG or
any other appropriately authorised body or individual or other organisation. In the 10 years
since the disaster South Yorkshire Police has released a vast amount of material from the
archive, many individuals have asked for a copy of the statement that they made and we
have responded to those requests. Some individuals asked for their statements to be sent to
them direct and others asked for their statement to be forwarded to nominated individuals or
organisations, including Ann Adlington and HFSG. Some families have asked for the body
file of their deceased family member. Again, some asked for the material to be sent to their
homes, some asked that it be forwarded to a named individuals or organisations. Some
other Hillsborough related material is in the public domain because other organisations have
made it public by placing papers in the Public Records Office, the House of Commons’
Library and other such places. Thus it is not possible for me to say what material is in the
hands of the private prosecutor that may have a bearing upon the prosecution of
Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.

On a separate note I am not sure that it would be proper for me to divulge details of
correspondence as some of those involved might perceive it as confidential.

I will forward a copy of this letter to Peter Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards and if you wish to
take this matter further I will be obliged if you would contact him in the first instance.

Yours sincerely

                         Dear Mr Metcalf

                         RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

                         I am writing to confirm the detail of today's telephone conversation.

                         On 24 June 19991 became aware of certain new information concerning statements
                         made by Inspector Harry White after the Hillsborough Disaster. Although the CPS is
                         not a party to the private prosecution, I consider that we have a continuing duty of
                         disclosure under the common law in this case.

                         For that reason 1 enclose a copy of my letter of today to Ms Ann Adlington of the
                         HFSG, together with copies of relevant correspondence and other documents. These
                         are self-explanatory as to the disclosure I am providing.

                         You will note that the new information is of the possible existence of a witness
                         statement made by Inspector White and having a date of either 25 February 1990 or
                         1991. I have not seen such a statement and the South Yorkshire Police did not bring it
                         to my attention in 1997.

                         If the Coroner's recollections are correct then the evidence in that statement m a y be
                         material to the present proceedings.

                         Under the provisions contained in section 3 (2) (e) of the P r o s e c u tio n o f Offences Act
                         1985, the Director has the duty to give, to such extent as he considers appropriate,
                         advice to police forces on all matters relating to criminal offences. Following
                         consultation with the Head of Casework at York it has been decided that we should
                         advise the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that the Hillsborough archive
                         and database should be re-examined for the existence of this particular statement and
                         that we should then be informed of the results of the search. I have concern that if
                         this statement exists in the alleged form then the CPS review may have to be
                         reopened.

                     As your firm is representing the Chief Constable in this matter I would be grateful if
                     you would pass this advice on to him.

                     Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

                     Dear Ms Adlington

                     RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

                     Thank you for your faxed letter of 24 June 1999.

                     I can confirm that I have received a letter from Dr Popper, the Coroner for the
                     Hillsborough Disaster Inquest, following your approach to him. I have
                     acknowledged his letter and fully considered the points that he drew to my attention.
                     I telephoned him on the afternoon of 24 June and he gave me some further
                     information based on the correspondence between us in 1997,

                    That discussion, and my later telephone conversation with you, has persuaded me that
                    there is further voluntary disclosure that I should give both to you and to the other
                    parties to the private prosecution. I have obtained the consent o f Dr Popper to
                    disclose our correspondence to you, and you have agreed that your letters may also
                    be disclosed to the other parties. I consider that it is in the interests of justice and also
                    o f fairness to all parties that my relevant correspondence with the police is disclosed.
                    I have spoken to Mr Peter Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards and he has no objection as
                    long as it is emphasised that PI1 attaches to CPS/police correspondence as a class of
                    documents and that a precedent is not being set in this case for the disclosure of any
                    other documents in the class.

                    The chronology of this matter is that Dr Popper wrote to Mr Pearson, the then Branch
                    Crown Prosecutor at this office, on 16 April 1997. Based on his recollections he
                    expressed some concern about the differences between the evidence of Inspector
                    Hajnry White and that of Superintendent Murray as to when the latter became aware
                    that the gates to the tunnel had been closed in 1988. A copy o f that letter is attached
                    together with my reply of 18 April 1997.

                    In order to conduct a review of this new information, I sent a fax on 18 April 199 7 to
                    the South Yorkshire Police with a copy of Dr Popper's letter attached and asked for a

                      response and all copies of any relevant statements. They replied by fax that day and
                      formally by letter on 21 April and 23 May. Copies of these three documents are
                      attached. The enclosures that were sent to me on 21 April were Inspector White's
                      statement o f 10 June 1989 (number S2223) and Superintendent Murray's undated
                      statement (number S207). The enclosures sent on 23 April 1997 included an undated
                      manuscript statement of Inspector White which I was told had been made at the time
                      o f the inquest hearing for the Coroner's viewing. A copy of that statement is also
                      attached. No other statements were provided to me by the police. I was informed that
                      no further statements of the Inspector had been found on the database.

                      My personal file note of 2 June 1997 was made after I had reviewed the new material.
                      I noted that Inspector White had not given evidence at the inquest and that his
                      statements) were not read out. Superintendent Murray's evidence throughout had
                      been that he did not know of the 1988 closure o f the central tunnel to regulate the
                      flow of fans into the pens until after the 1989 disaster. The June 1989 statement of
                      Inspector White did not mention the tunnel. In his later undated statement he says that
                      during the briefing for the match no mention was made about the tunnel gates being
                      used to control ingress of the crowd. He goes on to discuss his knowledge of the gates
                      being used in the past. He gives no indication of the purported knowledge of
                      Superintendent Murray re the closing of the tunnel in 1988. I made a comment in my
                      file note that unless there was a statement of Inspector White that is not on the
                      database but was considered by Dr Popper, then I must presume that the Coroner's
                      recollection is wrong. I also noted that the police were doing final checks on the
                      number of statements made by Inspector White and that in the end no more were
                      found.

                       I considered the above matters during my 1997 review of the allegations made by
                       yourself and Mr T Hicks.

                       On 3 June 1999 you wrote to me and made a number of requests for disclosure. I
                       replied to you on 15 June 1999. However you copied your letter to Dr Popper and
                       asked him to consider the papers and then write to me. You sent me a faxed letter on
                       24 June requesting the disclosure to you of Dr Popper's letter sent in response to your
                       request to him. His letter to me of 21 June is attached. You will see that he refers to
                       the 1997 correspondence with myself and Mr Pearson. He also mentions a file note of
                       which I was not previously aware.

                      On 24 June I rang Dr Popper at his home and he told me that his file note of S March
                      1991 states that he saw Inspector White’s statement, which was said to be dated 25
                      February 1991, where the officer says that he had discussed the previous closure of
                      the central tunnel gates with Superintendent Murray before the 1989 match was
                      played. I understand that there is no detail of the exact time of that discussion. Dr
                      Popper informed me that he had not told me of the date of Inspector White's statement
                      because at the time o f our correspondence in 1997 his file note was in papers stored
                      elsewhere and he was working from a recollection only. He only obtained a copy of
                      the file note in August 1997, On now looking at the chronology o f the events, he
                      considers that he may have made a mistake in his file note in that the date of Inspector
                      White’s statement could be in 1990 and not 1991.



                                                                                                                            0

                       Dr Popper also says that he discussed this statement of Inspector White with Mr
                       Maiming who was representing Superintendent Murray. Relevant parts o f the
                       statement were shown to Mr Maiming on or about 5 March 1991.

                       Dr Popper tells me that he does not wish to disclose his file note nor does he wish to
                       make a statement or appear as a witness re these matters.

                       I have copied this letter to Walker Morris, Winekworth Shenvood, Hammond
                       Suddaids and Dr Popper together with enclosures. I have also advised the Chief
                       Constable through the solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police that every effort
                       should be made to confirm o f otherwise the existence of any other statements made by
                       Inspector Harry White concerning the Hillsborough Disaster.

                       Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

                       Yours sincerely

    Dear Ian

    Hillsborough : Private Prosecutions

    Thank you for sending me the copy of your fax of 24 June to Ann Adlington.

    With reference to our telephone conversation of 25 June 1999 I now enclose a copy of a letter (with
    enclosures) received from George Croston.

    Aside from the other points covered you will note that the letter contains specific advice to The
    Chief Constable purporting to be given under Section 3(2)(e) Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to
    the effect that:-

                 “ ...The Hillsborough archive and database should be re-examinedfor the existence of
                 this particular statement and that we should then be informed of the results of the
                 search”
    The “statement” referred to is one from Harry White which Dr Popper recalls seeing and discussing
    with Richard Manning at the time of the generic inquest hearings. The possible significance is that,
    according to Dr Popper’s recollection, the statement includes an assertion that Harry White told
    Bernard Murray about the blocking of the tunnel at the 1988 Semi-final, and did so before the 1989
    Semi-final.

    I believe that some specific reaction to this advice is required. It was of course under this sub­
    section that we asked for guidance as regards disclosure of documents and received advice by way of
    the CPS letter of 15 July 1998.

                                                                                 Assistant Chief Constable

One response would be that because of the size of the archive it would be an unreasonable use of
manpower to conduct a document by document search.

In fact I think that it would be correct to refuse a document by document search on those grounds,
particularly as the likelihood is that if the statement exists at all the best place to look for it is in the
archive o f Hillsborough documents held by the current coroner. See the numbered paragraph 2 on
the second page o f Dr Popper’s letter of 21 June.

The coroner’s inquest was supported by the West Midlands Police, not by the South Yorkshire
Police. It is therefore reasonable to assume that if a copy of this statement is in the archive at
Windsor Road it is likely to have come with the documentation provided by the West Midlands
Police rather than amongst documents generated by the South Yorkshire Police. In my view it
would therefore be reasonable:-

1.       to search the database for any reference to further statements by Inspector White.
2.      to look through the physical bundle of statements provided by the West Midlands Police.
3.      to physically look through any other bundle or box of documentation which is specifically
        identified as having been provided by West Midlands Police and is in any way associated with
        the generic inquest hearings.

I am not sure how much time would be involved in carrying out those three recommendations but I
believe that a search along those lines would be a reasonable response to the advice given.

At present I have acknowledged the letter from George Croston but I think that a response should be
provided within the next few days which can either be made direct or through me.

I am in the office all week except Tuesday morning and Friday afternoon if you would like to discuss
how to proceed.

Yours sincerely

ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I refer to your letter of 25 June 1999 addressed to Mr Peter Metcalf, Solicitor of Hammond
Suddards, Leeds, relating to the above prosecution and in particular to a witness statement made
by former Police Inspector White on either 25 February 1990 or 1991.

On the instructions of the Chief Constable I have today carried out an extensive manual search of
the Hillsborough Archive and in a part of the archive dedicated to the Inquests I have found a hand
written original and typed copy of a statement taken by West Midlands Police from former
Inspector White on 25 February 1991. I enclose a copy of both for your information.

I would like to emphasise that until today I was not aware of the existence of this statement, nor is
there any record of it on the HOLMES database relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.

I am responding to your correspondence with the agreement of Assistant Chief Constable
Ian Daines and Mr Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards in order to expedite your receipt of the
copy statement.

Yours sincerely




Mr A M Hepworth
Hillsborough Archivist

                                                                  Rank    PC                           N o 9032
   I retired as a Police Inspector from South Yorkshire Police Force on the

   10th of December 1989, having served 27% years.

   I came to Sheffield as a Police Inspector in February 1982, and first

   worked at Hillsborough Football ground in that season, up until the

   1984-85 season.              I worked outside of the ground, generally in close

   proximity to the ground but at various locations.

   At the start of the 1984-85 season, I generally was posted to the West

   Side of the ground.              I worked on this position for most matches,

   circumstances permitting, ie, if it was a low category fixture and I was

   not on duty, then I would not work the match.

   At normal league matches with a 3 pm kick-off, myself and the Serials

  which came under my command, would take up position at the West Side at

   between 1 pm - 1.30 pm.                     The Serials under my command would normally

   consist of 4 Serials, upto kick-off, and a further 2-4 Serials from

   outside after kick-off, depending on the fixture.

   The duties of my Serials were to search for offensive weapons, to make

   sure the supporters had paid to come in, to check for drunkenness and to

   distribute the supporters onto the terraces and into the West Stand.

   With regards to distributing the supporters, my normal way, depending on

   the anticipated numbers, would be to fill the centre two enclosures first

and if necessary the enclosures nearer to the South Stand next.

I would do this by placing barriers across the building line of the West

Stand at its ends giving access to Pens 1 and 2 and at the other end

leading to Pens 6 and 7.                 These barriers would be manned by a Police

Officer who would direct supporters to whichever direction they were

supposed to go.             At the same time, I would have Police Officers on the

gates at the rear of the enclosures on the radial fences, they would have

these gates closed and bolted but not locked and they were there for

evacuation purposes.

When the central enclosures were full, I would close the blue gates

leading from the concourse onto the tunnel, to show the incoming fans that

the central enclosures were full.                    These gates would be manned by a Police

Officer, who would then re-direct the incoming fans.                                These gates could

not be kept closed for more than a few minutes, and in any case whilst

they were closed they were always manned by a Police Officer.

Prior to the semi-final on the 15th of April 1989, I had worked two

previous semi-finals, the .Leeds Utd V Coventry City semi-final in 1987,

where I was posted outside the ground, but I cannot remember where, and

the Liverpool V Nottingham Forest semi-final in 1988 when I was posted

again outside the ground in Penistone Road at Neeps End.                                In neither year

did I enter the ground or the West Side of the ground.

On Lhe 15th of April 1989, I worked the semi-final at Hillsborough between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, I was posted to the West Side of the

ground with two Serials.

I took up post at about 10.45 am.                     At about 11.25 am, for the first time I

briefed Stewards as to their duties.                      At about twelve noon, the turnstiles

were opened and I saw that the Serials under my command were in position.

Continuation of statement of   Harry WHITE



On this occasion, there was no filling of the pens as I have previously

described because firstly it was an all ticket match, and secondly at a

league match in April 1988, Superintendent MURRAY had observed me filling

the pens as I have described, and he told me that I was not to do it in

this way and that the gates of the rear of the terraces in the radial

fences were to remain open bolted against the wall and that the fans would

find their own level on the terraces.

Once supporters started to enter the ground, I monitored them as                                    they

entered by walking along the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, and

10-16.      I would also have gone around the side of the West Stand and I

climbed onto the steps of the Police Control box to get an elevated view

of the West terraces as they began to fill.                         The central enclosures were

filling quicker than the outer enclosures, this                         w h s   quite normal and I

could see no problems.

Throughout the afternoon, I continued to do a circuit of checking the

turnstile areas, the terraces, and also the refreshment bars, because at

the semi-final the previous year, there had been a cash snatch from one of

the refreshment bars.

During the course of one of my circuits,                      I saw a young Policeman having

difficulty with a drunk, and as a result                      I assisted the Officer to take

him to the Police Room.

At 2.45 pm, I left the Police Room, I know this because I remember

checking my watch.

There was some radio traffic at this time, concerning incidents outside

the Leppings Lane turnstiles, so I returned to the concourse area behind

turnstiles 10-16 via a route under the North Stand.

Continuation of statement of   Harry WHITE



Upon my arrival, the situation was as I described it in my previous

statement.         It would have taken me a matter of minutes to come from the

Police Room to behind these turnstiles.                       Whilst at this location, people

were coining to me complaining about the situation outside the turnstiles

and as a result, I attempted to convey a message to the Police Control

outlining the difficulties, I was still in the concourse behind the

turnstiles 10-16.              I got no response from Control.                 I then became aware of

a determined movement of people from the A-G turnstile area towards the

South side of the West terrace.                   As a result, I entered the concourse area

behind the turnstiles A-G, because it appeared abnormal to me.                                   Having

entered this area, I saw that Gate ’C ’ was open and the situation was as I

have described in my previous statement.

I have been asked about the deployment of Police Officers to the tunnel

area and the gates at the rear of the radial fences on the terraces.                                        The

situation was such that although Police Officers had been identified to

take up these posts they never did because circumstances did not allow it.

I have also been asked about the gate in the dividing wall between the two

concourses, to the best of my recollection, there was no Police Officer

allocated duty to this area but it was quite possible that a Steward was

present.       However, his duty was to assist and direct the crowd and not to

prevent movement.

As for the direction for the opening of Gate ’C ’, I did not give an order

for it to be opened and I did not hear an order given for it to be opened,

I just saw it open.

All my recollections from then are as per my previous statement.

 F urther to my letter o f 28 June the Chief Constable accepts the guidance o f the CPS that a further
 search should be made in an attempt to locate a possible further Statement from Ex-Inspector White.

 H ow ever it is noted that if a further statement does exist, the place w here it is most likely to be
 found is in the archive o f Hillsborough documents held by the current Coroner. See numbered
 paragraph 2 on the second page o f D r P o p per’s letter o f 21 June. Presumably you will be raising a
 request to the current C oroner for access to this archive.

 I should also make the point that the C oroner’s enquiries and investigations in relation to the
 Generic Inquest w ere supported by the W est Midlands Police rather than by South Yorkshire Police
 Accordingly, within the archive held by the South Yorkshire Police, it is only in docum ents received
 from the W est Midlands Police that such a statement (if it exists) might be expected to be found. I
 make this point because to carry out a physical examination o f the entire archive, which is estimated
 to contain over one million pages o f information, would be an extremely time consuming operation.

 Therefore the docum ents officer has been instructed :

          1.          To search the database for any reference to further Statements by Ex-Inspector White.

          2.      To search the physical bundle o f Statements provided by the West Midlands Police on the
                  conclusion o f their enquiries.

ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I refer to your letter of 25 June 1999 addressed to Mr Peter Metcalf, Solicitor of Hammond
Suddards, Leeds, relating to the above prosecution and in particular to a witness statement made
by former Police Inspector White on either 25 February 1990 or 1991.

On the instructions of the Chief Constable I have today carried out an extensive manual search of
the Hillsborough Archive and in a part of the archive dedicated to the Inquests I have found a hand
written original and typed copy of a statement taken by West Midlands Police from former
Inspector White on 25 February 1991. I enclose a copy of both for your information.

I would like to emphasise that until today I was not aware of the existence of this statement, nor is
there any record of it on the HOLMES database relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.

I am responding to your correspondence with the agreement of Assistant Chief Constable
Ian Daines and Mr Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards in order to expedite your receipt of the
copy statement.

Yours sincerely




Mr A M Hepworth

          Thank you for your letter and enclosure o f 6 July 1999 w hich w as faxed to m e w hile I
          w as observing the recent proceedings in Leeds M agistrates' Court.

          I am m ost grateful that you w ere able to find the m issing statem ent o f Inspector W hite
          that had been referred to us by the coroner, D r Popper. D uring the abuse o f process
          application by the defendants, m uch m ention w as m ade o f the contents o f this
          statem ent as w ell as o f the briefing notes o f m eetings betw een senior officers that
          w ere taken shortly after the disaster.

           The art o f disclosure in the present legal clim ate is a difficult one, b u t I feel that the
          co-operation betw een police, CPS and the coroner has been in the interests o f justice
          in this particular case.

          Y ours sincerely

        Thank you for letting me have a copy o f your letter to George Croston.

  *     H ere is another lengthy missive from Ann Adlington containing the usual mix o f untruths abuse and
        illogic.

        Jt is alw ays difficult to know w hether to respond in detail or simply to meet the essential point. The
        latter approach in this case would involve a short letter indicating that you had already sought the
        guidance o f the D PP on the correct approach now to be taken to requests for docum entation.

  *     H ow ever I attach a draft o f a rather longer response which could be cut down or even, suitably
        adapted, could com e from yourself. It should perhaps be copied to G eorge Croston.

        I will telephone you to discuss the approach to be adopted.

      D ear M r M etcalf,

      R v. Duckenfield. and Murray

      1       T he defendants in this case w ere committed for trial on 20th July on charges o f
              m anslaughter and misfeasance. The stipendiary m agistrate, M r Nigel Cadbury, had
               heard five days o f argum ent, and sworn oral evidence'from me, before rejecting the
               defence argum ent that th e prosecution w as an abuse o f process o f the court and
               oppressive. H e then rejected a defence argum ent th a t there was no case to answ er
               after a m ere three days o f evidence and argument.

      2       W e understand that the Presiding Judge o f the N orth-E astern Circuit, M r Justice
              H ooper, w ishes to hold a preliminary hearing soon, probably on 3rd September, but
              possibly o n 20* August. W e shall wish at that hearing to raise the im portant question
              o f access to th e H illsborough archive.

      3       As you know , w e have been arguing for nearly a year now that there is no lawful basis
              for South Y orkshire police to hold the papers. By virtue o f the fact that o n 16* April
               1989 th e C hief Constable o f the South Y orkshire police asked the C hief Constable o f
              th e W est M idlands police to conduct an inquiry into the policing at the Hillsborough
              disaster, it appears th at the fiction has been maintained that South Y orkshire police
              “ ow n” th e inform ation, o f which, it has been said, they are “ principals” .

      4        Therefore, it is apparently argued, the South Yorkshire police w ere the primary
               com m issioners o f evidence and inquiry, and other investigative and legal bodies w ere
               subordinate. Accordingly, the South Y orkshire police has been able, upon your own
               advice, (a) to decline to disclose material to th e bereaved families at the Inquest in
               1990, and (b) to deny it to th e prosecution in 1998-9.

     5        F o r th e same reason, the South Y orkshire police w as, on your advice, able to
              influence, in its ow n favour, the supply o f inform ation and evidence to the CPS in
               1989-90, w hen a decision w hether to prosecute w as under consideration, and, no
              doubt, to influence the supply o f information to the Police Complaints Authority.

     6        A lthough w e have repeatedly deployed these argum ents in the course o f the various
              applications by the defendants to have the proceedings stayed o r discontinued, and in
              th e course o f their applications for public fending, w e have never heard an answ er to
              them . N either have you offered any rebuttal o r contradiction at all over the last tw elve
              m onths.                      .     .

      7       A conspicuous feature o f th e case in th e last tw elve m onths had been the support that
              th e S ou th Y orkshire police has given to the defendants. The C h ief Constable has
              urged th e South Y orkshire Police A uthority, successfully, that it should pay th e entire
              legal fees and ou t o f pocket expenses o f the defendants on the ground that they acted
              “ reasonably and in good faith” at the time o f the H illsborough disaster, and that it was
              necessary to do this to maintain th e m orale o f officers who have to take “split-second”
              decisions.

      8       It is obviously absurd that the Crow n, in w hose name the prosecution will now be
               conducted, is denied access to evidential material w hich is obviously relevant to the
               case by a body w hich is actively supporting the defence. Furtherm ore, as you will
               know , the prosecution has duties o f disclosure to th e defence, namely, to disclose any
               m aterial in th e possession o f organs o f the state that may arguably assist the defence,
               subject to public interest immunity considerations and legal professional privilege.

      9       W e shall raise these m atters w ith M r Justice H ooper at the first hearing. W e invite you
              meanwhile to explain in w riting;

               (a) th e legal basis on w hich you contend that the papers belong to , or are possessed by,
               th e South Y orkshire police;

               (b) w hether th e C hief Constable is prepared to hand the archive over to a neutral third
               party,

               (c) w hat other steps th e C hief Constable proposes to take to co-operate w ith the
               Crown.

      10      In th e past you have failed to assist th e prosecution. W e believe that this .refusal was
               influenced by th e m istaken view expressed by M r Daines in 1998, before the
               sum m onses w ere issued, that any private prosecution w as likely to ccfall at th e first
               hurdle.” W e invite him now to take this case seriously. Since the argum ents are well
               know n to you, w e suggest that w e can reasonably expect a com prehensive reply by 6th
               August.

      H illsb o ro u g h : P riv a te P ro secu tio n s

      It is difficult to understand from your letter exactly what you are requesting.

      The position is not helped by a rather indiscriminate use o f the w ord “you” which variously appears
      to mean form er C hief Constables, the present Chief Constable, Assistant C hief Constable Ian Daines,
      th e South Y orkshire Police in general, my firm and/or myself personally.

      It is also difficult to know w hat exactly you are saying about the Hillsborough archive. This term is
      in any event a shorthand for a vast quantity o f material which has com e to the South Yorkshire
      Police through a variety o f sources, including the Taylor Inquiry, the mini Inquests, the civil
      proceedings, the M ain Inquest, the criminal investigation, the disciplinary proceedings and the
      H illsborough Scrutiny. It can hardly be disputed that this archive is in the physical possession o f the
      S outh Y orkshire Police and access to it is therefore under the control o f the present C hief Constable.
      I am n o t aw are o f anybody having put forward arguments to the effect that South Yorkshire Police
      “ow n” the inform ation or are “principals” in relation to it. For understandable reasons there is a
      dearth o f authority as to th e ownership o f a criminal investigation file but it can hardly be doubted
      th a t the normal hom e for such material would be with the Police Force for the area w here the crime
      is alleged to have taken place.

      B e that as it may, in relation to the committal proceedings the Chief Constable sought guidance from
      CPS in relation to docum entation and complied with the guidance given.

      T he C hief C onstable also made clear that he would comply with any request or O rder o f the Court in
      th e relation to th e production o f docum entation and that also was done.

     T he C h ief C onstable also offered voluntary access to docum entation from the archive subject only to
     provision o f som e com m ent as to its relevance, payment o f costs and a reservation o f any possible
     issue o f legal professional privilege. It was indicated that the last issue w as unlikely to present a
     problem in relation to any evidential material. That offer was never taken up but w as simply
     described as extortionate.

     T he suggestion that the South Y orkshire Police have “failed to assist” the Prosecution is therefore
     misconceived.

      Turning to th e points raised in your numbered paragraph 9 the answers are as follows:-

      a)    T h e South Y orkshire Police do not advance any "contentions" about the archive. They are in
            physical possession o f it and they affirm that in dealing with it they are subject to the guidance
            o f th e D irector o f Public Prosecutions (through CPS) and to any guidance or directions o f the
            C ourt.

      b)    As stated above the C hief Constable will deal with the archive subject to any guidance and
            directions referred to.

      c)    Y ou do not state what other co-operation is being sought.

      P rio r to receipt o f your fax the C hief Constable had already asked CPS to advise in relation to any
      future request from the Prosecution for docum entation and no doubt such guidance will be
      forthcom ing in the near future. The C hief Constable will then make any necessary future decision
      about th e archive in the light o f such guidance. There is therefore no need for the C hief Constable to
      b e represented at any Pre Trial Review hearing unless this is requested by the court.

      Finally, although it does not appear to bear any relevance to the core o f your request I should say
      that so far as I am aw are neither I nor my firm advised the South Y orkshire Police about disclosure
      o f m aterial to bereaved families at the inquest in 1990 or the supply o f information to the CPS in
      1989 o r 1990. B oth the inquest and the CPS consideration were supported by the W est Midlands
      Police w ho certainly did not seek our advice as to the disclosure o f material. I would be very
      surprised if (as you appear to suggest) the CPS, HM Coroner, the W est Midlands Police or the PCA
      sought th e advice o f the South Yorkshire Police on this subject either.

D ear Mr Wilson

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Your letter to the W est Midlands Police dated 5 May 1999 h a s b een p a s s e d to m e in my capacity
a s the archivist for the Hillsborough D isaster papers.

Using the com puter d ata b a s e established at the time of the disaster, I have been able to trace the
record of the telephone conversation you had with th e W est Midlands Police Enquiry Team on
25 April 1989 and also, the questionnaire com pleted by Detective C onstable C arpenter of W est
Midlands Police.

Neither the questionnaire nor the com puter d ata b a s e entry contains a reference to your match
day ticket. Unfortunately, without a reference num ber it is virtually impossible to trace a single
docum ent, in an archive which is said to contain over o ne million se p arate pieces of p ap er and
m e a n s that the time it would take to com plete a m anual search cannot be justified.

I am sorry I am unable to a s sist you but can I re a s s u re you that a c c e s s to the archive is restricted,
at the p resen t time to providing information for legal proceedings and if your match day ticket is in
th e archive, it is impossible for it to “slip into the wrong h a n d s”.

Dear Sir,

           I am of the understanding that your force was the one
that investigated the Hillsborough tragedy.        I contributed
evidence to the enquiry and regrettably agreed to loan my ticket
as evidence to two detectives on the understanding that I would
have the said item returned. I appreciate I have left this a long
time in asking but, as you can hopefully understand, I have no
idea how long evidence is held or needed for but I was hoping
that 10 years is long enough.

           As you can imagine the ticket is a very personal and
special artifact to me not least because it saved my life, to
this day I still remember with a chill wishing I was in the
Leppings Lane terrace on first recieving my stand ticket. It
was for row 1 in the West Stand I seem to recall, possibly seat
number 4.

          The other thing that troubles me is the idea that it
would slip into the wrong hands and become some sort of macabre
souvenir for some undesirable.

           I thankyou for your attention and would be eternally
grateful if the said ticket could be traced.

            Yours faithfully,




            Mr
                                                       \

Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

I attach a copy of a letter I recently sen t to Mr G eorge Croston, Prosecution Team Leader, at
C PS. You will s e e that my letter to him ask s for advice on how I should deal with a very
sensitive issu e with which you a re familiar. To d ate I have not received a reply from
Mr Croston. I would be obliged to receive your advice, by telephone intially on w hether I
would be acting reasonably if I w ere to ignore Mr C roston’s advice if I felt it inappropriate. My
concern is that Mr Croston may advise me not to disclose the correspondence relating to this
reported incident but I may feel duty bound to m ake such disclosure.

I also attach a letter from Mr Croston, dated 4 A ugust 1999, in which he offers advice about
disclosure from the Hillsborough archive to Ms Adlington.               You will s e e that he
s u g g e sts that I d iscuss this with you. My first impression is that the advice ap p ea rs
reasonable, I am inclined to go along with it. P lea se telephone to give m e your views.

Yours sincerely




Ian D aines
A ssistant Chief C onstable

         Dear Mr. Daines

         R v Duckenfield & Murray
         Access to archive

         I refer to previous correspondence, in particular my letters o f 12* and 20thAugust.
         On 24th August Mr. Croston informed me that he had given you further guidance and that you
         would be writing to me. 1 still await your response having provided you on 20* August with a
         comprehensive list o f material to which we seek access.

         We cannot possibly allow this matter to remain in such a state o f uncertainty. I am having a
         consultation with Leading Counsel tomorrow. If we do not have your clear proposals by then,
         we will have to make representations and ask the court to resolve matters on 3"1September.

         Yours Sincerely

D ear Mrs Adlington

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I refer to your letter of 20 A ugust 1999. I have discussed your letter with Mr G eorge Croston,
C PS, and Mr P eter Metcalfe, Hammond Suddards.

If w e are in p o sse ssio n of items 1 - 9 and I can find them then I am prepared to disclose them.
In particular, I do not know w hether we hold pocket books of officers containing notes of the
ev en ts of 15 April 1989 (item 2 on your list). If we hold the pocket books, I will disclose the
relevant p ag es. I will let you know a s soon a s the position is clear.

I am not at liberty to disclose the opinions of G areth Williams, QC, and P eter Birts, QC. They
w ere com m issioned by the D PP and it is for him to decide w hether he w ishes to disclose
them. Similarly, I am not at liberty to disclose the W est Midlands Police Report to the DPP.
However, if Mr Croston w ishes either docum ent to be released and we have copies of them, I
will release them to you.

I will enquire w hether it is possible to transfer HOLMES material onto a disc for your u se (item
12 on your list). I will need to check with the Home Office w hether they wish m e to release
material in this m anner, the HOLMES system is a Home Office system .

You a sk m e to define w hat I m ean by “supervised” acc e ss. This is Mr C roston’s p h rase and
perh ap s you should clarify it with him. For my part, I s e e it in the following terms:

You will com e to our archive store. If you wish to be accom panied by legally qualified staff, I
would ask to be told of their n am es before arrival. Material will be brought from the storeroom
to an other room and you will exam ine the material while my staff a re in the room but they will
not overhear your conversations. If you w ant a docum ent to be copied, my staff will do that
either immediately or a s soon a s practicable. Originals will be returned to the store.

On 30 S ep tem b er 1998, my solicitor P eter Metcalfe (Hammond S uddards) wrote to you and at
p aragraphs 2.1, 2.2 and 3 he asked for a s s u ra n c e s from you regarding confidentiality and
paym ent of an administration charge. P lea se respond to th e se requests.

Yours sincerely

 20th August 1999

 Dear Mr Daines

 R v. D u cke n fie ld a n d M u rra y

 Thank you for your letter dated 17th August, which we received by fax . We are encouraged
 that Mr Croston is to be involved in the process o f disclosure. I earnestly hope that it can
 begin soon, so that a clearly defined procedure is established and operating in advance o f the
 hearing before Mr Justice Hooper on 3rd September.

 I write on the basis that you have satisfied yourself that you are in a position, in law, to
 disclose material prepared and collected, not only by the South Yorkshire police for its own
 and external investigations, but also by the West Midlands police force, and any other outside
 police force that may have investigated the disaster, for the purposes o f :

          (a) the inquiiy commissioned by the Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire police on
          16th April 1989;
          (b) the Taylor Inquiiy;
          (c) the inquiries o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions;
          (d) the Coroner’s inquest; and
          (e) the investigations o f the Police Complaints Authority

 In view o f the legal issues arising in this difficult and controversial case, I should be grateful
 for your confirmation in this respect. .

 The material which we wish to review as relevant to the trial itself, and in part to the abuse o f
 process/ oppression argument which Mr Duckenfield’s solicitors have told us is to be brought
 yet again, is as follows:




           Phone 01 5 1 2 36 191 9. F a x 0151 236 1936. E M a il in fo @ h fs g .o rg
        l jt F lo o r C e n tra l B u ild in g s 41 N o rth John S tre e t L iv e rp o o l L 2 6 R R
(1)   The originals o f all signed edited and unedited reports and statements made by officers
      o f the South Yorkshire and any other police forces (eg Nottinghamshire and
      Merseyside) relating to the disaster and its surrounding circumstances. It is necessary
      for us to see these because o f the scale o f the editing exercise, and because there is
      doubt surrounding the circumstances in which parts o f some statements came to be
      written. The best example o f this is, o f course, the confusion surrounding the
      statements o f Inspector Harry White. You will recall that another statement o f his
      came to light after a letter from Dr Popper to Mr Croston in June o f this year.

      For the avoidance o f doubt, this categoiy includes all statements made by officers as to
      the lies told by David Duckenfield on 15th April 1989 about the circumstances in which
      the exit gates became open.

(2)   All pocket-books o f officers containing notes o f the events o f 15th April, whether made
      contemporaneously, or within days, or later, and all handwritten and typed “resumes”,
      or other similar notes, made by officers shortly after the incident. The
      Nottinghamshire officers, Brazener, who was called as a live witness at committal,
      Hoad, and Walton refer to them. ( See reports R 498, R 499, and R 450, where one o f
      these resumes is apparently attached.)

(3)   All original signed statements collected by the West Midlands police from those who
      had been present at or in the vicinity o f the ground at the time o f the disaster.

(4)   All notes and tape recordings o f meetings held by South Yorkshire police officers in
      the days and weeks after the disaster at which assertions o f fact, admissible under
      section 24 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1988, were made about the disaster. (An
      example is the collection o f three sets o f briefing notes o f meetings held by or under
      the auspices o f the Chief Constable on 16th, 17th and 19th April, which were produced
      by you to the Magistrates Court on 24® June. If the notes are a transcript o f a tape
      recording, we wish to hear and have copies o f those tape recordings also)

(5)   All documents, photographs, plans, videotape and models, either prepared to show or
      demonstrate the lay-out o f the ground, or which record events at Hillsborough
      between 1 and 6 pm on 15th April 1989, in addition to those produced by the witness
      statement, and whether such things were prepared by police, Sheffield Wednesday
      football club, City Council or emergency services.

(6)   All tape recordings and transcripts o f tape recordings showing the content o f
      conversations taking place in or from the police control box between 1 pm and 6 pm
      on 15th April 1989, not being conversations recorded by the radio multi-channel
      system (which we have already examined after you produced the tape on 24® May),
      whether made or produced by police officers or emergency services

(7)   All tape and video recordings o f Recounts given by police officers or other witnesses in
      interview, whether or notundaf p^ution, relating to the disaster.
(8)    All indexes to witnesses, statements or exhibits produced for any o f the inquiries into
       the disaster.

(9)    All expert reports prepared for the South Yorkshire or West Midlands police forces,
       whether for any o f the above inquiries, or for the contribution hearings o f autumn
        1990, apart from the Phillips report o f August 1990, a copy o f which you produced to
       us in October 1997. If there are other versions o f the Phillips report, we wish to see
       them.

(10)   A copy o f the West Midlands Police Report which was sent to the DPP and Coroner in
       1990. This cannot be considered sensitive (a) because a copy o f the Interim Report o f
       that force o f October 1989 is in the Public Record office, (b) because you have a copy,
       though the Report was prepared for the DPP, and (c) because the Coroner has a copy.

(11)   A copy o f the opinion signed by Gareth Williams QC ad Peter Birts QC which was sent
       to the DPP in 1990. This is no longer privileged because a copy has been sent to your
       force, although it was, o f course, your force that was primarily under investigation.
       Any surviving privilege was waived when it was produced to Lord Justice Stuart-
       Smith, who quoted from it in the report o f his “Scrutiny”.

(12)   The electronically-recorded versions o f the above, where they exist, stored on the
       Holmes computer system. We have ascertained that the material can be copied
       electronically from that system into a disc form that w e can use. Such copying will
       relieve us o f the need to photocopy vast numbers o f documents, although w e anticipate
       that there will remain a large number o f documents that we shall need to copy after
       inspection.

(13)   The charges, and list o f witnesses statements prepared for, the disciplinary proceedings
       brought against the two defendants, but abandoned after Mr Duckenfield retired from
       the force.

We anticipate from your previous attitudes towards the prosecution that you will claim that
the items in (10) and (11) are “sensitive”. If so, please indicate why you consider them to be
sensitive, and what reason in law you offer to justify withholding them from the Crown.

It may be that the list above includes the whole, or practically the whole, o f the “archive”.
We cannot be more specific, o f course, because w e do not know the identity o f all the
witnesses; a difficulty you will remember that hampered us in specifying material in the witness
summons. We need to see this material not simply for our own purposes, but because w e have
to disclose all material that may possibly be relevant to the defence. Unfortunately, w e do not
know what the defence will be, and the question which factual issues will be contested at trial
has not been made known.

In order to make our task, and yours, more manageable, we have invited the defence to set out
the nature o f their defence, but they have not done so. They declined to do so for what
appeared to be tactical reasons at the committal.
You will appreciate that the committal changes the responsibilities o f the prosecution. Given
(a) the powerful rejection by the court o f the allegations o f the defence that w e were abusing
the process o f the court, and (b) the strength o f the prima facie case, it was not necessary for
us, consistent with the law, to do more in two days at the magistrates’ court than to call two
live witnesses, read a few uncontroversial statements, show the compilation video, and read
the defendants’ evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and Inquest.

Our public duties now that w e prosecute in the name o f the Crown are greater. We wish to
have as complete and full access to your material as if w e were the Crown Prosecution Service
having the conduct, on indictment, o f a case in which your force had investigated and
instituted the proceedings.


I should be grateful if you could indicate what exactly you mean by “supervised” access. We
shall wish to inspect and copy material in some privacy, not least because you have expressed
public support for the defendants, and have procured the costs o f their defence and expenses
from public funds.

The above list o f material is, I hope, complete so far as trial material is concerned. Other
material relevant simply to the abuse hearing may be requested later. I reserve the right to
seek other material for the trial, after discussions within the prosecution team. I consider it is
more important, however, to give you an early, and possibly incomplete list, than to delay. I
shall send a copy o f this to Mr Croston, and seek to arrange an early meeting with him and Mr
Hepworth as you suggest.

Yours sincerely,
A i/_________ /

          Dear Ms Adlington

          Adlington v Duckenfleld & Murray

          I refer to my letter of 11 August 1999 and to your reply of 12 August 1999 Now that Mr
          Cro ton has returned from holiday, I have had the opportunity of discussing matters with
          him.

          I am prepared to allow supervised access to non-sensitive documents. Mr Croston has
          offered his services in assisting my staff in that supervision. There are some dates when he
          is on leave or otherwise engaged My proposal is this;

          1.     Please send me a schedule of material to which you seek access.

          2.     Please arrange direct with Mr Croston and the Force Hillsborough Archivist, Mr Alan
                 Hepworth, dates on which the three of you can meet at Heeley (Sheffield) police
                 office for the purpose of releasing material.

          The purpose of asking for a schedule of material is;

          1.     To allow staff the time to locate the documents.

          2.     To determine whether each document as sensitive or non-sensitive.

          Yours sincerely

    D ear Mrs Adlington

    ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

    I refer to your letter of 20 August 1999. I have discussed your letter with Mr G eorge Croston,
    C PS, and Mr P eter Metcalfe, Hammond Suddards.

    If w e are in possessio n of items 1 - 9 and I can find them then I am prepared to disclose them.
    In particular, I do not know w hether we hold pocket books of officers containing notes of the
    events of 15 April 1989 (item 2 on your list). If we hold the pocket books, I will disclose the
    relevant pages. I will let you know a s soon a s the position is clear.

    I am not a t liberty to disclose the opinions of Gareth Williams, QC, and P eter Birts, QC. They
    w ere com missioned by the DPP and it is for him to decide w hether he w ishes to disclose
    them. Similarly, I am not at liberty to disclose the W est Midlands Police Report to the DPP.
    However, if Mr Croston w ishes either docum ent to be released and we have copies of them, I
    will release them to you.

    I will enquire w hether it is possible to transfer HOLMES material onto a disc for your u se (item
    12 on your list). I will need to check with the Home Office w hether they wish me to release
    material in this manner, the HOLMES system is a Home Office system.

    You ask me to define w hat I m ean by “supervised” a c c ess. This is Mr Croston’s phrase and
    perhaps you should clarify it with him. For my part, I s e e it in the following terms:

    You will com e to our archive store. If you wish to be accom panied by legally qualified staff, I
    would ask to be told of their n am es before arrival. Material will be brought from the storeroom
    to another room and you will exam ine the material while my staff are in the room but they will
    not overhear your conversations. If you want a docum ent to be copied, my staff will do that
    either immediately or a s soon a s practicable. Originals will be returned to the store.
S
    On 3(Y septem ber)l 998, my solicitor P eter Metcalfe (Hammond Suddards) wrote to you and at
    paragraphs 2.1T2.2 and 3 he asked for a ssu ra n c e s from you regarding confidentiality and
    paym ent of an administration charge. P lea se respond to th e se requests.

    Yours sincerely

I refer to previous correspondence, in particular my letters o f 12* and 20* August.
On 24* August Mr. Croston informed me that he had given you further guidance and that you
would be writing to me. I still await your response having provided you on 20* August with a
comprehensive list o f material to which we seek access.

We cannot possibly allow this matter to remain in such a state o f uncertainty. I am having a
consultation with Leading Counsel tomorrow. If w e do not have your clear proposals by then,
w e will have to make representations and ask the court to resolve matters on 3rd September.

Yours Sincerely

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I refer to recent telephone conversations betw een us and to the letter dated 20 A ugust 1999
from Ms Adlington to me.

I have d iscu ssed this with Mr G eorge Croston, Special Caseworker, CPS. His advice is that I
should disclose the material sought by Ms Adlington. However, I think the W est Midlands
Police Report (item 10) may not be suitable for disclosure; I would be obliged to receive your
advice on that.

Mr Croston s a y s that item 11, the opinions of two Q C ’s, is sensitive. It is not for the Chief
Constable to release a docum ent prepared for som eo ne else (the DPP) when the other do es
not consent.

I do not know w hether item 12 (HOLMES discs) is technically feasible and I will look into this.

I think I should ask for the sam e a s s u ra n c e a s to confidentiality and paym ent of an
administration charge, a s previously detailed.

I attach a draft letter which I propose to send to Ms Adlington and I would be obliged to receive
your advice.

Yours sincerely

Adlington v Duckenfield & Murray

I refer to my letter of 11 A ugust 1999 and to your reply of 12 A ugust 1999. Now that Mr
C roston h a s returned from holiday, I have had the opportunity of discussing m atters with
him.

I am prepared to allow supervised a c c e s s to non-sensitive docum ents. Mr Croston has
offered his services in assisting my staff in that supervision. There are so m e d a te s w hen he
is on leave or otherwise engag ed . My proposal is this;

1.    P le a se sen d m e a schedule of material to which you se e k acc e ss.

2.    P le a se arran g e direct with Mr Croston and the Force Hillsborough Archivist, Mr Alan
       Hepworth, d a te s on which the three of you can m eet a t Heeley (Sheffield) police
       office for the purpose of releasing material.

The purpose of asking for a schedule of material is;

1.    To allow staff the time to locate the docum ents.

2.    To determ ine w hether eac h docum ent a s sensitive or non-sensitive.

12th August 1999

Dear Mr Daines,

R v. Duckenfield and Murray



Thank you for your letter o f 11th August. We look forward to hearing from you again as a
matter o f urgency on this matter. Since Mr Croston has already given his advice and you have
been advised by your own lawyers, it is not clear why Mr Croston’s absence on holiday
prevents the prosecution from being told now what disclosure the South Yorkshire police
intends to make.

You may know that a preliminary hearing has been arranged before Mr Justice Hooper at the
Crown Court at Leeds for 3rd September at 2 pm. The prosecution wishes to raise the whole
question o f access to documentation before the judge at this hearing, and we therefore need to
know as soon as possible what you are intending to disclose. It is possible that we shall again
wish to serve a witness summons upon you, but it may be that this can be avoided. However,
it seems probable in the light o f the history o f the case that matters o f law will arise, and that
these will affect you. The prosecution will ask for these to be resolved as soon as possible, so
that we can use the time profitably in the months before trial.

You may consider therefore that you ought to be legally represented on 3rd September.
Leading counsel for the Crown will circulate a skeleton argument beforehand o f legal matters
that he intends to raise. It would be helpful to know whether we should correspond with you
or Mr Metcalf about this.

Yours sincerely,.

          Dear Mr Daines

          R E : ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND M URRAY

          Further to my letter o f 22 July 1999 I am now able to give you substantive answers to
          the questions that you posed in your letter to us o f 21 July 1999.

          The Director Casework, Mr C Newell, has been consulted on the latest developments
          in the case and, following a full review o f all the present circumstances, it has been
          decided that it is not appropriate for us to intervene in the private prosecution.

          Now that the matter has been committed to the Crown Court the HFSG should be able
          to obtain a summons directing the police to disclose such statements and exhibits as
          would allow the private prosecutor to comply with their duty o f disclosure to the
          defendants. I understand that the hearing before Mr Justice Hooper on 3 September
          1999 may be for that purpose.

          Our advice is that you should allow unfettered, albeit supervised, access to all the non
          sensitive documents in the archives. This would be less time consuming for your
          officers than endeavouring to ascertain what is and is not relevant before giving
          access. I am willing to assist your archivist in such supervision if that would be
          helpful. As regards any material subject to PII, I would also offer my services in
          helping your officers to prepare a schedule o f the relevant material. That schedule
          could be provided to the HFSG so that they may, if they wish, make an application to
          the court for the disclosure o f any particular documents.

          The HFSG have again asked us to advise the Chief Constable to surrender possession
          o f the archive. Having conducted another review o f the circumstances w e are writing
          to the HFSG to inform them that as we see no valid grounds for their proposition we
          decline to so advise.




                           Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests of justice
You may wish to discuss the above advice with Hammond Suddards. I would be
grateful if we could consult on the content o f any draft letter offering disclosure to the
HFSG where it might involve CPS actions.

Yours sincerely




George R Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

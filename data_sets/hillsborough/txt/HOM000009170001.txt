                     But minutes after the disaster, in which 89
                     fans were crushed to death, he "deceitfully
                     and dishonestly" told senior FA officials that
                     the supporters had forced the gate open
                     themselves, Mr Jones said.

                     Six weeks later Mr Duckenfield changed his
                     account under public questioning when he
                     made a public apology for suggesting that
                     Liverpool spectators caused the disaster, he
                     added.

                 James Aspinall, 18.

                 The trial is the result of a private prosecution
                 brought to court by the Hillsborough Family
                 Support Group.

                 Both defendants also          Duckenfield
                 deny a second charge          d eceitfu lly and
                 of w ilfully neglecting to    dishonestly
                 carry out a public duty,      concealed from
                                               those men th a t he

                                               opened

                 Mr Jones told the court
                 th a t Mr Duckenfield        Alun Jones QC
                 spoke to FA chief executive Graham Kelly in
                 the police control box overlooking the terraces
                 m inutes after the disaster.

                 He said Duckenfield recognised very quickly
                 the causes of the disaster "and he was
                 responsible".

                 "He realised th a t a man like Graham Kelly
                 would be likely to talk within minutes to the
                 media and he sought to deflect the blame
                 from himself and place it on the spectators."

                 "Duckenfield deceitfully and dishonestly
                 concealed from those men that he had himself
                 ordered the exit gates to be opened because
                 the crush at the turnstiles had become so
                 severe"

                 He later gave two accounts of what he had
                 said to Mr Kelly, the first, that the gates had
                 burst open themselves, and the second an
                 "extraordinary assertion" th a t he feared crowd
                 disorder if he had adm itted he had given the
                 order.

                 "O b v io u s s te p "

                 The court was told that the two policemen also
                 failed to take the "obvious step" of blocking off
                 a narrow tunnel leading to the terraces where
                 the fatal overcrowding took place.

                 Alun Jones told the court the tragedy could
                 have been averted if the defendants had
                 ordered officers to block or close off the tunnel
                 to terrace pens three and four.

                 He said the pens were,        They surrendered

                 No s p e c u la tio n

                 When court proceedings began, Mr Jones
                 asked the ju ry to try not to be affected by the
                 unusual circumstances of the trial.

                 Alun Jones QC, prosecuting, told the ju ry :
                 "This prosecution is unusual because the case
                 is being tried more than 11 years after the
                 event.

                 "We ask you not to
                 speculate why this
                 case is brought now -
                 equally we ask you not
                 to speculate why no
                 prosecution was
                 brought, by us or
                 others, nearer the
                 tim e."

                 Relatives of some of       The court heard that
                 the victim s were in the   perimeter gates were opened
                                            during the game
                 packed courtroom to
                 hear the case open.

                 The trial at Leeds Crown Court is expected to
                 last five weeks, and is being heard under
                 Justice Hooper.

                 The Hillsborough Family Support Group has
                 the form er Football Association chief executive
                 Graham Kelly amongst its 34 witnesses.

                 The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday,
                 when the ju ry will view video film of the
                 disaster.

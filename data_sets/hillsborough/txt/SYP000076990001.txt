Some      were       sitting            on    the       gr a s s ,    some       were       standing           anjK'th^/e w e r e

large        groups          walking          in     both        directions            along         the/ r o a d .         I saw         that

the      majority            of    those          standing           still       or    seated/were                 d r inking        be er      f r om

aware        of    any       incidents             of     drunkeness             or    unruly           behaviour.               From      the

time      we      entered          Halifax          Rd     unjrtd      th e      time       we     reached           the    turnstiles

Liverpool            supporters,                  some     pWple         were         even       s h o u t i n g gnit t h e s e

requests           to    the       passing           c ro w d s .      I can a l s o             say      t h kx     the    footpaths

were      packed with                  supporters            walking          to      the       ground.            Initially          there

were      small         groups          of    police         officers            scattered              alon^Halifax                 Rd and

the      officers            were      more        concentrated               as we         approached               Penistone            Rd.

I recall           seeing          a    public          house        on m y      right          harjd^i d e , I dont                 re c a ll

house      was       closed and               there       appeared          to      have       been a stronger                        police

presence            here.          We    were       able       to w a l k      along       t h is         Road       freely although

it w a s       quite         pa c k e d .      This       was    the     first          Liverpool                match         I ha d

attended            and      having         regard        to    the    importance               of        the     game         th e    crowds

were     what        1 had         expected.              We    reached          th e    island wit ho ut                      further

incident            and      turned         into     Leppings          Ln.          A s _________ k n e w w h a t                 part       of       the

ground         we were          going         to.     I immediately                   noticed             that       there       were        a

greater         density            of    supporters             in L e p p i n g s       Ln     than Ha li fax                  Rd and

according            the P o l i c e          presence          had    increased.                   The        f a ns     appeared           to       be

well      beha v e d_ a nd L t h e r e             were    no     incidents             requiringpolice                         involvement.

We    walked         directly            to    the    turnstiles               marked          A/G        on the          plan and           saw

t ha t    there        were        only a          limited        number         of     supporters                outside             the

turnstiles             and      there         were    no       organised            queues.               We     were      able        to    pass

freely         between          these         spectators.              Just         prior       to        this,         the     number           of

spectators             drinking             from     cans       had    dramatically                   reduced             from        those       seen

earlier         and       there         were       only    isolated            instanceyr of                   it.        As    previously

stated         we    were       approached            on a        number         of     cynrasions               fo r     t i c k e t s but           1

did      not    see       any      touts       or a n y        other     person          sellingymy                     tickets.

We    eventually               passed         through          the     turnstile               at     a^out          1335 h o u r s         and

again      we       did      this       quite       easily.            I handed           o^fr         my      t i c k e t to         the

operator            and went            into       uncovered          area       beyond         the W S t a n d .                 1 think             it

was      before        going        through          th i s     turnstile             that      I was            sej^rched by a

Police         Officer          before         being       allowed          e n tr y .

Once      inside          the      enclosure,             I saw       t ha t     it w a s       quite            congested with

Liverpool            supporters               who    appeared          to      be     j u st    standing                about,         but       I was

able      to m o v e         about       freely.           I personally                 drank         a    can       of    pop,        collected

a    programme            f r o m one         of    the    sellers          and       went      to        th e    toilets.              I would

estimate            t ha t    we    stood          in the       area      marked          A1        u n ti l     a b o u t 1 4 00       ho ur s .

During         this       time      the       crowd where              I was        remained               constant and                I did          not

witness         any       incidents            of    unruly          behaviour,            drunkenness                    or    unlawful

M y a t t e n t i o n wa s         drawn         to a       tunnel       which        runs      under         the W S t a n d             a n d as

someone        who      had       not     attended a              previous         gameyat           t h is     location,             I

believed           this      to    be     the     only       entrance           poyft      to       the    standing             enclosure.

There        were      no    signs        visible           directing           tire to    other          p a r ts    of    t he G r o u n d .

As     we    approached            the     tunnel,           I diC^rat           see      any Police             Officers             or

stewards           present         at     its     entrants,             although          there were             a    number          of

Police        Officers            in th e        area,

A s we       entered         the     t u n n e l , /%. w a s        initially             easy       to m o v e       through             the

crowds        but as         we    neareVi^Che              standing          enclosure             we    had    to       push    ou r w a y

through        a mass         of     spectators              who w er e         stood      at       the    end       of    the    tunnel.

I did        not    see a n y        incident           of a l c o h o l        being      drunk          in t h i s       ar e a .        We

were        literally         carried            through          the    crowd and             entered          the       pen m a r k e d 4

on     the    grid and            stopped         at    a    po i n t    marked        (1)      on this          grid,          (A 2 ) on

From        this    location            I could         only       partially           see      the       playing          surface           due

to     the    large         density        of     crowd       in f r o n t       of me         and       I had       trouble

standing           up on      th e      st e p s .      This       crowd was           far      more       dense          than    I had

anticipated and                   for     some        time    I was          unable       to m o v e       and       my arms          were

pinned        against         my     body        as    I tried          to    hold my          glasses          in    position.                 I

r e m a i n e d at      this       location            with                     far    about         twenty          minutes          and

during        t h is    time       I had         seen       one    or    two     people         push their                way    through

th e    crowd       but      I c o u l d n ’t         imagine w here             they were               going       to as       my

At     about       14E5      hrs     or    thereabouts,                 we   decided           to    follow          these       few

supporters             and    s ee      where         they were          going.           We    had       only m o v e d a bou t                ten

yards        maxiumum         down        the     steps       when       th e    crowd         thinned          out       dramatically

a n d we      were      able       to     stand        freely and             I could          even       pick       my    viewing

point        with      ease.

fence           dividing           p e ns     4 and        5.        There       were       a    number           of    other       supporters

who     had        previously                completed           similar           moves         and        some       of    the    spectators

were        steadying              t h e m as        they       climbed          over.                            and       I then          climbed

I would            estimate             there        were       only about               250     to 3 0 0 y ^ c t a t o r s _            in       this

p en a n d         we    stood          in     open     spaces.

At     about           1455       hours       I looked           t o w a r d s pen 4             and        saw    the a r e a n e ar              to

th e    dividing              fence          4/3     was        extremely crowded                  and        I    was       very pleased                we

had     go t       out       of    it.        I saw        one m a n        in     particular                who       was       facing         away

from        th e       pitch an d            he w a s      squashed             completely              up a g a i n s t          the       railings

and     he       couldn't           move.            I c a n' t       describe             any     expressions                   on his         face     or

whether            he was          having          trouble           breathing             because           I j u st        passed          comment

to                      and       then       looked        elsewhere.                 I c a n' t        describe             this       m a n at

all,        apart        from       him being              fairly         stocky,           aged        about          35 years            and about

3*7     ta ll.

Both        teams        appeared             from      the      tunnel          onto       the        pitch an d my a t t e n t i o n s

attention            wa s     drawn       to     pens       4 and 3 and                I saw a          continuous                flow        of

spectators             being        lifted         from        the    rear        of      these        pens      into        th e       seated

area      of    the W S t a n d .              There        were      also        isolated             instances             of     spectators

being      caried            in a      prostrate            position across                      the    he^is          of    spectators

and      eventually            into       pen 5.

At    about         1 5 00    hours       and      v i r t u a l l y as         the       kic^-off           whistle            wa s     sounded,

I saw about             si x       people        or    so      cljmbing           ovey       the       fence       and       o nt o      the

p i t c h a r e a at          point       A5     on    t h e ^ p l a n .\ T ^ e r e          were       a    number          o f Police

Officers            present         at    this        lyation             and     they were             pushing             these

s upporters            back a g ainst              y e      fence.           I had          no    i de a w h y         these        people

were      climbing            the      feVice^and           I would          think          the P o l i c e        felt         there         was

going      to       be a      pitch       invasion.

Over      the       next      few minut es,               the       numbers          of     people          climbing            the      fence

increased            and      I saw       the      Police           form a        line       and       they      restricted                  these

people         from     gaining           access          to    the       p i tc h .        I then          noticed          t ha t      a    number

of    people         being         helped        o ve r     t hi s    fence          were        injured and                I think           at

t h is    stage        the P o l i c e         realised what                 was       happening             and       eventually

assisted            them      to    climb        over.

My a t t e n t i o n was            then       drawn        to a      number           of    f a ns     who      started            to       pull

with      their        hands        at    t he     fencing           at    th e      front        of    pen 4.              They were

joined         by a     number           of P o l i c e        Officers           and       between          them       they        forced          the

meshing         away         from      its     supports             and after             that        there was             a slow           trickle

of    fans      escaping            through           this      area.           By     t hi s     time       there          was     a    large

number         of    spectators              on a n d       around         the       pitch and              the m a t c h w a s              stopped

and      the    players            left      the      fi e l d .

I s a w at          this      t i me     that      there        were a          number           of    bodies          l a id     out        beyond

the      goal       area     and       some      were       injured and                some were             dead,          they        having

their      faces        covered with                  their         jackets.              I saw a           la r g e    number           of

and artificial                 resuscitation                   to    these        people.              The     pitch are a               became

just    a mass           of    people       wandering           and       lying       about,          the     injured being

carried        on h o a r d i n g s        which        had    been       ripped          down    from various               parts       of

th e   Ground.

           and        I climbed            over     the       fence       dividing             pens     6 and 5 and walked

through        th e      open    gate       onto        the    edge       of    the       pit c h.         There      were       that

many     people          attending          the     injured          by    this       time       that        we    felt     we    had

nothing        to     offer      so we       walked           through          pen 4 a n d        out        of    th e G r o u n d ,

through        the       tunnel,          under     the       W Stand.           The       time       then w ould           have       been

about     1 5 4 3 hrs.

I am     unable          to    describe          any     of    the    injured             or    dead       I saw      on    the    pitch

area     and     I am         unable       to a s s i s t      further          with       what       wa s    happening           on    the

pitch after              the    m a t c h was       stopped.              On    my way          out     of    pen 4        I saw a

number     of       people's          possessions              including          a       pair    of       glasses,         scarves

and     hats     and      other       clothing           l y i ng    about       on       the    rloojr.

I then     walked             away    from       th e    Ground       and       didn't          noln.ce a n y         other

In     conclusion             I feel       that     I must          apport^n              blame       to     the     club    itself

because        there          were    no    signs        directing/supporters                         to     the    viewing        points

disaster         had      occurred.

Prior     to     the      kick-off          1 have        stated          that    the          pen 4 w a s         crowded and

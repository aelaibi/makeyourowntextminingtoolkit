                        C o m m e n c e d duty at 9am for briefing at                   10am at the SWFC G r o u n d .           Was

                        on serial 3 w i t h PS 57 7 Gardner                 in the S o u t h Stand.             Covered

                        tu r n s t i l e n o . E8 inside       the stand.          No    problems a l t h o u g h after 2.1 5 p m

                        was      quite busy.        At 3pm together w i t h PC 26 1              Cooper       e s c o r t e d the man

                        fro m Bett i n g Office w ith m oney outside                     the S o u t h S tand for security

                        reasons.

                        Just after 3pm heard from someone                       on turnstiles              say that    "they were

                        on the      pitch".         So wit h PC 261        joined PS 577 and others                   from serial

                        in upper          level at    rear of S o u t h Stand.           At    that       stage did not        really

                        know what was             happening.        Just   thought       it was a pitch invasion.                  Then

                        n o t i c e d a PC on       pitch giving m o u t h to m outh to a person and                          realised

                        then that s o m e t h i n g was wrong.              Then found out that                there were
                                                                i                                     .


                        problems a n d        people were       being t e r r i b l y     crushed and PS 5 7 7 d i r ected

                        us down onto          the    pitch to do what we             could to help.             This was about

                        3.10pm.           On the    pitch was told by a            ' B o s s ’, can't        remember who,        to hel

                        move      the ones wh,o were n ' t          injured to one side,                  so people    could get

                        out the ones          that were.        M o v e d quite a few plus helped others

                        sl i g h t l y    injured    to their feet and their                  friends       then m o v e d them.        By

                        now Liv e r p o o l       fans were    getting very antagonistic, towards Notts.
Forest        fans an d w ere       starting to make              their w a y towards           them   in a

threat e n i n g m a n n e r .      T hen told by Chief              Inspector Beal            to form a line

ac r o s s    centre    of    pitch to stop them               reaching N o t t s . Forest         fans.      Was

in that        line from then o n w a r d s .           Alot      of the fans were o b v i o u s l y

u p s e t , but others were             just    stood shouting            t h r e a tening     things towards

P o l i c e and N o t t s . F o r e s t .      Was    impressed how many fans did h elp but

d i s g u s t e d w i t h others who          smelled of drink and were a s k i n g w hen

r eplay was and w o u l d they get their m o n e y back.                              (Can't    remember what

time this w a s )            Remember     seeing Li v e r p o o l        fan running         towards Notts.

Forest        fans    "taun t i n g "   them.        He was      eventually       'escorted*       from the

pitch by P o l i c e         offi c e r s .    At    this     stage a l t h o u g h    I knew    people    had

been killed an d             had seen alot           stretchered         from the       pitch    I still      did

not know the extent                 of the tragedy as             I did not have a radio,               the

only one on our              serial w i t h a radio was PS 577 an d I had got split up

from him since            being on the          pitch.         After     ground had       cleared,

together wit h PC £ 6 1              and 70 who we re also               on serial       3, we went       to the

rear of L e p p i n g s Lane            end where we          found the       rest of our       serial.

Wer e    then just        s tood ho 1ding            crowds     back to a l l o w e m e r g e n c y vehicles

access.        The n e v e n t u a l l y d i r ected to N o r t h S t a n d for a de-bri e f i n g and

e v e n t u a l l y we re stood down at 7 pm.

The m ood of L i v e r p o o l          fans    Iw o u l d say was m a i n l y        frustration and

u p s e t , but      the re we re       othe rs who      smelied       of drink a n d seemed not to

care     less.

I did not have a n y             contact w i t h s t e wards at L e p pings L a n e .

I did not have a              radi o , so don't         know      if the re was any            break   down in

transmissions.

I did not handle a n y              bodies.

M y feelings are             that   I was stun n e d by what was                happeni ng and felt

frustrated           in that     I could not do more               to help.           I felt    so helpless

s tood       in the    'line across*           the    pitch,      also    I did not know exactly
                                                                                                   P AGE
                                                                                                   R 189

     F'    what was    hap p e n i n g as   I did not have a radio, where as usually you do

     t     at work,      I was    impressed by m ost of         the fans who did help,       but

            d i s g u s t e d by others who a p p e a r e d the worse   for wear   for dr i nk, and

            appeared    not to    care      less,   more   c o n cerned wit h getting   the i r m oney

            back.

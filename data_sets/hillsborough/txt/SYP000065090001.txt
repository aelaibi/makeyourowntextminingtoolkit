the      press,         I only         said       1 presummed                it to        be    the       case.          I was      obviously

not      in a      position            to a s s i s t          anyone.           After         I had       been         rescued,        I wa s

taken       from        the     seating           area         to     the      ex it m a r k e d          X, this led to               the    exit

into      an area after                 I had          been         left let       out     of       the        g a te by the           steward.

I lay on           the       floor      by       the       g a t e , and       just       wanted          to    go      to s l e e p a fan,

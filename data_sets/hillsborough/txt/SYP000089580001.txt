            GROUP.



            On Saturday 15 April           1989 (150489)        I was on duty from Sam (0800) and

           /due to finish at around 8 pm (2000).                     I came on duty at Attercliffe

            Police Station at 8 am (0800) and attended a briefing at West Bar Pol

            Station regarding the football match that day between Liverpool and

            Nottingham Forest.



            At 10am (1000)          I attended at Midland Trayfi Station in Sheffield in
                                                               R X & F S ------------------------
             company with Police Constable                1790 CryHLghi 11 (PC 1790) .   We were

            supervising fans alighting from the football specials and service

            tr ai ns, they were then being taken to Hillsborough by double decked
                                                                                 PAGE        2
                                                                                 S3384

       bu s e s .    Police Constable C rai g h i 11 and myself travelled on one of

       these buses to Hillsborough at around 1.30pm (1330s) .          After arriving

       at Hillsborough our serial 1ead by Police Seroeant 840 Wright             (PS 840)
                                  ------
       assembled near to the police room.^-^We were to be a reserve

       serial at the ground.


$.o.
       At about 2.30pm       (1450) yde were directed by Police Sergeant Wright to

       go to the Leppings Jca .ne tnd of the ground as they was some kind of

       trouble.        We -wl-mt along the back of the North Stand and into the area

       behind the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end,          there I saw an

       Inspector I do not know who he was.           He was looking through the glass

       in the sliding metal gates to the right of the turnstiles as viewed

       from the back.         He seemed to be contemplating opening the gates,        this

       appeared to be as there was a large crowd gathered outside and people

       that were coming through the turnstiles were saying things            like “ It's

       murder out there,       someone will get killed.”      I took that to mean that

       people were getting       crushed.      I looked through the glass   in the doors

       and I could see that there was a large crowd of people behind the

       gates,       someone mentioned that if the gates were opened we would get

       trampled in the rush.         The    Inspector seemed to have decided against

       opening the gates.



       I then went to tha/turnstiles at the left hand end fnd above those

       turnstiles       I coidld see some youths climbing over the railings and onto

       the roof of t/fte turnstiles.         These were being helped over by a police
        n     ~xn S I /
       Inspector Wno was also on the roof.            I helped a few youths down from

       the roof and then my attention was drawn to a man on the outside of

       one of the turnstiles.         He was bent over the turnstiles and asked for

       help.         He was obviously being pressed against the turnstile by the
                                      ■ "1 111 1     1       1   ""        ■ — ■—
       crowd outside.         The turnstile would not turn because of the pressure
                                                                                   PAGE        3
                                                                                   S3384

            on it and I kicked the turnstile back after telling the man what I was

            going to d o .    The turnstile turned and the man fell towards me.        I

            ascertained that he was uninjured,        I took him to one side and told

            him to take it steady until he got his wind back.



            1 continued helping    people through the turnstiles who were having the

            same problem and I could see that a lot of people were simply holding

            their tickets    in the air   in the rush they were not having their

            tickets taken from them.       At this time there were two or three other

            P C ’s around me, but who I do not know who they were.



            As the pressure from the crowd eased and the turnstiles began

            operating properly I moved back from the turnstiles.         I then became

            aware that there was a lot of people stood in the area behind the

            turnstiles and around the caravan type trailer from which programmes

            were being sold.      Someone mentioned to me that a gate to my left was

            now clear if I wanted to eject anyone.        I think it was a steward who

            said this to me.



            I then became aware of Police Sergeant Wright and others from my

            serial    running towards the South stand,   I was beckoned to go with them

            and I followed as they appeared to be attending something       important.

            We went around the side of the stand and onto the perimeter of the

            pitch. This was only possible by going through a locked gate which we

            were     stood at for around 43 seconds to one minute.      It was

            eventually opened by a steward.       I went around the perimeter track to

            face the barriers behind the goal mouth at the Leppings Lane End.              I

            could see a small gate in the bar riers, I think it was open at the

            time.      I was going to go through this gate which goes    into the left

            hand pen as viewed from the pitch.        I was unable to do this at first

                                                                                   PAGE         4
                                                                                   S3384

due to fans crowding to see what was happening                    in the centre pen.

Some of the crowd were brought out onto the pitch and others moved

back to allow us in.              When 1 got in I went to the dividing fence

between the left hand pen and the centre p e n ^ ''1 This fence was about 6

feet high with spikes on the top.                   I sau/at the other side of the

fence people pressed very close to x \ /                   I struggled to help several

people over the fence some of t h e s ^ w e r e            injured and others appeared

to be just          'winded".     I can r E M M b e r   one white haired man who was

about 60-70 years old he looked very bad.                     It took some time to get

him over the fence and when we had I took him to one side,                     loosened

his clothing and sat him down.                 After taking some deep breaths he

appeared to come round slightly.                   I told him to keep sat down for a

while and he said he was feeling better.



Some of the fans were a great help but I can remember being spat at

and being verbally abused several                times.      I can also remember being

either kicked or thumped in the back on a couple of oc ca sio ns.                       After

helping several          people over I would say about          10 to 15 people I became

aware of a large pile of people about 4 to 5 feet deep at the other

side of the fence.              Quite a number of these were passed over the

fence by police officers and civilians.                     I can remember   checking

for the pulse on a few of them whilst we were carrying them.                       I was

aware of other police officers around me doing the same thing that I

was and helping people over and carrying them away.                      I tried to

administer mouth to mouth resuscitation onto some of them that we were

carrying away but it was awkward whilst trying to carry them as well.



Most of the injured and bodies that                 I helped carry were ta*:en to the

small gate that I had come through.                     I can remember aV-8fergeant who

was wearing a yellow anorak and was not from the South Yorkshire

                    Police,    he appeared to be handling a lot of the injured and the bodies

                    that we passed through the small gate,        I think he was taking them

                    onto the pitch somewhere        1 think I helped to remove around 10 or 12

                    bodies and when it appeared that they had all gone or were being

                    attended to I cama-v back out of the pitch,     I cannot describe very
Xiiofe
                    well any of tha^ bodies that    I was involved with,   but I think that

                    almost all a / them were male      Some of them being very heavily built

                    with ages    varying from around 16 years to around 50 years,

      .   When                had returned onto the pitch I began to generally help moving
T o ij}
                        le and trying to assist the doctors and ambulance men.         I cannot

                    remember much of what happened when I was back out on the pitch.
K/i'nrt

                    The next thing I can remember is going with the rest of our serial out

                    of the ground and walking up Penistone Road to a spot where the buses

                    were parked to take the fans back to the Midland Station.         Not many

                    people used these buses and we eventually went back into the ground

                    and to the North Stand where a de-brief was due to take place.



                    When I was in the area behind the turnstiles     I was aware of quite a

                    few youths either entering the ground with cans of alcohol       or smelling

                    of drink but due to the situation these were not ejected from the

                    ground.      I was not aware that any gate or doorway into the ground had

                    been opened until after the incident had finished.

           Today at Snighill             I was s h owri^vjprirgo and photographs by PC 1996

           WATSON of the West Midlands Police Force, although I recognised myself

           on the video and photographs.                  This material          did not show me dealing

           with and d e y c r ibed in my original,statement,                     From the film and a plan

           of the -yg^mnd, I worked in PeTr 2 carrying the injured or deceased from

           Pen 3 to the Gate             in pen 2 where they were taken by^^fn^one else

           onto the pitch.              I have looked at photographs of the c 1othing and

           photographs of the de ceasg^KT From this I feel that with regard to
           '                            /
           body no 3 Gary H A R R I ^ w the top he is wearing is very distinctive, and

           I feel he is one of the people I would have carri/o across.

           "he next body was No 21 Vincent Michael F ITZS^mMONS I am sure this is

           one of the bodi es I car r ied across pen 2 from the fence at Pen 3 where

           he was handed me,             both from clothes and his photograph.

         The next body was body Mo 61 C o C i ^ Andrew SEFTON I am sure I recognise

         this man by his shirt and the clothing his face is familiar although

         it does resemble that of no S i ’s.   I remember as well how^Heavy this

         man was that was why they strike me as more memorable,
                                                         h   H   o
         The last one I have seen is body No 69 Gerrard BABOON I remember

         distinctly an older very heavy man in the clothing,         which 1 now

         recognise he had grey/white hair and was very heavy.

         I cannot recall the order in whion I dealt with the above,         I have

         marked on a plan ref No DCT^K c he route I was taking inside pen no 2,

         after   I was passed tW-^people from pen 3.   This refers to all the

         fans above.

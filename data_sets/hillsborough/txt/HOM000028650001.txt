              1983 TESTING OF BARRIERS - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

             You will recall recently you asked me to obtain any data on the 1983
             testing of crush barriers.

             I have now received a response from Mr Graham Mackrell from the Club,
             which I think amounts to repetition of what we have already received.   I
             understand that Mr Mackrell was not supplied with the test data sheets.

             If you require this matter to be pursued any further please do not
             hesitate to contact me.

           Dear Mr Croker

           FA Cup S e a l " F i n a l <» L i v e r p o o l t H o tti a g h & i F o r e $ t

           I a t t e n d the above football watch on Saturday April 9th 1988, and write
           to protest in the strongest terms at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
           allowed to occur (in an all ticket match) in the Lappings Lane Terrace area
           (ticket counterfoil No.135 attached).

         The whole area was packed Solid to the point wh$re It was Impossible to
         ttOve and where X, and others around me, felt considerable concern for
         personal safety (as a result of the crush an umbrella I was holding in »y
         hand was snapped in half against the crush barrier in front of oe).     I
       . would emphasise that the concern over safety related to the sheer numbers
         admitted, and not to crowd behaviour which was good*

           My concern over safety was such (at tinea it? was impossible to breathe),
           that at Half time when there was r&ovement for toilets, refreshments etc* I
           flanged to extricate myself from the terrace, having taken the view that my
           personal safety was more important than watching the second half«

           This unfortunate overcrowding spoiled for a great many people what would
           and should have been a pleasant and enjoyable footballing occasion.

           It would therefore be helfpul if you could please let me know how euch
           overcrowding, with a direct impact on crowd safety* was allowed to happen.

           I would advise you that I have written in similar terms to the Minister of
           Sport*

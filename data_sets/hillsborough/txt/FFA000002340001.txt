                             Submission fVon Joe Ashton MP




 1       I have attended 25 Semi F in als a t Hillsborough and years ago th ere waS

no tro u b le because larg e numbers o f fans arriv ed by tr a in a t Wadsley

Bridge S ta tio n h a lf a mile away in good tim e.       On the day o f the d is a s te r

only 500 tra v e lle d th a t way.

2        I drove to the ground from my hone in S h effield a t noon fo r the o f f ic i a l

recep tio n and e a sily parked in the s tr e e t 100 yards away.       Yet even then

fans were standing o u tsid e pubs well away from the ground, drinking.

3     Many pubs a mile from Hillsborough and down side s tr e e ts erected larg*

impromptu signs saying "PUB GRUB" with arrows pointing o f f the main road.

4     On Sunday morning sev e ra l observers telephoned Radion S h effield with

s to r ie s o f excessive d rinking and these tapes and w itnesses should be

a v a ila b le .

5     I t i s c ru c ia l to r e a lis e th a t i f the same events had occurred on a

dark January night for a mid-week cup t i e i t would have been even worse,

as i t was for the overcrowding during the Luton v M illwall t i e in 1985

vivid-: re s u ltin g in Luton banning away supporters.

6     I f the proposed membership card had been in operation a t such a replay

fand th ere would have been one the following Wednesday had the game been A

t i e ) then the darkness would have made rescue v irtu a lly im possible.

7     I t i s well known among fo o tb a ll fans th a t i f they go w ithout a tic k e t

and g e t squeezed in to a tu r n s tile i t is p ra c tic a lly impossible for them

to be ejected back out o f the tunnel because o f the pressure o f the crush.

The tu r n s tile operator has no option but to allow then to c lia b over the

g ate.     Often a bribe i s o ffered too, and these exti*a sp e c ta to rs may not be
re g iste re d on the running t o ta l of the admissions computer in the control

c e n tre .
8     I f the proposed government membership card scheme was introduced and

an id e n tity card had to be pressed face down on a computer, or s lid through

i t then undoubtedly some id io t would s tic k chewing gum on the face o f i t and

render admissions inoperable causing fu rth e r delays, anger and chaos-

9     On several occasions I and other members o f the Commons Football

Committee have v is ite d the Home O ffice and previous M inisters o f Sport

to discuss these problems but have found i t extremely d i f f i c u l t to-convince

them and th e ir c iv il serv an ts, e sp e c ia lly , without being d is re s p e c tfu l,

Southern middle c la ss women c i v i l se rv a n ts,a s to the problan o f big grounds

lik e Hillsborough or Old Trafford having to l i t e r a l l y swallow 35-000 fans

in 35 minutes through 90 t u r n s tile s .     Many o f the ad viso rs, including m in isters,

have no personal experience o f the problems or dangers o f adding to the delay

a t a time when the crowd i s anxious and tra v e l weary and kick o f f time i s near.

10 The quickest sim plest so lu tio n to the problem: is to i n s i s t th a t a l l

big games where tic k e ts are in sh o rt supply should be played liv e on te le v isio n

p referab ly on Sunday afternoon where the t r a f f i c does not clash with shoppers.

This is one o f the reasons why thei^e i s l i t t l e trouble a t te le v ise d games

from Wembley.

11   Could I beg the enquiry not to rush in to the idea th a t a l l se a te r stadiums

a re an instance panacea.        Ten years ago in P aris the Leeds fans were a l l

seated and a f te r a disallow ed goal promptly smashed the p la s tic se a ts with

th e ir bow er boots and threw them as jagged m issiles in to the French cr«*d and
 12 At Coventry fans used to standing, simply in fu ria te d the r e s t o f the

 sp e c ta to rs by standing on the se a ts and fo rcin g everybody e lse to stand on

th e ir s too to see the game.      Eventually they were taken out.           In any case

Liverpool had 4.000 more se a ts than N o tts.F o rest did on the day.

 13 I n s ta llin g se a ts would not only reduce the ground capacity by h a lf i t

would make i t even more d i f f i c u l t to g e t tic k e ts , re s u ltin g in even more

fans tu rn in g up outside w ithout one and hoping to buy or s te a l one from a

tic k e t to u t.   This too could lead to tro u b le.

14 Because s e a t tic k e ts c o st two or th re e times as much as standing for a

big game the poorer fan, mainly young, is going to be priced out o f i t .                    The

advocates o f the much vaunted American stadiuns do not mention how these

are in v ariab ly f ille d with a fflu e n t middle c la ss fam ilies and not those who

liv e in the ghettos of the Bronx or Harlem.             I t does in fa c t cost $40 to

watch the New York G iants.        One of the reasons why our inner c itie s have a

much sm aller drug problem than the USA i s th a t fo o tb a ll is the "opiun of

the poor'" presenting a very cheap form o f a sp ira tio n s and release from a

menial l i f e .    Few of the supporters can affor'd to pay £20 for a tic k e t and

take th e ir children a l l the way to Wembley for every big game.

15 Stadiums do have to be re-designed but th ere w ill always be a t le a s t

5.000 young fans who p re fe r to stand and Junp about behind the goal.                 A

r e la tiv e ly small nunber lik e th is can be handled with polioe s i t t i n g in fVont

on the touch lin e aided by video cameras.          This was the p ra c tio e for generations

u n til the p itc h invasions ten years ago,which were caused not by violence,

but by id io ts try in g to stop the game when th e ir team was losin g.            The FA

put an immediate end to i t by awarding the match to the oth er sid e, but

by then some police forces in s is te d on perim eter fences.           These must, must,

now be taken down.
 16 The c u rre n t p ra c tio e o f allow ing each Chief Constable to persue

indiv idu al p o lic ie s on crowd contro l must cease-         I t i s a hotch potch o f ru le s

with some o f the 43 d if f e r e n t a u th o ritie s in s is tin g on morning k ic k -o ffs a t

Christmas (usually so th a t th e ir policemen can fin is h e a rly ) which c re ate s

even more o f a mad dash down the motorways with an e arly s t a r t in the

fro sty dark mornings. The Home O ffice must le g is la te on n a tio n a l safety

ru le s and procedures ra th e r than leave them to in d iv id u al forces and back

th is up by sp ec ia lised tra in in g a t Bramshill Police College.            Otherwise when

a big team lik e Liverpool is drawn away in the cup to a sem i*rural small

fourth d iv isio n team the local force have no experience whatsoever.

17 The cost o f a lte r in g our grounds w ill be enormous.             Clubs lik e S h e ffield

Wednesday have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on sa fe ty .                  So much

so th a t th is season th e ir own sp ec ta to rs demanded the re sig n atio n o f the

Board for not spending i t on player’s and only achieving modest playing

r e s u lts .     Fans say they pay to look a t a team not a ground.

18 That is why the theory th a t fo o tb a ll wastes money on tra n s fe r fees is

fa ls e .       Transfer fee money simply moves around from club to club lik e a

daisy chain and eventually re tu rn s.         Whereas money spent on the ground is

d i f f i c u l t to recoup unless the team does well and is a much more sp ecu lativ e

venture.

19 While tbeF ootball T rust does an e x c e lle n t job in helping clubs pay for

ground improvements, the government s t i l l takes U2 % o f the fo o tb a ll pools

income as a levy, plus 15% VAT from the gate and tra n s fe rs y et gives nothing

back to the game.

20    Undoubtedly big grounds lik e Hillsborough have a s t a f f with a wealth of

experience of big crowds,yet th is is not tru e of other clubs which ra re ly

stage a semi fin a l.       The Football League must s e t up crowd control tra in in g
courses too with a re le v an t pro ficien cy c e r t i f i c a t e ,o r q u a lific a tio n ,fo r an

executive member o f the club s t a f f on a l l grounds.             This should be a condition

of granting a sa fe ty lic e n c e .       Furthermore i t should be ille g a l for clubs

to discrim inate a g ain st away supporters by o ften lim itin g then to sub-standard

accomodation a t higher p ric e s than those charged to th e home crowd,because

th is often causes annoyance and f r ic tio n .




    I hope these recommendations are h e lp fu l.

               PC BUTLER,            WPC M A R S H A L L   <NESBIT).          Duty was      to supervise           Liverpool

               during       the m at ch to          remain on stan db y in the N S t a n d .                  A fter      match

               Fr om what           I can remember          of the match,           ever yt hi ng went         s m o ot h ly on the

               day,      supporters          from Liver pool           came     to the m a tc h      in good       spirit

               cannot       recall       any    s it u at i o n where      the gates were            o ve r cr o wd e d   neither

               did    I see any a tt empts          by L iverpool        s upporters     to enter   the g round by

               ■force through           the metal    gates       or   climbing   the walls.      The m a j or i ty of'

               the    crowd were well         beha ve d and there were           only      a small number

               What    did strike me         on the day was           the fact    that     alot of the

               s upporters who a rr i ve d very early w a n d e r e d a ro un d             for a while and

               because       of not knowing         the area w e l l , Publi c house wise,           they went

               into the ground early.

 SLOW TO REACT.

 REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK IN. THEY ACTED

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO      ADDWHICH YOU FEEL       IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. BETTER TREATMENT BY POLICE TOWARDS FANS.     IF    WE     ARE TREATED BETTER WE WOULD

 BEHAVE BETTER. GENERAL ATTITUDE.

 2. BETTER USE OF POLICE RESOURCES. A LARGE NUMBER OF OFFICERS AT TRAIN SIN ,

 NOT MANY IN GROUND.

3. MORE CLUB STEWARDS. THEY HAVE BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF GROUND.

 4 ^ T I C K E T ALLOCATION AND CHOICE OF GROUND SHOULD BE EXAMINED CLOSELY.

 5. RAILED OFF AREAS FOR QUEUING, SIMILAR TO ALTON TOWERS WOULD BE IDEAL.

6.     REVIEW OF EMERGENCY PROCEDURES,   I.E. CUTTERS TO CUT DOWN FENCES ETC.

Q17

 049

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE SUDDEN SURGE AND PEOPLE TRAPPED ON BARRIERS.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I WAS ONLY SEMI-CONSCIOUS AND CANNOT REMEMBER.

 051
                                                                                 QBl_ 732

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I LEFT BY AMBULANCE.


Q18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I ^ t N N O T REMEMBER. I WAS ONLY SEMI-CONSCIOUS.

 (354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU       FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I BELIEVE THE INCIDENT WAS DUE TO THE SUDDEN SURGE OF PEOPLE INTO THE

 GROUND WHEN THE OUTER GATE WAS OPENED, THE FENCES ON THE SIDE STOPPED THE

 CROWD FROM SPREADING OUT.     THERE   SEEMED TO BE NO POINT IN THEM    BEING THERE

 AS IT WAS SET ASIDE FOR THE SAME      FANS. THE   FENCE AT THE FRONT SHOULD   NOT HAVE

 BEEN THERE.

      fcRE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE CONTROLLING THE GROUND OUTSIDE,  THERE WERE

 NO SIGN POSTS TO THE SIDE TERRACING IF TbJERE WERE I WOULD HAVE GONE THERE.

 THE DESIGN OF THE LEPPINGS LN TERRACE IN PARTICULAR THE SIDE FENCING-            THE

 DESIGN OF THE TURNSTILES IS WRONG - THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH, AND THEY ARE ALL

 AT THE SAME PLACE FOR STANDS AND TERRACE.       THEY SHOULD BE SPREAD AROUND.

 Q50

 4 (1600) TO 4,30 PM (1630).

 Q51

        YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OS^fCER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 THE POLICE DID NOT HELP ENOU            ~H THE DEAD AND INJURED,   IT TOOK THEM TOO

 LONG TO REALISE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.         THEY WERE LINED UP ACROSS THE PITCH

 PERFORMING NO FUNCTION.         THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS DEAD AND

 INJURED BODIES WERE BEING CARRIED PAST THEM.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANY ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE GROUND NEED RE--Dfc.yj.GN.LNG,    THE PENS MU   BE REMOVED AND RE-DESIGNED.

 THERE SHOULD BE A GREATER NUMBER OF TU^STILES.          i ATTENDED THE CORRESPONDING

&IXTURE LAST YEAR.  WE HAD OUR TICKEffs CHECKED ON THE COACH PRIOR TO ARRIVAL.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE/STEWARDS TO          OPEN THE GATESTO THE

 FENCES AND ALL THE EXITS IN ORDER TO GET THE PEOPLE            OUT.

 THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO REACT TO THE SITUATION          THEY TRIED TO PUSH

 PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO GET OUT BACK IN.         WE   WERE SCREAMING FOR THE

 POLICE TO OPEN THE GATES, BUT THEY DIDN’T.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

£>ICIAL    INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO ALLOW PEOPLE TIME TO GET IN.

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE OUTSIDE AND

 INSIDE.   THERE WERE POLICE IN THE STANDS AND THEY APPEARED TO BE DOING

 NOTHING ONCE THE CRUSH STARTED THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH POLICE TO CONTROL THE

 CROWD. THE GATES AT THE FENCES WEREN’T BIG ENOUGH AND THE POLICE DIDN’T

 HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO CUT THE FENCES WHEN IT WAS NEEDED.

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED EARLIER ? THE POLICE MUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

 SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS THEY HAD CAMERAS MONITORING THE CROWD.           THE TERRACED

 AREA SHOULD NOT BE FENCED OFF INTO THE PENS.           THE TRAIN TOOK TOO LONG TO REACH

 ITS DESTINATION WHICH MEANT PEOPLE ARRIVING LATE AT THE GROUND AT THE SAME

 TIME.       THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO FANS TO NOTIFY WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING.       THE TURNSTILES WERE BADLY LAID OUT, THERE WEREN’T ENOUGH OF THEM.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONTROL OF THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES GETTING SUPPORTERS INTO THE GROUND WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE MATCH

 STARTING.    I SAW MASSES    OF PEOPLE MILLING AROUND OUTSIDE WHO EITHER SHOULD

 ^t/E BEEN DIRECTED INTO THE GROUND OR PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 MOVED AWAY.     ALSO THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME CONTROL OVER THE NUMBERS

 OF PEOPLE GOING DOWN THE TUNNEL INTO PENS THREE AND FOUR, ONCE IT WAS FULL,

 PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED AROUND TO THE SIDES.

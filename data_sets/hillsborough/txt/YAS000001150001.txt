HAME:          Qualified Ambulanceman

VEHICLE:       S208

SHIFT:         1400 - 2200 hours


DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:           19 April 1989 1225 - 1325, and



We had just dropped a patient off at the Northern General Hospital                               for
admission.       We heard on a radio inside the hospital that the match had been
stopped.       We returned to our vehicle and prepared to call but the air space
was     busy    with    details    being    given      to    another    vehicle,   regarding     the
Hillsborough       incident.       Once     the   radio      messages    were   passed    I   called
'Green'.        We were     instructed to go to the Hillsborough Football Ground,
Gymnasium Entrance on Penistone Road.


We proceeded 'Red'.          As we proceeded I heard the controller ask vehicles to
become 'Green' as soon as possible.                    A Police Officer directed us down to
Herries Road and when we got to the roundabout another Police Officer was
directing us down Leppings Lane.                  Although we were conscious of the fact
that we should be going to Penistone Road Gymnasium Entrance, he was very
insistent that we go to Leppings Lane.                      As the Officer was indicating to
Leppings Lane and as far as I am aware was saying "it's all down there" and
due to the fact that Penistone Road was severely congested, we carried on
to Leppings Lane.


As we arrived in Leppings Lane,                 I observed        two fire appliances and two
Ambulances parked.           I heard at some point Control state this was a Major
Incident       and we     should   tune    to   ERC.        We   tuned to   ERC and   experienced
problems from crackling on the radio.                  We assumed a position at the rear of
the line of Ambulances.             I got out of the vehicle and at this time was
still unaware of what the incident involved.


                                                                                         /continued

I went to speak to the other Ambulance staff present, who were Ambulanceman
_________ , Ambulanceman                    and   Ambulanceman               [     They were    all
working on      individual patients,          I tried to ascertain exactly what had
happened but they were unsure.             I then, although I had already seen bodies
on the floor near the Ambulances, started to check for signs of life.                              I
checked two male patients as indicated on my first journey plan and could
find no signs of life.              I told a Police Officer that in my opinion the
patients were dead.           At this time dozens of people were shouting, some for
help, others were saying, "Get something done" and I was able to cope with
the situation at this time.


I then saw three more bodies as indicated, I went and checked these out and
I could find no signs of life.               I again told Police Officers that these
patients were dead.            I ran back to my Ambulance, picked up the portable
radio   and    Portogen       and   told   Ambulanceman               that   it    was   a   serious
incident      and   I   was    going   further    in    to    check    on    the   situation     (as
indicated).         Ambulanceman            stayed     with    the vehicle.          I   then went
towards 'C' Gate and on approaching it, I recall at or near that location,
three bodies laying close to Gate 'C'.                 I again checked them out for signs
of life and found none.


I then moved        forward     towards    the West     Stand Tunnel         entrance which was
congested, I was grabbed by a Policewoman who said, "I've got one here who
is not breathing".            I saw two bodies near the entrance to the West Stand,
but went with the Police to a further body to the right of the entrance to
the West      Stand.     I found this body also had no signs of life, but the
Police Officer could not be informed as she had disappeared.




                                                                                         /continued

So at this stage I called Control about 3 times, but got no response, with
a view to requesting the attendance of a Senior Officer, whilst I was on
the radio I was heading towards the two bodies originally seen near the
tunnel but not checked.    I checked one and found no signs of life the other
one a male about 20 years,      cyanosed,   dilated pupils but with a carotid
pulse.    I instructed    two Police   Officers and   a civilian   to carry   this
patient down towards the Ambulances.     I was being jostled by anxious people
whom I tried to collate into one area.


People were wandering from the West Stand tunnel to 'C* gate in a dazed and
shocked condition.     I went towards and entered the West Stand tunnel,         I
honestly feared for my own safety and although I saw some bodies on the
floor of the tunnel I retreated because of the volume of people coming
towards m e .


I then returned towards the Ambulances.      This area was congested with many
agitated people.     I saw at least two people getting very aggressive towards
the uniformed staff there.     One person had to be physically removed by two
Police Officers.     As I approached my Ambulance, I could see at least two
bodies (as indicated).      There were also many shocked people sitting near
the Ambulances.      I then went over to my colleague who was attending to the
patient I had sent down from the tunnel area.         We removed a cot from our
vehicle and loaded him on.      The condition of our patient was critical and
we decided to move off immediately to hospital.


I attempted to contact Control via ERC, I am not sure if my message was
received but I asked if there was a designated hospital and after no reply
I switched to Channel 2.




                                                                       /continued

I explained reference lack of contact via ERC and asked which hospital I
was to go to and explained that my patient was in respiratory arrest and
that two vehicles had just left                for the Northern General with critical
cases on board so I felt         it necessary to go the the Royal Hallamshire.
Control agreed and said the Hallamshire would be informed.


I arrived at the Royal Hallamshire at 1540 hours, I said to a nurse "You
know we    have a major       incident    on” and        she replied "Yes,       we have been
informed”.      I   then    informed     the    Charge    Nurse   that    they   could   expect
appreciable numbers of dead and injured, I noted at this time they were not
prepared for a Major Incident.


We returned     to our vehicle and set off towards Hillsborough, we                      called
Control and informed them we were returning towards Hillsborough, we were
instructed to carry on.        I noted that we were now receiving ERC without any
problem.     We made our way back to the Penistone Road Gymnasium entrance.
Penistone Road was heavily congested with Service vehicles and we were met
by Mr Dale.     He explained what was happening in relation to vehicles moving
casualties and the nature of the incident and told us to stay where we were
on the main road.        We told him this was our second visit to the scene and
was he aware of the amount of casualties and bodies at Leppings Lane?                        He
replied "Have you seen the bodies round here" and pointed to the area of
the Gymnasium.        Mr Dale waved a vehicle out of the Gymnasium entrance and
directed us to reverse in which we did.


I got out of the vehicle with my attendant and went to the rear of our
vehicle.      I did not leave      the vehicle unattended.               I noticed something
happening at the rear of the vehicle that I had parked at the side of,
which was     three    or   four people        trying   to get    into that vehicle in an
aggiatated state.
                                                                                    /continued

    It was only at this time that I saw Mr Hopkins, he asked what was happening
    and I replied that I did not know what they were up to and pushed them out
    of the way to gain entry to the Ambulance and told them to go away and let
    us get on with our job.


    On opening the rear doors I saw two civilians attempting CPR on a male
    casualty.   I asked who they were and he replied "I'm a doctor and he is a
    first aider".   I told them to carry on.   It was at this time we realised we
    had a problem because the driver of this vehicle was missing.      It was then
    that Mr Morley said "transfer this patient to your vehicle".    Before we had
    a chance to move the casualty, the driver appeared and took the patient to
    hospital.


    Mr Hopkins came across and said stay with your vehicle, my attendant was
    administering to the walking wounded.      Someone then requested a stretcher
    for a patient that was on the pitch.    Mr Higgins appeared and requested our
    scoop stretcher.   A patient appeared from somewhere on one of our cots, so
    we took one of ours out and put him in.     As this patient was in a serious
    condition we loaded some walking wounded with him and proceeded to leave to
    the Northern General Hospital.


    Comments were passed by staff at the Northern General that they were full
    and would like casualties    to go to other hospitals.     We discharged our
    patients and returned towards the Football Ground.    We proceeded back
    towards the Leppings Lane end, from where we were re-directed by ACMAO
    Jones to the Penistone Road entrance.   We were about third in line on our
    arrival and waited until we had loaded our patients off the road, the
    patient was on a cot and accompanied by a doctor.    The doctor was satisfied
    that the patient was stable so we waited for further casualties.


                                                                        /continued

When none arrived after several minutes the doctor was concerned for the
patient so we proceeded to the Royal Hallamshire, we went via Leppings Lane
escorted by 2 motor cycle policeman.   I did notice that some scuffles were
taking place between individuals during our travel along Leppings Lane.
When we had discharged our patient we went to Infirmary Road to stand-by
and contacted Control who after a further half an hour, returned us to

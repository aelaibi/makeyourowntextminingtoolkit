FA/HILLSBOROUGH
I sDoke to            1 I was not in tomorrow^and I just
wanted to confirm Monday's meeting. She              £ould
would be fine. If there were any cancellations she woul
let        know tomorrow. Otherwise I would see her at 9.30
on Monday morning.
I said that we were not going to be going i^any <detailed
drafting on Monday but rather I wanted to discuss policy
with the FA. At the moment the FA had no             b®    ts
safety. Was it to set up a department
to moniter compliance with the recommendations lai«i d£*n by
Popplewell and Taylor? If so it ought to be aware inot only
of the extra expense of the administration but also that
liability for future accidents may well attacn.
If it was not to assume that role and I noticed the
difference in profile between Wembley matches and league and
cup matches, perhaps the FA could do little more than
translate Popplewell and Taylor's recommendations 11nto a
form that league clubs could understand and explain that as
it has set out in Phase 2 submissions it is not the body
charged with the responsibility of setting safety standards
and enforcing them and both Popplewell anJ
that was the case. The government also accepted that was
the case.
We had re-drafted Rule 24 to incorporate a reference to
crowd safety and had also looked at the memoranda on crowd
control.
It was important now to give the clubs a clear Policy and if
that meant differentiating between Wembley and other matches
we ought to say so now.
In addition it may be necessary to   call an EGM to amend
Rule 24.

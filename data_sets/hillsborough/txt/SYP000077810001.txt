               T here was a s teady flow of people towards                            the Ground,          all   in a good
                                                                                                         PAGE        2

 mood,      and     I was a p p r o a c h e d by a number          of t ee n ag e rs and older       people

* a nd the m ai n q uestions a s ke d were,                "Where's       the nearest       pub that's

 open",         and,    “W here's    the    nearest     toilet".

 Around         12.15    pm    (1215 h r s ) I was      told by Insp ec to r M I LL E T T to a t t e n d

 further along P e n i s t o n e Rd and posit io n o u rs el ve s at the first

 j u n c t i o n beyond the         roundabout w h i ch      I believe        is part of C l ay w h e e l s

 Ln.      This was        the j un ct i o n the L iv e rp o ol       coaches were         to take,       to park

 a l o n g C l a yw he el s Ln      itself.

 PC E D W A R D S and m yself were then m ak in g                  sure   that    the    coaches    took this

 junction.

 From     this     time the       number      of s u pp or te rs    on foot      grew steadily,          as    did

 the    number of         cars a nd vans        conta in in g      supporters.

 The general            demeanour     of the      crowd was good and fair ly well                  behaved.

 The yo un ge r         element were        s houting and        chanting?       there were a good

 number of         people wa lk in g        into the     road as the        crowds grew.           I saw

 large     numbers        of people who had o bv i o u s l y been drinking;                  their       faces

 were     flushed,        their eyes        somewhat     bleary,      large      numbers were       carrying

 2, 4 and even more               cans of beer        or lager.

 N um b e r s    s t e a d i l y grew until     I n ot ic ed the t rain a rrive            over    the bridge

 further         up the       road and about       f iftee n m i nu t e s   later       there was a large

 surge of supporters                who were e sc o rt e d by the M o u n t e d Branch.              Again,

 general         behaviour was        good but       large   numbers were          carrying       cans    of

 beer .

 The s u p po rt er s were on both sides                 of the dual        c ar ri a ge w ay down the

 central         r es er va ti on and on the         road,   sing in g and        chanting.        I was

 c o n t i n u a l l y a s ke d for the nearest          pubs a nd toilets and by now                it was

 a r o u n d 2.20       pm (1420 h r s ).

 All    the time         there were        people wa lk in g a g ai n s t     the flow of the m a i n

 body of supporters,                a sking    for spare tickets,           "Any spare,       mate".

 A r o u n d 2.4 0      pirn (1440 h r s ) , A /P S T H OM A S     came up to me a nd said that                 it

                                                                                                      S2207

s ounded as       if there was           fighting      in the Ground,        a cc o rd i ng   to the    radio

m e ssages.       He    remained w i th us on the              point a nd    I remember        seeing    the

last    coach go up P e n i s t o n e Rd a r o u n d 2 .45 pm            (1445 h r s ).       These

coaches were           now being       parked on the m ai n road near              to the      railway

bridge as C la yw h e e l s Ln was foil and had been for about                            15 minutes.

S h o r t l y after PS T HO MA S s a w          that    it s ou n de d on the      radio as      if the

fans were trying              to r i or down a gate at the G r o u n d .

At 3 pm       (15QQ h r s ) j/e left our          point w i t h other members             of our Serial

to   return to L e ppangs Ln,              as we had been briefed,              to await       our meal

break.

As we w a l k e d / b a c k we m i x e d w ith other           seri al s who were also          r eturning

to L e p p i n ^ Ln.          Once at the entra nc e           I saw other O ff i ce r s       including

me mb er s    of the M o u n t e d B r a n c h and a small          crowd of      people,      some of

w h o m were waving           their    tickets,     still      intent    on g et ting     in to see the

game.
                                                       /
l't was quite a p p a re nt           to me at t h i ^ stage that           some th in g had h a p p e ne d

inside the Ground,              although      I was    not a ware       e x ac t ly what.

The O ff ic e r s      present were        talfd to form a cordon,            w h i ch we did.         This

was across        the e ntrance          tjft the L e p p ings Ln e n tr an ce     to stop a nyone

At this       time an a mb u l a n c e arrived;          the    cord on part ed a nd a l l o w e d      it

I then saw someo/e              b eckon us towards w here            the a m b u l an c e was    now

parked,       w h i c h was    outside the       c o nc er ti na gates.        I saw at the          rear of

the a mb u l a n c e a male        body     laid on the floor a nd a P ol ic e O f fi ce r w it h

him,    and by his        colour he was          in a bad w a y or dead.             I walked        past the

ambulance        th ro ug h the       c o n ce rt i na gates a nd there        saw a large number             of

people,       a lot of w hom were            laid on the floor;           there were other            people

next    to the      people,       some    giving F irst Aid,         others     crying,       some

s ho ut ing    tor help.

I ran to the nearest              person on the floor who was a l r e a d y being t en de d

to by an ot he r male.            He had a pulse but had been sick a nd was of a

poor    colour and        in a bad way.              We   i m m ed i at e ly were       j oined by an

a m b u l a n c e man who had a r esusc it at or w h i c h he placed on the m an a nd we

then w it h others          carried the man to the a m b u l a n c e                   by the gates.            A fter

he was       placed     in the ambulance,             I r eturned back t hr o ug h the gate and

went    to the next         person      I found who was             just about          conscious.         I

placed him in the              r ecovery      posi ti on and a s k e d the two              lads    next to him

to keep an eye on him as                 1 t en de d to the next man who was                       dead;       there

was    no pulse at all a nd his                friend       cov ered him up.

The    next    part     is all a bit of a blurr                really,        picking       people up,

carrying       them to outside           the gates where             it a p p e a r e d other O ff i ce r s

were s e gr eg at in g     the    people       into d if fe re nt       groups,         dead,    badly

injured,       a nd those       that    could wait.           T here were a lot of               people        in

there who had been sick a nd all                      that    came up was             pure alcohol.           T here

were    people       crying,     s houting      in a nger a nd all            this      time    I still was

not aware       of what        had gone on.          But as the         comments made            to me went           on

like,    "Why did you open the gates?                        You bast ar ds are           r e sp on si bl e     for

this,    y o u ’re m ur d e r i n g    b astards " a nd the          like.       It became appa re nt

that    there    had been some           form of surge t h ro u g h the t u rn st il es a nd the

gates.        I was     told by some that             stewa rd s     had been          letting     people over

the    t urnstiles       for a price and that                lots of      people just s ur ge d            past

wi th ou t    having     their    ticket       taken from them.              One      of the     last     I h el pe d

carry out was a m an who had back a nd                        chest     injuries.

We then went a ro un d the              large numbers          of    people who were             still     in this

area,    checking        to see       if anyone was still             in need of m ed ical

attention,       and then as the              crowds were        d i sp e r s i n g    from the a re a

d i r e c t l y above    the    incident,       I was       one of a number             of O f fi ce rs

deployed       in a cordon,           directing       the    crowd a w a y from the             c on ce r ti n a

gates,       where    the a mb ul a n c e s    and    injured were,           towards       the other          gate

            ' I don't         know how    long    I was stood there           for,   but    it seemed    like

              forever as s u p po rt er s         left,    blaming    us for the        incident,     m ak in g

              remarks as m e n t i o n e d earlier and,             "I see y o u' v e      got the gates      shut

              now,     it's too     late",       but the m a j o r i t y of    remarks      passed were to the

              effect,         "I hope we don't        get the blame        for this        one as well".          Other

              remarks were made           in a similar         vein and some         comm en te d on the good job

              we'd    done and e nquiring about              the number        of dead and       injured.         Most

              people were         clearly upset and at that time                 need ed s om eone      to blame,

              and we were         the nearest        target.

              W h e n all     the fans    had     cleared the area we were              d ep lo ye d o ut side     the

              L e p p i ng s Ln e ntrance        for a short       time   before     being    stood down to the N

              Stand     to await     instructions.           This was s h o r t l y before 5 pm <1700 hrs).

              1 do     remember quite a surge of fans s h or t l y before S . 45 pm                      (1445 hrs);

              people      running    towards       the Ground,       cutting a c ro s s the dual         c a r ri a ge w ay

              and onto the         roundabout,        cutting across and t h ro u g h the vehicles,

              v i r t u a l l y halting   traffic,        and there were        still      people a sk in g for

              tickets         coming the o pposite way until              s h o r t l y before this.

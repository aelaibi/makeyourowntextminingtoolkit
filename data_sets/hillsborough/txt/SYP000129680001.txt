Dear
       Many thanks for your letter of 31 December regarding the

requested by the Working Party during its visit to the ground
in August 1984 and should therefore qualify for a grant including
our fees.

                 Structural Stabilit1

     We have pleasure in enclosin<
summary sheet submitted by Gleeson (Sheffield) Ltd. on
1 October, together with single copies of their daywork
records and an account from their specialist sub­
contractor V.A, Crookes (Contracts) Ltd., for the
repair and strengthening of the concrete columns exposed
during the recent alterations which have been carried
out at the back of     the South Stand.

     Also enclosed     are single copies   of our letters
dated 15 June, 19 June     and 5 July to   the Clubwhich give
the reasons behind     the necessity to carry out the
repairs.     A copy of our own account for professional
fees associated with the work is also enclosed.

     You will appreciate that because of the extensions
and improvements carried out at the west end of the
stand the opportunity was taken to repair and strengthen
the columns at the same time.   Probably only about 30% of
the columns in the whole stand have been attended to but
over say the next few years the remainder will have to be
inspected and any necessary repairs carried out.     The
beams and columns which are visible along the rear and
gable elevations are especially vulnerable and these are
llJkely to be repaired in the near future.

     If you have any queries or would like further
documentation John Strange will be pleased to help.



                                        Yours faithfully,

Dear       ^.
                         Ground Safety Work 1984
        Thank you for your letter of 19 September telling me of
the arrangements you hmre made with regard to the maintenance
work.
        With regard to the concrete beam over the tunnel exit
from the Kop, the situation is thafcit is not unsafe at the present
moment. If untreated it will become unsafe within a year or two
and would be likely to cost store to put right at that time.
        Because it is still safe it seemgS to me good sense to
postpone the work until you see whether the reroofing of the
Kop is to proceed.     Remedial work on the bridge can then be
done as part of the large contract.    It will almost certainly
be cheaper to do it along with a lot of other work rather than
as a small job.


                                 Yours sincerely,
                             Sheffield

Dear

Many thanks for your letter dated 13th September 1984.

I would confirm that I have summarised the schedule of work capable of
being undertaken by our maintenance staff and instructed them to proceed
forthwith accordingly, and inform me also of the dates each particular
section of the work is completed.Upon receipt of that    information I
will duly keep you informed of the schedule of work.

Certainly there was a lengthy discussion regarding the area of concrete
beam work over the tunnel exit at the north side of thespion kop and
it was emphasised by John that it would not be a financially sound
practice to undertake work which might well be incorporated in a large
scale development.  I have had several conversations since with the
Chairman who is adamant that the work to complete the kop will be
undertaken in the very near future. I can also confirm that we have
already made preliminary application to the Football League Ground
Improvements Trust who in principal have accepted an application from
Sheffield Wednesday for grant aid, all be it that this has not as yet
been confirmed in writing.

Under the circumstances therefore, I feel somewhat reluctant to spend
good money for remedial work but recognise only too well the importance
of the work and the danger associated in the event of a mishap.

 I would be obliged however, in the light of the above information, if you
 could correspond with me further and give me some indication as to your
 positive views.

Yours sincerely,




Seoretary

For the attention of Mr, R. Chester


Dear. I   L
                       Maintenance Work by Club Staff
              tfhank you for your letter   dated 20 August. Please
excusethe delay in replying.       John got out the list    almost
straight away, but I have been out of Sheffield for over a
week and it has been sitting on my desk.
              Enclosed is a copyof the list of remedial work sent
to the Club last September.       The items which we believe could
be successfully attended to by your ground staff are marked
with a red tick.      Some c £ the items have of course already been
completed.
              On each of the last three    or four visits by the Working
Party they have raised the question        of repairs to the edge ofthe
concrete beam over the tunnel e x i t at the North side of Spion
Kop (item 16 on our list, item Eii) in the minutes of the Working
Party meeting held on 9 August 1984).         We have resisted this on
the grounds that it could be done when the Kop is roofed over. It
may be that eventually you will want it doing as a separate item,
as it is safety work.      We obtained tenders at the end of last year
and at present the repair would cost about £450.
              Items 6a, 6b and 8a should preferably be carried out by
a firm specialising in the repair of reinforced concrete.
          These stalling columns are in the same category
as those which were found to be so badly decayed during the
recent now works in the South stand.        The factor of safety
of the columns is seriously impaired.        Because the concrete
itself is so variable in strength, there could conceivably
be danger of a collapse, and columns do not give much warning.
The longer work is delayed the more the work which will have
to be done.   I recommend the Board to have these spalled
columns, and the spalled beam repaired in not more than one
year from now.
          Also enclosed is a list of remedial work recommended
bo be done after the last visit by the Working Party.        All
except the repairs to the buckled raking supports on the
perimeter fence and the repairs to the spelling concrete at
the back of the South stand could be done by the ground staff.
          We have resisted carrying out an inspection of the
pylons for three years now.     X   will now have a look in the next
week or so.      Pressure for us to prepare check calculations
on the low free standing sections of the boundary wall on Penistone
Road started at the time the alterations were made last year.
If you would like us to do some calculations in confidence, we
will do so.   The calculations are likely to show that the wall
would be unsafe in a gale like that of 1962, if the wind were
blowing in the worst direction.        But you could be sure that there
would be no football under those conditions.        There could, of
course, be danger to people on the footpath outside the ground
and even to traffic,
          David Vaughan has also said there is ifftinri a need to
update the drawings which accompany the Safety Certificate,
will see to this if you so wish.

      The wire mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access desk had been
      test-loaded (as suggested at the meeting on 29th February* 1984), and had
      satisfactorily m e t .the Green Guide requirements.
            D.         North Stand

            It was noted that a metal water storage tank had been installed adjacent to the
            ramped access to the upper stand level.  It was also noted that a store area
            had been formed by timber screening under the stand between the outer edge of
            the walkaway and the Gymnasium building.

            "Stands" Club had been braced by metal supports.

            It was noted that the condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the
            roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop had continued to deteriorate, as had the
            dividing wall between the Spion Kop and the South Stand and the outer perimeter
            wall at the Penistone Road ead of the Stadium.

  4 .________ Toilet and Catering Facilities

 The Club gave an advance indication of the likely up-grading of toilet and
 catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the outcome
 of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust.  In the more
 immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serve food
 from the rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of from inside
 The area used would remain the same.  If structural alterations were required,
 the Club would also require building regulation approval from the City Council

(as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection) had not yet been carried                                            \
out.                                                                          rh

IT WAS AGREED that, pending the visual inspection of the lighting pylons,,,                                              .
corrosion of the base of the pylon at the rear of the West Stand and of the                                     Cvw»l /LoJ
adjoining fence posts and manhole cover, required attention.
     G.         Crush Barriers

     It was pointed out that the sets of tests carried out in June had completed
     the five year test cycle at the Stadium.  The cycle would re-commence next
     year.

     3.         General Safety Certificate

     The numerous alterations to the Stadium since the issue of the General Safety
     Certificate on 21st December, 1979, were recalled.

Ur   IT WAS AGREED that up-dated plans were required for incorporation into the
     General Safety Certificate in order to indicate the present facilities at the
     Stadium.

     _4._______ Toilet   and Catering Facilities

     The Club   gave an advance indication of the likely up-grading of toilet and
     catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the outcome
     of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust.     In the more
     immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serve food
     from the   rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of from inside
     The area   used would remain the same.   If structural alterations were required,
     the Club would also require building regulation approval from the City Council

For the attention of Hr. R. Chester


Dear
                        Barrier Testing 1984

       On 18 and 19 June,   crush   barriers 155, 156, 157, 158, 159,
160, 164, 165, 166, 167, 167A, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173,
174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180 (spans 3 and 4), 182, 183
(spans 1 and 2), 184 and 185, on the north west corner terrace,
were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the
Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.        The barriers are shown
on the attached print of our drawing 1610/64c.
       Barriers 161, 162, 163, 180 (spans 1 and 2), 181, 183
(spans 3 and 4) and 186 could not be tested because being        very
close to the bade of the terrace the testing rig would not fit
into the spaee available.      Because the distance behind these
barriers is so resitricted it is extremely unlilely that the few
people behind them will exert the full load suggested in the
'green* guide.
       In all cases tested the barriers sustained the test load.
       On 20 June the fencing along the internal edge of the
access walkway at the rear if the north west corner terrace was
tested.    Thirteen spans were tested and although the wire mesh
deformed by as much as 36mm during the load application,
recovery at the end of the final test was 100%.
     On 22 June the concrete parapet wall along the front of
the suspended section of terracing, in the north west corner
was tested.      During the load application, movement of the
wall was so small that readings using the measuring equipment
could not be taken.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing
the results of all the tests on the barriers and fencing.
We are pleased to report that none of the barriers needs
strengthening work.
     This set of tests now complete the five year test cycle
at the ground.


                                    Yours sincerely.

               Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                        Sheffield, on 29th February, 1984

PRESENT:     Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic

             Mr. R. Chester (Secretary)
             Dr. W. Eastwood (Eastwood & Partners)

             Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

             S. Allcock (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                          (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
             Ms. J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police)
             C. W. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
             M. Johnson (South Yorkshire. County Fire Service)
                          City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
             D . TT Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football League
grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate Officer Working Party.

The Club reported that the majority of the items listed as normal maintenance
items following the "summer" inspection had yet -to be carried out. This wa,s
due to a combination of the change in Club Secretary and certain development
proposals (outlined on a confidential basis) which the Club had in mind.
However, those which the Club's staff could undertake would be commenced shortly
and tenders had been invited and received for the urgent remaining larger
items (to be carried out commencing in May). The exception was the roof of the
tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the North Stand end) in view of its
possible inclusion in the development proposals outlined.

2.     Ground Inspection

A.         West. Stand and Terrace

It  was noted that the former ARP building adjacent to theboundary wall was
in   the process of demolition and the sitecleared and levelled. This would
have the additional benefit of improving the access/egress.

B.         North West Terrace

It was noted that whilst generally the sealing of the cracks beneath the Terrace
to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
seepage from one of the repairs.

The possible need for protection of the wire mesh on the inside of the upper
access deck was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That the Club would continue tomonitor the slight seepage of        water
from the repaired cracks under the Terrace.

(ii)   That the possible need forlateralb r a c f ' t h e w & r e
mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access deck be^i|iw^s|i^ated by a
test loading during the forthcoming close sea^pgi.
c.     Spion Kop

As previously indicated, the Club confirmed that the remedial work to the
existing access ramp and barrier rails required as the result of the
construction of the new refreshment and toilet^ together with the erection
of barriers to prevent access to the roofs of the new facilities, had been
carried out. .

The present condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the roof of
the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop was inspected.

The stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end of the ground
was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Building Authority and Mr. J. Strange of    Messrs. Eastwood &
Partners should discuss and inspect that part of the, perimeter fencing
erected at the northern end of the ramp to prevent access to the roofs of the
new facilities.

(ii)  That the Club would undertake continuous maintenance work on theroof
of the tunnel exit, pending a decision on any development proposals.

(iii) That the Building Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood should discuss and inspect
the stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end during the
forthcoming close season.

D.    Lighting Pylons

The Club undertook to carry out a visual inspection of the lighting pylons during
the forthcoming close season and to make more detailed inspections should this
prove to be necessary after the visual inspection.

E.    Emergency Lighting, Fire Alarm and Public Address   Systems Test

IT WAS AGREED - That the County Fire Service in conjunction with the South
Yorkshire Police and the Club'S staff, would carry out a test of these systems
at the evening match against Fulham to be held on 7th March.

             Is the matter worth pursuing and if so, what angle of attack
             should I use?

          Hi 1lsborough

          Dear Si rs

          We thank you fo r your l e t t e r of the 2 April 198*» with regard to the works
          we c arried out a t the back of the Spion Kop, but were surprised a t your
          request that we be l i a b l e fo r the charges made by Eastwood and Partners.

          The works o f supporting the Kop during the period o f construction was c e rta in ly
          carried out in a proper and workmanlike manner and we do not believe i t
          possible th a t a lleg ations o f negligence can be made against us. We had
          viewed your te s tin g o f the r a i ls as your normal safety procedure, and a t no
          time were we in discussion with you as to the need or l i a b i l i t y f o r such
          actions. Under these cirsumstances, we cannot be held l i a b l e and therefore,
          are unable to n o tify you o f our acceptance.

          Yours f a i t h f u l l y ___________________

             Dear        ,

             How much pressure are we really under to have the work completed
             as per your letter dated 30th January 1984?

             If we are, I would like to:stage the work when the account would
             become due for settlement mid-April. If we are not under pressure,
             perhaps this could be left in abeyance as there are really some
             quite major developments/improvements being currently discussed
             and, like before, I don't want to spend money unnecessarily.

             Yours sincerely




             R.H. Chester,
             Secretary.




                                                                                                               x.

standing            are a.        After           this       we    began          to w a l k     towards          the      t u n n e l to          get

into       the      standing            area,          we    waIked          half       way     down    tj^f^tunnel               and       s aw

put      again,          this w a s       at       t en      past       two.         As/we       came       out      of    the     tunnel

directly            in     front        of       us w a s      gate       B ay^arqeconcertina                        blue       gate            and    I

saw       t ha t    it     was    open abaut                 two     feaa,          t h e r e a p p e a r e d no a p p a r e n t

reason          for      this     and        the       omly       person          I saw       standing          there       was        a

Steward            who    wa s    situated              in    the       ga p      between        the w a ll          and     the       gate

it s el f .         At    this     stage           no-one           came       through          the    g at e     nor      w a s vt h e r e

many       peo pie         in s i d e    the       ground.                        and     I then made             ourySay          to       the

left       of      the    t u n nel      and       round          the     stand and             into    P e n Jtwo.             There           was

not       a great         d ea 1 on          people          standing             in p e n      two    w]jr€n we          got     there          you

could move               e as i ly .

This       was      about        half        past       two       and     I could          s^fe p e o p l e       climbing             over        the
fencinq           from     pen       three        into         pen     tw.gr and o t h e r s             being         lifted         from          both

pen     three        and       four       into       the       upffer     stand, I would                      say      that       this         was

because           people        were       being / q u a s h e d             rather           than       r u sh e d,                  and       I

stood        talking           and    l o o k y ng        to     our    left        to    see       if we        could          see       our       two

mates        in    the No^rth W ^ s t                Upper        Terrace.               It    came        up    to 3 o * c l o c k                 t h e?

player        came        out    onto          the    pitch.                    and       I were           standing             in    the

middle        of     pen two          close          to    the        front.         My a t t e n t i o n            w as    drawn         to       pen

three,        I could           see       alot       of    people        at     the       front          being         crushed            and

people        shouting           for       hel p .         I couldn't               concentrate                 on     the      game       at       all,

and     I began           to    see       people          climb        over     the       perimeter              fence          onto       the

p 11     .        Th e    next       thing        I know          the    games           being        stopped             also       t hi s     must

have     b e e n at a b o u t             six    minutes              past     t h r e e,      and       people           are     still

climbing           over        the    f ence and               then     helping           other          people           out,       I saw a

young        lad o f a b o u t            11    yrs       being        handed        o v er      the       fence          h e wa s

unconscious              and was           laid       on       the     pitchabout              ten       feet        away       from where

       and        I were        now       standing             close      to    the       fence          of     pen       two     and

a'ctual ly on             the w a ll ,          I could           have       got     out       to     help       but        I didn't            know

ahy     first        aid and          I thought                I *d j u s t     be       in the          way,        so     1 stayed            where

I jw a s , I s aw          somebody             giving           mouth       to m o u t h       to       the     young          lad,       I

think        it was        someone             f r o m St        Johns       Ambulance,               he      stayed         for      a    bit       and

then     gave        up,              |shouted at                him    "Don't           stop,        Don't          stop,        carry         on

going,        "the        St    Johns          man    ha d a n o t h e r        go a n d         he      brought            him      back       I

know     this       as     I sa w         the     lad      start        coughing,              then        he w a s         carried            off

towards           the     South S t a n d .               Th e    only       description                 of     hi m      that       I can

remember           was     that       lying          down        he    looked        about          5'     or 5 * 2 “ tall,                thin

build        and wearing              a Liverpool                 tracksuit.                  I also          saw a man              of a b o u t

35-40        Yrs     lyi ng      on       the     pitch wit h            his        j u n p e r pul 1 ed             up     over      his       face

J remember               watching          him       for       a while         to    see       if     his       stomach           moved         but

it     didn't.            I would          describe              his    as     about          5 ' 1 0 “ tall,             arev       hair

thinning           on     top,       he    had       a w el l         trimmed        beard and moustache.                                 He    was

                                                                                                                                       8525

    of    a stocky          build          and      was       wearing        a / j u m p e r , possibly            striped        and       I ’m

    not      s u r e if     he       h ad j e a n s       or    tr^fsers           on.     I believe             he    came      out    of

    pen      th re e ,          I also saw           4 n__j>«f'd     man     in    pen    three       passed         out   and        lifted

    out      o n to the         pitch near               us    he w as       sitting       up a g a i n s t        an a d v ertising

    hoarding             and after a bou t                five mi nut es            and    s o me     treatment            from       the    St

    Johns       Officers             he w a s       OK    and      j u st    sat    st i ll ,    on a s t oo l .

    During         the m a i n        h al f     hour         before        the    match       I saw      three        Policemen

    walking          along       the       f ront        of    the W e s t        Stand    seating          area and          I can

    remember          seeing          someone            around        the    pitch,       and      quite        a few      came       to

    help      get     the       injured          out      of    pe n    three       but    only after              they     realised

    something            wa s    wrong,          and      not      that      there       was    any      trouble.

    During         the     whole       day       I didn't            see     any    drunks       nor      di d     I see      any

    fighting          in s i d e      or    outside            the     ground.           I would         say     people       were      just

    in h i g h       spirit          its    generally              enjoying         themselves            aXci l o o k i n g      forward          to

    the     m a tc h .

    After      the       ground        had       been         cleared               bnd /       helped         the     Police         and

    S tewards         by    picking            up    scarves           and    t y i n g them        to    the      railing.            We

    'also     picked        up m o n e y ,          g l a s s ’s a w a t c / a n d         various          i tems      t h at    had

    this      we     gave       our    names \ m d             addrgfes       to a P o l i c e        O f f i ce r a n d      made      ou r

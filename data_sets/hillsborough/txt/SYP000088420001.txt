    we     left                    at about 9 am          (0900)       and t r avelled straight                to

    Sh ef fi el d with no stops                  or delays.          We ar r i ved      in Sheffield, at about

    1 i „45 am        (1145)                 parked     the    car    in a factory unit opposite                      South

    Y o rk s h i r e Police        Traffic,        HQ the man at the Police Stat i o n had the

    keys     to the factory unit and he                       let us     in.

    Having        parked the            car we all walked down to the S Hef f ie 1d P o 1 ice                          club

    for     lunch and a drink.                   There were Liverpool                and N o t t i n g h a m fans      in

    the     club,      but y f i e r e    were    no drankeness

    We     left, th, ^ club at about 2.2 0                pm    (1420)     and walked down to the

                                                                          met    two of my friends

                                                                           Police,         and                                I

    don't        know where        he     lives    I just       know him from College.                  They wers

    standing         by the shop next to                 the ground.

    As we all          reached the ground I s p lit up f r o m                   my      g i r 1 f r ie n d a n d h e i

    family and tried to get                      into    the ground wit h my friends.                     It was <            iut

    2.3 3    piii (1435)       as we       reached the ground.                 I knew which set of

    turnstiles          to use having             been there         before.         I was    not aware        of any

    signs        cii r e c 11 ng us      l-o Lnsss tur ns l-x 1 es «

    Wh i l s t walking          to the ground           1 saw no violence               disorder      or drunkeness

    an/received             no d i r ec t i o n or escort            from the Police.

    whe n we got to the ground there were                             no queues         it was j ust a mass               o-f

    people        trying      to get       in to the turnstiles.                 There was q ne officer                   on
\
    horsebac k         trying      to organise          the queues,        but he just            couldn't       do

    anything,          people were shouting at him                      and he was           shouting      back.          I

    saw one on foot              trying         to give directions             but again there was               nothing

    he     could do,        there were           just more and more             people       coming     in from

    fae h in d .

    It     was    quite     crushed        in    that   area,    so    much     so    that    people      were
l ifted out by P o li ce me n onto                    the turnstile wall and                   let    in that
_
way,        as     far as     I am aware         there was         no u n a u t h o r i s e d entry     to the

    r a u.n d ,

     entually          1 got through a turnstile at about 2.30                               pm    (1430)

    nd                 got    in at about, the safiie ^ iiiie ,                         w a s imine d ia t e 1y

behind me.              At some       time in the         crush outside                     had had his wallet

stolen together                wit h      his ticket.           A s h e ca rne t h r o u g h a Pol :i.c e0 f f i c e r

took         him to one        side       and was going          to eject        him for not having a

         k e t.    between                and myself we           convinced the officer                that    he had

              ticket.         A steward      came over ana gave                          a ticket       stub and

told him to get                in the ground and the Police Officer                               1et hirn go

                   3 of us then went             -cjs'twn the     t,unnel under         the West S tand

as       I was aware          Chat was      the only way onto                   s,he terracing and that wa^

the way            I had gone       last year.          1 did not see any signs                      directing         us

elsewhere,             but    in all       ho nesty     I wasn't looking for any.

t i e f o r & Qo i ng oown the             tunne 1 I did not see                 the gates     near    the

turnstil es            being opened.             On going         into     t h a ^ u n n e 1 I was     not aware            of

any Police Officers                   or stewards         g iv i nqjcli rections.              Walking      down the

tunnel            there w e r e    no problems         u n t i 3Vy o u came to the end,               you had to

push your way out onto                     the    terr^ing           as    it was alre a d y         crowded      in

there.             As we     reached the t e c i n g               we all went          left      into Pen 4 a nd we

tried         to stay at          the N j a c k W e     never m a n a g e d        to stay still         every         time

sep a r a t e d from us.              I    was    pushed forward until I carne to the                         first

barrier            back from the front              fence.         I was        crushed right         up against

that.

I have            indicated on the a t t a c h e d          plan,         the    path   I took through            the       pen,

             *‘as next       to me on the barrier                 the     pressure      from behind was

intense.              I felt or saw no surges                   it was just a steady                 constant

pressure and movement                     forward.
                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                  S32&S

       The     barrier was across my w a istline and                           I was    bent double       over    it.

       There was          a man on the           pitch      side of the         barrier     trying to help me and

       push ms back           but he     c o u l d n ’t     do much      with the       pressure.        This    kept up

       for about 5-10 minutes.                     At one       point     I felt       I was   passing     out.      I

       remember         the man shouting            "keep your head up."

       At    no time did JE^see any of the                      play on the        pitch so       its difficult          to

       re 1ate     to         es    that things       happen„

       T          |f across my middle was quite                         intense and       it began to cross my

       rn         at      I might     die,       I knew there were             so m a n y people        behind me and

           ^ j u s t couldn't       see a relief           to it.

      As     1 thought        this the        pressure suddenly s l ackened and                    I fell     to the

       floor a nd         quickly got         under       the bar.        On the other          side of the       bar

       there was          no pressure at all you                could just walk           round.        All   the
                                          /
       problems were all              t \ys other         side of the b a r r i e r .

       At that      time      I^as      not aware          of any other          people    injured or killed.                 I

      .and     I went      out onto the           pitch and sat on one of the hoardings                          to get

       I could see          people      lying      on the       pitch,        but as far as       I was    concerned

       they were          just     injured.        I decided to go round,y^o                   the N o r t h S t a n d   in

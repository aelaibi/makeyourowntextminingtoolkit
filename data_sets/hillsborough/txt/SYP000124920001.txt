    AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?                           —    ArjV/^   f

    1)         THE DEPLOYMENT OF POLICE OFFICERS WAS TOTALL^   I^jAFFECTIVE   AND SEEMED TO

    LACK AN OVERALL DIRECTION.

    2)         THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS NOT USED CORRECTLY,   THE USER SEEMED TO HAVE
 LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

 3)    THE FANS SEEMED TO TAKE THE INITATIVE TO ASSIST THE INJURED, RATHER THAN

 THE POLICE.    THE POLICE WHERE ALMOST SPECTATORS ON THE NORTH STAND SIDE AS

 FANS BROKE UP ADVERTISING BOARDS AND USED THEM AS MAKE DO STRETCHERS.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL JNGUIRY?

 1)    THE MOOD OF THE FANS WAS GOOD HUMOURED PRIOR TO THE G A M E , I WITNESSED NO

 DRUNKENNESS OR AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR AT ALL.

 2)    THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FILTER SYSTEM OPERATING AROUND THE GROUND

 ^ p P P I N G ANY FANS WHO H A D N ’T GOT TICKETS GETTING NEAR THE TURNSTILES.

 3)    THE LAYOUT OF THE GROUND,   ESPECIALLY THE LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES NEEDS

 TO BE CHANGED, THERE IS JUST NOT ENOUGH ROOM TO ACCOMMODATE THE AMOUNT OF

 FANS THAT USE THE THREE STANDS.      OM-^QHE BASIS THAT 807. OF FANS PASS THROUGH

 THE TURNSTILES IN THE LAST HOUR, EACH TURN^C^LE SERVICING THE TERRACED AREA

 WOULD HAVE TO HANDLE 14 FANS PER MINUTE, AND O n N^IE BASIS THAT LIVERPOOL HAD
                                                       C r r
 AN ALLOCATION OF 25,000 TICKETS - 807. OF 25,000 IS ^ , 0 0 0 USING THE TUi¥JSTILES

 IN THE LAST HOUR MEANS THAT EACH TURNSTILE HAS TO HANDL^JlS FANS PER MINUTE.

 4)    THE INFORMATION ON THE FAN, RETAINED PART, OF THIS TICKET IS INCOMPLETE,

 IT DOES NOT TELL YOU WHAT ENTRANCE TO USE,

 0     HAVING DECIDED TO USE HILLSBOROUGH AS THE V E N U E , I THINK THE POLICE DID

 THE RIGHT THING IN ALLOCATING THE RESPECTIVE ENDS TO EACH SET OF SUPPORTING

 FANS.

 6)    IN HINDSIGHT I WOULD BE CRITICAL OF THE SIZE OF THE PENS AND ALSO THE

 AMOUNT OF PENS.

 7)    THE F.A. SHOULD LOOK MORE CLOSELY     AT THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS,        FOR BIG

 GAMES.     EACH CLUB SHOULD BE CAREFULLY LOOKED AT AS TO ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR

 TICKETS.

 Q1S

 WHAT POLICE DIRECTIONS DID YOU WITNESS OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES?

 i\A~ , NOT AT 1/4 PAST TWO.        ( 1415)     I WASN'T GOING TO JOIN THE CROWDS

 AS I AM DISABLED,     SO I WALKED AROUND IN ORDER TO FIND OTHER TURNSTILES TO

 GET INTO THE NORTH STAND,       I WAS LET THROUGH A CORDON BY A POLICEMAN TO DO

 THIS, BUT AFTER WALKING TO THE NORTH STAND TURNSTILES,                   I FOUND THEM SHUT, SO

 HAD TO WALK BACK,     I WAS LET THROUGH THE CORDON AGAIN.

 WHAT WERE THE QUEUES LIKE AT YOUR ARRIVAL AT THE TURNSTILES?

 THE OUTER PERIMETER GATES WERE OPEN AND THERE WERE POLICE HORSES THERE.          THERE

 WERE NO ORDERLY QUEUES JUST A MASS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE     THE       TERRACE TURNSTILES.

 THE STAND TURNSTILES WERE QUITE CONGESTED BUT NOT AS     BAD       AS   THE TERRACE

 TURNSTILES.

G17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR                IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 1) YES I SAW THE GATE IN THE PERIMETER FENCE OF PEN 3 (LEADING ONTO PITCH)
          ■On to                                                                        page      8

 OPENED.         I SAW A M A N ’S HEAD AND SHOULDERS EMERGE OUT OF THE G A T E , I THEN SAW

 A POLICEMAN PUSH THIS MAN BACK          INTO THE TERRACES AND SLAM THE GATE SHUT.

 2) AS PEOPLE WERE ATTEMPTING TO CLIMB OVER THE PERIMETER FENCE POLICEMEN

 WERE PUSHING THEM BACK INTO THE TERRACES.

 3) GOING BACK TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE GROUND,           INEFFECTIVE POLICING,      I DIDN'T

 THINK THERE WERE SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF POLICE INSIDE THE PERIMETER GATES TO

 FORM     PEOPLE INTO ORDERLY QUEUES AT THE TURNSTILES.          THE ONLY POINT PEOPLE

 ENCOUNTERED POLICE WAS AT THE PERIMETER GATES, PEOPLE WERE JUST ARRIVING AT

 THE PERIMETER GATES IN ABSOLOUTE MASSES.

 4) ONE THING THAT I THINK DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATHS WAS A LARGE

       UNT OF POLICE WERE MARCHED ONTO THE GROUND AND WERE FORMED UP IN A LINE IN
m
 FRONT OF AND FACING THE NORTH STAND THEY JUST STOOD THERE IN LARGE NUMBERS

 WHILST OTHER OFFICERS WERE TACKLING THE DISASTER AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END,

 THERE WAS A SENIOR POLICEMAN WITH PIPS ON HIS SHOULDER WITH THE OFFICERS AND

 HE SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED THOSE MEN TO ASSIST THE DEAD AND DYING PEOPLE,                 AND

 WHEN PEOPLE TRIED TO APPROACH THE SENIOR POLICEMAN TO POINT OUT THE LARGE

 NUMBER OF INJURED PEOPLE WHO WERE UNATTENDED,           THEY WERE FORCIBLY R E M O V E D .

 Q50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT            DECLARING THE    GAME

 aA   ^ idoned   .
 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE            OFFICER, ASTEWARD,      A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.


G18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q33
                                                                                    PAGE     9
                                                                                    Q SL3104

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 Y E S , BECAUSE AT THIS TIME THE POLICE WERE STILL PUSHING PEOPLE BACK         INTO THE

 TERRACES,   ALSO THEY WERE FORCIBLY REMOVING PEOPLE FROM THE PITCH WHO WERE

 OBVIOUSLY INJURED AND IN NEED OF HELP.         AT THIS TIME I THINK THE POLICE

 WERE MORE INTERESTED IN CLEARING THE PITCH TO ENABLE THE GAME TO BE RESUMED

 THAN ASSESSING THE SITUATION AND HELPING THE INJURED.           ALSO NO ONE KNEW WHAT

 WAS HAPPENING,     THE P.A. SYSTEM AT THE 'GROUND WAS RUBBISH YOU C O U L D N ’T

 UNDERSTAND ANYTHING WHAT WAS BEING SAID WHEN THE SYSTEM WAS EVENTUALLY USED.

 HAD THIS BEEN USED IN THE CORRECT WAY MORE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE WOULD HAVE

 E^pN FORTHCOMING.      ALSO I AM SURE THAT THE FOREST FANS WOULD HAVE STOPPED

 TAUNTING IF THEY HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THE DESIGN OF THE PERIMETER FENCES AT THE GROUND ARE WRONG,             THE

 ONES AT ANFIELD ARE FAR B E T T E R .   ALSO I THINK THE POLICE WERE IN-EFFECTIVE.

 ALSO THE TEAM WITH THE LARGER FOLLOWING SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE END WITH

 BETTER ACCESS.      I D O N ’T THINK THE STEWARDS SHOULD BE OLD MEN, BUT YOUNGER

 MEN WHO ARE TRAINED.      ALSO THE NUMBER OF STRETCHERS THAT WERE AVAILABLE

 ( J B VERY POOR.    I THINK COMMUNICATION    (POLICE) WAS RUBBISH, YOU COULD SEE

 THAT THEY WERE STRUGGLING.       I THINK SPECIAL FACILITIES SHOULD BE MADE

 AVAILABLE FOR PARKING LIKE AT ANFIELD.         ALSO I CONSIDER A NEW STADIUM SUCH AS

 WEMBLEY SHOULD BE BUILT IN THE NORTH TO HOST MAJOR FIXTURES.            IF AN INCIDENT

 SUCH AS THIS HAD HAPPENED AT MILLWALL WITH THE DESIGN OF PERIMETER FENCE USED

 AT THAT GROUND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AND SERIOUS INJURIES WOULD HAVE BEEN

 INCREASED   (DUE TO IM PAI LI NG).   THE DESIGN OF PERIMETER FENCING AND ITS USE

 SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY STUDIED.

 YES,    I THOUGHT THE CROWD CONTROL WAS FAR INFERIOR TO THE SAME FIXTURE LAST

Y E A R , IN THAT WE WERE CHECKED FOR TICKETS^FRE)qUENTLY PRIOR TO ARRIVING AT THE

GROUND,    AND THAT PEOPLE ENTERED IN A MORE ( W e R L Y FASHION LAST YEAR DUE TO

THIS.

 NO,

 G53                 '   \

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS W s O B S E R V A T I O N S ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS S T O P P E D ^ .

 N®,    I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE Abl(ED FOR FIRST AIDERS TO COME FORWARD.              THEY
                                          \                       CAT
 DIDN'T KEEP THE CROWD INFORMED OF WN^J WAS HAPPENING.           THE POLICE,     AMBULANCE

 AND STEWARDS DIDN'T SEEM TO REACT GUICKfcyY ENOUGH TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

 G54     OC9

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE BASIC CAUSE WAS THE CROWD CRUSH OUTSIDE THE GROUND,             A DECISION WAS

 OBVIOUSLY MADE TO REDUCE THE CRUSH OUTSIDE BY OPENING THESE GATES.                IT WORKED

 FOR THE STAND I WAS IN BUT CAUSED A GREATER PROBLEM IN THE TERRACES

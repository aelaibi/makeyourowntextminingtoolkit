         Dear Mr eras ten,
                        Further to recent correspondence I would like to
         draw your attention to the inquest transcript, -of 13th Inarch P. SID
         C copy enclosed ) where the coroner states that the jury had on 2
         occasions asked about the video ovidsxice of the terraces.
         You will note the coroner remarks that there was ” actually next
         to nothing on the videos because , of course, not everything we#
         recorded ”,
         He goeB on to state that the footage froo 15.03. would be shown
         but It was of very poor quality. In his opinion it would not help
         the jury very much. As you ar© aware, footage from 15.02 was
         ahown to the jury on 15th Kerch ( pBO E ) this being the date
         when the coronar stated that the footage prior to this tine had
         gone missing.
         Furt&er to your suggestion that I obtain copies of tapes * YBI *
         and K TB2 " from South Yorkshire Polics. families have asked nun
         to ifvsk® a forioal requeet for the same through your office.
         F i n a l l y , I should he grateful if you would forward copies of the
         tt#i a t ®*hibite from the Taylor Inquiry and the< Inquest as
         previously discussed.

             Dear Mr.

             I understand that you or one o f your colleagues are reviewing the evidence in
             connection with the Hillsborough Disaster.

             During the conduct o f the Inquests I inter alia considered the statements by Police
             Inspector Harry White. In the light o f what I was told about Mr. White’s state of
             health I decided that it would not be right to ask him to give evidence at the Inquests.

             I do however seem to recall that there was a comment in a statement o f his which
             differs from the evidence o f Mr. Murray as to when the latter became aware that the
             gates to the tunnel were closed in 1988 . Mr. Murray said he learned about the tunnel
             being closed off in 1988 after the 1989 disaster while as I recollect it Mr. White
             indicated that he knew about this before.

            I think that it is in          s interest that your review is as full and comprehensive
            as possible which i: ,3 j ,, ■■= d\ avn the above to your attention. You may o f course
            be aware of it anyway. Either way it is a matter entirely for you to decide whether this
            i ipterial and wrhat reliance, weight and significance should be given to this.

            I      ;. would mention that -I do not have a copy o f the relevant statement by Mr.
            While . If you do not have this statement already I am sure you can obtain a copy
            from the Data Base. Please check the accuracy o f my recollection.

                          Response to Daily M irror report on Hillsborou{ 1

    Responding to a report injtoday’s Daily Mirror, about the Hillsboroug i tragedy, Assistant
    Chief Constable lan Dain^s said:

    “Reports about this particular video tape continue to add confifciion to an already
    complex set of circumstances. The Chief Constable has always said that any new
    evidence surrounding the disaster will be examined in detail. There is no new evidence
    in the article published in (the Daily Mirror today.

    “The tape in question - from a closed circuit television camera s owing the disaster
    unfold on the toppings (Lane terraces - has never been ‘missing and it was made
    available in full to both Ijord Justice Taylor's inquiry and to the a roner’s inquest. Its
    existence has never been in doubt.

    “The camera which took tfie pictures was indeed in working order, otfierwise there would
    have been no tape to subjnit as evidence.

"VVhat officers have previbusly explained is that the live transmissiot of the pictures into
the police control point atjthe time was of poor quality. This meant lat they had to rely
on the view from the polkje control room window and on information from officers on the
ground. It has always baen assumed that the interference on their screen was caused
by television equipment being used to transmit live coverage of th< FA cup semi-final,
which was not a factor when the equipment was tested earlier in the Jay.

    “As has been explained before, the confusion over ‘missing1 tapes seems to arise from
    the fact that two other tsjpes recorded at the ground on the day £ f the disaster were
    stolen overnight from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's recordi tg suite in a locked
    room in the stadium. One would have shown a disused area of t e complex and the
    other would have shown turnstiles. Neither tape would have b en relevant to the
    tragedy and tfie motive,fo|r the theft has never been established.

    “W e understand that enquiries are being conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service
    but have not yet been concluded.”

                                Response to Daily Mirror report on Hillsborouf i

     Responding to a report injtoday's Daily Mirror, about the Hillsboroug i tragedy, Assistant
     Chief Constable ian Dain$s said:

     ^Reports about this partjcular video tape continue to add confti                            5ion to an already
     complex set of circumstances. The Chief Constable has always                                said that any new
     evsd-anc© surrounding thej disaster will be examined in detail. There                       is no new evidence
     ;V1 i.he article published in (the Daiiy Mirror today.


     “The tape in question - from a closed circuit television camera      lowing the disaster
     unfold on -the-Loppings jLane terraces - has never been ‘missing and it was made
     available in fuii to both Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry and to the o roner's inquest. Its
     existence-has never, been ^ doubt.

    “The camera which took t^e pictures was indeed in working order, ot lerwise there would
    have      no tape io subpnii as evidence.

    “What officers have previously: explained is that the live transmissioi of the pictures into
    the police control poihf atjthe time was of poor quality. This meant jhat they had to rely
    on the view from the poii ' control room window and on information rom officers on the
    ground* it has always          assumed that the interference on their screen was caused
    by television equipment Seeing used to transmit live coverage of ih | FA cup semi-final
    which was not a factor wfyen the equipment was tested earlier in the Say.

     ■AS has been Explained before, the confusion over missing" tapes ;eems to arise from
    th© fact that two other tsjpes recorded at the ground on the day £f the disaster were
    stolen overnight from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's recordi ig suite in a locked
    room in'the stadium, Qrie would have shown a disused area of t e complex and the
    other would have shown turnstiles. Neither tape would have bfe n relevant to the
    tragedy and the motive fcjr the theft has never been established.

    “W e understand that enquiries are being conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service
    but h a i.: ::ot yet been concluded.”

 Responding to a report in today s Daily Mirror, about the Hiilsborc ugh tragedy, police
 spokeswoman!                  Isa- d;

  Reports about this particular video tape continue to add confifsion to an aireaay
 complGx set of circumstances.

   The tape in question »»the one showing the disaster unfold on the Lappings Lane
 i©! races - has never beeiji 'missing' and it was made available in full to both Lord Justice
  I syior's tnqury and to th^ inquest.

  The camera which took jhe pictures was indeed in working order, o herwise there wouk
 nave been no tape to submit as evidence.

  :'hf> Daily Minor has npt ‘found’ a !hidden’ video. Several nem spapers reporiea ;• t
  ?“.uary mat the force hejd sent a copy of the tape to the Home Sec stary.

  W hat officers have previously explained is that the live transmissic 1 of the pictures into
 the police control point $t the time was subject to severe interferer ce. This meant that
 they had to rely on the view from their window and on information from officers on the
 ground, it has always bjeen assumed that the interference on thei screen was caused
 by television equipment rbeing used to transmit iive coverage of tf e FA cup semi-final,
 which was not a factor wfien the equipment was tested earlier in the day.

 “As has been explained!before, the confusion over 'missing5 tapes seems io arise from
 the fact that two of the tapes of activity at the ground on the day of the disaster were
 stolen overnight from a locked room in the stadium. One would h ive shown a disused
 area of the complex ancj the other would have shown turnstiles. 1 is not thought either
 tape would have been relevant to the tragedy and the motive foj the theft has never
 been established.

 C.I D PLANS DEPT.
At 10.00 am on Friday 7 March 1997, Superintendent Foster and PC Greenway of
South Yorkshire Police visited Sue McDougall and Matthew Pyne at the Home
Office.


The Doctor Ed Walker file was handed to them.


Discussion


Basically, the same as his newspaper statement, except for timings and Lee Nicol,
but they could accept with the passage of time versions alter/become distorted, due
to be asked different questions by interviewer.    Inaccurate as to not having been
seen or contacted by police.


Alive after 3.15 pm - discussed expert evidence of Professor Usher, Doctors Slater
and Gumpert.


Sue mentioned that even Doctor Popper had admitted since that 3.15 pm cut off
time wrong - explained why after calculation this time picked.


Discussed the security of the videos by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, the
duties of PC Guest and Roger Houldsworth, what he, Houldsworth, could see - On
programme views shown were BBC material, not South Yorkshire Police


West Midlands Police


Why should ex head of West Midlands Police SCS, Superintendent Beachey be put
in charge of Enquiry - Sinister overtones in view of their record.   Advised West
Midlands Police invited and Police Complaints Authority approved appointment of IO
and they supervised the investigation so there was that independent element to the
investigation progress.    Choice of staffing would be West Midlands Police's
responsibility.


Video material shown was of poor quality - copies of copies? Was this done on
purpose to prevent their being used.


TB2 shown and with assistance of plan of ground advised her of views and to which
cameras they related to.
PC Bichard had lied to the Inquiry/Inquest insomuch as to what could be seen on
the videos.


What part, if any, of the South Yorkshire Police CCTV material was in fact
incorporated in the compilation tape.


Points


1.   Any reason why TB1 and TB2 could not be disclosed to families - Deferred as
     decision would have to come from Chief Superintendent Lowe.


2.   Have families ever had meeting with South Yorkshire Police to discuss case -
     no, except in 91 when Mr Devonside and 5 others came to South Yorkshire
     Police HQ to view photographic albums.


3.   Looked out of police room window could have seen look of anguish on fans'
     faces - CSU Duckenfield admitted his mind on other matters at time, did not
     see.


4.   Faces not picked out of the crowd, she said good view from pictures at 2.18 pm
     TB2 - response as 3 above.


5.   Why were families trying to have the verdict overthrown and new verdict
     possibly with lack of care added - perhaps to have a second chance of having
     criminal proceedings taken against CSU Duckenfield - South Yorkshire Police
     already admitted liability, together with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
     engineers.


6.   Did PC Guest give evidence? - Would check.


7.   Why did police officers on track not see distress - were subject to complaints
     procedure.


The points raised by the families, on their own, were not sufficient, but when
combined together may present persuasive element as far as families concerned to
cause enquiry to be re-opened.
Sue agreed that judicial inquiry had already denied families right to have inquests
re-opened.


Trevor Hicks, Philip Hammond, Ann Adlington had visited her on Thursday 6.3.97.
Sue stated they did not give the appearance of being vindictive, no malice and
seemed sincere. She seemed possibly swayed by their behaviour, warmed to them
- Sympathy for cause but on basis of evidence - nowhere to go.


Families believed that guilty parties had escaped by being medically retired.


Sue has been asked for update note for Michael Howard on yesterday's meeting
with families.

  General Hospital.



  On the afternoon of Saturday April 15th, I was off duty. I returned home from walking the dog at

  around 3.00 pm. I turned on the television to see crowd disturbance at the Hillsborough Football

  Ground. The match appeared to have been abandoned, and the television coverage ceased. I

  listened briefly to a local radio station, who were also reporting a disturbance at the ground.



  As I am familiar with the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, I decided to make my way there

  in case I could be of assistance in the event of casualties being received.



  Due to the location of my house, I almost immediately encountered an ambulance, which I

  assume was on its way to the ground. It had its lights & siren on, and I followed immediately

  behind it, with my headlights on.

  As it passed the Herries Rd. entrance, I turned off into the Northern General Hospital.



  I entered the Accident & Emergency Department to be told that a Paediatric "cardiac arrest" was

  expected (via Ambulance Control), and that there was an incident of some kind at the

  Hillsborough stadium. No-one in the department was aware that these two pieces of information

  were related.



  The first casualty arrived within two or three minutes. I believe this patient to be a boy I know

  only as "Lee", who




  Whilst I and another doctor were treating Lee, the second victim arrived. He was of similar age

  (around 12 - 1 4 years), with blond hair.




                                                                                      and I believe he

  has since died.



 These two boys had taken up the space immediately available in the resuscitation area, and the

  next patient I dealt with was in the A & E Department Theatre.

 This patient was aged around twenty, with fair hair, of slim build.

                                                                        and left him in the care of

 another doctor.



  I next saw another unconscious,                              with shoulder-length brown hair, and

 aged around twenty.       I judged his airway to be adequate, and left him in the care of a non­

 medical member of staff.



 The next patient I dealt with was                                 He was aged around twenty, of

 stocky build, with ginger hair.

                                                   I was assisted by a doctor of around my own age

 from the football ground. I never discovered his name.




  I next saw a patient of around forty, with thinning hair and of heavy build.        He was having

 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation from another doctor.



  I then was asked to see a boy of around fifteen with black hair, who had already had resuscitative

 treatment.

                                                                                                   I

  believe he has since made a good recovery.

                                                     on a boy of similar age with light brown hair.

                                      I do not know what has happened to this boy.



 I was then briefly involved with a male of around thirty in the resuscitation room. He had already

 had considerable effort put into his resuscitation,

                                                              I believe resuscitative measures on this

 patient were abandoned.



 I then went to Ward 60, and




 This, I believe, covers the bulk of the work I did on the day of the disaster.



 I left the Northern General hospital at around 9.00 p.m.

         resuscitation attempts.were not taken any further.

resuscitation.                      There is definite post mortem evidence of intensive resuscitation
attempts.
99.          PHILIP STEELE
             There is no evidence in the medical record nor any evidence from the post
             mortem findings that Mr. Steele received any resuscitation,                                                                                 I think it
             likely that he was triaged                                   as dead.


119.         ARTHUR H0RR0CKS.......................................
             There is no evidence in the medical record of any resuscitation attempts
             and there is no evidence in the post mortem findings of any resuscitation
             attempts.                 I therefore think it likely that Mr. Horrocks was triaged as
             dead.


In summary, there is definite evidence both from the hospital records and post
mortem reports that six patients received resuscitation attempts.                                                                                     In a further
three patients there us some evidence that the patients may have received some
resuscitation attempts.                                   In four patients there is no evidence of resuscitation
and it is likely that these patients were triaged to the mortuary on arrival
at the Accident and Emergency Department.


I feel it may be helpful to give a brief summary of our experience of traumatic
asphyxia.                 Traumatic asphyxia is a fairly uncommon condition, normally occurring
in sporadic cases, either in car accidents, or heavy injury.                                                                               There are a
number of well documented instances where large numbers of people have died
in crowds as a result of traumatic asphyxia.                                                          Such events are fortunately
rare.                The Northern General Hospital Accident and Emergency Department
admitted .. fifteen cases of severe traumatic asphyxia within a space of one
hour on the 15th April. and .this.is.in. addition.to.the. patients,m?otjpned. .above.


No patient admitted in a state of cardiac arrest has survived.

Dear Mr Wells

On Tuesday 10 December I held a meeting with colleagues in the Parliamentary
Labour Party representing constituencies in Sheffield and Merseyside, to discuss calls
for a reopening of the inquest, or a separate new inquiry, which have been made
following the screening last week of the Granada programme about the Hillsborough
disaster.

Richard Cabom told me that you were making your own inquiries into some of the
allegations about missing evidence which were made in the programme. I should be
very grateful for more details about this - particularly in relation to the video tape
which some allege was not available at the inquest.

For your information I enclose a copy of a letter which I have written to the producer
of the programme. I have copied this letter to all Labour colleagues with Sheffield or
Merseyside constituencies.

 Yours sincerely

Dear Ian

On Tuesday 10 December I held a meeting with colleagues in the Parliamentary
Labour Party representing constituencies in Sheffield and Merseyside, to discuss calls
for a reopening of the inquest, or a separate new inquiry, which have been made
following the screening of your programme last week about the Hillsborough disaster.

As a result of my meeting I am now writing to you to ask if you would be good
enough to specify any new evidence which was not available either to the inquest or to
the Taylor inquiry.

1 should also be grateful if you could clarify the allegation which has been made about
a missing video tape. Is it alleged that this “missing video” was, in whole or part, not
available to the inquest or to the inquiry?

I shall look forward to hearing from you. I have copied this letter to all Labour
colleagues with Sheffield or Merseyside constituencies.

Dear M e r v y n ,

Just a note to thank you and your colleagues for giving me the time
on the 9th May and showing me all the tremendous amount of work
which is being done at Nechels.

I was very impressed indeed and am very much obliged for the great
effort which you are putting into this inquiry.

I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking you for lunch
and for arranging transport for me, it was very much appreciated.



Youihs sincerely.

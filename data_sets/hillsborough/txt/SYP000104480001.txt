                                  SERVING AT DONCASTER IN CAPACITY OF


                                            GYPSY LIAISON OFFICER



I    am    a     Police    Officer        with   21   years    service     in    the   West   Riding,   West

Yorkshire         and     South    Yorkshire      Police      Forces.      During      my   service   I have

performed duty at Hillsborough on approximately 20 occasions.                                 Half of these

occasions would be F.A. Cup semi-finals.



On Saturday 15th April 1989 I paraded on duty at Doncaster at 08.45 hours and

was       conveyed to the Hillsborough Football Ground by coach.                              At 10.00am we

were       briefed      and I      then    took up my duties            as driver      of   a Freight Rover

personnel carrier containing serial number '44'.                           The serial was commanded by

Inspector Wardle and made up of Sergeant Hughes from Sheffield, myself and

nine other Police Constables from Doncaster Division.



Our       duty    consisted of stopping PSV's, mini buses and vans on the A616 at

Oughtibridge and searching them for alcohol.                             My personal duty during this

time was the manning of the VHF radio in the van.                               During this time Officers

in the serial confiscated a considerable amount of alcohol, mainly cans of

beer from several vehicles.



Prior to kick off time at 3pm the serial left Oughtibridge travelling along

    the A616      towards the ground with the intention of making our way to Clay

    Wheels Lane for meal break.                  During the course of the journey we were twice
                                                                                            Qjxi 2
PC 1484 Collins                                                                           Contd/.... 2




directed    by     radio       message        to   fights   taking    place   in    the   vicinity   of

Middlewood Road, Hillsborough Park.                  On both occasions the matters were dealt

with   by   other       serials      before    our   arrival.    We     then made     our   way   along

Penistone Road North and into Claywheels Lane for a meal.



A   short   time       after   3 .00pm      just   as we Were about       to dine,    a message was

received directing all ranks to Leppings Lane.                       I drove my van containing the

whole of my serial and other Officers immediately from CLaywheels Lane to the

Leppings      Lane      entrance      of    Hillsborough     Football     Ground,    completing      the

journey in a matter of minutes.



On arrival at the Ground we began to push our way through a dense crowd of

people to get towards the ground to give assistance.                       As we got to the ground

and were about to begin assisting in what was obviously a major incident, I

was sent back to my van and told to stand by in case transport was needed.                             I

returned to my van and sat in the cab.



The crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrance was the biggest I had ever seen,

and I have never seen a football crowd containing so many obvious drunks.

After a short while people who were obviously distressed began leaving the

ground and I noticed that people outside were approaching them for tickets.

From the condition and reactions of the prople who were leaving the ground,

it became obvious to me that something very serious had occurred inside.                              As

time   went      on    a lot    of    the    crowd became     very    angry   and belligerent,       but

someone had walked down to the Police Officer who was outside, I think it was

a Sergeant,           and said that whatever was said to us, we were to ignore it and

do nothing.           I was called "MURDERING BASTARD" on several occasions, one drunk
                                                                                     S j9 0 2 f
PC 1484 COLLINS                                                                Contd/--- 3




stood in front of my van and shouted several               times    "IT'S ALL THE BIZZIES

FAULT".   Another drunk ran up to the van, banged on the side and shouted "YOU

CAN'T BLAME US THIS TIME."         Several wanted to fight but were dragged away by

other fans.    Many of the more voiciferous and aggressive ones were obviously

the worse for drink and on a normal day would have got themselves arrested

for their conduct.



I saw that other Officers were working extremely hard to get fans out of the

road so that the Ambulances         could get through,       many of them wouldn't move

until physically pushed out of the road and a patrol car with PA patrolled up

and down Leppings      Lane   constantly appealing        to fans   to clear the way for

Ambulances    with   little   success.     The     fans    blocking   the   access   of   the

Ambulances were      obviously well    the worse    for drink and as such failed to

comprehend that a major tragedy had occurred, their main concern how to get

into the ground at any cost.



I remained    with my    vehicle    in leppings    Lane    until    after 6pm when    I was

rejoined by ther rest of my serial and we returned to Claywheels Lane and

from there to Doncaster.

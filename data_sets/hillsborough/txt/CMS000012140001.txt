HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL


1.     We need to press ahead with the early payment of the
Government's £ ^ - m contribution to the Hillsborough disaster
appeal fund.   Details of the fund, which is a joint one between
the City Councils of Nottingham,       Sheffield and Liverpool,
Nottingham County Council and Liverpool Football Club, and its
trustees, are enclosed.

2.    The Treasury's view is that it would be right for DOE to
account for the donation on one of its Votes.      As a precedent
they point to the Bradford fire disaster in which we, rather than
the Home Office, took formal responsibility for the payment. DOE
does not have a suitable vote subhead for this kind of
expenditure and Treasury has invited us to apply for an advance
from the Contingencies Fund in order to make the payment, the
position   being  subsequently   regularised  by  our   taking  a
supplementary estimate against a newly created subhead.     There
can be no question of the Department having to make offsetting
PES savings, and we will need to secure specific Treasury
agreement to access to the Reserve. Finance colleagues have this
in hand and we are checking, based on the Bradford experience,
any other arrangements we may need to put in place.

3.    I would be grateful for confirmation that the Minister is
content for us to make the payment - we are aiming at Monday 24
April - on this basis.

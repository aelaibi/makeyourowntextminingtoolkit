Maximum Capacities for Terraces
  7. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the S afety Certificate
should specify th e maximum number o f spectators to be adm itted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed ‘"’self-contained” notw ithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording a ccess to
another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

  8. Each figure for m aximum capacity should be a sse ssed in accordance with Chapter 16 o f the Green Guide
(“th e Green G uide figure”) subject to the follow ing qualifications:-

     (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide (when the terrace
         or viewing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;


                                                           76
    (b) the m inimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope m aterially
        deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
        packed) should be 0 not 27;

    (c)   in arriving at “the Green G uide figure”, proper and realistic allowance m ust be made for all factors
          w hich should reduce the perm issible density including th o se specified in paragraphs 220 to 2 24
          inclusive o f the Green Guide.

  9. A rrangem ents should be m ade:-

    (a) to lim it the number o f spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the m axim um capacity
        figure a ssessed in accordance with Recom m endation 8 above either electronically, m echanically, by a
        tick etin g arrangem ent, by counting or otherw ise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its m axim um capacity is about to be reached.

  10. T h e m axim um notional rate at w hich spectators can p ass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 7 50 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 o f the G reen G uide. T h e m aximum rate for any particular
turnstile m ust take full account o f all circum stances including th o se given a s exam ples in paragraph 47.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
  11. T h ere should be a written statem ent o f intent, agreed between the club and the p olice, settin g out their
respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling o f each self-contained pen or
other standing area and the monitoring o f spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. A ny
variation o f the document in respect o f an individual m atch should be agreed in writing in advance.

  12. (a) A t each m atch, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is m onitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
m onitoring it) w hose so le duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. W hoever is so appointed sh ould be in addition to any
other steward or police presence. H e should have ready a ccess to a police officer w ho can authorise access
through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.

      (b)       T h is R ecom m endation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where th e
spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular m atch do not exceed o n e third o f the area’s
m axim um perm itted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.


Gangways
  13. G angw ays should be kept clear, in accordance with paragraphs 97 to 99 o f th e G reen G u id e. Gangways
should be painted in a conspicuous colour whether they are su nk or not. T h e Safety C ertificate should require
that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they b ep ain ted .


Fences and Gates
   14. A ll sp ikes or sim ilar constructions on perimeter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.

  15. P erim eter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 m etres, m easured from the top o f the fence to the low est
point at w hich spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations form ing part o f th e perimeter
boundary.

  16. A ll police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those w ith
duties under Recom m endation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition o f
crowd d en sities, to the recognition o f signs o f distress and to crowd dynam ics. Training should include
dem onstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to en ab le stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd d en sities.

   17. T h ere m ust be provided in any perimeter fence o f a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates o f a
m inim um width o f 1.1 m etres to enable that pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the tim e prescribed for
an em ergency evacuation o f that pen or area.


                                                          77
   18. All gates in radial or perim eter fences o f pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest o f the fence and marked “Em ergency E xit”.

   19. W here there is a perim eter fence in front o f a pen or enclosure, all gates to th e pitch should be kept fully
open during th e period w hen spectators are in th e pen or enclosure, wherever th o se in command feel that th is
can safely b e done. W h eth er they be fully open, partially open or closed, they should be* kept unlocked
throughout th e period w hen the pen or enclosure is occupied.

   20. E ach ga te in a perim eter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or enclosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer when the pen or enclosure is occupied. W hether su ch m anning should be by a
p olice officer or by a stew ard should be decided by the P olice Commander. In either event, the Police
C om m ander should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to the
pitch im m ediately in the event o f an emergency.

  21. S uitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by th e club at each ground where there are
perim eter fen ces to perm it th e im m ediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers o f spectators if
necessary. A greem ent sh ould be reached as to whether th e equipm ent should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. W hoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision of a
nom inated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
   22. A ll cru sh barriers sh ould be visually inspected each year for sign s o f corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a sign ificant degree o f corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23 . T he layout o f barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed im m ediately (if th is h a s not
already been done follow ing the Interim Report) to ensure that it com plies w ith the criteria contained in
C hapter 9 o f t h e Green G uide. If it does not, the assessm en t o f the m aximum capacity figure for that pen or
terraced area, in accordance w ith Recomm endation 8 above, should reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
   24. T he Secretary o f S ta te should exercise his powers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) o f the Safety
o f Sports G rounds A ct 1 9 7 5 so as to m ake mandatory in S afety C ertificates th o se conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) o f th e 1975 A ct. S o far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “sh a ll” should be
substituted for “ m ay”.

   25 . In a sse ssin g th ese m andatory requirements in the C ertificate for a particular ground, the local authority
sh ou ld follow th e Green G u id e criteria. O nce that is done, the resultant figures and terms for that ground
sh ou ld be specified in th e S afety C ertificate and no variation from them should be permitted other than by
form al revision.

   26. W here a local authority incorporates any provision o f the Green Guide into th e Safety Certificate, other
th an one w ithin the scope o f Recomm endation 25 above, it should m ake clear w hether that provision is to be
com plied w ith absolutely or with discretionary flexibility.

    2 7 . There sh ould be an im m ediate review o f each S afety C ertificate (if this h as not already been done
 follow ing the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority, w hich should con su lt the club in respect o f
 w h ich the C ertificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the am bulance service and the building authority.
 S u c h a review should include an inspection o f the stadium . Its object should be to ensure that the operative
 conditions o f the C ertificate are com plied with and to add or substitute any condition show n to be necessary as a
 m atter of urgency following th e findings and Recom m endations in this Report.

    28. Any local authority w ithin w hose area there ex ists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
 w hich no Safety C ertificate h as yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy th e situation.

    2 9 . Every S afety C ertificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
 C ertificate should require to be renewed annually.

   30. Each local authority should review its arrangem ents for issuing, m onitoring, enforcing, reviewing,

Report). S uch review should require that there ex ists or is provided an accountable adm inistrative structure
whereby th e functions o f the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by sen ior officers and
elected m em bers and d ecision s are properly taken in accordance with th e local authority’s rules.

   31. To a ssist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) con sistin g of appropriate members o f its own staff, representatives o f th e police, o f the fire
and am bulance services and o f th e building authority. T he Advisory Group should consult representatives o f the
club and o f a recognised supporters' organisation on a regular basis. T h e Advisory Group’s term s o f reference
should encom pass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to th e ground and
attendance at m atches. T h e Advisory Group should have a chairm an from the local authority-, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.


Duties of Each Football Club
  32. E ach turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate o f flow m easured (if this has not already been
done follow ing the Interim Report). Thereafter, regular in spections should be made to ensure that each turnstile

in su b m ittin g its R eport, w hich has been agreed by all m em b ers. D etailed supplem entary notes dealing w ith
certain o f the technical features will be available fo r your use in due course.

We n o te th a t the G uide is n o t confined to football gro u n ds a n d stadia b u t includes guidance on all sports
grounds, a n d we have bo rn e this in m in d in o u r con sid eratio ns. A lthough not w ithin o ur term s o f reference,

                              R E P O R T O F T H E T E C H N IC A L W O R K IN G PARTY

T h e G reen Guide
    1. T h e Technical W orking Party recognises the valuable c o n trib u tio n s o f successive editions o f the G u id e
to Safety a t Sports G ro u n ds, com m only known as th e G reen G uide. Its scope a n d status are described in its
in tro d u c tio n as follows: “T his booklet provides guidance to ground m anagem ent, local a u th o rities a n d
technical specialists such as engineers on m easures for im proving spectator safety at existing sports grounds.
It is a vo lu n tary guide a n d has no legal force” .

   2. In view o f the variability o f existing sports grounds in fu n ctio n an d in scale, there are serious difficulties
in establishing com prehensive an d general regulations, back ed by legal force, to cover all the com plex d etails
o f design an d construction. A dherence to the stan dard s set by Building Regulations should provide a
m easu re o f uniform ity in respect o f new work a t sports grounds. Nevertheless, the Technical W orking Party is
strongly o f the opinion th a t a m uch higher degree o f sta n d a rd isa tio n th a n presently prevails should be sought
in practice.

   3. It considers th a t a revised issue o f th e G reen G u id e sh o uld form the basis on w hich a designated ground
o r s ta n d is certified by the certifying authority, a n d reco m m en d s th at any departures from its guidance on
technical provisions th a t m ay arise from local circum stances sh o u ld be fully defined a n d should be subject to
approval in w riting by the certifying authority.

A C entre of Expertise
   4. T h e G reen G uide covers a w ide range o f m aterial, m u c h o f which concerns the physical characteristics
o f grounds. Its successive issues have been published in respo n se to a n u m ber o f serious accidents at football
g rounds. T his process has led to increm ental ad v an ces in th e G u id e as experience has grown, but th e
T echnical W orking Party does n o t believe th a t such a process, although essential, is by itself sufficient to co p e
w ith present-day requirem ents.

    5. M any British football grounds were first c o n stru c te d a long tim e ago, an d im provem ents have b een
 in tro d u c e d largely on an in d iv id u afb asis. A central body o f knowledge applicable to the com plex design o f


                                                            89
such grounds has been conspicuously absent although a start has now been m ad e. As a result, progress has
b een piecem eal.

   6. T he Technical W orking Party considers th a t th is is a serious defect. A c o n tin u o u s an d ex panding body
o f public knowledge, draw n from th e relevant professional fields, is required to provide a basis for good
ind iv id u al designs a t m o d e m standards. At a tim e w hen substantial im provem ents are u n d e r consideration,
including a h ig h er p ro p o rtio n o f seafed-accom m odation, it is im perative to establish a n d to dissem inate
rigorous sta n d a rd s o f design if expectations are to be fulfilled. T he w ork o f o rganisations in o th e r countries,
including th e C o m itato O lim pico N azionale Italiano (C O N I), can provide a valuable reference. T he
Technical W orking P arty recognises, too, the im p o rta n t w ork u ndertaken in this country by th e Sports
C ouncil. Its recen t guide to the planning, design a n d m anag em en t o f in d o o r are n a s is a notew orthy attem p t
to draw together a considerable body o f research a n d practical experience. Similarly, o th er work on o u td o o r
stad ia has tak en place a n d is currently proceeding u n d e r the C ouncil’s aegis. It is im p o rta n t th a t resulting
p ublications sh ou ld be w idely dissem inated a n d th a t any guidance on o u td o o r stadia should m ake particular
reference to th e structural aspects o f safety, com fort an d crowd control.

   7. T he Technical W orking Party therefore reco m m end s th e form ation o f a central body, u n d e r a title such
as th e A dvisory Council for Sports G rounds, to provide an a u th oritativ e source o f knowledge for all those
involved in th e design a n d construction o f o u td o o r stadia. A detailed specification o f its structure an d
fu n ding is n o t p ro p osed at this stage but, as envisaged, its m em bers would be draw n from the relevant
professional fields a n d w ould com m ission specialist advice w hen necessary. It w ould be in d ep en d en t o f any
Inspectorate. T h e relationship o f such a body to o th e r organisations is a m a tte r for fu rth er discussion, but it
is suggested th a t the Football Association an d th e Sports Council m ight wish to play leading roles.

S eatin g and S tan din g
   8. T he T echnical W orking Party notes th a t FIFA has agreed regulations on seating for certain classes o f
football m atches, a n d th a t the regulations are to be im posed w ithin a short tim e-scale. It also recognises th at
th e British tra d itio n o f standing on terraces ru n s co u n ter to these international requirem ents.

   9. It is clear th a t if B ritish clubs are to co n tin u e w ith in the international com m unity, they will be obliged
to close their stan d in g acco m m o datio n for m atches th a t fall w ithin the FIFA definition. For o th er m atches,
th e Technical W orking P arty recognises that, w hilst standing acco m m o d ation is n o t intrinsically unsafe, the
benefits to sp ectato r com fo rt an d crow d control b ro ug h t about by all-seater stadia are likely to accelerate the
m ove tow ards such venues. T he Technical W orking Party accepts, however, th a t although the in trod u ctio n o f
all-seater sta d ia for leading, w ell-supported football clubs m ay be b oth beneficial a n d practical, clubs in the
low er divisions m ay fin d it less so an d the rem oval o f all standing a c c o m m o d a tio n a t these grounds may
affect their viability. A lterations to seating from standing arrangem ents a t existing grounds m ay have both
design an d co st im plications through the im pact on such m atters as spectator sight-lines an d crow d density.

   10. In ad d itio n , it m u st be recognised th a t th ere are m any sports (horse, greyhound, m o to r racing and car
rallying for exam ple) w here the nature o f the sport favours the m obility o f large sections o f the crowd an d
w here viewing from standing areas is an essential elem ent. Any reco m m en d atio n s tow ards all-seater stadia
m u s t therefore be carefully worded.

C apacities
    11. T he Technical W orking Party recognises th a t the safe allowable capacity o f any viewing area, w hether
seated o r standing, is the least o f (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the n u m b e r o f persons w ho can leave through a
n o rm a l exit system w ithin a prescribed tim e a t the en d o f an event, (iii) the n u m b e r o f persons w ho can leave
th ro u g h an em ergency exit system w ithin a prescribed tim e, an d (iv) the n u m b e r o f persons who can be
a d m itte d through the turnstiles serving th at area w ithin one hour.

    12. The theoretical holding capacity o f a seated viewing area is sim ply the n u m b e r o f seats in good
co n d itio n w hich com ply w ith the relevant G reen G u id e reco m m en d atio n s including those relating to
d istan ce from exits an d gangways a n d size an d spacing. D eterm in atio n o f the holding capacity o f a viewing
terrace o r slope is n o t so simple; factors th at m u st be taken into account include the strength a n d spacing o f
th e crush-barriers, the position o f gangways, the dim ension s an d physical state o f the steps, the effective
stan d in g area, a n d the acceptable packing density.

    13. A packing density o f 5.4/m 2 is recom m ended in the current G reen G u id e as the m ax im u m allowable
 figure for terraces an d viewing slopes th a t m eet all the specified guidelines. A reduced figure o f 2 .7/m 2 is


                                                             90
presently re co m m en d ed for areas deviating m aterially from the guidelines. The Technical W orking Party sees
no p o in t in retaining reference to the lower figure an d recom m ends th a t there should be no lower lim it to the
reduction; ie if the enclosure had such poor safety stan d ard s th at it was totally u n fit as a viewing area the
figure should be zero.

   14. As to th e m a x im u m figures, the Technical W orking Party concludes th a t a uniform ly distributed
d en sity o f 5 .4 /m 2 should be safe in static conditions where th e terraces are in full co m pliance w ith the G reen
G u id e. It recognises, however, th a t there will be variations o f density w ithin a given enclosure, an d allowance
should be m ad e to acco m m o date th is factor in th e final determ ination.

    15. T h e Technical W orking Party recom m ends th at the m ax im u m allowable average packing density
d e te rm in e d by the In q u iry should establish a general reference for certifying au th o rities. For an individual
ground, the packing density applicable-to a given standing area should be derived from this figure, the full
figure for areas in good co n d ition a n d reduced figures for areas in p o o rer condition. D etailed calculations o f
h olding capacities should then be determ ined o n the basis o f the agreed packing density for that specific
enclosure o r o th e r relevant factors. These calculations should take into acco un t specific features o f the
crush-barriers a n d fences a n d o f step dim ensions as illustrated in the G reen G u id e. T he Technical W orking
P arty reco m m end s a thorough review o f the exam ples currently co n tain ed in C h a p te r 16 o f th e G reen G uide,
a n d th e inclusion o f ap p ro p riate diagram s.

Structural E lem ents
   16. It is a fu n d a m e n ta l requirem ent o f safety th a t structures at grounds should provide spectators with
safe acco m m o d a tio n a n d safe m eans o f ingress an d egress. They should also en ab le police a n d stew ards to
exert p ro p er control over crowd m ovem ents. If a conflict should occur between these objectives, a substantial
re-arrangem ent m ay be required; in no circum stances should safety sta n d a rd s be com prom ised. The
Technical W orking Party recom m ends th at references to sub-divisions in C h a p te r 14 o f the G reen G u id e be
review ed w ith these considerations in m ind, an d th a t the C h ap ter as a w hole should reflect these principles
m ore positively.

Separation o f V iew ing A reas and Pitch
   17. T h e Technical W orking Party recognises the im p o rtan ce o f physical b arriers as deterrents to pitch
invasions. It also recognises th a t n o t all viewing areas present th e sam e risk, a n d recom m ends th a t
co n sid eratio n be given to differentiating those areas requiring higher levels o f security fro m o th e r areas, such
as seated acc o m m o d a tio n an d m em b ers’ enclosures, w here a lesser degree o f security m ig h t b e acceptable.

    18. T h e general principle o f separation endorsed by th e Technical W orking Party is th a t the m eans
a d o p te d should provide sufficient security against pitch incursions to enable th e police to take tim ely an d
effective action should such incidents occur. Clearly a balance has to be struck betw een crow d control and
safety.

     19. A configuration recom m ended for w id er consideration consists o f a p e rim e te r barrier o n the
 pitch-side backed by a parallel a n d continuous crush-barrier on the terrace-side, set b ack from the perim eter
 b a rrie r so as to provide a clear walk-way between the two; except in em ergencies, spectators would n o t be
 allow ed to en ter th e walk-way. Such an arrangem ent w ould reduce the risks associated with a com m on feature
 o f B ritish grounds, n am ely th a t th e front steps o f terraces a re substantially lower th a n th e level o f the pitch:
 im m e d ia te a tte n tio n should be given to the elim ination o f this hazard.

    20. T h e Technical W orking Party recom m ends that the m axim um height o f perim eter fences should be
 d e te rm in e d in relatio n to the UEFA stan d ard o f 2.2m . It also recom m ends th e removal o f overhanging
 sections a n d spiked o r barbed-w ire attachm ents at the tops offences.

    21. A form o f separation increasingly ad o p ted in new stadia is the dry m oat. To be effective, a dry m oat
 m u st .be sufficiently w ide an d deep, an d should be protected by fences on both sides to ensure th a t spectators
 a n d players d o n o t fall in to it. W here enough space is available, a m oat m ay offer a n attractive solution, but
 its ap p licatio n to older grounds is likely to be restricted by lim itations o f space.

 E m ergency A ccess to Pitch
       22. T h e Technical W orking Party recom m ends th at emergency access to th e pitch should be provided
- f r o m all ad jacen t view ing areas. It considers th e provision o f gates or gaps in any form al b a rrie r to be in all
  cases advantageous for the evacuation o f ad jacen t enclosures and essential except where adequate, safe


                                                              91
   alternative arran g em en ts exist. W here fences, b arriers o r m oats are installed th e m ajority view o f the
   Technical W orking Party is th a t th ere should be clear gangways leading to emergency exits on to th e pitch.
   Such gangways m u st be properly identified an d kep t clear a t all tim es. T he exit gates or gaps should be at least
   1.1 m etres w ide o r as w ide as the gangways feeding into th em , w hichever is the larger an d should be sufficient
   in dim en sio ns a n d spacing to allow evacuation o f th e enclosure w ithin a prescribed tim e. T h e W orking Party
   recorded a m in o rity view th at the need to police gangways exacerbated friction on terraces, an d th a t
   gangways w ere n o t always essential for proper crow d control a n d safety.

    C rush Barriers
      23. A review o f the procedures for inspection a n d testing o f barriers is recom m ended. T he Technical
    W orking P arty considers th a t greater em phasis should be given to thorough recorded an d certified annual
    visual inspections o f all crush barriers. P articular a tte n tio n should be given to the developm ent o f corrosion.

      24. It is fu rth e r recom m ended th a t 25% o f barriers, evenly spaced through each enclosure as designated by
    a com petent engineer, continue to be tested each year. In ad d itio n , all barriers which the inspection has
    identified as o f possibly sub-standard condition should also be tested.

       25. T h e a d o p te d test m ethod should be capable o f applying to b a rrie r rail, post a n d foundation anchorage,
    a loading eq uivalent to a uniform ly d istrib u ted lo ad 1.20 x th e design load o f the barrier as a t present.

       26. T h e test procedure should be revised in line w ith cu rrent practice for structural testing to incorporate
    (i) a detailed visual inspection o f the barrier, (ii) a bedding-in cycle taken to a percentage o f the design loading
    a n d (iii) a single cycle o f p ro o f testing taken as a t presen t to 1.20 x th e design loading. D eflections a t all
    significant po in ts should be recorded.

       27. After th e full p ro o f load has been held for a m in im u m o f five m inutes the deflections should be
    recorded p rio r to release o f loading a n d the p e rm a n e n t residual u nload ed deflections recorded after th e load
    h a s been released.

       28. T he Technical W orking P arty reco m m en d s the ad o p tio n o f tw o criteria for acceptable structural
    perform ance (i) th a t no significant defects, including corrosion, are revealed by inspection a n d (ii) th a t the
    percentage recovery o f deflections afte r release o f th e lo ad during proof-testing achieves acceptable values.
    T h e specific values required will d e p e n d on the m aterials o f construction.

     29. T he Technical W orking Party recom m en d s th a t th e distinction currently draw n in the G reen G uide
CK betw een “p eak ” a n d “non-peak“ view ing areas for th e purpose o f assessing barrier spacing should be
   abolished. All areas should comply w ith the peak view ing specifications.

    S tan d s
        30. A substantial part o f C hapter 10 o f the G re e n G u id e, ‘R oofed Stands w ith Seated A ccom m odation’,
    deals with tem po rary structures. It is reco m m en d ed th a t th is m aterial should be placed in a separate C hapter,
    a n d th at it should give explicit references as req uired to B ritish Stand ards a n d to applicable regulations.

       31. T he rem ainder, which m ight be called ‘C overed Standing a n d Seated A ccom m odation’, should clarify
    th e special requirem ents for safety th a t are involved, n otin g th a t fire risk is n o t th e only hazard an d th a t
    statu to ry control o f the requirem ents m ay be vested in different authorities. A ppropriate references to
    B uilding R egulations should be m ade. It is im p o rta n t to ensure th a t all spectators can be cleared into safe
    pro tected escape routes w ithin prescribed tim es, although such routes need not be exits from the stand as a
    w hole.

    In gress/E gress
        32. T he current C hapters on Ingress and Egress in th e G reen G u id e (Chapters 5 and 6) contain m uch
    useful inform ation, but are nonetheless in need o f som e revision. C onsideration was given by the Technical
    W orking Party to the possible am algam ation o f features com m on to b oth ingress an d egress, b u t despite the
    c o m m o n ground it is recognised th at em phases m ight well differ. T he W orking Party does not therefore
    reco m m en d am algam ation o f the individual C hapters.

     In gress
        33. T he Technical W orking Party felt that C h ap ter 5 needed expansion to incorporate additional clauses
     o n (a) the positive counting and recording o f th o se passing through each turnstile; (b) the location of


                                                                92
am en ities inside th e ground to avoid obstru ctin g o r d isru p tin g the flow between turnstile a n d enclosures: (c)
th e sub-division o f enclosures: (d) the a d eq u acy o f well d istrib u ted entrances into large enclosures to
facilitate even packing; an d (e) the design o f e n tran ces so as to avoid local pressure on spectators caused, for
exam ple, by dow nw ard ramps. Inform ative d iag ram s should be ad o p ted and general principles laid dow n,
w herever possible. T he Technical W orking P arty w ould no t favour the introduction of num erical exam ples
w hich m ight, in any event, be difficult to establish. It views the current m ax im um notional flow ra te p er
turn stile o f 750 persons per hour (as set out in p aragraph 47 G reen G uide) as too high, a n d recom m ends a
figure of 500 as the m edian for a no rm al turnstile. F u rth e rm o re , it recom m ends th at variatio ns up o r dow n
be approved by the certifying authority, subject to a m a x im u m upper lim it o f 660 persons p er hour.

E gress
  34. G reater cross-referencing with o th er C h ap ters is required, a n d the Technical W orking Party favours
expansion o r am en d m en t o f a n u m b e r o f paragraphs. In particular, the density figure set out in paragraph 54
in respect o f reservoir areas is felt to be too high, a n d the m em bers o f the Technical W orking P a rty
reco m m en d that, where reservoir areas c a n n o t be rem oved from egress routes, a lower d ensity o f 35-40
persons per 10 sq m etres be substituted. T h e T echnical W orking Party favours greater em phasis o n
netw orking, and believes that the G reen G u id e should in clu d e a stipulation that each ground produce proper,
netw orked plans, delineating all aspects o f ingress/egress.

E nclosures/Turnstiles
   35. T h e Technical Working Party strongly rec o m m e n d s th at there should be a direct one-to-one
relation sh ip between banks o f turnstiles an d enclosures in order to m a in tain accurate co un ts o f entries. A.
review o f the current state o f League grounds h a d show n th at sub-divisions such as h a d occurred a t
H illsborough were uncom m on, an d h ad generally been in itiated by police for crowd control. W here such
sub-divisions d o exist, it is im perative th at the total n u m b e r of spectators entering each sub-division sh o u ld
be c o u n te d separately.

Stairw ays and Ramps
   36. T h e Technical W orking Party notes the dangers presen ted by stairways a n d ram ps, particularly th o se
used by the public in large num bers, an d reco m m end s extensive redrafting o f the G reen G u id e to present
m o re sharply the hazards involved. It recognises th a t the sta n d a rd s o f safety required for stairways an d ram p s
w hich form p art o f th e access between enclosures a n d a n exit a n d those w hich exist as gangways w ith in
enclosures differ an d recom m ends th a t the differences b e explained in m ore detail. P articu lar atten tio n
sh o u ld be given by certifying authorities to acceptable u p p e r lim its on th e gradients o f ram ps a n d stairways.
T h e m ax im u m gradient for ram ps set out in the curren t G re e n G u id e was felt acceptable.

   37. Similarly, the W orking Party believes th a t th e channelling of flows by th e provision o f handrails should
be given greater em phasis. The reco m m end ed w idth o f channel for b o th stairways an d ram p s should not
exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast, a n d th e w id th o f up to 1.8 m etres p erm itted by paragraph
76 should therefore be reduced accordingly. H an drails sh o u ld extend, by at least 300m m beyond the to p and
b o tto m o f any stairway or ramp.

    38. T h e difference between handrails, balustrades a n d barriers on o r n e a r th e to p an d b o tto m of stairways
 a n d ram p s, an d th eir appropriate strength req uirem ents, needs to be clarified.

    39. T he Technical W orking Party recom m en d s th e inclu sio n in th e G reen G u id e o f a g reater n u m b e r o f
 d iagram s illustrating th e potentially h azardo u s situ atio n s in relation to stairways an d ram p s an d o f the
 prin cip les b eh in d the provisions.

 Inspections and Tests
    40. Inspection a n d tests o f all eq u ip m en t a n d stru ctu res at grounds are vital features o f good operation.
 T h e ir range is wide, extending from visual in spectio n before an d after each event to regular testin g of
 stru ctu ral com ponents. It is a m a tte r o f serious concern th a t the interpretation o f requirem ents by those
 responsible is unacceptably variable. T he Technical W orking Party considers th a t action should be tak en to
 en su re th a t com m on high standards o f inspection a n d test are realised, a n d m akes th e following
 reco m m en d atio n s.

   (i)    T h e G reen G u id e should include a co m p rehensive ta b u la tio n o f inspections an d tests covering the
          essential technical features o f grounds. It should prescribe the m in im u m frequencies at which the
          inspections an d tests should be conducted.


                                                             93

  (iii) R ecords o f the results o f inspections an d tests, in clu ding the identification o f defects an d the rem edies

  (iv) A national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the adoption o f com m on stan dard s o f

       n ational register o f organisations em ployed to carry o ut inspections an d tests; central recording o f the
       extent an d type o f the inspections an d tests a d o p te d at individual grounds; a n d the provision o f advice
       on inspection an d test for those responsible fo r carry in g out the work and for certifying authorities. It
       would be in th e interest o f c o m m o n sta n d a rd s if an Inspectorate o f this k ind dealt w ith the grounds o f
       all relevant sports, an d co n sid eratio n should be given to its form ation through an association o f th e ir
       governing bodies.

Fire Safety
   41. T here is general recognition am o n gst T echnical W orking Party m em bers th at the current C h a p te r on
F ire Safety (C hap ter 11) is well-defined. It c o n ta in s m u c h useful advice on egress an d m eans o f escape,
a p p licatio n o f which is not restricted to fire risks a n d w hich would bear repetition in o th er C hapters.

   42. T h e Technical W orking Party con sid ers th a t it is essential to m ain tain simple, clear lines o f au th o rity
a n d co m m u nicatio n ; independent in p u t from in d iv id u a l bodies; is to be avoided. W ith th a t in m in d , its
m e m b e rs believe that consultation o n all safety m a tte rs sh o u ld be directly with th e certifying au th o rity w ho,
in tu rn , w ould consult w ith the fire, police, an d o th e r au th o rities.

E m ergency/A uxiliary Power
   43. T h e Technical W orking Party considers th a t th e current G reen G u id e contains insufficient
in fo rm atio n o n auxiliary power. It reco m m en d s a sep arate chap ter on the topic w ith a req u irem en t th a t
em ergency pow er should be sufficient to m a in ta in an a d e q u a te level o f lighting, a n d public address system
a n d to operate any electronic gates, a la rm s etc for a p e rio d o f three hours from th e tim e o f failure o f t h e
n o rm a l supply.

C om m unications
    44. T he Technical W orking Party considers th a t too little weight has in the past been attached to th e need
f o r a com prehensive com m unications system , capable o f reaching both inside an d outside the ground.

  45. C h ap ter 12 o f the G reen G uide therefore req u ires substan tial am en d m ent to reflect the im po rtan ce o f
effective c o m m u nicatio n s systems, the need to m ake use o f high-technology equipm ent, an d the value o f
closer co-operation between club an d police personnel. T h e Technical W orking Party considers th a t Interim
R e c o m m e n d a tio n s 31-34 should be retain ed p erm an en tly an d incorporated into the G reen G uide.

D isa b led Spectators
  46. The current G reen G uide fails to address th e specific problem s encountered by disabled spectators
an d the Technical W orking Party reco m m end s the in tro d u c tio n o f a C h ap ter to cover these aspects. It should
deal in particu lar with Ingress and Egress an d w ith the provision o f self-contained viewing areas.

T he G reen Guide
   1. A higher degree o f stan dard isatio n in stad ia design an d construction is required. An updated a n d
revised G reen G u id e should form the basis on w hich a designated ground o r stand is certified. It sh o uld
in co rp o rate app rop riate diagram s and refer to relevant B uilding Regulations.

A dvisory Body
   2. T h ere should be a single, central bo d y (called p erh ap s the Advisory Council for Sports G ro u n ds) to
p ro vide an a u th o r ita tiv e source o f knowledge l o r all those involved in the design and construction o f stadia.


                                                              94

  3. W hilst standing acco m m od ation is not intrinsically unsafe, all-seater stadia bring benefits to spectator
com fort, safety and crowd control. T he im p le m e n ta tio n o f higher proportions o f seated accom m odation
should be governed by com m on high stan d ard s o f design a n d construction.

C apacities
   4. C apacity d epends on stan d ard s o f ingress, egress a n d safety generally as well as the acceptable packing
d en sity an d the effective area o f the acco m m o dation . T h e current m axim um packing density o f 5 .4 /m 2
re co m m en ded in the G reen G uide for standing terraces should be safe in static conditions where the terraces
are in full com pliance w ith the G reen G uide. It should be recognised, however, th at densities norm ally vary
over an enclosure, an d an allowable average figure should reflect th is consideration. T h e reduced figure of
2 .7 /m 2 should be abolished and there should be no specified lower lim it. If an enclosure has such p oo r safety
stan d ard s th a t it is totally unfit as a viewing area, the figure should be zero.

Separation of Viewing A reas and Pitch
  5. C onsideration should be given to different perim eter arrangem ents appropriate for different areas o f a
ground.

   6. T he m eans o f separation adopted should provide sufficient protection against pitch incursions w itho u t
co m p ro m isin g spectator safety. T he m ax im u m height o f fences should be determ ined in relation to the UEFA
sta n d a rd o f 2.2 metres. O verhanging sections a n d spiked or barbed-w ire attachm ents should be rem oved.

  7. A tten tio n should be given to the elim in atio n o f sp ectato r viewing from front steps o f terraces which are
substantially lower th a n the level o f the pitch.

Em ergency Access to the P itch
   8. Em ergency access to the pitch should be provided from all adjacent viewing areas.

   9. Exit gaps or gates should be at least 1.1 m etres w ide o r as w ide as the gangways feeding into th em ,
w hichever is th e larger. All gangways m ust be clearly id en tified an d m u st be kept clear o f spectators in n o rm a l
circum stances.

C ru sh B arriers
    10. A review o f the procedures for inspection a n d testing o f b arriers is recom m ended. G re a te r em phasis
s h o u ld be given to thorough recorded and certified annual visual inspections o f all crush barriers, an d to th e
e stablish m en t o f an unam biguous testing procedure.

S ta n d s
    11. T he G re e n G u id e should contain a sep arate C h a p te r o n te m p o ra ry structures, w ith a p p ro p ria te
 references to applicable regulations an d British S tandards.

 In g ress
    12. T he curren t m ax im u m notional flow rate p er turn stile o f 750 persons per h o u r is too high. A figure o f
 500 should be ad op ted as the m ed ian with a m a x im u m u p p e r lim it o f 660 persons p e r hour. V ariations fro m
 the m e d ia n m u st be approved by the certifying authority.

 E gress
    13. W here reservoir areas cannot be rem oved, a lower d en sity o f 35-40 persons per 10 sq m etres should be
 ad o p te d . Each ground should produce netw orked plans d elin eating all aspects o f ingress an d egress.

 E nclosures/Turnstiles
   14. T here should be a direct one-to-one relatio n sh ip betw een banks o f turnstiles an d corresponding
 enclosures. W here sub-divisions exist, it is im p e ra tiv e th a t th e totals entering each sub-division are counted
 separately.

 Stairw ays a n d Ram ps
     15. T he recom m ended w idth o f channels sh o u ld not exceed three persons (unit w idths) in line abreast.
 H a n d ra ils should extend by at least^300mm beyond the to p a n d b o tto m o f any stairway or ram p . The design
 a n d streng th o f handrails, barriers and p ro tectio n o n o r n e a r stairways or ram ps should be clearly defined.
 R a m p s should n ot produce dangerous crowd pressures.


                                                              95
In spection and T ests
    16. A ction should be tak en to ensure th a t c o m m o n high stan d ard s o f inspection and test are realised. A
n a tio n a l Inspectorate should be established to oversee th e a d o ptio n o f such standards. Its term s o f reference
sh o u ld include com pilation an d m ain ten an ce o f a natio nal register o f organisations employed to carry out
in sp ectio n s a n d tests; central reco rd in g o f the ex ten t a n d type o f inspections an d tests at individual grounds;
a n d the provision o f advice.

    17. T h e G reen G u id e sh ou ld b e am e n d e d substantially to em phasise the im portance o f effective
c o m m u n ic a tio n s systems capable o f reaching bo th in sid e a n d outside the ground.

     Dear Sir/Madam

    HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 11/1990
    FINAL REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
     Introduction

    The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secyretary
    following the disaster at the Hillsborough footoall ground vas
    published on 29 January. A copy of the Report is attached.
    2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
    of the Report's recommendations and the Government's response to
    them; and second to give guidance to local authorities with
    safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
    recommendations.
    The Report

    3.   The Report contains 76 recommendations, 43 of ‘which are
    repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6 below) from the
    Interim Report circulated with HOC 68/1989. Attached at Annex A
    is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to the House
    of Commons on 29 January responding to the final Report.     At
    Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
    setting out the Government's initial response to the individual
    recommendations in the report.

    4.   Local authorities may wish to note, in particular, the
    response to recommendations1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
    recommendation 6 (National Review Body). The intention is to
    bring into force the relevant sections of Part I of the Football
    Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
 as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.                     Safety
 certificates should not be amended for this purpose.
         >             • ■

 Scope

  5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
  the recommendations MessentiallyH to sports grounds designated
  under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the flexibility of
  approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
  Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply. Paragraph 14 of
  the Report makes clear that its emphasis is on football/ with its
  special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
- are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
  states that "crowd problems are directly related to the nature
  of the' event and the numbers attending it". It would therefore
  be cpnsistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
  to take proper account of these factors when applying the
  recommendations to individual grounds:     for example a careful
  appraisal, of the value of such matters as the installation of
  sophisticated, communications systems and CCTV may be necessary
  where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than
  thousands and where the police presence at the ground is minimal.

 Interim Report Recommendations Adjusted
 6.   The   attention  of   local   authorities   is  drawn   to
 recommendations 8, 11, 12(b), 19, 20, 31, 33, 58, 66 and 67 all
 of which were contained in the Interim Report but have been
 modified as follows:
         recommendation 8 -            revised maximum figure
         recommendation 11     -       "agreement" between club and pol4ce is
                                       replaced by "statement of intent"
         recommendation 12     -       qualification introduced by 12(b)
         recommendation 19     -       discretion as regards opening of pitch
                                       perimeter gates
         recommendation 20     -       mannina by police or steward
         recommendation 31     -       revised   composition   of   the Advisory
                                       Group                           *
         recommendation 33     -       reference to 1975 Act provision

         recommendation 58     -       hand-signals not recommended

         rec ommendat ion 66   -       recommended threshold figure of 2000

         recommendation 67         -   ambulance may be approved         by   the
                                       ambulance authorities.
     New Safety Recommendations

     7.   New recommendations are summarised below and         local
     authorities are urged to take the action indicated        where
     appropriate.

          Turnstiles (recommendation 10) - to note the revised
          maximum flow-rate to be used in place of the figure of
          750 quoted in the Green Guide which will be amended as
          soon as possible;

          Gangways (recommendation 13) - to include appropriate
          conditions in safety certificates;

          Perimeter Fences (recommendations 14, 15, 17) - to
          secure   action by clubs to      comply with these
          recommendations and to amend safety certificates, as
          necessary;

          Safety Certificates (recommendations 24, 25, 26) - to
          consider   any   necessary   adjustment   to   safety
          certificates and note Home Office intention to
          implement recommendation 24;

          Duties of Clubs (recommendations 39, 40, 42, 43) - to
          consider appropriate amendment to safety certificates,
          as necessary;

          Police Planning (recommendations 47, 48, 50, 52, 53),
          Communications (55) and Co-ordination (61) - to note
          the recommendations and the Governments response;
          First Aid (recommendation 69) and Of fences/penalties
          (recommendations 70-73)   - to note Governments
          response;

          Green Guide (recommendations 74-76 and Appendix 3) -
          to note the Government response and to adopt the
          revised criteria/requirements which will be included
          in a revised guide as soon as possible.
     Resource Implications

If 8.    Action to consider, revise and enforce the provisions of |
11 safety certificates in the light of the Report may have short j
 ; term resource implications but is not expected to give rise to j
j; significant long-term resource implications above existing 'l
I V commitments.

impact of closed circuit television on the hooligan
problem. It also mentions other measures taken by the
Government, such as the restriction on the sale of alcohol
and the power given to the courts to make orders
excluding convicted hooligans from grounds.
    Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
value of the police national football intelligence unit in
dealing with football-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.
    As I have said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
better behaviour. Beyond that, the report recommends the
creation of three new specific offences to apply at
designated sports grounds— throwing a missile; chanting
obscene or racialist abuse: and going on to the pitch
without reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
to be given to extending the courts' powers to impose
attendance centre orders and for the use of electronic
lagging in the case of offenders* convicted of football-
related offences. The specific new offences suggested seem,
to some extent, to duplicate offences which are already
available in the Public Order Act 1986. but I shall look
carefully and quickly at all these suggestions.
    I now come to the proposed football membership
scheme. Lord Justice Taylor examined the invitation to
tender for a scheme which was issued by the consultants
employed by the football authorities. He came to the
conclusion that he could not support a scheme of that kind
because he could not believe that the technology would
work well enough to avoid the danger of congestion and
disorder. He was also concerned about the call on police
resources. Instead, he proposes the measures to which 1
have referred.
    In the light of this advice, the Government have decided
not to proceed with the establishment of a football
 membership authority, but part 1of the Act will remain on
the statute book. Work will continue to see how the
shortcomings identified by Lord Justice Taylor could be
 overcome in case we have to return to the matter again,
 should the problem of hooliganism not be defeated by the
 alternative strategy proposed in the report.
     Let no one imagine that this means that there will be
 any let-up in the fight against hooliganism. Those who.
 unlike the Government, have for so long shrugged offtheir
 responsibilities will now have to face up to them.
    The Government intend to proceed as quickly as
 possible to the establishment of a football licensing
 authority and. subject to consultation, section 11 of the
 Football Spectators Act will be used to direct the Football
 Licensing Authority to require all-seater stadiums— with
 standing being reduced by stages and entirely eliminated in
 firstand second division grounds by August 1994 and in all
 Football League grounds by 1999.
     The necessary steps will be taken to ensure improved
 arrangements for crowd control and better training for
 police and stewards. There will be urgent consideration of
 the case for new offences and for new powers to deal with
 those excluded from grounds by the courts. The clubs will
 be compelled to get rid of the terraces. But Lord Justice
 Taylor indicates how much more they can do to create a

INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM INQUIRY

Initial response by the Government to the recommendations in the
final report of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry into the
Hillsborough stadium diaster.

In his statement on 29 January, the Home Secretary indicated that
he would place in the Library a schedule setting out the
Government1s initial response to the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor's final report. The schedule is annexed.




29 January 1990
Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report.

ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.   General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
     designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

2.   To apply to all UEFA "high risk" matches from Autumn 19*3.
3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
          Football league, Divisions 1 and 2
          Scottish football league, Premier Division
          National stadia.

4.   To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
     other matches played at designated grounds.
The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.


The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and wftich it m3y not'
be practicable to deal with in this way.



ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)
The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.



NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)
     (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
           review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

     (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
           sports and other sports venues.

The Government supports      the   recommendation that safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues after consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority's responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)
7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators
      in pens or areas (interim recommendation 1).
8.    Calculations of crowd density:    revised figures      (interim
      recommendation 2, revised).
9.    Arrangements to prevent further access to pens          (interim
      recommendation 3).

10.   Turnstile flow rates.

The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates to reflect reductions in terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities*
attention. The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.
                                                   r             •   -

FILLING .AND MONITORING OF TERRACES (Recommendations 11-12)
11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation     A,   revised.

12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).
The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.

GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13)
Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.

FENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)

14.   Removal of spikes.

15.   Reduction in height.

16.   Training of stewards (interim recommendation 6).
                                                        fc

17.   Emergency gates in perimeter fences.

18.   Harking of emergency gates (interim recommendation 7).

19.   Gates normally to be kept open during matches             (interim
      recommendation 8, revised).

20.   Hanning    of    emergency      gates      (replaces       interim
      recommendation 9).

21.   Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).

The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17 and to note recommendation 19 which varies interim
recommendation 8.   The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.

CRUSH BARRIERS (Recommendations 22, 23)

22.   Inspection (interim recommendation 11).

23.   Review of layout (interim recommendation 12).

These are repeated from the Interim Report.        They have already
been commended to local authorities.
SAFETY CERTIFICATES (Recommendations 24-31)

24.   Handatory conditions in safety certificatest
25.   Variation from terms of safety certificates.

26.   Terms of safety certificates.
27.   Review of safety certificates (interim recommendation 13).

28.Issue of certificates     to    grounds    without   them    (interim
recommendation 14).
29.   Annual   review  of   certificates;  annual            renewal   of
      certificates (interim recommendation 15).

30.   Review of arrangements for issuing certificates (interim
      recommendation 16).

31.   Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17,
      revised).

The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
reminded of the need to have an effective review system, the
desirability of a properly constituted team approach to
certification and the desirability of consulting club and
supporters association representatives.

Annual review of safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
with safety certificates is already required by law.       The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

DUTIES OF FOOTBALL CLUBS (Recommendations 32-43)

32.   Measurement of turnstile flow (interim recommendation 18).

33.   Correlation of turnstile      flow   and    capacity   (interim
      recommendation 19).

      extended).

36.   Signposting (interim recommendation 22, extended).

37.   Information on tickets (interim recommendation 23).

38.   Co-ordination with the police (interim recommendation 24).

39.   Computer records of ticket sales.

40.   Restriction of all ticket matches to capacity attendances.

41.   Pre match entertainment (interim recommendation 25) .
42.   Recruitment of stewards.
43.   Police control rooms.

These recommendations are aimed primarily at football clubs and
are supported by the Government.       Where appropriate, local
authorities will be asked to amend safety certificates tb enforce
these recommendations.

POLICE PLANNING (Recommendations 44-53)
44.   Nomination of a Chief      Officer    for    liaison   (interim
      recommendation 26).
45.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 27).

46.   Operational orders (interim recommendation 28) .

47.   Police action on ticketless fans.
48.   Review of arrest procedures.                 *
49.   Postponement of kick-offs (interim recommendation 29).

50.   Early kick-offs and Sunday fixtures.

51.   Control room facilities.

52.   Training of senior officers.
53.   Charges for police services.

These recommendations, some of which are repeated from the
Interim Report are directed primarily to Chief Police Officers
and police authorities. The Government supports the proposal for
senior   officer training    and   the objective    to   improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches. The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police
authorities after consultation with relevant representative
associations, to ensure consistency of practice.

COMMUNICATIONS (Recommendations 54-58)

54.   Radio communications (interim recommendation 31, amended).
55.   Provision of a command channel.

56.   Land lines (interim recommendation 32).

57.   Public address (interim recommendation 33).
58.   Illuminated advertising (interim recommendation 34:-^advice
      on hand signals withdrawn).
These are largely repeated from the Interim Report which the
Government has already urged clubs, local authorities and police
to implement. Chief Officers will also be encouraged to use an
additional, discrete channel of communications for police match
commanders.

CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES (Recommendations 59-63)

59.   Co-ordination (interim recommendation 35).        »
60.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 36).

61.   Communication with emergency services.

62.   Arrival of emergency vehicles (interim recommendation 37).

63.   Briefing of police officers (interim recommendation 38).

These recommendations are intended to ensure full co-ordination
and co-operation of the emergency services and are substantially
those covered in the Interim Report which the Government has
already endorsed. The Government will urge all those concerned
to comply with the further recommendation devised to ensure
immediate summons of emergency services.

FIRST AID, MEDICAL FACILITIES AMD AMBULANCES
(Recommendations   64-69)

64.    First aiders (interim recommendation 39).

65.    First aid rooms (interim recommendation 40).

66.    Medical practitioners (interim recommendation 41, revised).

67.    Ambulances (interim recommendation 42, revised).

68.    Ambulances, larger matches (interim recommendation 43).

69.    Major incident vehicles.

The Government will draw attention to variations from the
relevant Interim Report recommendations and will discuss the
provision of major incident vehicles with the authorities
concerned.

OFFENCES AND PENALTIES (Recommendations 70-73)
70.    Selling tickets.

71.    Other specific offences.
72.    Attendance centres.
73.    Electronic tagging.
                                                      f.
The Government will look carefully and quickly at all these
suggestions.

GREEN GUIDE (Recommendations 74-76)

74.    Revision of the Green Guide.
75.    Crush barrier tests.

7 6.   Inspections for corrosion.
                                                           I
The Government accepts these recommendations and will act on them
with urgency.

    Seminar:      After Hillsborough:
         The Implications of the Taylor Report
    for Local Authority-Football Club Relationships

                     11 May 1990
                                                     CHAPTER 2

                                     A BE TT ER F U T U R E FO R F O O T BA LL

  59. It is not enough to aim only at the m in im u m m easures necessary for safety. T hat has been, at best, the
approach in the past and too often not even that standard has been achieved. W hat is required is the vision
and im agination to achieve a new ethos for football. G ro unds should be upgraded. A ttitudes should be more
welcoming. The aim should be to provide m ore m odern and com fortable accom m odation, better and more
varied facilities, m ore consultation with the supporters and m ore positive leadership. If such a policy is
im plem ented it will not only improve safety. There will also be an im provem ent in behaviour, m aking crowd
control easier.

   60. At some clubs changes have already been m ade towards realising this new concept o f how football
should be. For example, at Ibrox Park, scene o f the appalling disaster in 1971, there has been a total
transform ation. T he old m ain stand rem ains and still has some standing areas in front o f it. But three new
stands have been built round the rest o f the ground. T hey are colourful, convenient and are all-seating. They
are constructed so as to provide a covered concourse at first floor level running the length o f the stand. At the
rear o f that concourse throughout its length are m odern lavatories for both sexes. At the front are attractive
fast food service points offering a good range o f food and drinks (but no alcohol). T he walls are clean; the
flooring is o f studded rubber. M ounted overhead, at regular intervals o f a few yards along the whole
concourse, are television sets tuned to a sports program m e giving inform ation on the day ’s fixtures, excerpts
from previous m atches and general sports coverage. These arrangem ents encourage fans to arrive in good
tim e, to have w holesom e refreshm ents in a clean an d pleasant setting, to enjoy on the television the kind o f
pre-m atch entertain m en t which genuinely interests them , to visit a decent toilet, an d then to walk up a few
steps to take their seats for the m atch. All o f this is under cover a n d it is enjoyed not ju st by the affluent b ut by
the ordinary supporter. Significantly, the facilities are not abused. O ccasional graffiti do ap pear b ut are
wiped away prom ptly and th e overall im pression is that if spectators are offered civilised conditions they
come to respect them .

A ll-Seating
  61. T here is no panacea which will achieve total safety and cure all problem s o f behaviour and crowd
control. But I am satisfied that seating does more to achieve those objectives th a n any o ther single measure.

  62. It is obvious that sitting for the duration o f the m atch is m ore com fortable than standing. It is also
safer. W hen a spectator is seated he has his own small piece o f territory in which he can feel reasonably
secure. He will not be in close physical contact with those aro und him. He will not be jostled or moved about
by swaying or surging. Small or infirm or elderly m en and women as well as young children are not buffeted,
sm othered o r unsighted by larger and m ore robust people as on the terraces. T he seated spectator is not
subject to pressure o f num bers behind or a roun d him during the m atch. He will not be painfully bent double
over a crush barrier, Those m onitoring num bers will know exactly how m any are there w ithout having to
count them in or assess the density by visual im pression. T here will still, o f course, be scope for crowd
pressure on stairways whilst entering and especially when leaving, b u t involuntary and uncontrolled crowd
m ovem ents occasioned by incidents in the game are effectively elim inated.
               f

  63. It is true that at m om en ts o f excitem ent seated spectators do, and may be expected to, rise from their
seats, But the m om ent passes and they sit down again. I also recognise that seating is only regarded as m ore
com fortable than standing if cover is provided, T he consensus is that, although standing on an exposed
tcrrace on a wet day is disagreeable, sitting in the rain is worse, So, increased seating does require that cover
be provided.

  64. A part from com fort and safety, seating has distinct advantages in achieving crowd control. It is
possible to have disturbances in a seated area and they have occurred, b u t with the assistance o f CCTV the
police can im m ediately zoom in with a cam era an d p inpoint the seats occupied by the trouble-m akers as well
as the trouble-m akers themselves. Moreover, if num bered tickets are issued to nam ed purchasers, the police
have a further aid to identifying miscreants.

  65. N um bered tickets m atching num bered seats also help to identify forgeries. Forged tickets for standing
areas may not be discovered. In the past, they simply led to inflated num bers on the terraces at all-ticket
matches. But there can only be one valid ticket for each num bered seat and the existence o f a forgery is
immediately exposed.


                                                             12
  66. The evidence I have received has been overwhelmingly in favour o f m ore seating accom m odation. At
present, the ratio throughout the 92 League clubs in England and Wales is about two thirds standing to one
third seated. But whilst m ost are in favour o f reversing th at ratio, there are those who wish to retain a
proportion o f standing room. Amongst them are the FA and the football supporters’ organisations.
Essentially they deploy three argum ents.

  67. The first is an em otional one based on a desire to retain the traditional culture derived from the close
contact o f the terraces. “ My grandfather stood here; my father stood here with me; why shouldn’t I stand here
with my son?” is a com m only expressed view. Moreover, to m any young men the cam araderie o f singing
together, ju m p in g up and down, responding in unison to the nam ing o f the players, their emergence on to the
pitch, the scoring o f a goal, an unpo pular decision - all o f these are an integral part o f enjoying the match.
They like being part o f an am orphous seething crowd and do not wish to have each his own place in a seat.

   68. The second argum ent is that conversion to all-seating will reduce the num bers o f fans who can be
admitted to the ground; so, m any would-be spectators will be disappointed. T his assum es a significantly
greater density being perm itted for standing places than for seating. It also assum es that the size o f present
crowds regularly exceeds projected all-seated capacity. But the FA’s own evidence showed that during the
 1988/89 season the n u m b e r o f occasions when attendances at League clubs exceeded projected all-seater
capacity ranged from nil to 16. T he 16 attendances were at Liverpool, who have accepted the need for
all-seating. For only three clubs in the first and second divisions did the attendance exceed the projected
all-seated capacity on m ore than 10 occasions, and for 21 out o f 44 clubs in these two divisions the
attendance never exceeded the projected all-seated capacity. In only one case (Liverpool) was the average
attendance during the season in excess o f the projected all-seated capacity.

  69. Finally, cost. Spectators do not want to pay and, it is argued, m any could not pay the substantially
higher price o f a seat as against the cost o f standing.

  70. I am not convinced th at the cherished culture o f the terraces is wholly lost when fans are seated.
Watching the m ore boisterous and dem onstrative sections at all-seater grounds, I have noted no absence o f
concerted singing, chanting, clapping o r gesticulating in unison. T he com m unal spirit is still there and finds
ready expression. To such extent as the seating lim its togetherness or prevents m ovem ent, th at price is surely
worth paying for the benefits in safety and control.

   71. Moreover, the m axim um density which experience now shows to be acceptable in standing areas tends
to take the force out o f the first two argum ents. If standing density is little m ore than seating density, the
melded mass previously found on terraces becom es m ore diffuse and the intensity o f the togetherness
becomes little greater standing than sitting. Likewise, at such a density, the difference between the adm issible
num bers standing and sitting becom e marginal. It can be m ade up by having two o r m ore tiers o f seating
where previously there was only one tier o f standing.

   72. As to cost, clubs may well wish to charge som ew hat m ore for seats than for standing b u t it should be
possible to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to the pockets o f those presently paying to
stand. At Ibrox, for example, seating is £6, standing £4 - not a prohibitive price o r differential.

The Trend in the IJK
   73. T he superibr safety o f seating has already persuaded a n u m b er o f clubs in the U K to convert their
terraces to seating either totally or predom inantly. Following Hillsborough, Liverpool have a nnounced their
intention to ad ap t their fam ous Kop to seating. In Scotland, A berdeen’s ground at Pittodrie becam e all-seater
in 1978; Clydebank followed suit; St Johnstone’s new ground at Perth is all-seated. Wembley stadium will
early in 1990 accom m odate 80,000 spectators, all-seated.

  74. T hose opposed to all-seating point out th at previous attem pts to introduce it have m et with spectator
resistance. Coventry City was the first English club to install seating throughout its ground in 1981. In 1983
the club reverted to allowing 2,000 to stand. In 1985, after visiting fans o f M anchester City tore up seats and
used them as missiles, the ground reverted to standing. Q ueen’s Park Rangers also moved towards all-seated
accom m odation but removed some seats under pressure from supporters.

  75. Since then, however, Hillsborough has happened, thinking has changed; responsible com m ent by
government, football a uthorities and m edia has prepared the way for change. Moreover, there are now seats
available which cann ot be m anually torn and used as missiles. Those at U trecht, for example, have
survived intact for seven years despite usage and deliberate experim ental tests o f their strength.


                                                        13
   76. It is possible th a t in the early stages o f conversion there may be instances o f fans standing on the seats
or in front o f them because they are used to standing or in order to register a protest, but I am satisfied that in
England and Wales as in Scotland and abroad spectators will becom e accustom ed and educated to sitting.
T he evidence 1 have received shows th at m ore recently, where seating has been installed, the fans have come
to accept and like it. At lbrox Park, for example, the seated areas are the m ost popular and tickets for them
sell in preference to those for standing. Significantly, trouble from m isbehaviour and physical injuries have
been reduced since m ost o f the crowd becam e seated. Such trouble and accidental injuries as still occur are
prim arily in the rem aining standing areas. It is planned to convert them to seating in the near future.

S ir Norman C hester C entre Research
   77. T he Sir N orm an C hester C entre for Football Research, attached to the U niversity o f Leicester, is
funded by the Football Trust. In N ovem ber 1989 the C entre undertook a survey o f registered m em bers o f the
Football Supporters’ Association to discover the views o f com m itted football fans on a nu m b er o f the issues
after Hillsborough which are covered in my Report. T he extension o f seating was one such issue. N um erous
questions were asked on a n u m b er o f different hypotheses. T he R eport states th at substantial m ajorities in
the sam ple were in favour o f m aintaining the status quo on the seats/terraces balance at their own clubs.
However, the Report continues:

  “ 53.6% claim ed they would actually support the drive for m ore seating (sic) if they were reasonably priced
  and covered. T he ad d itio n o f these last two points - concessions on price and cover - also seemed to have
  dram atic effects in reducing levels o f opposition to the prospects o f all-seated facilities as we shall see
  later” .

W hen all-seating was put to the sam ple there was a m ajority against it, b u t the R eport goes on:

  “ Finally, and perhaps significantly, opposition in o u r sam ple to the introduction o f all-seated facilities
  dim inishes considerably when one introduces provisos on price and protection from the elements. W hen
  this is done, m ore people in o u r sam ple support all-seaters than oppose them .”

Europe
  78. T he trend towards seating is even stronger in Europe and is now being driven by decrees o f both
national an d European football authorities.

   79. In Italy the im m inence o f the 1990 W orld C up co m petitio n has forced the pace o f progress. T he Italian
Ministry o f the Interior decreed on 25 August 1989 that for open air facilities with a capacity o f m ore than
10,000 spectators at football games and for covered ones with a capacity o f m ore than 4,000 spectators no
standing will be allowed after 30 April 1990. Those facilities m ust have only num bered seats each not less
than 0.45 metres wide. The San Siro stadium in Milan will by then seat 85,000 spectators; the Olim pico
stadium in Rome will seat 87,000.

   80. In H olland, U trecht’s ground built in 1982 has seating for 12,000 and standing room for 8,000. The
club already intended to convert the latter to seating. However, on 6 D ecem ber 1989 the D utch equivalent of
the FA (the KNVB) agreed with the D utch clubs to cut the standing capacity o f football grounds by 10% each
year over the next decade so as to render football stadia in the N etherlands in effect all-seater at the end o f the
 1990s.             '

  81. In following this phasing H ollan d’s policy is in accord w ith a resolution presently und er consideration
by UEFA (U nion des A ssociations Europeennes de Football). T he resolution proposes th at for the 1990/91
season only 80% o f the standing tickets may be sold, th a t figure to be reduced every season by 10% until 1999.

   82. FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) passed a resolution on 26 July 1989
providing that as from the prelim inary com petition for the 1994 W orld C up (starting in autu m n 1992)
“m atches may in principle only be played in all-seater stadia” . T he resolution went on “as from 1993 it will
be the duty o f the C onfederations an d N ational Associations to hold high-risk m atches in their zones only in
all-seater stad ia.” High-risk m atches are defined under UEFA Regulations as follows:

     “ 1 All UEFA final and semi-final ties o f the UEFA club com petitions as well as final tou rnam en t
         m atches o f the European Football C ham pionship.

      II W hen declared as such by UEFA on the basis o f previous incidents o f supporters o f one o r both
         team s or o f o ther exceptional considerations.


                                                          14
     III W hen it is expected that visiting team supporters will exceed 10% o f stadium capacity o r will exceed
         3,000 persons.

     IV W hen full capacity stadium is expected or m ore than 50,000 spectators present.

     V W hen the m atch is likely to attract a large n u m ber o f emigrants/foreign workers originating from the
       country o f the visiting team , who live either in the country where the m atch is being played or in
       neighbouring countries.”

   T hus world and E uropean football authorities are clearly determ ined to enforce the conversion o f stadia to
all-seating, so far as international matches and other m atches under their control are concerned. It is true that
their resolutions will not be bin ding in regard to League o r dom estic football matches. But they are a pointer
in the direction o f safety and control and as such have been em ulated by Italy and H olland domestically.

   83. F urtherm ore, I am told by the FA that they regard them selves as duty bound to follow, in the dom estic
football scene, any Resolution passed by FIFA although strictly such Resolution is binding only in
international m atches o r m atches between U K clubs an d clubs from abroad. Thus, the FA regard the
Resolution o f 26 July 1989 as effective in relation to the League, C up and other dom estic fixtures from 1993
onwards. T he Resolution does not force clubs to install all-seating as a condition o f staging high-risk matches.
T here is still the optio n to use only those parts o f the ground which have seating. Clearly, unless these are
substantial, atte n d a n ce will be m uch reduced. O ne would therefore expect the m ajor clubs to ad ap t their
grounds to accom m odate the m axim um seating they can manage by the tim e the Resolution takes effect.
Sm aller and m ore im pecu nio us clubs may prefer to postpone conversion. However, if a small club with little
seating accom m odation draw s a large first division club at hom e in the Cup in 1993 (a high-risk m atch) it will
be able only to use its lim ited seating accom m odation o r the game will have to be played at a better equipped
ground elsewhere.

T h e Football Spectators Act 1989
  84. T he intention to follow this sam e trend was stated by your predecessor. M r Douglas H urd, in a
statem ent to the H ouse o f C o m m o n s two days after Hillsborough. H e a d d e d :-

  “T his would involve the disappearance o f terraces at (m ajor) grounds. It might also involve am en dm ents
  to strengthen the Football Spectators Bill so th at its provisions for the licensing o f grounds m atched this
  c oncept”.

  In the event, m achinery for im plem enting increased seating is to be found in section 11 o f the 1989 Act.
There, provision is m ade for the Football Licensing A uthority (set up under section 8) to be directed by the
Secretary o f State to include in any licence to a d m it spectators a condition imposing requirem ents as respects
the seating o f spectators at designated football m atches at the premises; “and it shall be the duty o f the
authority to com ply with the direction ”.

A ssociation Football only or D esignated Grounds?
   85. In considering seating and standing. I have concentrated so far on association football because it
attracts the largest and m ost volatile crowds and has been troubled with m isbehaviour. But should
recom m endations about seating be confined to association football or should they go further? W herever a
line is drawn com plain t may be m ade that it is illogical, but two possibilities seem m ore logical than most;
either to confine recom m end ation s to the 92 clubs in the Football League or to apply them to grounds
designated un der the 1975 Act as am ended. T he latter course would include a num ber o f Rugby League,
Rugby U nion and cricket grounds. I acknowledge th at so far, happily, m isbehaviour at those grounds has
been m inim al. However, even leaving aside possible m isbehaviour, where there are large num bers there is a
risk o f overcrowding. A well attended Rugby m atch o f either code may attract num bers in excess o f those
a ttending m any Football League matches. T here would seem little reason for requiring a fourth division
L eagueclub to convert to seating whilst perm itting m ajor Rugby clubs to keep their terraces indefinitely.

  86. On the o ther hand, proposals for all-seating would clearly be inappropriate in relation to sports events
at which spectators are accustom ed, and should be entitled, to move about. For exam ple, at horserace
meetings, spectators may wish to view horses in the paddock, place bets, view races from different vantage
points and enjoy the o th er facilities o f what is a social occasion as well as a sports event. O th e r exam ples o f
events at which spectators move about and should be free to do so are greyhound racing and golf
tournam ents.


                                                          15
   87. T he criteria for designating a sports ground under the 1975 Act as am en d e d are laid down in section
1 ( 1 ):

   “The Secretary o f State may by o rder designate as a sports ground requiring a certificate un der this Act (in
   this Act referred to as a “safety certificate” ) any sports ground which in his o p in ion has accom m odation for
   m ore than 10,000 spectators.”

  Section 1(1 )(A) perm its the Secretary o f State to substitute such o th e r n u m b e r as he considers appropriate
for the nu m b er 10,000.

   88. Clearly the purpose o f such designation is to bring safety o f grounds with capacity for substantial
num bers und er the control o f the local authority. W hilst some grounds w ith a capacity o f m ore than 10.000
m ay currently have an average attendance o f only say 3,000, there is always the prospect o f a visit from a large
club, an attractive Cup draw, or an uptu rn in fortunes bringing in larger crowds. Safety provisions m ust be
capable o f coping with such events. Indeed, danger is more likely to result if there is an occasional m atch with
a large attendance than if such m atches were regular since those controlling it a n d those attending it will be
inexperienced.

    89. For these reasons, I think recom m endations to increase seating should be applied to all designated
grounds. 1 appreciate that the m achinery provided in section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989 can be
used only to regulate the extension o f seating at association football grounds. However, the Secretary o f State
has power und er section 6(2) o f the 1975 Act, as am ended, to provide for securing safety by regulations and
m ay prescribe term s and conditions to be inserted in Safety Certificates u n d e r section 15A as indicated in the
next chapter. These powers could be used, even w ithout the provision in section 11 o f the 1989 Act, to
prescribe m andatory rules a bout seating. So, by a com bination o f his 1989 Act powers an d his 1975 Act
powers o r solely by exercising the latter, the Secretary o f State can require the progressive extension o f seating
a t designated grounds.

  90. I therefore conclude and recommend that designated grounds under the 1975 Act should be required in
due course to be converted to all-seating. 1 do so for the com pelling reasons o f safety a n d control already set
out; also, so far as association football is concerned, because the present tren d at hom e and abroad and the
rules o f the world and European football authorities make the move to all-seating irresistible.

Phasing
  91. Unless some tim e factors are specified, progress tow ards all-seating m ay well be protracted. This is
recognised in the phasing proposed in the UEFA Resolution qu o ted above an d in the m achinery set up in
section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989.

  92. For high-risk association football matches I welcome and endorse the adoption by the FA of the FIFA
Resolution requiring no standing tickets to be sold after 1993 and its application to domestic fixtures.

   93. As to other m atches, I consider that w ithout the im petus locally o f the W orld Cup, which is the spur
for speedy change in Italy, and having regard to the present state o f o u r grounds, it would be asking too m uch
to require conversion in the U K in the next two o r three years. For all grounds designated under the 1975 Act
except for first division and second division League grounds, and national stadia, I think a timing along the
lines suggested in th e Resolution under consideration by U EFA (and now adopted in Holland) is reasonable ie
that standing tickets should be reduced by 10% per year starting with a 10% deduction effective from August
1990 and so be phased out by August 1999.

   94. However, I recommend th at grounds in the first and second divisions of the League and national stadia
should be all-seated by the start of the 1994/1995 season. It is at those grounds th a t the larger crowds atten d
and, in the interests o f both safety and crowd control, I consider they should have seating for all spectators in
five years rather than ten years. T he reduction in standing tickets should therefore be at 20% per annum from
August 1990 and be complete by August 1994. Any club promoted to the second division of the League should be
given a reasonable period in which to comply. A sim ilar approach should be adopted in Scotland.

Planning Ground Improvements
   95. Increased seating an d o ther ground im provem ents will require expert plann ing an d m uch finance. As
to planning, it is crucial that before clubs em bark upon m ajor work, they should have the best inform ation
and advice on m odern ground design. Conversion to seating canno t necessarily be achieved merely by fixing
seating onto existing terraces. For example, sight-lines. access to seats, gangways, ro o f cover and o th er factors


                                                           16
may require m ore extensive changes to the layout. Some clubs may be able wholly to redevelop their existing
grounds; others m ay be lim ited by space, finance o r crowd needs to more m odest alterations. In some
instances, the best course would be to move to a new site eith er alone or in conjunction with an o th e r club.
U ltim ate decisions on these options m ust be for the club m anagem ent. No doubt, some o f the bigger clubs
will be able to engage the forem ost contractors in this field to advise them and carry out the work. But even
for them , an d certainly for the lesser clubs, it would be o f great value to have a body fully apprised o f the latest
developm ents in ground design, capable o f giving expert advice on possible schemes an d on ways and m eans
o f achieving them .

An Advisory Design Council
  96. I therefore support the suggestion of Professor M au nder’s Technical Working Party that there should be
established an Advisory Design Council to fulfil this role. It should, in my view, be set up by the FA and the FL
whose functions should include offering a service of this kind to the clubs. By way o f analogy, in Italy this
function is exercised by the C om itato O lim pico N azionale Italiano (CONI). After studying m any grounds,
including those in M adrid, V ienna an d Athens, CO N I p roduced an excellent pam phlet on “ Design Criteria
for Safe C om fortable an d Large Sports Facilities” supported by detailed studies showing how they can be
achieved. These, together with m odels which may be inspected at C O N I’s headquarters in Rome, show how a
m odern stad iu m can be designed from car park to pitch so as to secure safety and crowd control.

Research
  97. It has com e to my atten tio n only recently th at the Sports Council published in 1981 a “ H andbook o f
Sport and R ecreational Building D esign”, an d in 1989, a work entitled “Arenas, a Planning, Design and
M anagem ent G u id e” . T he 1981 work included, in volum e three, studies on ou td o o r sports stadia. T he 1989
work concentrated on in d o o r stadia. It seems th a t neither o f these works was sent to the FA o r the FL, n o r
have they acquired them . Again, in July 1986, the Institution o f Structural Engineers form ed an ad hoc
com m ittee “to bring together all cu rren t technical knowledge relevant to the appraisal o f sports grounds and
their individual elem ents. T he com m ittee’s task was to establish a fully referenced body o f knowledge within
three years which would be com plem entary to the ‘G uide to Safety at Sports G rou nds’.” T he ad hoc
com m ittee has p rep ared a fifth draft o f its report which will be finalised after the recom m endations in my
R eport have been considered.

   98. It is highly desirable th at such worthwhile research as I have m entioned should all be brought together
to achieve m axim u m benefit. W ith a form idable building and conversion program m e for football grounds
ahead, an A dvisory Design Council set up by the FA an d FL could m ake the best use o f all available research
here and abroad to assist a n d advise clubs.

Finance
   99. T he scale o f the changes I recom m end will necessarily require heavy expenditure, albeit over an
extended period. It is not my function to make detailed proposals for financing the work. T h at is for football
m anagem ent and essentially for the clubs. However, lest it be thought that I have m ade proposals regardless
o f feasible funding, I ought to indicate sources and m etho ds o f finance which should m ake the im provem ents
practicable, a n d som e o f the fiscal argum ents which have been addressed to me.

T he Football Trust (FT) and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust (FG IT)
    100. Assistance in financing safety m easures is presently available from the FT and the FGIT. T h e form er
is funded by the three m ajor pools com panies (Littlewoods. Vernons and Zetters) from the “Spot the Ball”
C om petition, a t the rate o f 21 % o f turnover, yielding over £9 million a year. The total given to British football
since 1958 now approaches £120 million. T he Trustees are em powered to use their funds to prom ote
m easures for the control o r suppression o f unruly beh av io u r in relation to football; to assist clubs to m eet the
obligations o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975: to im prove grounds and facilities for those who play
a n d watch the game a n d for any o th er purpose they consider to be a benefit to the game o f football in G reat
Britain and N orth ern Ireland. T he FT allocates ju s t over h a lf its incom e (ie over £4.5 million) to assisting
expenditure by League clubs on ground safety and im provem ents. T his is done through the FGIT, a second
in depend ent trust. T he F G IT was established in 1975. the arrangem ents being m odified later in 1979 when
the FT was brought into being.

     101. A lthough it helps to fund m any other works, from those at international grounds down to those at the
 lowliest clubs, the Trust continues to give first priority to assisting expenditure essential to the grant o f a
 Safety Certificate for a designated ground. U n d e r its trust deed, the FG IT is able to m ake grants o f up to 7 5%
 o f the total cost available to clubs carrying ou t work as a necessary condition o f their being given a Safety


                                                            17
Certificate under the 1975 Act. Accordingly, should my recom m endation o f m an d ato ry increases in seating
be m ade a condition o f the Safety Certificate, the work would be eligible for a grant from the FGIT.

    102. However, even at £4.5 million a year, the FG IT fund would be insufficient. A dditional financial
requirem ents fell upon the League clubs on the im plem en tation o f the 1975 Act a n d still m ore after the fire at
Bradford City’s ground in May 1985. By February 1988 over £37 m illion had been paid out in grants.
Pressures on finance led to the suspension o f im provem ent grants in Ju n e 1987. T he F G IT was able to
reintroduce im provem ent grant aid on a lim ited basis during the closed season o f 1988. However, the range
o f works required to upgrade the League grounds inevitably m eans that resources o f the F G IT would be
spread quite thinly. They will not be sufficient to finance the kind o f im provem ents I have suggested, but the
Trust provides a structure for doing so. By way o f example, Sheffield W ednesday received a grant o f £595,000
for the im provem ent o f the Kop end at Hillsborough. T his was in a d d itio n to som e £431,000 given to the club
for a total o f 21 safety projects between Septem ber 1978 an d O ctob er 1988. Even so, funds o f this o rd e r will
be insufficient to build new all-seated stands. How then, can ad d itional revenue be generated?

Fiscal Considerations
   103. T hree argum ents have been addressed to me by the football a uthorities suggesting alterations in tax
structure to m ake funds available for ground im provem ents. Fiscal policy is for governm ent and ultim ately
Parliam ent to decide, not fo ra judge. All I can usefully do is to set out the argum ents.

  (a) VAT on the Spot the Ball Competition
   104. T he Football Trust have suggested that if VAT were abolished on receipts from this com petition,
some £5 to £6 million would be available. This would a m o u n t to a direct subsidy from the Treasury. It would
be contrary as I u nderstand it not only to present governm ent thinking bu t to long established principles o f
fiscal policy. If that is so, a different and perhaps m ore pro pitious appro ach would be for the FA to urge the
Pool Prom oters Association (PPA) to increase th eir contribution as part o f a strategy to ensure the healthy
developm ent o f the game from which the PPA makes its money.

  (b) Pool Betting Tax
   105. A second case m ade by the FA is for a reduction in Pool Betting Tax now standing at 42.5%. T he
suggestion is a reduction to 40% which would yield som e £16 m illion. T his, it is said, could be passed on to
assist ground im provem ents in one o f two ways: either the G overnm ent could con tin u e to tax pool betting at
the current level b ut m ake a don ation to football equivalent to 2.5% o f the tax recovered, o r it could reduce
the tax rate to 40% on the strict understanding that present proposals as to how any reduction o f the 42.5%
m ight be used were am en ded to allow football to derive the entire benefit from the m oney thus saved by the
pool companies.

   106. The FA seek to support their argum ent by reference to the structure o f tax on horse racing. They
claim the com parison shows football to be unfairly treated. In horse racing, the duty on off-course betting is
8%; on-course betting is not now taxed. T here is a H orserace Betting Levy which goes to th e im provem ent
an d m aintenance o f race courses. However, the com parison between football pools an d racing is not o f like
with like. The relationship o f stakes to winnings is different. T he Football League presently receives £14
million a year from the PPA for the use o f its fixture list. T here is no p ay m en t sim ilar to this in racing. N o r is
there an equivalent in racing to the Football Trust o r the FGIT. T h e Horserace Betting Levy is essentially
based on voluntary agreem ent and is not regarded by the Treasury as a tax. T here could be no basis for a levy
on football pools unless there were agreement between the PPA an d the Football League.

   107. For these am ongst o th e r reasons, the racing analogy m ay no t ad d weight to the FA’s arg um ent on pool
betting tax. However, a p art from that analogy, the FA subm it there is a strong case for som e reduction o f the
42.5% tax. T he C hester R eport o f 1968 recom m ended the establishm ent o f a football levy. T he Rothschild
Royal Com m ission on G am bling recom m ended in 1977 a reduction in the pool b etting tax from the level at
that tim e o f 40% to 37% to establish a levy board. T he FA an d the FL do not favour the creation o f a football
levy board. They consider that the Football Trust an d the F G IT are ap p ro p riate bodies to receive an d
adm inister any m oney accruing to football were a reduction m ade in the pool betting tax. I can only say that
the case for a m odest reduction in the pool betting tax which convinced the R othschild C om m ission in 1977
is arguably stronger now th at the rate stands at 42.5%. It m ust in general be for com m ercial undertakings to
be self-financing. T his applies throughout the en tertain m en t industry o f which football clubs are a part. T he
football authorities appreciate an d accept that they m ust find the necessary funding substantially from their
own resources. Nevertheless, if grounds all over the country are to be upgraded an d in som e instances
re-located so as to achieve safety for spectators, im provem ent in the quality o f life for residents near grounds


                                                            18
                                                                                                    c




an d a reduction in the expensive police co m m itm en t to controlling m atches, it can be argued there is a case
for financial assistance, if not by direct subsidy then by some tax reduction.

   108. W hether o r not the FA’s argum ent for tax reduction finds favour, there may well be scope for
reassessing an d possibly increasing the contribution m ade by pools to football. It would not m atter w hether
such contribution is to be by voluntary levy, by an increase in the present percentage rate on receipts from the
Spot the Ball C om petition o r by increasing the am o u n t paid for the use o f the fixture list.

  (c) Capital Allowances
   109. C o m p lain t is m a d e th a t no capital allowances can be claim ed against tax in respect o f ground
im provem ents.

   110. W hen asked why they seem ready an d able to spend large sums, som etim es into millions o f pounds,
for a single player in preference to spending m oney on im proving th e ir grounds, the clubs usually give two
reasons.

   111. First, th e a tte n d a n ce an d satisfaction o f their supporters dep ends essentially on success; so buying a
brilliant player has priority over ground im provem ent.

T ransfer Fees
   112. They say th e p o p u la r perception o f transfer fees as excessive and extravagant is m istaken. The
money, I was told again a n d again, simply circulates round the League clubs. It is calculated to bring on
budding players. T he level o f paym ents is high, but it is forced up by prices continental clubs with huge
financial backing (like J u v e n tu s from Fiat) are able to pay.

   113. T h e “circu latio n” a rgum en t runs like this. First division club A buys an ace player for £1 million
from club B. T his enables club B to buy three players at, say, £250,000 each from three o th e r clubs, C, D and
E. Clubs C, D an d E each buy tw o up-and-com ing bu t n ot yet arrived players from lesser clubs for perhaps
£100,000 each. So th e process a n d the prices continue dow nwards eventually enabling the poorer clubs to
keep going by cashing in on players they have trained from scratch. M eanwhile, to finance th eir £1 million
purchase, club A m ay sell two o r three players who are past th e ir best to lower division clubs. T his analysis
may well have som e validity, b u t there are notable exceptions. For example, when a French club bought a
player from an English club for over £4 million the m oney had not been circulating round the League clubs.

A Levy on Transfer Fees?
   114. Even if the “c ircu latio n ” argum ent has some validity, the fact rem ains th at transfer fees have reached
a level w hich m any regard as grotesque an d certainly out o f all prop ortion to the am o u n ts spent on ground
im provem ent. T here is a case for the football authorities im posing a levy on such fees, the proceeds going to
the F G IT to fund g round im provem ents. I suggest consideration be given to this.

Tax “Anomaly”
   115. Secondly (and th is is the tax argum ent) football clubs have a strong fiscal ind ucem ent to spend on
players rather than g ro und im provem ents. Paym ents for players are allowable revenue expenditure.
Im provem ents to the g round are not. In Brown (Inspector o f taxes) v Burnley Football and Athletic Company
Ltd 1983 A ER 244, it was held th at expenditure on a new stand to replace an old unsafe one did not qualify as
an allowable dedu ction w h ether as a repair o r as provision o f plant. It is arguable that a fiscal provision which
penalises the redevelopm ent o f grounds whilst encouraging the paym ent o f huge transfer fees is an anomaly,
that it sends the wrong signals to clubs, and that it encourages them to neglect questions o f safety in favour o f
prom oting success on the field. To accede to this argum ent m ight fall foul o f the m axim th a t hard cases m ake
bad law. But as a m a tte r o f policy, it is argued that the encouragem ent o f expenditure on ground
im provem ents by a fiscal concession may well b ear re-exam ination.

Club Financing
   116. W hatever m ay com e from the Pool Prom oters Association via the two Trusts, o r from any tax
concession, in the end the bulk o f the finances for ground im provem ent m ust be raised by the clubs
themselves. Here, clubs are at a disadvantage com pared with th e ir European counterparts. O n the co ntinent
most grounds are ow ned by local auth orities which lease th em to the clubs. They are regarded as providing a
com m unal facility an d often the stadium is available for a variety o f sports an d o th er functions; sports
facilities a n d offices are b uilt into the stadium complex.


                                                            19
   117. Nevertheless, there are ways o f financing im provem ents if the club m anagem ent is enterprising and
resourceful. Sponsorship is one. Presently it brings £17.5 m illion into football annually. A dvertising on
electric score boards an d on hoardings round the ground as well as on tickets, program m es and m em bership
cards is another. Associated com panies m arketing sports wear a n d o th e r m erchandise with the club’s logo,
the sale o f television rights, the issue o f debentures, an d the sale o f shares to the public are o ther m ethods
which can be an d have been used. In particular, I would expect the football a uth orities to seek the highest
possible price for television rights. U n d e r current contractual arrangem ents, th e Football Association
receives some £6 million pa from the sale o f television rights for dom estic broadcasts, o f which som e £2.5
million is distributed to clubs. They also receive between £0.75 million a n d £1 million for the sale o f
television rights overseas. Separate arrangem ents apply at Wembley. T he Football League contracted some
two years ago to sell the television rights for League m atches for £ 11 m illion, linked to the Retail Price Index.
T he television com panies know that football on the screen has a vast following. T hey should be expected to
pay a substantial price for the rights to relay p o pular m atches. For th e ir part, the football authorities should
ensure that this valuable source o f revenue is directed towards im proving stadia as a high priority.

   118. T he cost o f covered seating throughout the 92 clubs in the Football League has been investigated by
the FA. W hilst the assessm ent can only be a rough estim ate a n d is subject to fluctuations due to inflation and
o ther factors, the consultants suggested th at to install seating th ro u g h o u t all th e grounds m ight cost about £30
million. To provide cover over all those areas could cost a fu rth er £ 100 m illion. It should be noted, however,
that no breakdown o f that figure is given. Moreover, it assum es “all existing uncovered standing capacity
should becom e covered”. G iven current attendances, it would seem unnecessary th at all that capacity should
be covered. In m any instances, attendances are always well below the p e rm itte d capacity o f the ground. In
those cases, a m uch sm aller scale solution involving the rebuilding o r redevelopm ent o f only1part o f the
ground would be sufficient. There would be little po in t in providing covered seating accom m odation
throughout a ground if there is no realistic possibility o f m ore than h a lf o f it being used. Costs may therefore
be less daun ting for the sm aller clubs than the consultants’ estim ates suggest.

Upgraded Stadia or N ew Stadia
   119. At m ajo r grounds where substantial resources can be generated, vast im provem ents can be m ade on
existing sites if there is sufficient space. I have seen a n u m b e r o f im aginative exam ples o f ground
redevelopm ent. It has been achieved at Ibrox Park an d is in the course o f being achieved at O ld Trafford,
W hite H a rt Lane an d H am p d en Park, to give only four examples.

    120. However, I agree with the evidence from the Sports C ouncil as to the need for space to facilitate car
parking, external an d internal circulation and sufficient exits a n d entrances to the spectator areas. They
sa id :-

  “T he location o f m any existing football grounds in central city o r town sites precludes this provision (of
  space) which implies the adoption o f a gradual but progressive policy o f disposing o f grounds in densely
  developed areas an d replacing the facility on the urban periphery. T h e C ouncil believes th at op portunities
  exist for such developm ents on a self-funding basis in m any instances. T his would also provide the
  opportun ity for m ore than one club to be based at newly developed stadia constructed to a high
  specification an d built to m eet new dem and s for safety an d co m fo rt”.

S t Johnstone    ,
   121. I was im pressed by the way this had been d on e at three pa rtic u la r grounds. At St Johnsto ne in
Scotland, the solution has been to involve private capital directly. T h e ASDA su p erm ark et chain bought the
site o f the old St Johnsto ne Football Club in the centre o f Perth, redeveloped it as a superm arket, and built
the club a brand new all-seated stadium for 10,000 spectators on the outskirts o f the town. T he site was, in
effect, do nated by a local farmer. It is close to a m otorway exit an d provides for extensive car parks. I accept
th at this confluence o f factors might not be easy to reproduce elsewhere. In particular, land prices in some
areas would be prohibitive and planning perm ission very difficult to obtain. A greenfield site is likely to be in
a conservation o r green belt area an d the choice o f sites is lim ited by the need to m ake the ground accessible
to townsfolk albeit outside the town.

Utrecht
   122. I saw two exam ples abroad where these problem s had been tackled resolutely. At U trecht an old
stadium on the outskirts o f the town was totally redeveloped on the sam e site ostensibly at nil cost. The
contracting com pany which rebuilt the stadium (Ballast N edam ) is now in consultation with 11 clubs in
England an d Scotland with a view to building sim ilar projects in partnership with the Football Association


                                                            20
an d British Aerospace o f which it is a subsidiary. T h eir concept involves the recognition that in the past, for
all b ut a handful o f days in the year, a stadium complex has usually an d wastefully lain deserted. At U trecht
the stadium is owned by the municipality. T he space underneath the stands and in the corners o f the ground
has been developed to provide accom m odation for com m ercial use. T he rent provides the m unicipality with
sports accom m odation w hich pays for itself. Some 6,000 square m etres o f com m ercial working areas and
24,000 square m etres o f com m ercial offices have been incorporated into the complex. The com m ercial uses
o f this accom m odatio n include office accom m odation, snack bars, sports facilities, photocopying and office
e q u ip m en t services, a driving school an d a hairdresser. T he large parking area is used except on m atch days
as a “park an d ride” facility for those working in the m ore congested areas o f the city. The advantages for
business are that shops an d offices enjoy a prestigious high profile address with all necessary services and
facilities. For the com m unity, the com m ercial stadium serves as an arena both for trade and recreation.
A ppendix 5 is a photograph showing the stad iu m with the com m ercial infill in the corners and out into the
c ar park.

Nimes
   123. The stadium a t N im es in Southern France is also owned by the m unicipality . It was built recently on
the outskirts o f the town w ith extensive parking an d good access to road com m unications. T he cost was some
£17 million o f which £16 m illion cam e from the m unicipality itself. T he justification for this expenditure o f
public funds is the b elief th at the stadium is a com m unal asset. It provides not only a stadium for football or
rugby but an extensive range o f o th e r sports facilities built into the complex. These include a gym nastic hall
capable o f hosting international m atches, an “o m n isp o rt” hall for tennis, basket-ball and volley-ball, a ju d o
hall, facilities for fencing an d billiards, an d a large exhibition hall which, at the tim e o f o u r visit, had ju st
been used for a car sales exhibition.

Local Authority Assistance
   124. All these three stadia are on a com paratively small scale. St Johnstone seats 10,000. U trecht
accom m odates 20,000 a n d N im es a bout 28,000. 1 accept th at in the current financial clim ate an d with o u r
different ap proach to c o m m u n al funding, local authorities are unlikely to be able to provide subsidies for
such stadia, although local a u th o ritie s do subsidize, for example, sw im m ing baths, theatres an d o th er leisure
facilities which may serve fewer o f th e ir citizens. However, clubs which wish to move from centre town sites
to new sites on the outskirts o f town may well be able to find a purchaser as St Johnstone did with ASDA.
Likewise, those who wish e ith e r to build a new stadium on the outskirts o r to redevelop their stadium in town
may be able to do so in a way which incorporates space for com m ercial lettings.

    125. In such situations, although the local au tho rity may be unable to assist with finance, it could play a
useful role in bringing parties together an d as planning authority. It could take a favourable view, for
example, o f a planning ap plication which involved the provision not only o f a com m unal sports stadium but
o f further facilities, w hether for sport or otherwise, benefitting the co m m u nity as a whole. There has recently
been a n um b er o f a tte m p ts by clubs to find greenfield sites for new grounds only to be turned down at each
a tte m p t on planning grounds. Clearly, an application for a football ground in a conservation area or green
belt poses planning problem s. But, although the protection o f such areas is an im po rtan t principle, two other
considerations m ay also carry weight. First, that the quality o f life o f residents living adjacent to a football
ground in a town w ould be m uch im proved by resiting it elsewhere. Secondly, th at if we w ant safety and
im proved standards at ground s there are som e clubs which will need a new site at which to achieve them . To
this end, local auth o rities should surely give what assistance they properly can. O ne useful exam ple o f the
m u tual assistance which a club an d a local authority can give each o th er is an agreement m ade between
Millwall a n d the London Borough o f Lewisham. T he latter agreed to pay £70,000 a year to the club which for
its part agreed inter alia to m ake the ground available for various activities beneficial to the local com m unity.

Ground Sharing
    126. W hether or not incom e-earning facilities are incorporated into a sports ground, it seems uneconom ic
th at the stadium itself should be used by only one club, in effect once a fortnight. The cost to each club both
o f upgrading o r building a stad iu m an d o f m aintaining it could be halved if sensible sharing arrangem ents
could be m ade. But there is resistance to this. A n um b er o f cities have two clubs, each with its own ground.
Such is local rivalry th at the idea o f ground sharing seems a n a th e m a to many. Yet. faced with the expense o f
seating and ground im prov em ent, it would m ake financial sense. O pposition to sharing an entirely new
ground may be marginally less than to one club sharing a n o th e r’s existing ground. Recently M r Peter
Robinson, C hief Executive o f Liverpool FC, was quoted as saying:

   “ If som eone were to b uild a high-quality stadium on Merseyside, we an d Everton would be quite happy to
   share it - even though the idea m ight not appeal to the fans at first”.


                                                           21
  If two clubs could sell their inner city grounds with planning perm ission, the resultant capital would go a
long way to building a m odern shared stadium on a m ore suitable site.

  127. It works abroad. AC Milan and Inter M ilan share the San Siro stadium . In Turin, Juventus and
Torino also share. G enova and Sam pdoria provide a th ird example.

  128. As long ago as 1981, in the Sports C ouncil's H andbo ok o f Sports an d Recreational Building Design,
Volume T hree (O u tdoo r Sports), ground-sharing was considered in a technical study o f stadia. T he author,
M r Faulkner Brown, wrote at page 2 4 :-

  “Several courses would appear to be open to football clubs. O ne is that they m ight rationalise their position
  and, wherever possible, jointly use a single stadium . This could happen at Sheffield, N o ttin gham and
  Bristol. Fulham could move in with Chelsea and Brentford with Q ueen’s Park Rangers. Inter-M ilan and
  AC Milan, for all their deep rivalry, d o live happily enough together in the giant San Siro stadium . The
  British clubs could all retain their identity, halve their overheads an d realise handsom ely the value o f their
  freehold properties, if they could cope with their fiercely held views o f club individuality an d club pride.

    A nother alternative would be, where possible, for clubs to offer unused land adjacen t to the stadiu m for
  developm ent and, in realising the assets from the land, to plough them back into the cost o f stadium
  reconstruction. This, o f course, has happened at L ord’s an d is having som e noticeable effects at the Oval
  an d in oth er county cricket grounds.

    A further alternative is to build additional sports facilities alongside the stad ium , not necessarily in
  em ulation o f the ancient Greek example (but nevertheless there is a parallel), so th a t a large n u m b e r o f
  sports clubs could use all the facilities. This schem e has been developed to som e extent b o th in th e U nited
  States and on the continent. ”

Super-Stadia
  129. So far, I have referred only to club grounds. But there is a case for having a small nu m b er o f
super-stadia capable o f accom m odating very large crowds for international m atches o r m ajo r C up ties. At
present, the only such stadium in the U K is Wembley which will accom m odate 80,000 all-seated. Like
Wembley, any o ther stadia o f large capacity could be available not only for football b u t for o th er sports, for
pop concerts an d o th er large events.

   130. A consortium com prising British Aerospace, the FA an d Ballast N ed am (w ho built the U trecht
stadium ) is presently considering the building o f a new national stadium at B irm ingham to accom m odate
100,000. T here is a suggestion that this project, if carried through, would provide a replacem ent for
Wembley. However, it may well be that there is room for both. T his would give a venue in London and a
venue in the M idlands for m ajor events. H am p d en Park has served as S cotland’s international football
ground for m any years and when planned im provem ents are com plete it should con tinue to do so. It is
arguable that one m ore large stadium m ay be required in the north o f England bu t the upgrading o f a ground
such as Old Trafford m ight well suffice to achieve this purpose.

Leadership and Exam ple
   131. I turn from stadia an d money to one aspect o f football which gives wide scope for im provem ent at
very little cost. M uch is written about the m isbehaviour o f spectators; bu t m isb ehaviour is often imitative.
Hooligans in the crowd find others who will copy them . Similarly, in citem ent from the pitch o r bad
behaviour by players has a malign influence on the crowd. For m any fervent followers, the m en on the pitch
are heroes to be revered and em ulated. After a goal, when the scorer dem on strates to the fans behind the
fencing, the resultant surge forward and hysteria is bad for safety an d bad for crowd control. It should not
occur. Worse still, when players fight, the fans follow suit. Lest anyone d o u b t this, th e recent exam ples o f
fighting between players bear it out. In two o f the four incidents in N ovem ber 1989, crowd m isbehaviour
resulted directly from fighting between players. At Highbury, fans cam e o ut on to the pitch to jo in in. At
U pton Park, scuffles between W im bledon and West H am players provoked surging, fighting an d coin
throwing on the terraces.

   132. It is in the first instance up to the players themselves, then the referees, the m anagers a n d the club
directors to stop both incitem ent and violence by players w hether on or o ff the ball. T he referees, m anagers
and directors have power to do this. If and when they fail to use it, the FA m ust take a firm disciplinary line
using their very full powers to fine those involved including the clubs an d to penalise the clubs in points. If all
else fails, there is no reason why violence on the pitch should have any im m unity from the law o f the land or
from police action.


                                                         22
   133. O n the positive side, m anagem ent could do m uch to create a b etter atm osphere in the grounds by
w hat they say an d w hat they w rite in program m es and magazines. By consulting with supporters they could
enlist the goodwill an d help o f the decent m ajority to isolate and reb u ff m isbehaviour from the m inority
rath er than im itate it. A cam paign for b etter behaviour could be launched by the clubs through their
literature an d backed by m anagers an d players using their popular hero appeal.

    134. 1 should ad d th a t violence on the pitch is not confined to soccer. T here has been a growing incidence
o f stam pings and punchings in Rugby U n io n games even at the highest level. Reaction from referees, clubs
and even international selectors has tended to play such incidents down. Although spectator behaviour has
not, as yet, been adversely affected by such incidents, the authorities ought to deal firmly with them before
that happens an d in any event, sim ply because violence should be p ut down.

Family and M em bership Areas
    135. M uch progress has been m a d e at a n u m b e r o f clubs recently in bringing women and children back to
w atching football by creating separate family areas. Similarly, partial m em bership schemes have enabled
clubs to reserve parts o f th e g rou nd exclusively to mem bers. This has had the dual advantage o f creating areas
o f reliable good b ehaviour a n d offering discounts, favourable travel facilities an d other benefits to mem bers.
T he good b ehaviour depen ds on those who pay for m em bership being m ore likely to be responsible an d upon
their risking loss o f m em b ersh ip if they transgress.

   136. At a n u m b er o f grounds, family areas have been de-segregated in the sense that families draw n from
away supporters have been p e rm itted to share family areas with ho m e supporters. I have already indicated
how segregation has ten d ed to worsen hostility between rival fans. It is difficult once segregation has been
practised to dispense with it, certainly at a stroke. These jo in t family areas may prove to be the first step in a
retreat from segregation. I f th e process can be extended gradually to allowing m em bers o f the visiting club to
share the m em bership area o f th e hom e club, useful progress will have been m ade. It will be m ade easier if
there is seating rath er than standing.

T he Disabled
    137. I received evidence from the Royal Association for D isability an d R ehabilitation (RAD AR) an d the
Access C om m ittee for E ngland draw ing attention to the o ppo rtu n ity which redevelopm ent o f grounds
presents to m ake better provision for disabled people. M any clubs already m ake provision for the disabled
b u t this is by no m eans universal. P articu lar attention is needed to the provision o f safe and adequately
spacious viewing areas for w heelchair users, with a seat alongside for a com panio n, protected from the
weather, accessible to toilet facilities designed specifically for the disabled, an d easily reached from a car park
(with reserved car spaces for Orange Badge holders) by m eans o f ram ps. T he needs o f other disabled people -
those who have difficulty walking, the partially sighted, an d those w ith im paired hearing - require special
attention, for exam ple by the provision o f handrails, clear signposts, steps painted in bright colours, an d the
use o f electronic scoreboards to supplem ent loudspeaker a nnoun cem ents, if these people are to be able to
atten d sporting events enjoyably a n d safely. I endorse the im p ortan ce attached to these suggestions an d I
hope that the com prehensive im provem ents which I am proposing will include careful attention to them.
Clubs should regard them as integral to their planning, not as an optional extra.

Conclusion
  138. I hope in these two chapters I have m ade it clear th at the years o f patching up grounds, o f having
periodic disasters an d narrowly avoiding m any others by m uddling through on a wing an d a prayer m ust be
over. A totally new approach across the whole field o f football requires higher standards both in bricks and
m o rtar and in h um an relationships.

                             PART V - FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
All-Seated Accommodation
  1. T he Secretary of State should ensure th a t spectators are admitted only to seated accommodation at
m atches played at sports grounds designated under th e Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in accordance with
the timing set out in Recommendations 2 to 4 below.

  2. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from th e start of the 1993/4 season at high-risk matches as
defined under th e U EFA Regulations set out in paragraph 82 above.

  3. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 above should apply with effect from the start of
the 1994/5 season to all matches a t grounds in the first and second divisions of the Football League, the
Prem ier Division of the Scottish Football League, and at national stadia, subject to a reasonable extension of
time in the case of a club promoted to the second division of the Football League o r the Prem ier Division of the
Scottish Football League. Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 20% of the
present standing capacity (such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8
below), the first 20% deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to elim inate standing by August 1994.

  4. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 should apply with' effect from the start of the
1999/2000 season to all matches at all other grounds designated under the Safety of S ports G rounds Act 1975.
Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 10% of th e present standing capacity
(such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8 below), the first 10%
deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to elim inate standing by August 1999.

Advisory Design Council
  5. T h e Football Association and the Football League should establish an Advisory Design Council whose
functions should be:

    (a) to conduct and m arshal research into the improvement and design of football stadia;

    (b) to dissem inate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in th is field to members of the
        Football League and, on request, to other football and sports clubs in England, W ales and Scotland.

National Inspectorate and Review Body
  6. (a) I f P a rt I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and powers therein specified (power to review the
discharge of functions by local authorities). If P a rt I of th e Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
other arrangem ents should be made for the discharge of th e functions and powers in section 13 of the Act by the
appointm ent of a body to exercise them.

      (b)       In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
should also be entrusted with sim ilar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local authorities of their
certifying and licensing functions in relation to other sports grounds and sports entertainm ents pursuant to the
Safety of S ports G rounds Act 1975 and P a rts III and IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
  7. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
should specify the maximum number of spectators to be adm itted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notw ithstanding th a t it has a gate or gates affording access to
another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

   8. E ach figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with C h ap ter 16 of the G reen Guide
 (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

     (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraph s 221 and 222 of the Green Guide (when the terrace
         or viewing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;


                                                         76
    (b) the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope materially
        deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
        packed) should be 0 not 27;

    (c) in arriving at “the G reen Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density including those specified in paragraphs 220 to 224
        inclusive of the Green Guide.

  9. A rrangem ents should be m ade:-

    (a) to lim it the num ber of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangem ent, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.

  10. T he maximum notional rate a t which spectators can pass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 750 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide. T he maximum rate for any particular
turnstile must take full account of all circum stances including those given as examples in paragraph 47.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
   11. T here should be a written statem ent o f intent, agreed between the club and the police, setting out their
respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling of each self-contained pen or
other standing area and the m onitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the document in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

  12. (a) At each match, th ere should be on the perim eter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring th a t area) or a police officer (if the police are
monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in th a t area for possible overcrowding or distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
other steward or police presence. H e should have ready access to a police officer who can authorise access
through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.

      (b)       T his Recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where the
spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not exceed one third of the area’s
maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.


Gangways
   13. Gangways should be kept clear, in accordance with paragraphs 97 to 99 of the Green Guide. Gangways
should be painted in a conspicuous colour w hether they are sunk or not. T he Safety Certificate should require
th a t no standing is allowed in gangways and th a t they be painted.


Fences and Gates
   14. All spikes, or sim ilar constructions on perim eter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.

  15. Perim eter fencing should be no higher th a n 2.2 metres, measured from the top of the fence to the lowest
point at which spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations forming part of the perimeter
boundary.

  16. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those with
duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
dem onstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd densities.

   17. T here must be provided in any perim eter fence of a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates of a
 minimum width of 1.1 metres to enable th a t pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for
 an emergency evacuation of th a t pen or area.


                                                          77
   18. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest of the fence and m arked “ Emergency E xit”.

   19. W here there is a perimeter fence in front of a pen or enclosure, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully
open during the period when spectators are in th e pen or enclosure, wherever those in command feel th a t this
can safely be done. W hether they be fully open, partially open or closed, they should be kept unlocked
throughout th e period when the pen or enclosure is occupied.

   20. Each gate in a perimeter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or enclosure should be m anned by
a steward or by a police officer w hen the pen or enclosure is occupied. W hether such m anning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be decided by the Police Commander. In either event, the Police
C om m ander should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to the
pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

  21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club a t each ground where there are
perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release num bers of spectators if
necessary. Agreement should be reached as to w hether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision of a
nominated senior police officer a t the ground.


Crush Barriers
   22. All crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23. T he layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately (if this h a s not
already been done following the Interim Report) to ensure th at it complies with the criteria contained in
C hapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessm ent of the maximum capacity figure for th a t pen or
terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 8 above, should reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
   24. T he Secretary of State should exercise his pow ers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) of the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 so as to m ake m andatory in Safety Certificates those conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act. So far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “ sh all” should be
substituted for “ may” .

  25. In assessing these mandatory requirem ents in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. O nce th a t is done, the resultant figures and term s for th at ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be perm itted other than by
formal revision.

  26. W here a local authority incorporates any provision of the G reen Guide into th e Safety Certificate, other
than one within the scope of Recommendation 25 above, it should m ake clear w hether th a t provision is to be
complied with absolutely or with discretionary flexibility.

   27. T here should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if th is h a s not already been done
following the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority, which should consult the club in respect of
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.
Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its object should be to ensure th a t the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a
m atter of urgency following the findings and Recommendations in this Report.

   28. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
 w hich no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

   29. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority a t least once annually and each
 Certificate should require to be renewed annually.

   30. Each local authority should review its arrangem ents for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
 am ending and renewing Safety Certificates (if th is has not already been done following the Interim


                                                          78
Report). Such review should require th a t there exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by senior officers and
elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local authority’s rules.

   31. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) consisting of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire
and am bulance services and of the building authority. T he Advisory Group should consult representatives of the
club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation on a regular basis. T he Advisory Group’s term s of reference
should encompass all m atters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance a t m atches. T he Advisory G roup should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.


Duties of Each Football Club
  32. E ach turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured (if this has not already been
done following the Interim Report). Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure th a t each turnstile
rem ains capable of adm itting spectators a t the rate anticipated.

   33. T h e correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such as
to ensure th a t all the spectators intended to be adm itted to th a t viewing area can pass through the turnstiles
within one hour. If th a t cannot be done, the capacity of th a t viewing area should be reduced accordingly. Since
this Recommendation includes term s and conditions within the scope of the original section 2(2)(c)(i) of the
Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 it should be given effect in the Safety Certificate (see Recommendation 24
above).

  34. Turnstiles should be closed when th e perm itted capacity of the area served by them is about to be reached
and arrangem ents should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile operators for this
purpose.

  35. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before, throughout and a t the end of a
match.

  36. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively reviewed (if
this h as not already been done following the Interim Report). It should, in relation to the arrangem ents for each
m atch, be unambiguous, eye-catching, sim ple and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of
spectators to th eir appropriate viewing areas. Any redundant signs should be removed.

  37. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with the
information provided in respect of each m atch both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs should
contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

   38. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed (if
this h a s not already been done following the Interim Report) by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure
th a t it corresponds with the planned arrangem ents for adm itting spectators to the ground.

  39. Clubs should consider m aintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of the match, for
season tickets and tickets for all-ticket m atches for seated areas, containing the names and addresses of those
purchasing tickets.

  40. All-ticket m atches should be confined to those a t which a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected.
W hen a match ha s been designated all-ticket, clubs should not sell tickets a t the m atch and should take steps to
advise the spectators of both clubs accordingly.

  41. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
entertainm ent aim ed a t attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

    42. Clubs should recruit and retain sufficient competent stewards. They should be fit, active and robust, and
 preferably between the ages of 18 and 55. Clubs should ensure that stewards are fully trained, aware of their
 duties under Annex B of the G reen Guide and under the statem ent of intent (see Recommendation 11) and able
 to perform them.


                                                           79
  43. T he club should provide a police control room which is:—

    (a) well placed, so as to command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator area surrounding it;

    (b) of sufficient size for the commander, his deputy and enough officers to operate the radios, telephones
        and CCTV screens. T here should be space for others who may need from time to time to visit the room
        eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services;

    (c) well equipped with CCTV, radio and telephone facilities and, where necessary, sound-proofed against
        excessive crowd noise.

  It should be the duty of the club to provide a room and equipment to the satisfaction of the chief officer
nominated under Recommendation 44 below.


Police Planning
  44. T he Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated sports ground or more
should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the m anagem ent of each football club and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

  45. T he O perational O rder for each match a t a designated sports ground, and the pre-m atch briefing of all
officers on duty there, should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is
detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

  46. T he Operational O rder for each m atch a t a designated sports ground should enable the police to cope
with any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators a t a m atch and in their departure. It should provide for
sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made a t any point inside or outside the ground.

  47. Police planning should provide th a t ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter a designated sports
ground except in an emergency.

 48. A rrest procedures inside and outside designated sports grounds should be reviewed so as to keep to the
minimum the period during which an arresting officer is away from his post.

  49. T h e option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command a t the ground.
Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

  50. Consideration in consultation with the club should be given, especially for high-risk m atches, to the
possibility of an early kick-off or a Sunday fixture.

  51. T here should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television monitoring
outside a nd inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles
or of num bers adm itted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the
interpretation and use of these data.

   52. Consideration should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
strategy of policing football matches.

  53. Police authorities should review the charges they m ake to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
as to ensure that realistic charges are made. T h e H om e Office should take steps to ensure consistency of
practice, subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.


Communications
  54.     T here should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transm issions to be
received, evaluated and answered. T he radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the sam e channel. Additional channels should be used,
where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of th e airwaves.


                                                         80
  55. T here should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate
with his senior officers round the ground.

   56. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points a t the ground.

  57. W ithin the control room, th ere should be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside th e ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Im portant announcements should
be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This
arrangem ent should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.

  58. U se should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   59. T he police, fire and am bulance services should m aintain through senior nominated officers regular
liaison concerning crowd safety a t each designated sports ground.

  60. Before each m atch a t a designated sports ground the police should ensure th a t the fire service and
am bulance Service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of spectators
expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the
control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control rooms of each of the
emergency services.

  61. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control room to the local
headquarters of all emergency services should be m aintained at all times so th a t emergency calls can be made
instantly.

  62. Contingency plans for the arrival a t each designated sports ground of emergency vehicles from all three
services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility within
the ground itself.

  63. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for the
arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why they are
required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
   64. T here should be a t each sports ground a t each m atch a t least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
T he club should have th e responsibility for securing such attendance.

  65. T h ere should be a t each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. T he number of such rooms
and the equipment to be m aintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.

   66. (a) At every match where the num ber of spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency a t the ground. H e should be
trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be present a t the ground a t least an hour before kick-off
and should remain until h alf an hour after the end of the match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in
the police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

        (b)        At any match where the number of spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
arrangem ents to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
a t the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. T he arrangem ents made should be
known to those in the police control room.

  67. At least one fully equipped am bulance from or approved by the appropriate ambulance authority should
be in attendance a t all m atches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

  68. T he num ber of am bulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a requirement
of the Safety Certificate.


                                                          81
  69. A “ major incident equipment vehicle”, designed and equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties, should be
deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance a t a match where a crowd in excess of 25,000 is expected.


Offences and Penalties
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence of selling tickets for and on the day of a football
match without authority from the home club to do so.

  71. Each of the following activities a t a designated sports ground should be made a specific offence:-

    i.    throwing a missile;

    ii.   chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.

  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courts’ powers to m ake attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football m atches. T he provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum of 72 hours in the case of an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentencing of offenders
convicted of football related offences.


Green Guide
  74. As a m atter of urgency, the Hom e Office should set up a body to revise th e Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report of the Technical W orking P a rty (Appendix 3).

  75. In any revision of the G reen Guide, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various m aterials should be
specified.

  76. W hen the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.




                                                         82

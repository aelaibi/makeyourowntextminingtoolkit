              RIMMER v C H IE F CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE AND OTHERS


              We discussed this case y este rd a y , when 1 told you th a t Steyn 3 had sought the
              assistan c e of an am icus in an application to approve a form of tr u s t deed tor
              the re c e ip t of d am ages payable to infan ts following the d isaste r a t Hillsboroug
              Stadium.


               The A ttorney G eneral has agreed to the nom ination of Mr Riddle, but you will
               see t h a t the pro cedu re followed was hardly orthodox. Steyn 3, it s e e m s ,'
                he Leader of the N orthern C irc u it, ra th e r than th e A tto rn e y G en eral, to
               appoint 3unior Chancery Counsel.           Mr Riddle is his nomination, bu t I have
               established with the A ttorn ey t h a t he is c o n te n t for this to go ahead. He has
               asked t h a t the 3udge should be notified of the proper pro ced ure in fu tu re . I will
               see to the w riting of th a t le t t e r .
                                                                                    !

                Mav , leave it to you to see to th e instru cting of Mr Riddle. You will see from
                Th7 f i n a r p a r a Eraph of Miss S te e l's l e tte r t h a t she has o ffe re d to supply Mr
                Riddle d ire ctly with copies of docum en ts.                  Although, form ally, in stru ctio ns
                Should com e f?om the Treasury Solicitor, it may be th a t Miss S te e l's o ffer of
                help might be useful. t

      Dear Sir

      RE GARY PHILIP JONES

      I refer to the above-named and your request for provision of copies of two
      photographs to which reference was made at the Inquest on 23 April 1990.

      In view of the current criminal investigation taking place under the guidance
      of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the supervision of the Police
      Complaints Authority, I am not at liberty to release any material at this
      stage.

      If this situation changes I will inform you accordingly.       I trust you
      understand the current position.

      Yours faithfully




      S Beechey
      Detective Superintendent

                       Dear Sir                       /s/

                       R E : Gary             Philip Jones - Hillsborough Disaster

                       At the inquest which was held in the above case on the 23 April
                       1990, reference was made at the inquest to a number of photographs
                       The family have asked me to enquire whether copies of the 2
                       photographs to which references were made, namely photographs
                       numbered "PR3-29A" and "NGN-55" could be provided.

                       I have recently written to Doctor S L Popper at the Medico-Legal
                       Centre who informs me that the photographs are held by yourselves.
                       I should be obliged if you could note our interest for the time
                       when they are released.

                       I look forward to hearing from you.

                       Yours faithfully

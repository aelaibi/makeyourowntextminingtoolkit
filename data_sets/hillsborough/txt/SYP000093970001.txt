              It was a £6 standing             ticket       for Le^ pi ng s Lane.

              I travelled        to the game by car with

             were     not delayed.

              We    parked on a side          street       in S h e ff ie ld about a mile from             the ground,

              It was about        11.30     (1130)     ~    1200 hrs      (1200).

              Whe n we ar riv ed we all went                for a drink         in a pub near         the ground.

              We    left the     pub about      14.15       hours      (1415)     and made our        way to the

          Going    through the               tunnel   there was a                 of   people going     through but

          it was not too bad until                     coming out of the tunnel               it was full.             X

          tried to get            past a couple          of    people and once            passed them       I could not

          move any further.                   I was being          crushed as more         people    came    in behind

          me.     I had been s e p ara te d from the other                        two as soon as       I was       in the

          ground.          I did not see them aga in until                     I was     on the     pitch    later         on.

          I was    continuallyH^ing                   crushed and m ov ed about             the    pen gr adually

          people on the            pitch at this time.

          I found                      and               and we then went              towards the stand           looking

          for              and                    We found                  but               nad gone       to    look for

                and   people were being helped out.                    I went   over and h e V ^ d    pull    out a

                only then that          I realised         people had died.        While    I was   in the    pen I

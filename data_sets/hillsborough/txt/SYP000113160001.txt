     them to be opened.              I can only say that                 if they nad not           been opened

     when    they were       serious and           probable      fatal      '.injuries w ould         have been

     caused.

     There were-? roars         from the         crowd     inside,       possibly        k ick— oft    or football

behaviour         of the       crowd and the          pressure       build up.

S t a r t e d to walk         back    towards     the    t e l e v i s i o n vehicles        as the        problem

had      cleared and we          intended to activate                phase 2.

I heard Serge a n t G o d d a r d ’s voice               come      over   the    radio a l t h o u g h

reception was            none    too     clear there was an anxious                    tone       to     his    voice,

'!A 11    o f f icgrs    on to       pe r ime te r t rack " » (r e p e a t e d )

I shouted to the               serial      (6) and we all           ran towards            the    entrance              near

to turnstiles            19 to 22 at the             rear    of control         point.           We    entered           the

   r ime t e r t ra c k v ia t h e f r o nt a r e a o f t h e So u t h S t a n d .                    P e o p 1e in t he

   uth Stand were              stood up and shouting abuse                   towards         the West Stand

area,        it looked         like a pitch          invasion from the West S t a n d terraces.

There were         'no players         on the field.            Numerous        police       officers           near

and around the            perimeter          fencing and g o a lmouth area.                      Fans were

spilling         onto    the    field,       climbing       fencing,      etc.        My immediate              thought

was      that    it was a pitch            invasion and nothing more.

With      the officers          I made my way to the                p^^fle^^^^fe^c^ng,                    I made my

way to the         fencing       towards       the    left hand side            of G a t e w a y No.           3.        This

gate was         open and       police       officers       were    trying      to    clear       the g ateway of

fallen       people.      ■

To my horror            I then saw the           reality of what was                 taking       place.

T h e first 4 o r 3 ro w s of s u ppo r t e r s w h o ha d be e n s t o o d behind t h i s

section         of fencing       had all       been     crushed t ogethe r up to the fencing.

Several         were    o b v iously     dead and others a p p e a r e d             to be dying.

There was         one elderly man;, greying                  hair?



                                                                   He was    o b viously dead.                  Others

a r o u n d him were          turning      blue/pur pie as they, were                 suffocating.                  A

young girl         probably          15 or    16 years was          struggling         to keep alive.                     She

was unable         to speak, and           I suspect        fading    fast.          The    gateway was                 open
                                                                                                                         PAG Ei        6
                                                                                                                         R24b

                  and officers were            trying    to remove what           I realise        now were       bodies

                  from the      gateway,,       The    bodies were        ent a n g l e d with other           bodies which

                  were alive.          Supporters       from the        back were      climbing         over    bodies    to

                  get    out,   thereby       hindering    the     rescue a t t empts        by the       officers

                  c o nc erned.
Ob   c
                  The    crowds were         still    pushing    forward and         chanting at the             police.

                  I joined the         officers       stood on the wall           and shouted at the               crowd to

                  s t o p pus h in g .    Sho ut s of abuse we r e t he o n 1y r e p 1y .

                  Officers      were     trying      to make    their way through the               section of         crowds

                  to the    left,        compound 2, and        climb over        the adjoining           fence.       They
         /^VvV'
                  were    being    pushed and jostled by the                 crowd as they did so.

                  Other    supporters         were    climbing    over      the   dead and        injured at the           front

                  t o e s ca pe o v e r t he f e n c i n g „    T he    c r o wd a t t he   rear    o f t h i s section

                  and the West Sitand area              did not        seem to    realise what was              happening at

                  the front.          They    continued to shout abuse at the                     police.

                  I was    unaware        if control     had realised the            seriousness          of the

                  situation.          It was    impossible       to hear       radio    t r a n smissions        if in fact

                  they were       being made.

                  I jumped      down from the          fencing and         ran towards       the    go a l m o u t h area      in

                  the hope      tht      I could     contact    control      and ensure          that    other     services

                  were attending,.            We urgently       required       cutting      equipment,          bullhorns         or

                  the    pub 1 i c address      system to       I et the      c r owd know what was             hap p e n i ng ,

                  etc.,    and for officers            to be deputed to att e n d from the                     rear   tunnel,

                  that    being    the mai n entrance           to areas 3 and 4.

                  It was may h e m and         there was       no way that a message               could be        passed

                  from my       position.       I ran towards            the South Stand where             I saw

                  Superintendent           Greenwood     near          to the touchline          facing    the S outh Stand

                  and the       control      box.     I shouted to him that             there were         fatal ities and

                  we needed a s s i s t a n c e      quickly.           I did not wait       for an answer and ran

                  back to the fencing area near                        to gateway No.       3.
                                                                                                           pagee :
                                                                                                           R243

By     this       time    several officer's had            climbed      the fencing and were

 hanging          over    the    top trying      to pull       people    up from the         other     side       of

 uhe fence.              io some      extent    this was       being    successful.           £>ome were

being e x t racted             from the gateway.           By now a number            of severely

 injured          were    laid on the         playing area       to the       left   of the       goalmouth.

P olice       officers and supporters alike were                        giving what a s s i s t a n c e         they

could,

1 ran towards             the    gateway and as           1 did so a y outh was             pulled from the

gateway.           Assisted        by some s u pporters          I carried the y outh aged about

1? years          to the       playing area,        his   breathing was            shallow but he was

alive,        I therefore          placed him       in the      corna position and as              I started

to get up          I saw Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t      Nesbit        to     go    past      me         and go

t o w a rd s t h e gat e way N o . 3.

.1 followed him and saw that                     the    gateway was          still   blocked.        Chief

Superintendent             Nesbit       had told the           officers to           clear    the gateway of

bod i e s as be s t t hey             c o u 1 d but t hey we r e be i ng hampe r e d         by two bo di e s

in particular,             one of which was             laid face       down his      head and upper

body      being     ent a n g l e d with the other             bodies    in the doorway,            his    legs

and     lower      body being          on the    perimeter       track,

1 intended          to attempt          to    remove    this    body when the         body of a male

4U     to 4 5 years,           well    built,    salt and       pepper       hair,   was   passed through

the gateway.              S e r geant 8 4 Q Wright        and myself          carried this man on to

the grassed area.                  I cleared the man's            throat and S e r geant Wright

commenced heart                massage,      whilst     I commenced mouth to mouth

resuscitation.                 After a couple          of minutes       we    realised that        this was a

pointless          exercise        the man was         dead and    I covered his           upper     body with

Sgt.     Gutcher,          Serial       Crime     Squad,      who       was    in s id e     the     compound.          By

this     time       a number       of    officers        had m a d e      their       way     into     the       enclosure

and were        either          moving      b o dies,    assisting            others       over      the    fences,      or

giving      mouth       to m o u t h      resuscitation.                Two    officers         in    particular         come

to mind,        although          there       were    many    others          whose    names         I do       not   know.

Sgt    Gutcher        and Constable             Humphries          of    *C'    Division.             Their       actions

were     praiseworthy             to    say    the    least.

1 then assist ed                several       other     officers         with    the       removal         of    casualties

from    the     area       of a r o u n d     gateway       No.    3.     With Chief           Sup t .      Nesbit,

.Sergeant       Horton,          HQ Serio us         Crime    Squad       and    other        oficers,          we m a d e    a

chain and           cont :i.~nTred to pass           injured and dead              people          from the

compound.            It is       proper       to say at this             time    that the m a j o r i t y of thee

people were           in fact          dead by now.

As the number              of    bodies       inside    the       compound       dwindled,            I assisted

po I i. ce officer s and               suppo r t e rs to      car ry t he dead away                  on m a k e s h i f t

t rack of the          g ro u n d .

The    bodies were              carried to the          g yinna s iurn where           they had to be taken

from the        stretcher          in order          to get       them through the                 door.        The   bodies

were    then either              left w ith one of the officers who                            had a s s i s t e d      in

con t i n u 11y p ur poses.

I a s s isted with the                 removal       of 3    or 4 such          bodies but           I am unable         to

As    I. was about          to    leave       the gym n a s i u m on the           last such venture,

somebody        I. am unable            to say who,          a sked      if a check could be made

and saw one more              body outside.           It was      laid on the        floor     between the

prison van and          the     gymnasium wall.               It had been       partially         covered

with a green blanket.                  Together with f ^ ^ O ^ J a k s o n             I carried this

No.    3.     I saw that        the     wire   fencing had been bent away                  from     the frame

at one       corner.     This     I     under s t o o d had been done by police                officers       in

tragedy.        The    cross member         had snapped near             to the      neck    of the

securing       stand and        then the whole           stand had been            pushed forward,           no

doubt       by the    pressure        exerted by the           supportrs      at    some    stage.

Chief Supt.          Nesbit     had alre a d y       positioned        officers      to    preserve     the

immediate       scene    for     evidential          purposes.

I looked around           the    scene at some                of the   officers       and saw that some

were    overcome w ith          emotion and others were                 physically exhausted.

All,    I feel       sure,    were      numb with the           scenes    they had witneses.

It was at this          time     that    I noticed        that my shirt,            had vomit and blood

        frightening         I have     ever     seen.      O f f icers at that               locality are       to be

        immediate area,           resulting        in deaths.            It is a miracle              that    nobody was

END OF REPORT
Trevor Harvey

I am an Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police presently seconded to
the Discipline and Complaints Department, Force Headquarters.

Prior to this appointment (30.1.89) I was an operational Inspector at
'F' Division stationed at Hammerton Road. I have at least 4 years
experience of uniformed supervisory duties at Hillsborough Football Ground
and several years experience of working in criminal investigation duties
at this venue.

I have assisted in the last three cup semi-final football matches to be
played at Hillsborough. My main uniform supervisory duties at this venue
have been the supervision of serials 1 to 3 (perimeter track and car park
areas) and more lately Crime and Vandal Commander duties, being deployed
where and when required.  (The majority of these requirements have been
at the Leppings Lane area of the ground on coach reception, etc.

I have also supervised serials having responsibilities for all sections
of the ground including the West Stand area but this has been on a lesser
footing than the other areas mentioned.

At 9.45am, 15 April 1989, I reported for duty at the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Ground Semi-final - Liverpool v Nottingham Forest. My call sign
was India 2, in charge of serials 4 - 6 . My overall sector commander
was Superintendent Greenwood, his deputy was Chief Inspector Beal.

Briefing was held in the South Stand, given by Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield - incident commander.

Serials 4 - 6 overall coverage of roadway from Penistone Road - rear South
Stands to Lepping Lane turnstiles (barriers).

Serial Sergeants:   4 PS266 Jacques (E)     +10
                    5 PS1084 Hodgett (E)   +10
                    6 PS729 Norburn (E)    +10

All experienced officers in football duties.   No problems foreseen.

Serial 4        Penistone Road area, safety of persons,
                vehicles, etc. Run South Stand
                supervision of turnstiles etc.

Serial 5        Supervision turnstiles and security of
                TV vehicles etc.

Serial 6        Erection of barriers near to 'C' gate
                Leppings Lane end. Security of South
                Stand Car Parks etc.

11.20   All serials, 4, 5 &. 6 at their respective details.
        No problems, spectators light good humoured. Mainly
        Nottingham Forest supporters except near players' entrance
        of both.
        Both teams arrived - no problems.      Fans well behaved.

Approx 2.30

        Apparent radio fault - buzzing when control pass message -
        similar to radio battery fault. Enter ground by Players' entrance
        and tunnel speak to officers there - fault on radio system - Saw
        Chief Inspector Beal who apparently had civilian radio engineer
        with him on way to control box.

        and Terracing              )

        Liverpool players on field, pre-match kick around.

        Whilst speaking to other officers near to players' tunnel,
        approached by Doug LOCK (ex-Police Superintendent FI) now
        head of security at ground.

        Looked very worried, made mention of large crowds at Leppings
        Lane end of ground.

        It looked as if they were trying to push their way in. Some had
        already got in through a gateway. Mr Lock stated that ground
        control was aware. Player had left pitch by this time.

        Exit ground via players' tunnel and called at Doug Lock's office.
        Saw large group outside Leppings Lane end on camera.

        Left South Stand via players' entrance and commenced to go to
        Leppings Lane turnstiles.

        Once outside, rear of South Stand, heard Supt Marshall on radio
        requesting permission to open gates. Voice full of panic.

        Two horses pass by towards Leppings Lane.

        Whilst passing television vehicles mention on radio of possible
        postponement of kick off? Radio reception poor. Unknown source.

2.55?   Arrive at barrier near to 'C' Gate - Large crowd possibly 4,000
        outside turnstiles all pushing and shoving. Horseman in middle
        of crowd - didn't look happy with situation, didn't look as if
        he could get out.

        There were a number 10 - 20 youths climbing on wall above turnstiles
        towards 'B' gate. I could see Inspector Bennett on top of turnstile
        wall trying to stop them.

        Crowd chanting and pushing very frightening scene - never seen
        anything like this at a football match. In fear that someone would
        get badly injured or worse.




                                       - 2 -
    Noise from inside ground - possible teams onto field. This made
    crowd push even more. Real danger of people being crushed. Several
    being pulled or pushed out at side.

    Saw Inspector Purdy - worried.

X   Noise too loud to hear radio etc - could smell alcohol drifting
    from crowd. People shouting for help.

    Gate 'C' opened from the inside - unable to see by whom. Crowd
    surged forward and allowed into ground, unable to stop, like
    animals. The smell of alcohol got worse the nearer they got.

    Approximately 1500 or more passed through the gateway like a pack
    of animals, no other words to describe them.

    Horses move and close crowd down somewhat. Gate pulled together
    slightly and crowd let in a little more orderly. Those holding
    tickets in the air were allowed to pass. Another 5 or 600 allowed
    in pressure easing by this time.

    I then went around the barrier and saw 200/300 supporters at the
    turnstiles still trying to get in that way, it didn't appear as
    though they had seen Gate 'C' open. Then someone, I couldn't see
    who, opened Gate 'B'. The people at the turnstile then ran through
    this gate and the pressure on the turnstile was relieved.

    There were several people who were limping, etc., and had obviously
    been injured in the crush. None appeared serious and there were
    definitely no bodies at this location.

    I do not know who opened gates 'C' or 'B' or if control had
    requested them to be opened. I can only say that if they had not
    been opened when they were serious and probable fatal injuries
    would have been caused.

    There were roars from the crowd inside, possibly kick-off or
    football action of some description, I was unable to tell.

    I spoke to Sergeant Norburn and we discussed the animal like
    behavour of the crowd and the pressure build up.

    Started to walk back towards the television vehicles as the problem
    had cleared and we intended to activate phase 2.

    I heard Sergeant Goddard's voice come over the radio although
    reception was none too clear there was an anxious tone to his voice,
    "All officers on to perimeter track." (repeated).

    I shouted to the serial (6) and we all ran towards the entrance
    near to turnstiles 19 to 22 at the rear of control point. We
    entered the perimeter track via the front area of the South Stand.
    People in the South Stand were stood up and shouting abuse towards
    the West Stand area. It looked like a pitch invasion from the
    West Stand terraces. There were no players on the field. Numerous

                                                                          fi   Li




    police officers near and around the perimeter fencing and goalmouth
    area. Fans were spilling onto the field, climbing fencing etc.
    My immediate thought was that it was a pitch invasion and nothing
    more.

    With the officers I made my way to the perimeter fencing. I made
    my way to the fencing towards the left hand side of Gateway No.3.
    This gate was open and police officers were trying to clear the
    gateway of fallen people.

    To my horror I then saw the reality of what was taking place.

    The first 4 or 5 rows of supporters who had been stood behind this
    section of fencing had all been crushed together up to the fencing.
    Several were obviously dead and others appeared to be dying.

There was one elderly man. erevine hair.
,

                                           HE WAS OBVIOUSLY DEAD.
Others around him were turning blue/purple as they were suffocating.
A young girl probably 15 or 16 years was struggling to keep alive.
She was unable to speak and I suspect fading fast. The gateway
was open and officers were trying to remove what I realise now
were bodies from the gateway. The bodies were entangled with other
bodies which were alive. Supporters from the back were climbing
over bodies to get out, thereby hindering the rescue attempts by
the officers concerned.

The crowds were still pushing forward and chanting at the police.

I joined the officers stood on the wall and shouted at the crowd
to stop pushing. Shouts of abuse were the only reply.

Officers were trying to make their way through the section of crowds
to the left, compound 2, and climb over the adjoining fence. They
were being pushed and jostled by the crowd as they did so.

Other supporters were climbing over the dead and injured at the
front to escape over the fencing. The crowd at the rear of this
section and the West Stand area did not seem to realise what was
happening at the front. They continued to shout abuse at the
police.

I was unaware if control had realised the seriousness of the
situation. It was impossible to hear radio transmissions if in
fact they were being made.

I jumped down from the fencing and ran towards the goalmouth area
in the hope that I could contact control and ensure that other
services were attending. We urgently required cutting equipment,
bullhorns or the public address system to let the crowd know what
was happening, etc., and for officers to be deputed to attend from
the rear tunnel, that being the main entrance to areas 3 and 4.

It was mayhem and there was no way that a message could be passed




                                -   4   -
from my position. I ran towards the South Stand where I saw
Superintendent Greenwood near to the touchline facing the South
Stand and the control box. I shouted to him that there were
fatalities and we needed assistance quickly. I did not wait for
an answer and ran back to the fencing area near to gateway No.3.

By this time several officers had climbed the fencing and were
hanging over the top trying to pull people up from the other side
of the fence. To some extent this was being successful. Some
were being extracted from the gateway. By now a number of severely
injured were laid on the playing area to the left of the goalmouth.
Police officers and supporters alike were giving what assistance
they could.

I ran towards the gateway and as I did so a youth was pulled from
the gateway. Assisted by some supporters I carried the youth aged
about 17 years to the playing area, his breathing was shallow but
he was alive, I therefore placed him in the coma position and as
I started to get up I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit go past me
and go towards the gateway No.3.

I followed him and saw that the gateway was still blocked. Chief
Superintendent Nesbit had told the officers to clear the gateway
of bodies as best they could but they were being hampered by two
bodies in particular, one of which was laid face down his head
and upper body being entangled with the other bodies in the doorway,
his legs and lower body being on the perimeter track.

I intended to attempt to remove this body when the body of a male
40 to 45 years, well built, salt and pepper hair, was passed through
the gateway. Sergeant 840 Wright and myself carried this man on
to the grassed area. I cleared the man's throat and Sergeant Wright
commenced heart massage, whilst I commenced mouth to mouth
resuscitation. After a couple of minutes we realised that this
was a pointless exercise the man was dead and I covered his upper
body with my coat.

I returned to gateway No.3 and saw Chief Supt. Nesbit lifting a
small boy up the perimeter fence. The child's shoe or shoelace
had become entangled in the perimeter fence and it had to be
released by Sgt. Gutcher, Serious Crime Squad, who was inside the
compound. By this time a number of officers had made their way
into the enclosure and were either moving bodies, assisting others
over the fences, or giving mouth to mouth resuscitation. Two
officers in particular come to mind, although there were many others
whose names I do not know. Sgt Gutcher and Constable Humphries
of 'C' Division. Their actions were praiseworthy to say the least.

I then assisted several other officers with the removal of
casualties from the area of around gateway No.3. With Chief Supt
Nesbit, Sergeant Morton, HQ Serious Crime Squad and other officers,
we made a chain and continued to pass injured and dead people from
the compound. It is proper to say at this time that the majority
of these people were in fact dead by now.




                              - 5 -
As the number of bodies inside the compound dwindled, I assisted
police officers and supporters to carry the dead away on make-shift
stretchers. These were advertising hoardings used on the perimeter
track of the ground.

The bodies were carried to the gymnasium where they had to be taken
from the stretcher in order to get them through the door. The
bodies were then either left with one of the officers who had
assisted in carrying them or handed over to officers inside the
gymnasium for continuity purposes.

I assisted with the removal of 3 or 4 such bodies but I am unable
to recall anything about them other than they were all male and
in either their late teens or early twenties.

As I was about to leave the gymnasium on the last such venture,
somebody I am unable to say who, asked if a check could be made
outside to see if there were any more dead in the immediate area
of the prison van and police room.

I went outside and assisted in carrying the body of a male 20 to
22 years, fair hair, no other details, into the gymnasium. I
returned and saw one more body outside. It was laid on the floor
between the prison van and the gymnasium wall. It had been
partially covered with a green blanket. Together with PC2051
Jackson, I carried this body into the gymnasium. I assisted PC
Jackson with the completion of a sudden death report and left him
with the body. This body was later identified as Stuart William
Paul Thompson, 17 years, ___________________________| Liverpool.

Sometime after 4.30pm

I then returned to the playing area and made my way towards
enclosure No.3. I saw that the wire fencing had been bent away
from the frame at one corner. This I understood had been done
by police officers in an attempt to remove the casualties. I then
noticed the broken barrier which must have had an effect on the
outcome of this tragedy. The cross member had snapped near to
the neck of the securing stand and then the whole stand had been
pushed forward, no doubt by the pressure exerted by the supporters
at some stage.

Chief Supt Nesbit had already positioned officers to preserve the
immediate scene for evidential purposes.

I looked around the scene at some of the officers and saw that
some were overcome with emotion and others were physically
exhausted. All, I feel sure, were numb with the scenes they had
witnessed.

It was at this time that I noticed thatmy shirt had vomit and
blood on it, my trousers and shoes were covered in mud, my hat,
coat and tie were missing.

I went around speaking to police officers giving what support and




                          - 6 -
encouragement I could under the circumstances. I stayed on the
playing area until nearly all the supporters had left the ground
and then remained in the ground until I was stood down at 7pm that
evening by Chief Supt Mole.

OBSERVATIONS

The scene I witnessed at the Leppings Lane Turnstiles is the most
frightening I have ever seen. Officers at that locality are to
be commended for their actions.

There was a real danger that structural damage would be caused
to the immediate area, resulting in deaths. It is a miracle that
nobody was killed or injured in the crush outside of these
turnstiles.

The animalistic actions of the crowd left no other option open
other than to open the gates concerned.   I am unaware whoopened
them but I applaud their actions.

The build up of spectators was due to the number of spectators
who came to the ground late, together with the insistence of non­
ticket holders to gain entry. Alcohol obviously had an affect
on their behaviour. Had the supporters gone through the gates
in an orderly manner the concourse at the rear could have dispersed
them naturally. Instead they ran and pushed their way through
without care, thought or consideration to anyone.

Many many officers, some of whom I have mentioned, carried out
acts worthy of the highest praise. If I may be allowed to select
one individual officer whose actions were outstanding for his
command of the situation, organisation and physical effort, then
I select Chief Supt. Nesbit, Operations & Traffic Division.

instructions               of    how       to    ge^k-^to the         ground.             I walked       down      to       the    ground

with    Shane          a n d we       arrived        at     fc>K t w e e n    1 31 5 h o u r s    (1315)       and      1330

hours       <1 3 3 0 ) .        We    had\o        tr oub le ^' A . n d i n g        where       we    had    to   go a n d w h e n

we    gtft th er e ,        there          were    nb^ a        lot     of     fans       outside       the    ground.




On    my wa y      to      the       ground       I did       see     some         fans    sitting       outside            pubs

drinking          and      s om e     fans       with      b ee r    cans      but     I saw      no    one    who      was       drunk

or    behaving          ba dly ,          just    the      usual      singing         of    football          song s.




I had       no    difficulty               in g e t t i n g     into         the    ground and          the    turnstile

operator          took      my       ticket       and      ripped       it     in half.



I was       searched            by P o l i ^       otAside           th e^ur lysti le and               then a gai n whe n                 I

had    gon e      t h rough          the    turns^\es,               by a P o l i c e       Officer          in t hat        are a.            I

do    remember          seeing            C 1 ub'-SJewards           both      inside       and       outside      the       ground

just    standing            around.



When     I got         in the         ground       I went           to a s>iiall          refreshment          bar      j ust      inside

to    get    something               to    eat.     Then        I walked            through       the    tunnel         to    the

     terraces.              I did       not    see        Isay s i g n s     telling            me    to    go a n o t h e r       way and          I
     *
     was    not       told which way                 to    go    but    anyway whatever                     had      been     said       I would

     have       gone       to    the    place        so    that       I could         get       behind        the      goal    because

     t h a t ’s w h e r e        I always          stand and           t h a t ’s w h e r e          I wanted          to    go.




     At    the>itch              end    of    t he    tunnel          I went         slightly             %o m y     left     into w h a t          I

     During       th e      next       hour    the        part    of     the     ground          I was        in j us t       got       fuller

     and    fuller          and    I was       getting           more       and more            squashed.              At    about       1455

     hours       <1455)          or a bit          later,        I decided            to    try       to    get      nearer        to    the

     front       of    the       terraces.            The       lad                  I was       with       had      go ne    down       to    the

     front       earlier          at    about        1445       hours       <1445),         so       I did      not     see    him a gai n

     in the ground.

                                                                                                                    BtfLrTur fk x i ^

     Just       about       the    t ime      the     match       started            1 go t      trapped            on a b a r r i e r        about

     one    third          of    the w a y     doWj        the    terrace.                I j us t        could      not     get

     off    it for a             bit.        Eventualfy           I was        able        to    get       myself       up a n d        stood       on

     the    crash          Mirier,           then     I divedN^nto               the       people          in f r o n t      of me       and

     they       p a s s e d me     aver       their        heads       to    the      front          fence     and      some       fans       then

     dragged          me    out    over^the           fence       onto       the      pitch.




     I. d i d    not       sustain       any       injuries           but w h i l e        I was          in the       crowd       crush,       I

     was    having          difficulty             in b r e a t h i n g .        I was          so    pre-~occupied w i t h

     getting          out       myself       that     I did       not       t a ke    too       much attention                of w h a t       was

     going       on a r o u n d me           and     I saw       nothing        of w e n t           on    in the       next       pen    on m y

     rig h t .

                                                                                                                                    S2134

I do    remember               that     fans       were    shouting             to       the    Police        in the         stand

above,          telling         them      that      there       was       a    crush        but      they     did      not     seem    to

take    any        notice.             The    Police       at       the       front       also       did    not     seem       to

understand               what    was      going      on    but       when       they        eventually            did     they were

also    trying            to    get     fans       over    the       fence          onto       the      pitch.




When    I finally               go t    onto       the    pitch         I was        also       helping        to      try     to    pull

the    front          fence      down        to    get    people          out.           This     was      still       in f r o n t    of

pen    no       f ou r    and    I could           see    a number             of    people          who    had     fallen          over    and

were    on       the      ground        close       up    bv    the       n ext      fenc e.


                                         x                          \                CAT -
After       a    bit      of    time      I smarted            to    hexfeJother               f a ns   who    were       carrying

people          away      on    the     a d v e r t i s'Ssjpg b o a r d s .          I helped with                tw o    or thre e.

We    just       carried         them        to    the    far       corner          of    the     ground and             left       them

with    other            p eop le.



I left          the      ground        just       after    they         gave        the     announcement               th at    the    game

had    been        abandoned.                I met                   outside             a n d we w e n t      back       to    the    coach

together.




My    one       thought         about        what    happened             at    the       m a tc h was        t ha t     there

appeared           to     be a     lack       of    communication,                   no     one      told anyone             what     was

going       on.

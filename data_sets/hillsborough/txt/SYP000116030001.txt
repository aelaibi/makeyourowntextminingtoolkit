            I am      a Police                 Constable          in    the       South       Yorkshire          Police,             presently

            stationed                at    Doncaster             Sub    Division.              On    Saturday,          9th          April,         1988

            (090488)                I was       stationed          at       Rotherham          Sub    Division          and          at   8.30am

            <0830)             that       same    day       together          with       other       Police       officers                I attended

            Hillsborough                   Football          Ground          for       the    FA    Semi       Final    between             Liverpool

            and       Nottingham                Forest.

            After          the       briefing          in    the       North       Stand       our    serial          was    engaged             on     the

            outside             of       the    turnstiles             on    the       West    Stand       Leppings          Lane.             We     were

            paired             up    outside        each         turnstile             and    searched          the    Liverpool

            supporters                   for    cans    and       sticks          which       could       be    used    as       missiles.

            A    second             serial       was    inside          the       turnstiles          doing       exactly             the      same

            search             as    our       serial       in    order       to       double       check       the    supporters.

            We    took          up       our    positions          at       the    turnstiles             at    11.00arn         <1100)          and

            everything                   was    working          well       and    we    took       possession          of       a    large         number

            of    beer          and       pop    cans       which       were       placed          in a    large       plastic             bin      liner

            and       later          together          with       the       sticks       and       banners       were       taken         to     the

            gymnasium                which       was    being          used       as    the    Property          Store.

            At    1.30pm             a    number       of    fans       arrived          and       some    were       the    worse          for       drink,

            one       of       which       was

            Crosby,             Liverpool.              He       was    staggering             about       and    had       to       be   spoken         to

      *               on    two    occasions                by       myself          and       Police             Constable                1144       Reynolds,                which

                      resulted          in       the       man       being          arrested             for          ’A t t e m p t i n g       to    Enter          a    Ground

                      Whilst       Drunk’.                 He    was       taken          to       the       Police             Room       and    on       my    return             to;

                      the    turnstiles                the       mass          of    supporters                   had       increased             and       it    became

                      very    congested                around             the       area       of       Lep<pi n g s •L a n e .              However,             a       third

                      serial       was       engaged             on       the       highway             directing                the       supporters             to       the

                      relevant          turnstiles.                       There          was       quite          a    considerable                   amount          of

                      pushing          as    it       neared          the       start          of       the       g a m e > however,                  no    one       was

                      injured          to    my       knowledge.                    The       majority                of    the       supporters                had       entered

                      the    ground          before             the       start          of    the       game.

                      At    about       3.15pm             (1515)          our       serial             went          to    the       gymnasium where                      we       had

                      our    meal.           Whilst             we    were          in    that          position                two    officers             from

                      Nottingham             Police             said       there          was       a    disturbance                   on    the       Kop.           As       a

                      result       we       attended             the       rear          of    the       Hop          near       to    the       slipway          leading

                      to    the    pitch          area          at    the       side          of    the       North             Stand,       the       only       trouble                we

                      could       see       was       pushing             from       the       back          of       the       crowd       as    they          tried          to    get

                      a    better       view          of    the       game.              No    one       was          injured          and       there          were       no

                      arrests.              We    returned                to    the       gymnasium                   until          the    halftime             whistle,

                      after       where          we    went          to    the       Leppings                Lane          Stand.           All       the       pens       were

                      full    and       as       normal          there          was       quite          a    bit          of    pushing          forward             as       the

                      supporters             followed                the       match,          but       everything                   appeared             in    order             and

                      good    nature.

                      At    4.30pm          we    left          the       ground          and       stood             on    Leppings             Lane       on    the          bridge

                      on    the    opposite                side       of       the       road.           On       the       final          whistle          the

                      supporters             came          out       of    the       ground             and       left          in a       noisily          and       orderly

                      manner       towards             the       Railway             Station             at       Wadsley             Bridge.              Prior          to       the

                      start       of    the       game          at    no       time       did       I see             any       of    the    supporters                   being

                      allowed          access          by       the       large          gates          at    the          rear       of    Leppings             Lane          Stand.

                                        Police Constable 1027.
                                        South Yorkshire Police, Doncaster A.1.


I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, presently stationed at
Doncaster Sub-Division. On Saturday, 9th April 1988 I was stationed at Rotherham
Sub-Division and at 8.30am that same day together with other Police Officers I
attended Hillsborough Football Ground for the F.A. Semi Final between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forest,
After the briefing in the North Stand our serial was engaged on the outside of the
turnstiles on the West Stand Leppings Lane. We were paired up outside each turnstile
and searched the Liverpool Supporters for cans and sticks which could be used as
missiles.
A secong serial was inside the turnstiles doing exactly the same search as our serial
in order to double check the supporters.
We took up our positions at the turnstiles at 11.00am and everything was working
well and we took possession of a large number of beer and pop cans which were placed
in a large plastic bin liner and later togther with the sticks and banners were taken
to the gymnasium which was being used as the Property Store.
At 1.30pm a number of fans arrived and some were the wors©     for drirk, one of which
was                                                   Crosby, Liverpool. He was
staggering about and had to be spoken to on two occasions by myself and Police
Constable 11M+ Reynolds, which resulted in the man being arrested for Attempting
To Enter A Ground Whilst Drunk. He was taken to the Police room and on my return
to the turnstiles the mass of supporters had increased and it became very congested
around the area of Leppings Lane. However a third serial was engaed on the highway
directing the supporters to the relevant turnstiles. There was quiet a considerable
amount of pushing as it neared the start of the game, however no one was injured to
my knowledge.$he majority of the supporters had entered the ground before the start
of the game.
At about 3.15pm our serial went to the gymnasium where we had our meal. Whilst we were
in that position two Officers from Nottigham Police said there was a disturbance on
the kop. As a result we attended the rear of the kop nearto the slip way leading to
the pitch area at the side of the North Stand, the only trouble we could see was
pushing from the back of the crowd as they tried to get a better view of the game.
No one was injured and there were no arrests. We returned to the gymnasium until the
halftime whistle, after where we went to the Leppings Lane Stand. All the pens were
full and as normal there was quiet a bit of pushing forward as the supporters followed
the match, but everything appeared in order and good nature.
At ^.30pm we left the ground and stood on Leppings Lane on the bridge on the opposite
side of the road. On the final whistle the supporters came out of the ground     and
left in a noisily and oredrly manner towards the Railway Station at Wadsley Bridge.
Prior to the start of the game at no time did I see any of the supporters being allowed
access by the large gates at the rear of Leppings

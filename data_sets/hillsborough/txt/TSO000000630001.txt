             POSITIONING OF THE DECEASED

             I enclose herewith two charts and supporting documentation with regard
             to the positioning of the deceased at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989-

             The information shown on the attached plans has been compiled by the West
             Midlands Police Video/Photographic Section of the Hillsborough Judicial
             Inquiry for the purposes of assisting the work of the section.

             The coloured and numbered stickers indicate, what are believed to be the
             position of deceased either prior to, or following their death as seen
             on either video footage or photographs.

             In some instances people have been seen in different locations, ie pen
             or pitch and as such may have more than one identifying sticker shown.

             The plan showing stickers which are all the same colour is drawn up from
             information contained in statements only and at this stage does not
             differentiate as to whether alive or dead. These are additional
             identifications to the above.

             It should be stressed that the identifications are based on the opinion
             of officers researching the material available to them as at 6 June 1989.

             The plans should be treated as a guide to movements of persons at this
             stage and not a completed document.

             I have forwarded sufficient copies for Andrew Collins QC, yourselves and
             Junior Counsel.  I have also sent copies to Mr Whalley, Lord Justice
             Taylor and the Assessors.

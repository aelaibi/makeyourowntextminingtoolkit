~          seating requirement for Football League grounds in the context of
W           the representations that have been made and our concern to ensure
            the highest standards of safety that are reasonably practicable
           given all the factors involved, including the size of particular
           grounds, League status and the financial health of the clubs
           concerned.    The safety of our sports grounds must, however,
           remain paramount.


           'We have decided that it would be wrong to review either the
           principle or the timetable for all-seating at First Division
           grounds in the Football    League (the newPremier League).   It is
           essential that our top      clubs meet the standards necessary to
           compete in Europe and make full use of the resources available to
           them to provide grounds of which we can all be proud.      We also
           remain firmly committed to the principle of all-seating for the
           great majority of Second Division clubs.


           "There may be circumstances, however, in which standing
           accommodation can be retained at Third and Fourth Division clubs
           in the Football League. We also need to consider the position at
           those Second Division clubs with very low average attendances.
           Further representations     are being invited from a number of
           interested organisations    to assist me in finalising our re-
           examination of these and related issues.     I intend to make a
           further announcement as soon as possible.


           "For the time being all Second, Third and Fourth Division clubs
           should continue to plan on the basis of all-seating being a
           requirement by the stated dates.


           "My Rt Honourable Friend, the Secretary of State for Scotland,
           intends to consult the Scottish Stadia Committee on the question
           of a re-examination of the all-seated requirements at designated
           grounds within the First and Second Divisions of the Scottish
           Football League.     The policy for the Premier Division is
           unchanged. "

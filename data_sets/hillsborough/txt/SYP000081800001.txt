                At this       the mass        of    people          started to          run           the gr ou nd towards           the

                near    to me.         The    speed of the              rust^^slowed down to almost                 a halt?          1 was

                out to     left and          right and some              of us were            forced down       into    pen 3 by

                the force        of the       people          still     coming      thro ug h the tunnel.               I was    being

                carried by the            crowd to al mo st              the front            of the fence.        By this       time      .1.

                exit    gate     of the       pen.    I could then feel a                      continual    pressure       from the

                back    of me,      the      crowd getting              tighter an d t i g h t e r .        I was       sweating

                shouting        for help throwing                   their arms          up    into the air.        The    first

                         He was       not doing anything,                    he just a p p e a r e d to be staring at me.                           I

                         did not          see this man again.                    I j^ould describe               him as being white                in

                         quite      short.         I only      saw his           head.          This man was           clean shaven.

                         The     next      person    I saw        I ’m sure was                dead.      He was       to the       left    of me

                         a bout an arms            length away.                A policeman on t he/track                      pointed to          him.

                         I can just            remember           the look of his"race.                    His face and neck were                   deep

                         blue.        I started s la pp in g               his     face trying            to shock him.              I could not

                         get an y         response     out     of him.             Immedi at el y         in front          of me was a w om an

                         She was          screaming      for      help that              she    c o u l d n ’t breath.

                         I d i d n ’t take a lot             of       notice of other               things       h appening         in the

                         The     pressure      then began to ease                        off and as        it did there was a surge

                         from my          right.     I was        pushed backwards                  and over          to the     left      of the       pen

              of where          I had been s ta nd ing           previously.         I saw that the           crowd had

              cleared from there              but    there were about            fifty or sixty             people all

              i n t e r m i n g l ed together       on their       feet with their            heads     on each others

              shoulders.           I knew that           they were dead.           I c o u l d n ’t u nd er s ta n d what

              was    keeping       them up.         I saw that           there was a y outh amongst                the

              intermingled          people     s h ou te d for me to help him.                     I star te d     pulling at

              the    i n t er m i ng le d bodies         to try to get        him out.            The stench o ve rcame me

              and    I was      exhausted.          It    came   to my m ind about my sister.                      I s t ar te d

              what    I might       find.

              It was at this           time    that my friend ______               came to me and            i nf ormed me

              that. my sister was alive.

              I believe         that   there were         far too few         police      to handle         the    crowd

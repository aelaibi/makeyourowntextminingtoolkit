      Dear Mr Sharp

      HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

      Thank you for your letter dated the 23rd May 1990.

      My preliminary view is to agree with your conclusion that there
      is no obvious reason for objecting to the proposal.

      I have however referred the matter to Counsel for their
      consideration and I hope to be in a position to report their
      advice to you shortly.

      Yours sincerely




            IKK

HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

You asked me for early advice and draft reply to Mrs Hicks'
letter of 6 July which enclosed an article from the Wolverhampton
Express and Star about the delays in settling the issue of the
cost of the inquiries by the West Midlands police into the
Hillsborough tragedy.

2.   The article suggested that members of the West Midlands
Police Authority were expecting to hear from Lord Ferrers
following his meeting with members of the South Yorkshire Police
Authority but they had heard nothing as yet. That was because we
had hoped to receive an early response to Lord Ferrers' letter of
27 June to Sir John Layden, Chairman of the South Yorkshire
Police Authority, making the proposal that they seek a special
payment from us so as to assist them in paying the West Midlands
costs.

3.   In view of the delay in hearing from South Yorkshire, I
recommend that Lord Ferrers should now write to Councillor
Ablett following up his letter of 16 June informing him of the
latest developments in general terms.    Lord Ferrers can also
reply at the same time to Mrs Hicks.

4.   This will at least deter the West Midlands Police Authority
and local press from suggesting that we are delaying the
resolution of the policing costs issue.

5.   We have to give South Yorkshire reasonable time to consider
our offer.   I understand from the clerk to the South Yorkshire
Police Authority that although some members have discussed Lord
Ferrers | letter of 27 June, the next opportunity for a full
discussion about Hillsborough is on 21 July at the next meeting
of the Finance and General Purposes Committee.
6.   I attach draft letters to Councillor Ablett and Mrs Hicks
for Lord Ferrers consideration.

                         You will recall that in my letter of 16 June I promised
                         to write to you again following my meeting with members
                         of the South Yorkshire Police Authority on 20 June, at
                         which we discussed the costs of the inquiries by the West
                         Midlands police into the Hillsborough Stadium Tragedy.

                         At the meeting I put a proposal to the South Yorkshire
                         police about how the costs being incurred on the
                         investigation should be met.    I have written to them
                         formally setting out our proposal and they are
                         considering this.     It would involve South Yorkshire
                         meeting the costs initially but with special assistance
                         from central government in recognition of the special
                         features of the case.


                         I hope the proposal that we have put to South Yorkshire
                         Police Authority will help to achieve an agreement on the
                         reimbursement of West Midlands1 additional police costs.

We remain fully committed to the principle that the costs
should not fall to West Midlands.


I will write to you again as soon as I have received a
reply from South Yorkshire.

                       Thank you for your letter of 6 July enclosing an article
                       which appeared in the Wolverhampton Express and Star
                       about the cost of the inquiries by the West Midlands
                       police into the Hillsborough Stadium Tragedy.

                       I have today written to the Clerk of the West Midlands
                       Police Authority informing him that at my recent meeting
                       with members of the South Yorkshire Police Authority I
                       discussed their concerns and put a proposal to them about
                       how the costs being incurred by the West Midlands should
                       be met.


                       I have also written to Sir John Layden, the Chairman of
                       the South Yorkshire Police Authority about the proposal
                       and the authority is now considering this.    I am now
                       awaiting their response.


                       I am anxious to reach agreement on the reimbursement of
                       the West Midlands police costs and I hope the proposal

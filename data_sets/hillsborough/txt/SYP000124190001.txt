 ACROSS THE PITCH.    THEY COULD HAVE HELPED.    THE FIRE SERVICE WHEN THEY

 ARRIVED SEEMED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE SITUATION.

^DICIAL    INQUIRY?

 I. VISITED THE SAME GROUND FOR A SEMI. FINAL LAST YEAR,   THE SAME FANS SAME

TEAM, AND YET l'T WAS HANDLED SO MUCH MORE PROFESSIONALLY.       I FEEL

THAT I WAS CRUSHED MORE OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND WHEN THE GATES WERE

OPENED I WAS RELIEVED, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TRANSFERRING THE. PROBLEM TO

OTHER PLACES.

 ALL FOUR OF US WALKED THROUGH THE TUNNEL WHICH WAS FAIRLY CLEAR,                WHEN WE CAME

 TO THE END OF THE TUNNEL WE JUST CAME TO A SOLID MASS OF PEOPLE.                 WE TRIED TO

 WORK OUR WAY ONTO THE TERRACES TO GET A BETTER VIEWING POINT,              AT THIS TIME I

 VAGUELY REMEMBER THE LIVERPOOL TEAM COMING ONTO THE PITCH AND RUNNING UP

        WARDS THE GOAL AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END.

 WAS PUSHED FORWARD.       I HAD MY DAUGHTER,          IWITH ME.     I WAS HOLDING HER

 AROUND THE WAIST.       WE HAD BECOME SEPARATED FROM MY SON AND                   FIANCE AND

 I WAS TRYING TO MAKE MY WAY TOWARDS THEM,         THEY WERE OVER TO OUR RIGHT,         AT THIS

 STAGE WE WERE STILL BEING PUSHED FORWARDS,          fyrOGb                0\T     6

 WE WERE PUSHED FORWARDS AND EVENTUALLY WERE PUSHED AGAINST A BARRIER.                  (THIS

 TO SLIP UNDER THE BARRIER.       I STAYED AGAINST THE BARRIER AND I FELT A SURGE

 FORWARD,      WHEN THE PRESSURE RELEASED I STEPPED TO THE SIDE OF THE BARRIER

 I WAS PUSHED EVEN FURTHER FORWARD TOWARDS THE PERIMETER FENCE.                  I FINALLY

 GATE    IN THE PERIMETER FENCE C)F PEN 3.

 AT THIS STAGE SOMEONE HAD OPENED THE WICKET GATE ONTO THE PITCH AND PEOPLE

 WERE BEING DRAGGED OUT OF IT.

 BEFORE THE GATE WAS OPENED PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE PERIMETER

 FENCE ONTO THE PITCH BUT THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK.

 EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO GET OUT OF THE WICKET GATE AND ONTO THE RUNNING TRACK

 BEHIND THE GOAL.        AT THIS TIME WHEN I GOT OUT THE GAME WAS STILL. BEING PLAYED.

 I WAS JOINED ON THE RUNNING TRACK BY I

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIOh                    ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO REACT TO               HE SITUATION, BUT, EVEN PEOPLE IN THE PEN

 ITSELF DIDN'T REALISE HOW SERI01/              IT WAS.                 EVEN AT THE HEIGHT OF                                              IT, ONE

 MINUTE YOU WERE CRUSHED AND THE NEXT YOU WERE FREE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE CORDON WASN'T PUT UP AGAIN AROUND THE GROUND TO

 FILTER YOU THROUGH TO THE TURNSTILES LIKE LAST YEAR, WHICH WORKED WELL.

 WHILST TRYING TO GET IN, ONE OF THE MOUNTED OFFICERS SHOUTED THAT THE

 TURNSTILES WERE CLOSED UNTIL THE CROWD COULD BE SORTED OUT.    I DON'T KNOW

 WHETHER THIS IS TRUE OR NOT, BUT ALL IT DID WAS INCREASE THE CROWDS

 EAGERNESS TO GET IN.

 I THINK THE SLOW REACTION OF THE POLICE WAS A LARGE. FACTOR           IN THE DISASTER.

 THE POLICE SEEMED TO DEAL WITH THE EVENT AS A CROWD CONTROL PROBLEM AND NOT AS

 A CROWD SAFETY PROBLEM.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL. IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IF OFFICERS HAD STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL TO DIVERT THE SUPPORTERS

 TO OTHER PARTS OF THE GROUND THE/DISASTER COULD HAVE BEEN AVERTED.

 PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS COULD NOT GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE GROUND.

 I DO NOT THINK THAT THE GATE SHOULD HAVE BEEN O P E N E D . /'THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH

 POLICE ON CROWD CONTROL T H A T ’S OUTSIDE THE GROUND.       IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE THE:

 SITUATION WOULD NOT HAVE ARISEN.         BY OPENING THE GAmE IT JUST TRANSFERRED THE

 CROWD PROBLEM FROM OUTSIDE THE GROUND TO INSIDE THE GROUND.

 THERE WERE NO SIGNS DIRECTING SUPPORTERS TO THE SIDE P E N S , AND WHEN THE FANS

 ENTERED THE GROUND ALL. THEY COULD SEE WAS THE TUNNEL.

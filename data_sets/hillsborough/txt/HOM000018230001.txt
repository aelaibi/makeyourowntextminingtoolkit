        Dear Mr Bruce,

        Like e veryone else I have been h orrified and sickened by the scenes from
        Hil ls b or ou g h Football Ground.

        As the E ngineer responsible for c er tifying two of our local stadia, East End
        Park and Cow de n be at h I am familiar with the safety g ui delines and
        regulations par ti c ul ar l y in respect of the design and layout of crush
        barriers, gates, stairways etc. The disaster at Hil ls b or ou g h raises
        questions about the design and layout of the barriers there which
        undoubtedly will be addressed by the public inquiry.

       At East End Park crowds are of course much smaller than at Hil ls b or ou g h but
       over the past two seasons we have achieved c apacity crowds of over 18,000
       which involved very high local densities. Ult im a te ly were severe over
       crowding ever to have occ ur r ed the crowd had the option of climbing over the
       low perimeter fence, and in an e mergency the police and a mbulance men could
       assist with this. The high per im e te r fence at Hil ls b or ou g h prevented this
       and it was here of course that so many died. I would suggest that
       c onsi d er at i on must now be given to d es igning a m o d i f i ca ti o n to these high
       perimeter fences which would enable them to be opened by the Police from the
       track side. Some sort of simple key or bar system which could be o perated
       with relative ease by one or two policemen even under a full crowd loading
       should not be too difficult to design. Every section of fence could then be
       d em ou ntable in an e mergency situation, a "normal" barrier i mmediately inside
       the fence w ould prevent the crowd falling forward when the fence was dropped
       and would enable the police and rescuers to assist the front rows of people.
      T h e / . ..

The ope ra t io n of these perimeter fence control levers would be something
every policeman would be trained in and the licence for each gro un d should
require monthly tests to be carri e d out to ensure the mec ha n is m work
properly even under the most severe load c o n d i t i o n s .

I w ould be grateful if you could forward my s ug gestion to the most
a pp ro p ri at e authority; if I can assist at all with the development of such a
system then I would naturally be glad to do so.


Yours sincerely,

        C/o Taylor Enquiry
        Town Hall
        Sheffield.

        Dear Sir,

        We have been in correspondence with a number of Football League Clubs
        and also the Football League and Football Association regarding
        Perimeter Fencing at Football Grounds.

      With the whole question of  crowd safety uppermost in everyone's mind
      we  may   have a   possible  alternative  to  the  continued  use  of
     ^traditional perimeter crowd barriers.
    V
        Our suggestion, which will give the same psychological effect and
        physical appearance of existing fencing will enable crowd containment
        to take place and, yet allow instant evacuation onto the pitch in
        emergencies.

         This may be achieved by using our Tildenet CR1 Perimeter Safety
1 Ikw.i Netting to provide a barrier between spectators and playing area.
 ^           netting is extremely strong and is of a knitted, lockstitched,
      I tear resistant proof and rotproof polyethylene.   It has a 2.5 cm mesh
       V giving good visibility and is available in Black or Green.

        Our belief is that a crush barrier could be installed upto say waist
        height and from there the TILDENET would be added above it.     This
        should be a compromise solution because when erected Tildenet CR1
        would act as a deterrent to pitch invasion, yet in an emergency may
        be removed to allow instant escape.

        The installation of this fencing is obviously a fundemental point to
        consider.   We believe we could develop a pulley system which easily
        removesthe netting without having to cut it in the event that this
        should be required.   We know that something similar was done in the
        Republic of Ireland, and we are presently obtaining the specification
        of that system which incidentally used our net.  I would just mention
        that not only is this meant to be a deterrent for fans invading the
        pitch but, of course, would be a protection against missiles.

        We would be very pleased to work with you and or any Football Clubs
        in developing this idea.  We have already spoken to Chelsea Football
        Club who have indicated an interest in experimenting on their west

  Dear Mr

  Through statements made by other people it has come to my notice that you
  attended the FA Cup Semi Final Liverpool V Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough on
  15 April 1989.

  It was my intention to arrange a personal visit in order that a statement could
  be obtained. However my officers have experienced difficulty in contacting
  yourself. If you feel you wish to be seen please do not hesitate to contact my
  investigation team at Nechells Green Police Station. Alternatively you may
  write to the Secretary of the Inquiry as below:

  Mr R M Whalley
  Secretary to the Inquiry
  50 Queen Anne's Gate
  London SW1H 9AT

 Yours sincerely




 J M JONES
 ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT       NECHELLS.GBEEN .EQLIGE .STATION.

   HILLSBOROUGH ■ ORAL STATEMENT

   Thank you for sending me a copy of the Home Secretary's draft statement to be delivered in
   the House today. My Secretary of State was grateful for sight of it. He commented that it was
   unfortunate that news of this was leaked on Saturday when Liverpool were playing Sheffield
   Wednesday at Hillsborough.

one    from       someone              n ear      the       g r ou nd .      I was        in L e p p i n g s      LN and

approached              by a n         o f fi c e r .        I told         h im    tha t    I wanted            to    buy a t i c k e t

and    he a d v i s e d me              t hat       I was         unlikely          to    b uy     one      in L e p p i n g s        LN    n ea r

the    ground and                 to    go       further          afield a          long     way       from      the    g r o u nd .




I eventually                 got       one       from a genuine                  f a n at    f ac e      value        six    po u n ds .          I

offered          h im    ten       pounds           but      he    insisted           on a c c e p t i n g       only       six       pounds

and    on       condition              t ha t     it    w as      for m y        use     only.




The    rest       of m y          friends           had stand              tickets        a n d at a b o u t       2 . 1 5 pm          (1415)

we    split       up.         My       brother          s t a y e d w i t h me           u nti l      about     2.30        pm    (1430).




I returned              to    the       t u r n s t il e       a r e a at a b o u t         2.30       pm     (1430).            My    brother

went       to    the     turnstiles                 leading           to    the     seating           stands      and       I split          from

him and went                 as    directed             to      the    smaller           turnstile            a r e a m a r k e d B.             At

the    entrance              gates          I w as      confronted               by a P o l i c e O f f i c e r        on h o r s e b a c k

who    w as      attempting                 to    prevent          any      supporters             entering           the    turnstile

rather          than     queues             and     the      officer         appeared            to    be m a i n t a i n i n g        a gap

the     number          of    people         waiting           to    get    inside        the     perimeter           gates          grew

quickly and many                    became         agitated           b e i ng     concerned         t hat     they might                 not

eventually              the     pressure            from       behind       grew       u n til    the    horse        was       turned

round        ninety          degrees.

                                                                                                                                          We




others        shouting             to m o v e      back.            I was     continually            trying          to    e as e     the

pressure.




At     one    p oi nt        two    other         horsemen           t r i e d to      force      the     c r o wd    b ac k        but

merely        ended          up witln^^he               third       officer        and    the     c r o wd m o v e d       into       the

space        left.           There       was      noN^ffy t i v e           c o n tr ol    or     communication                 between

the P o l i c e         and     the      crowd.              Many    people        in the        crowd were           appealing                to       ;

the     Police          to    get       s om e    order        in the       situation.




T he    mass       of    people          gradually moved                   forward,        but     the     crush          continued

ri ght       up    to    the       turnstiles.                 At    one    p o in t     someone        near me           fainted and

he w a s      helped          by two        others            who    got    h im    through        the     turnstile.                 The

heat       wa s    in t e ns e ,        people were                sweating        profusely and             there         was

a    lot     of    screaming             and      shouting.             I managed          to     get    through           the

turnstile           and       h a n d rny t i c k e t          in.      The      turnstile         operation appeared                          very

slow.         At    the       other        side         the    turnstile           I saw an        officer           w ho a p p e a r e d

very       bemused.             Some       people            were    insulting           him a n d      o t h e rs

protesting              t hat      he    ought          to    do    something          about      the     crush outside.




I went        to    the       toilet         to     the       left    of    the     t u n ne l.      When      inside           I

heard        somone          s ay t h at         t he    gates       had    been       opened.          I heard           the       roar       of

t he    crowd and             I think            this        coincided with              the     gate     b e i ng    o p e n e d.         I

went                                                     and      saw     l arg e        numbers         of    people          starting          to

come    through          the      op                       I intended                to       go   to    the S o u t h         s id e     of

the    terracing          a n d as       t h e re        were       no    s i g ns       directing            me    I went          down

the    tunnel        expecting           to m o v e        to       the       r i gh t    hand        side     of      the     terrace.




The    only       stewards         I saw were              b e h i n d a d oo r               leading         up s t a i r s        to    the

stancf>\They appeared                     to        be    standing             on the          stairs         s i de     of    the       door.

There       wereN^p        stewards            at    either            e nd    of    the       tunnel.




My    passage        along        t m ^ tunnel            was       f r ee a n d at            the      end    there          were

about       two    rows      of    peopt^jin              the       t u nn el ,      static.             I worked my way

through       to w h a t       I now      k n o w as           Pen 3 and             I h av e         marked my           original

and    f i na l    position            on the        grid,          although             these        are     only approximate.




My    progress        through           the     ground            to     seek a v ie w i n g             p o s i t i o n was          n orm al

for a       lar ge    crowd        for a b o u t          t en      to    fifteen yards                  but       then       I c o u l n ’t go

any    further.            The     people           in f r o nt a n d            to m y        side      were       so    tightly

packed       it w as       impossible               to move.




I am an       experienced               football            spectator               and       I wanted         to get          my     back      to

a barrier          but     I w as       unable           to m o v e       at all.              T he     pressure          on me

increased and              I w as       gradually              forced          forward.               I was        unable        to

prevent       being        pushed        forward and                   eventually              reached a barrier                      in f r o nt

of me.        I realised               t hat    I may          be      crushed           on    the      barrier          and     I started

to    get    c o n c e r n e d as       a man        in f r o n t         of me          h a d his       legs       trapped

and    was    s h o u t i ng ,     "Me     legs,          Me      legs.”            I w as         eventually            forced          onto

the    barrier        my     ch e s t    touching              the       person          in f r o n t       whose        b ac k was

against       the     barrier.             I tried             to      escape        the       pressure            by    ducking          u n d er

the    barrier        but      o nc e     I did          t h at     I was        trapped.                I was          unable

to    breath.         T he     people          r o u n d me         closed          in a n d        I c o u l d n ’t see a n y             sky.

I seemed            trapped      down       there      for     some      time        b'W    managed         to    force        my.way

up.        From      then      the    pressure         on m y       c h est    increasedkas               if t h e r e        had       been

a su r g e.          I became         very anxious            a n d all        I could           do w a s    aoncentrate

on    the      n ext     bre at h.        Eventually           I found myself                 with a fence               on rny

r i gh t    and      people      the      other      side w h o        were       helj^ng         others         to    scale           the

fence       by      cupping      hands         through       the     fence        and assisting              people           up.           O ne

man wearing             a    long     sleeve        b lu e a n d w h i t e        shirt       h e l p e d me.          I d i d n ’t

have       the      s t r e n g t h at    first      but was         eventually             l i f t e d f r g the        t op a nd

fell       o ve r    onto      people      b e l o w who       c au gh t      me.         I then wandered                off a c r o s s

the    open         terrace      to a       position         near      the     corner         flag.         While        I was

trapped          in P e n 3      I w as        aware      tha t    many       other        people      were       in g r e a t

difficulty             s ome    screaming           for    help and           s om e      very    quiet      too       crushed              to

s c r e am .




I j us t       s t o o d a n d w a t c h e d as        people        poured          over     the     fences          s ome        ,

appearing            like      rag    do ll s .      I h av e m a n y         thoughts           of   events          w h i c h are

surges         but     t h e r e w as     no      crowd movement,              ju st       a greater         amount           of

pressure            on m y     chest.



I wasn't            injured      but      when      I returned           h om e      on    the    evening         I suffered

from       breathlessness                and




There       are      several         p o i nt s    which     I consider              were     a factor           in the

deaths      and       injuries.          Firstly           the      presence          of     side     fences         which

prevented           fans     spreading          out a n d w h e n          the       problems         arose         they were          not

easily      scaleable.            Secondly            the P o l i c e         did     not a p p r e c i a t e        the       severity

of   the    p r o b l e m a n d at       one      t im e      prevented            f an s    scaling          the

fence      and      thirdly      the     start        of      the    g am e     should        have       been       delayed

until      the      spectators, w e r e           safely         inside.




I also      v i s i t e d H i ll s                i| in       19 8 8 w h e n L i v e r p o o l        played Notts

Forest      and       I saw    spectators             pulled         up to         the W S t a n d .          I d o n ’t

think      t hi s     was    because         of a     crush         but    due        to the       discomfort             f e l t by

spectators.             Outside         the     ground          there were            far     f e we r    p eo p le .          I h ad a

spare      ticket       to    sell      and     had      to     sell      below       f ace       v a l u e at      the    perimeter

gates      and      I w as a b l e      to    queue and             get    in as        late as          2.50       pm    (1450)

without       difficulty.               When      I got         in m o s t      people        were       already          in    t heir

place      unlike       this     year        when many were                s t il l     outside.




After      the      m atch was       stopped my views                     are      t ha t    the     facilities            and

number      of      officials        available             to    deal      with       the     dead and           injured

were    insufficient.




I have written a               l e tt er      which        I h a ve       s en t      to L o r d J u s t i c e       TAYLOR

and would           like     to a d d    t h at     he     should         look        at the       following             aspects       of

spectator           sp ort.      First        the     design         of all         grounds          from a safety

viewpoint           both     in a n d    outside.               Second        the     training           of    staff       so    they

are able         to    deal    effectively with a                      life        threatening            situation.              Third

improved         communication               b e t w e e n all       officials              and    forth       t hat      the    paying

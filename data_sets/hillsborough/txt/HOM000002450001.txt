               JULIE ANN WEBSTER       Temporary Control Room
                                       Assistant




On the 15th April 1989 I was  on 6.00a.m. - 6.00p.m. duty in
the Operations Room on Console 5.

At 1513 hours I recieved a call from the Fire Service on their
direct line informing me of a house fire.
I can't remember the address but whilst I was still connected
to the Fire Service I heard Chief Inspector Edmundson shout
to tell them we wanted cutting equipment at Hillsborough
Football Ground.

I told the Fire Service Operator but she wanted to know the
location and I didn't know exactley, I can't remember the
call but I remember there was some confusion as to what was
required and Chief Inspector Edmundson took the phone from me
and explained to them.

[Actions Consolidated by Order of the Honourable Mr.      Justice
Rose dated 14th of May 1990]
                               NOTICE OF APPEAL


TAKE NOTICE that the Court of Appeal will be moved as soon as

Counsel can be heard on behalf of the above named Plaintiffs, On

Appeal from so much of the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice

Hidden in the Consolidated Actions herein given on the 31st of

July 1990 and sealed on the 5th of September 1990 whereby it was

ordered that the action of each of the above named Plaintiffs be

dismissed and that judgment in each action be entered for the

Defendants.



FOR AN ORDER that:



(i)        the   said   judgment     in    relation    to    the   above   named

           Plaintiffs be set aside:



           judgment be entered in each respective action for each

           of    the   above    named     Plaintiffs   for    damages      to   be

           assessed with costs to be taxed if not agreed;



AND that   the Defendant may be adjudged to pay to each of the

above named Plaintiffs the costs of this appeal to be taxed if

not agreed.



AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that the grounds of this appeal are:-



1 .        In each of the actions of the above-named Plaintiffs

           the learned Judge, on the admitted facts before him
applicable to each Plaintiff,                                was wrong to conclude

that the Plaintiff did not come within the range of

persons to whom the Defendant in his management and

control of arrangements at the Hillsborough Stadium on

the occasion of the F.A. Cup Semi-Final football match

on   the      15th       of     April           1989,        owed       a    duty      of    care;

further or in the alternative in so' far as the learned

Judge        founded          his         judgment          on    a     finding        that     the

nervous           shock/psychiatric                    illness          suffered        by    each

Plaintiff was in law too remote a consequence of the

Defendant's              breach            of       duty,        he    was       on    the    said

admitted facts wrong so to conclude;



In each of the said actions the learned Judge in so far

as      he         applied                the        criterion              of        reasonable
        -•                          • -




foreseeability in respect of either the issue -of the

existence           of    a    duty            of     care       and/or      the       issue    of

remoteness of damage, was on the admitted facts wrong

to conclude that the nervous shock/psychiatric illness

suffered by each Plaintiff and the circumstances                                                in

which the same arose were not reasonably foreseeable

to the Defendant                as a consequence of his failure to

take all reasonable care in the said arrangements;



In each of the said actions in so far as the learned

Judge        in    respect                of    the    said           issues,         applied    a

criterion other than reasonable foreseeability so as

to exclude the Defendant's liability to the Plaintiff,

such as a criterion of public policy, the learned Judge
was wrong so to do;         alternatively in so far as in law

the learned Judge was correct to apply principles of

policy so as to limit the Defendant's liability, there

was in each of the said actions no policy consideration

sufficient to exclude liability;



In   the   actions     of    Robert    Alcock.    Peter   Richard

Coldicutt,, John James O'Dell and Alexandra Pe nk;



the learned Judge          excluded   liability   solely on the

ground that the Plaintiff's relationship with his or

her perceived victim of the disaster which occurred at

the Hillsborough Stadium [hereinafter referred to as

the Hillsborough       Disaster]      out   of apprehension   for

whose      fate      the     Plaintiff        suffered    nervous

shock/psychiatric * illness,                was   insufficiently
proximate;



the learned Judge in so excluding liability wrongly

applied a test of proximity of relationship as if it

were a limitation on liability as a matter of law, when

in law the only test was and is that of reasonable

foreseeability;       and on the admitted facts applicable

to each Plaintiff, namely that each of the Plaintiffs

Alcock, Coldicott and O'Dell was present in the Stadium

as a spectator witnessing the events of the Disaster

as they unfolded, and that the Plaintiff Penk witnessed

the same events through the medium of a live television

transmission, the learned Judge ought to have held on
            the   basis      of   the        evidence         before    him    that   it     was

            reasonably       foreseeable            to    the    Defendant         that     each

            Plaintiff would suffer nervous shock/psychiatric injury

            as    a   result      of    such       perception          of    the   events     of

            multiple death             and    injury,         out of        concern   for    any

            perceived victim of the disaster whether or not there

            was any particular relationship between the Plaintiff

            and the victim;             and on such basis the learned Judge

            ought to have found in favour of each Plaintiff;




1   (iii)   alternatively,

            correct in law to apply
                                   in        so far      as

                                                      such
                                                               the

                                                                test of
                                                                       learned     Judge

                                                                               proximity
                                                                                            was

                                                                                             of

            relationship, the relationship in each case was and is

            sufficiently proximate whether by reference to a test

            of reasonable foreseeability or policy or otherwise and

            the learned Judge was in e a c h .case wrong to conclude

            to the contrary;            that is to say the learned Judge on

            the admitted facts before him was wrong to conclude
            that:



            (a) in the action of Robert Alcock the relationship of

            brother-in-law was insufficiently proximate;



            (b)   in   the     action         of   Peter       Richard        Coldicutt     the

            relationship          of         friendship          was         insufficiently

            proximate;



            (C) in the action of John James O'Dell the relationship

            of uncle/nephew was insufficiently’proximate;
(d) in the action of Alexandra Penk. the relationship

°f fiance was insufficiently proximate.



In the action of the Plaintiff Catherine Marea J ones:



the learned        Judge excluded        liability      solely on the

ground     that    the     Plaintiff    had     been    insufficiently

proximate to the material events of the Hillsborough

Disaster    in     terms    of   time    and    place    since   on   the

admitted facts before him the Plaintiff had not been

present in the stadium at the time of the disaster but

had obtained her perception of the disaster and had

suffered the material apprehension for the fate of her

perceived victim of the disaster (her brother) through

hearing news       on the radio         in     the afternoon     of   the

disaster and through seeing, later in theyevening of

the same day, a recording of the events of the disaster

broadcast on television;



the learned Judge in so excluding liability wrongly

applied a test of proximity of time and place as if it

were a limitation on liability as a matter of law, when

in   law     the     only     test      is     that     of   reasonable

foreseeability;          and on the admitted facts before him

applicable to the Plaintiff, the learned Judge ought

to have held that it was reasonably foreseeable to the

Defendant that:



(a) news of a disaster involving multiple deaths and
injuries occurring at a public event such as that which

took place at the Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th of

April 1989 would be broadcast on the radio both as the

events were          still    unfolding    and    in    the       hours   that
followed;

                                                        >




(b) that such a public event and any such disaster

occurring thereat would be televised and recorded by

the television authorities;



(c)   that a recording of the public event and any such

disaster          occurring    thereat    would    be       broadcast      on

television in the hours that followed including the

evening of the same day;

             ••




(d)   that        someone in the position          of       the    Plaintiff

concerned         for   the   fate   of   her    loved-one         whom   she

anticipated would have been on the material terraces

at the time of the disaster, would be listening to the

radio and/or watching the television broadcast seeking

and searching to discover what had happened                           to her

loved-one;



(e) that someone in the position of the Plaintiff would

suffer in the way the Plaintiff did through witnessing

the events of the disaster through the medium of the

radio and/or the medium of the television recording at

a time when the final outcome of the events of the

disaster was still unclear and the fate of the loved-
one was still unknown to the Plaintiff;



and on the basis of such a finding the learned Judge

should have found in favour of the Plaintiff;



alternatively,     in    so   far   as     the       learned         Judge    was

correct in law to apply a test of proximity in terms

of time and place, the learned Judge ought to have held

that on the admitted facts before him applicable to

the Plaintiff, the time and place and manner of the

Plaintiff's       perception        of     the        events           of     the

Hillsborough      Disaster     fell       within           "the      immediate

aftermath" of those events, having particular regard

to the following matters established on the evidence

before the learned Judges
                                                                 /


(a)   that   at   all    material        times       of    the       radio    and

television broadcasts the final outcome of the events
                                                 K

of the Hillsborough Disaster were still unknown;



(b) the fate of her loved-one was still unknown to the

Plaintiff;



(c)   the    Plaintiff        through       the           medium       of     the

transmission of the television recording into her home

on the evening of the 15th of April 1990, the day of

the   disaster,    was    placed     effectively             in      the     same

position as someone physically present at the scene of

the disaster or watching a live transmission on the
television of the events of the disaster;                     and in being

so placed, the Plaintiff was in effectively the same

position as someone physically at the                     scene of       the

disaster searching for a loved-one caught up in the
disaster;

                                     V




and the learned Judge on the basis of such a finding

of the Plaintiff being within the immediate aftermath

of   the   disaster,        ought    to    have        held     there    was

sufficient proximity of time and place and accordingly

found in favour of the Plaintiff.                                         >



In the action of Joseph Kehoe the learned Judge:



wrongly    excluded      liability on        the       ground    that    the

Plaintiff's       relationship      to     his    perceived          victim,

namely     that     of    grandfather            and     grandson        was

insufficiently proximate;                the Plaintiff adopts and

repeats as his primary contention the ground set out

in   paragraph      4(ii)      hereof      in     respect       of     other

Plaintiffs, namely tht the learned Judge was wrong to

apply a test of proximity of relationship as a legal

limitation on liability;            in so far however as on the

admitted facts applicable to this Plaintiff the learned

Judge    was   correct    to    apply      such    a    principle,       the

Plaintiff's relationship, namely that of grandfather

and grandson, was and is sufficiently proximate whether

by reference to a test of reasonable foreseeability,

policy or otherwise, and the learned Judge was wrong
                                                                      naB attM tm aaaaniM       mm




            to conclude to the contrary;



(ii)        was further wrong to exclude liability on the ground

            that    as   the    Plaintiff   had    only       learned         of        the

            Hillsborough Disaster by listening to the radio and

            later, on the same day of the disaster,               by seeing a

            recording of events on television, his perception of

            the material       events was insufficiently proximate in

            terms   of   time    and   place;     on    the    admitted            facts
                                                                                            I


            applicable to this Plaintiff the learned Judge ought

            to have held that the time, place and manner of the

            Plaintiff's        perception   of    the     said    events                was

            reasonably foreseeable to           the Defendant      and/or               was

            sufficiently within the immediate aftermath of those

            events, as to give rise to liability on the part of the

            Defendant.                                            ^



AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that the Plaintiffs propose to apply to

set down this Appeal in the Queen's Bench Division Final and New

Trial List.

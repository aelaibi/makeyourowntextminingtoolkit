direction           and       saw a    surge          of    such       a degree            that      it w a s       far       fiercer

than       anything           I had    ever        witnessed             before       and       I attend            football

matches        as       a supporter             on a       regular        basis.            Again       the       supporters

appeared           to    return       to     their         original         positions             as    like       a w a ve.

Although           at    this     t im e     1 did         not    see     any       supporters              climbing           over         the

that       supporters           from       the     terrace,            pens      3 and        4 were         being        assisted               by

was     trouble       and we may            be    required.

I a s s u m e d at this          stage       that     the    crowd      in the        pens    had      been fighting,

although        I couldnt         actually          see any myself.

We s tood       up as a group and                  I assisted with              the    carrying         of the

pens 3 and 4 onto                the       pitch.      I was       then met          by Peter W E L L S who was

returning          from the L e p p i n g s         LN end.          I hadn't been aware                he had       left

He a s k e d rne to go w ith                him to our A m b u l a n c e         to fetch an            oxygen       bottle

and mask,          because       people were           being       crushed       dead and dying.                 I ran

By    this     time    there were            considerable            numbers         of s u pporters         lying         on

into his mouth.                 After     about       a minute         there was           no    response at all.

The     only other            thing    1 can     remember          about       the     description            of this

e l d e r l y man was          that    he had a                                      nose.         While      we were

doing      this        supporters       w e r e climbing           over     the      fence       to the       pitch.            In

clean shaven,             medium       build.         He was       squashed          between        the      elde r l y man

directly          infront       of me     on the       other       side     of the         fence       I saw other

supporters,             who were       packed, tightly             crushed up against                   each other.

Their      heads were           d r o p p i n g and    their       eyes     closing as             if falling a s l e e p

and. then bringing                their      heads     back      up opening            their       eyes as       if

fi g h t i n g    to stay       conscious.            Some     of them didnt               bring       their     heads

back     up.        In p articular           I noti c e d a ma n           (3)      who was        behind      the     two       I

have     described            he was    very     close        to u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s .       His    head was

nodd i n g       and    eyes    were    closing.         He was          in his        early thirties             clean

sh a v e n w i t h short         light       brown hair.             I can't         remember what             he was

w e a ring,         Slightly         behind     him and        to his       right       squashed          up against

him was anot h e r             man    in his     early        twenties.             He was       head and

s h o u ld e r s above m a n          (3).      He was        still      conscious          and didn't           appear          to

be     in immediate            danger     of    passing        out.       He was a p p a r e n t l y able              to

br e a t h alright.             I shou t e d to him to nip the                       ear    of man        (3).        He

shouted          back    "I    cant mo v e . "        His arms were              t r a p p e d down by his

sides.           I told him to bite              the rnaKs ears.               He    leant       his    head     forward

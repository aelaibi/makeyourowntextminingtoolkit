 Dated                 200390


            On Saturday/l5th April           1989    (150489)      together with my brother

            his son             we went to Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield to

            watch t         semi--fi nal

            When we entered the ground through the Leppings Lane entrance we made

            our way to the side of the North Stand byyXjate 7 and I stood there

                             with          w hwent
                                              i 1st to his seat in the^Worth Stand.

            The match started about 3 pm (1500) and my attention had been drawn to

            the two centre          pens under the West Stand which had a tremendous             crush

            of supporters       in them.

           The game was stopped because of people                    coming onto the pitch and

            climbing out of the pens.               I saw Policemen pushing the fans

            back   into the pens and trying to get them off the fences around the

            pens.I    saw a lot of supporters           coming onto the pitch and then saw one
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                   S3864

          in particular stagger out onto the pitch into the penalty area

          towards our side.      Has he got level with the      penalty spot he was

      ^   still staggering and at the time          I thought he ctyuld have been drunk

          but since realise     it could have been through A h e     effects of being

          crushed.    I would describe the man about g y y e a r s   of age of average

          appearance and I cannot      remember what hjr was wearing.

          Just as he got level with the p e n a l t y spot a Policeman in Uniform

           earing a flat peaked cap like the A e n i o r     officers wear   came up to the

           an from the North S t a n d directiom and deliberately punched him in the

           ace.     The supporter   put his h ^ d    up to his face and fell to the

           round.     The Police Officer just walked on towards the West Stand

           eaving the supporter      lying on the ground,     without giving him any aid

           t all.     Because of what was taking       place with jio many people on the

           itch,    I then lost sight of the supporter a t h e        Policeman.

            am definate the Policeman had a peaked jfep o n and also a shorter

           ypecoat     on which came to just above iVfs knees.        I cannot describe

          him any further and would not be abljr to identify him.

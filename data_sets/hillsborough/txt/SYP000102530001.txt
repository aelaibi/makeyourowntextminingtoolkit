Over 21                                                              â€œ   1
Police Sergeant 894


I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police, presently stationed
at the HQS Training Centre, The Common, Ecclesfield.


At 9.45am on Saturday, 15 April 1989, I reported for duty at Hillsborough
Football Ground, Penistone Road, Sheffield, to be briefed on duties to be
undertaken in connection with the F.A. Cup Semi Final Match scheduled to
take place there that day.


Commencing at 11.00am the same day I took up m y role as the Supervisory
Officer over Serial 62, comprising of the following personnel
PC   93 Turner            Operations
PC 1126 Smith             Operations
PC 2389 Martin            A2
PC   80 Marvin            A2
PC 1414 Gordon            A2
PC 2649 Bashforth         A2

As a mobile patrol operating under call sign Tango Eight the role of this
Serial    was   to   patrol       the       Southey   Green   and   Herries   Road   areas   of
Sheffield.      Accompanied by Inspector Wallace, Serial 62 constantly toured
the aforementioned district without incident until 3.00pm, when a radio
call was received instructing all available officers to report to the
Ground.      On arrival at the stadium gymnasium our Serial was instructed,
along with countless other officers in attendance, to standby ready to act
to prevent crowd disorder.              Comments were being made inferring that people
had been trapped in the Leppings Lane enclosure and on trying to escape
this environment some supporters had suffered serious injury.
                                                                                                        (?P\
                                                                                   2.



At approximately 3.15pm L was directed along with my Serial and numerous
other officers on to the football pitch to be strategically placed in two
ranks along the halfway line across the full width of the pitch.                           The two
ranks were stood back to back so as to face and divide Nottingham Forrest
supporters located at the one side on the Spion Kop end of the ground from
the Liverpool contingent occupying the Leppings Lane end of the ground.


The   pitch     area was      a scene of utter confusion,           particularly at the
Leppings Lane end.         Hundreds of people were spread all over the playing
surface, some just standing, others strolling about aimlessly, others just
sat or lying there.            There was a mixed air of feelings and emotions
displayed,      ranging    from   utter      bewilderment    and    shock    to         anger     and
frustration, some were obviously intoxicated. Word was spreading amongst
the people that life had been lost in the melee as the crowd had sought to
escape from the Leppings Lane Stand.             Due to the endless number of people
on the pitch I did not observe any dead bodies though officers and members
of the public could be seen stretchering people from the pitch, after what
seemed     an   age   where    order   was    difficult     to   muster     from        chaos,     an
announcement      was made      over   the" tannoy    system     resulting     in the            slow
dispersal of the public in the ground.               It would be approximately 5.00pm
when I resumed - to take up crowd control duties on roads surrounding the
ground.

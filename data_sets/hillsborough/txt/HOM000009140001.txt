         HILLSBOROUGH PUBLIC INQUIRY

         1.   You will be aware that former Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, who was
         in charge of policing at Hillsborough on 15April 1989, is facing a private
         prosecution for manslaughter.

         2.     I though that I should let you know that Mr Justice Collins (Counsel to the
         Inquiry), Peter Whitehurst (Assistant Solicitor to the Inquiry) and I (Solicitor to
         the Inquiry) have been approached by Mr Duckenfield's solicitors (Winckworth
         Sherwood). I enclose in this connection copies of Winckworth Sherwood's letter
         to me of 12 November (with its enclosures).

         3.    You will see from this that Mr Justice Collins and Peter Whitehurst have
         already given statements and that I have now been approached with a view to
         being interviewed and giving a statement. Subject to my checking the file, any
         statement which I gave would be along similar lines to that given by Peter
         Whitehurst.

         4.   I would propose to respond positively to Winckworth Sherwood's letter, but
         thought that the Home Office would wish to be aware of these approaches.

                  A copy of this letter (with its enclosures) goes to Stephen Parkinson.

Dear M r Brummell

Hillsborough Public Inquiry

I refer to my telephone discussion w ith you on 12 Novem ber 1999. As advised we
currently act for M r David Duckenfield, the former C hief Superintendent o f South
Yorkshire Police who was in control o f the police operation at the H illsborough football
disaster on 15 April 1989. M r Duckenfield is currently facing a private prosecution for
m anslaughter in relation to two o f the deaths that occurred at Hillsborough.

As part o f the defence that is being m ounted on behalf o f M r Duckenfield, we intend
making a challenge to the admissibility o f the evidence given by M r D uckenfield at the
Taylor Inquiry. We are concerned that M r Duckenfield gave evidence to that Inquiry
w ithout the benefit o f independent legal advice and without the knowledge o f matters raised
in a Salmon letter addressed to M essrs Hamm ond Suddards, the solicitors acting for the
South Yorkshire Police at that time. As part o f our investigation into this matter we have
taken statements from M r Justice A ndrew Collins QC, lead counsel to the Taylor Inquiry,
M r W illiam W oodward QC, lead counsel instructed by Messrs H am m ond Suddards on
behalf o f the South Yorkshire Police and M r Peter Whitehurst, your assistant solicitor to the
Inquiry. To complete the picture w e w ould very much like to m eet w ith you to interview
you w ith a view to preparing a statement for signature by you in relation to the issue o f the
distribution o f Salmon letters and all related matters. To assist you w ith your recollection o f
events at that time I enclose for your information a copy o f the Salmon letter in question
together w ith a draft o f the statement w e have prepared for M r Peter W hitehurst. Matters
that we would be seeking to discuss w ith you are similar in vein to those contained in M r
W hitehurst’s statement.

I request that you consider the material attached together with any other material you have
in your possession (and I note that your assistant Kim has extracted from your archives
docum entation relating to this matter) and that you contact me to discuss matters further
with a view to arranging a time for us to meet. Please note that I will be in Bristol until

S ig n atu re:......... ............................ ...............................................




1.      I am an Assistant Treasury Solicitor and a m em ber o f the Senior Civil Service. I am

         currently appointed as the solicitor to the Bristol Royal Infirm ary Inquiry.


2.      In April 1989 I w as appointed to assist the solicitor to the Public Inquiry into the
         Hillsborough Disaster, M r David Brum m ell. Initially the Treasury Solicitors appointed

         to assist the Inquiry were based in London but as the Inquiry w as to be based in
         Sheffield, a team consisting o f myself, 3 other staff and a secretary set up an office in

          Sheffield shortly after the announcem ent o f the Inquiry.

3.      I recall that West M idlands Police were appointed to investigate the Hillsborough

        disaster a matter o f days after the disaster took place on 15 A pril 1989. It was decided
         at a very early stage that the solicitors to the Inquiry w ould be given access to the

         m aterial gathered by the W est M idlands Police as and w hen the m aterial became
         available. It was our task, as solicitors to the Inquiry, to sift through all the material
         produced by the W est M idlands Police to determine what m aterial w as relevant and

         should be produced to the Inquiry.


4.       I have a vivid recollection o f the material arriving from the W est M idlands Police by the
         box load. I understood th at the W est M idlands Police were using the H olm es computer

         system to log the statem ents taken from potential witnesses before delivering the same

         to our team for evaluation as to relevance to the Inquiry.       T he statem ents and other

         m aterial received from th e W est M idlands Police were delivered to us w ithin days o f the

         statements being taken from the witnesses.


5.       It w as the view o f the solicitor to the Inquiry that the fans should give their story to the
         Inquiry first to put the disaster in context. As the statement gathering process w as not

          an ordered process, one o f our m ain tasks was to sift through all the statem ents and put
          them in order for presentation to the Inquiry. It was decided that the evidence to the

          Inquiry would be presented in the following order:


          5.1.    fans


          5.2.    South Y orkshire Police;


          5.3.     Sheffield W ednesday Football Club;


          5.4.     others.


 6.       A lthough the initial review o f the material produced by the W est M idlands Police was
           carried out by the T reasury Solicitors team, the final decision on m atters o f relevance

     and the decision on w hether any material would be produced to the Inquiry w as with
     Counsel.        M r Andrew Collins QC was appointed as C ounsel to the Inquiry and he,

     together with his 2 juniors A lan Goldsack and Bernard Phillips, had the final say as to

     w hether a statement or docum ent w ould be produced to the Inquiry. T he procedure was

     for m y self and the other Treasury Solicitors to review the statem ents before referring

     potentially important statements and material to M r Collins and ju n io r Counsel for their

     assessment.


7.   For the purpose o f this statement I have been shown a letter dated 9 M ay 1989 from the
     Treasury Solicitor’s office to M essrs Ham m ond Suddards solicitors.         I recognise the

     letter as a “Salmon” letter.     The purpose o f this Salm on letter w as to advise Messrs

     H am m ond Suddards, w ho acted for the South Yorkshire Police, o f the general criticisms

     that w ere likely to be raised during the Inquiry. It is likely that I had som e input into the
     preparation o f the letter given m y role as the Assistant T reasury Solicitor to the Inquiry.

     I am sure that the letter w ent through several drafts and w as considered by Treasury

     Solicitors and Counsel involved in the Inquiry before the final draft w as settled upon

     and forwarded to H am m ond Suddards.


8.   The Salm on letter w as addressed to H am m ond Suddards as they w ere acting for the
      South Yorkshire Police. I w ould have expected that H am m ond Suddards w ould refer
     the Salm on letter to individuals w ithin the South Y orkshire Police that were to give

      evidence at the Inquiry. It w as m y understanding at all tim es that H am m ond Suddards

      represented not only the South Yorkshire Police but the individual officers and that M r

      W oodw ard QC w as instructed by H am m ond Suddards on b e h a lf o f the South Yorkshire

      Police and individual officers. I do not recall any consideration being given to separate

      representation for individual officers by the Inquiry team.


9.   Follow ing receipt o f the Salm on letter I would have expected H am m ond Suddards to

      consider each individual officer’s statement in light o f the criticisms raised in the

      Salm on letter.

10.   For the purpose o f this statement I have been asked to recall the protocol for the

      distribution o f m aterial received by the Inquiry solicitors.     I recall that the Inquiry
      solicitors were receiving a large volume o f material including police statements, other
      statements, video tapes, docum entation on stadium construction and various other

      m atters on a daily basis. The Inquiry team then scrutinised the m aterial to determine

      that w hich should be distributed to all interested parties. T he m aterial w as then copied
      and distributed to all interested parties. All material that w as distributed w as distributed

      to all parties concerned. A list o f the material that was distributed w as kept and a note
      m ade confirm ing distribution to each interested party.         I recall that material was

      distributed from the Inquiry office at least on a daily basis but given the short timeframe
      in w hich we w ere w orking it is likely that there was only a short tim e between the

      distribution o f m aterial to various parties and the giving o f evidence by those parties.


11.   F or the purpose o f this docum ent I have been asked as to w hether I have any

      recollection o f any potential criminal prosecution being addressed by the Inquiry team.

      I do n ot have any recollection o f that matter being addressed b y m e and I am not aware

      o f the m atter being addressed by Counsel to the Inquiry or by L ord Justice Taylor.

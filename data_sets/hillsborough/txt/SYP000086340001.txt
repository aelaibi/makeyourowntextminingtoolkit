We    entered            the    g r o u n d at             about      3.10          pm a n d we w e r e        positioned             in/front

goal      are a ,        on    the       pitch.             Looking            towards       the     Leppings         Lane       i^nd of        the

ground         I could          see          t ha t    there         were       people       being        pulled      intcy the           seated

area      above.              The       Notts         Forest         f ans      were       agitated        and    sorneV came           to     the

fence         and    tried          to       climb         o ve r    believing             that    the     s i t u a t i o | m w as       in

end      of    the       ground and               stood         in f r o n t         of    the    Nots     Forest       end      beck-dning

them       in a t h r e a t e n i n g             manner.             The       youth       ran    b ack    to    the      otheij/end

after         being       challenged                  a n d w as      soon arrested.                  At    the    Leppings             Lane

was      getting          larger             by   the m i n u t e ,            as    people       ran to a s s i s t         and      fans

spilled         onto          the       pitch.             I could         see       people       making       makeshift

stretchers               from       the       advertising                 boards          around     the    pitch.           Some       Notts

         One      y o u t h w ho           was     a L iverpoo 1 supporter                          came     to     the    fence        and asked             to

         be    let      o nt o        the       pitch       to    join       his     friends.              An     officer         clo s e     by    told

    w.   me    that         he    had a l r e a d y          thrown          out     of    the       ground         regs     by    hi            I t he n

         told      me       t h at     he       had    pur c h a s e d a t i c k e t            o u ts i de       the     gs'&und for            £25

         see      bodies          on a d v e r t i s e m e n t          board and              people        l y i/g      obviously           injured

         I returned               to m y         position           in f r o n t      of       the      cop a n d       hadn't       been        t her e

         intent         on       causing           trouble         with       the     Notts          Forest         fans,     with        only what

         appeared            to       be    our       serial       to     stop       them.           At    this      point        I began          to    fear

         for      my    own       s a fe t y .         As    the     fans       got w i t h i n           o n l y a f ew y a r d s          of     us a

         line      of       officers             came       from     the      tunnel           and      formed a          cordon across                 the

         pitch         slowly          pushing             the    f ans      b ack    to       the      Leppings          Lane     enclosure.




         By    now      both          ourselves             and    the N o t t s          Forest          f ans     had    come      to     realise

         how      serious             the       s i t u a t i o n at      the      Leppings             Lane      enclosure          h ad     been,

         and      the       f ans      began          to    calm.         Bodies          by    this       t ime     were     being         placed

         n e ar    the       goal          as    there       appeared           to    be       no    room       in the a r e a          behind          the

         stand.             Shortly             after       this     the a n n o u n c e m e n t           w as     made     t hat      the      match

         would         be    cancelled                and    the     majority             of    the       Notts      Forest        Fans       left       the

         ground         in a n         orderly             manner.

R i v e 1 i n Bank at about               2 . 1 3 pm 1415.

I parked my           car    in Far Ln near               to the     j u n c t i o n wit h Dykes Hall          Rd at

about 2.20pm           1420.

As    1 walked        to the gr o u n d          I noticed nothing             unusual.           There were     large

numbers      of Liverpool               suppo r t e r s     in the area.            Many of the         supporters

were    eating        and dr i n<k i nc/'f r orn beer            cans    but   I did not witness any

d r u n k e n or behaviour              that     could be        considered, disorderly.

As    I walked        down L e p p i n g s       Ln towards        the gro u n d      I noticed         there was a

large    flow of supp o r t e r s               heading      in the same        direction.

1 a r r i v e d at     the L e p p i n g s       Ln entrance at about 2.3 0 p m                   1430.    There

were    large        groups       of    suppo r t e r s     in the are a       standing ar o u n d outside

the    terrace        turnstiles.               The    queues     for    the standing a rea were about

tw e n t y yards along and                  three      or four     people      deep.      The      queues were

orderly.         There were             no queues         for the       seating a rea and myself and my

son ga i n e d access             to the ground with ease.                     The    seating       entrance     is

situated        to    the    left       of the        terrace     turnstiles.          The    only      problem we

had was      struggling            t h r o u g h the      large    crowds      of    people       standing aro u n d

11"!e s t a nding      entrance.

At 2 » 3 5 pm    1433 we          took      our seats.           From    our   position there was a clear

view down onto              the t e r races           d i r e c t l y below.

At about        2 . 5 0 pm 1430         I looked down and               noti c e d that      pens 3 and 4 which

a r e s i t ua t e d d i r ectly          behind       the goal      w er e pa c k ed w i t h pe o p I e .      In my

opinion      there were            far      t o o many      people      in these      pans.        I w ou ld   think

pressure        of the       crowd        behind.         There was       no singing         or    clapping     from

the    terraces.            The    people        looked so t i g h t l y       packed they were            unable      to

At about 2 . 33p m           1453       I noticed         that    people were         trying       to   climb the

                                                                                                                  S2405

fencing          but were       having       great      difficulty           in trying       to   pull     t h emselves

out    of the          crowd.      This      c o n tinued as the             players       came out      onto the

p itch.

As    the game          kicked off        the supporters               tried to attr a c t          the a t t e n t i o n

of Police           O f f icers who were at                 the L e p p i n g s Ln end by waving and

sh o u t i n g    but    the O f f i c e r s     seemed unaware              that    there was a problem.

The    only are a of te r r a c i n g             I could see was              from about         halfway down to

the    front.           I could not          see the         tunnel     at    the    back    of    pens three and

four.        I did       not w i t n e s s a large            surge     but    I did see a forward

movement          of    people w h i c h       I now assume            to    be the tail          end of a large

s u rg e .

At 3 . 0 2 p m      1302     people were          climbing        the       perimeter       fence and trying            to

lift other             people over,          there were about                four Police Officers              pushing

them     back.          I cannot       describe         these O f f i c e r s       in an y detail.

At 3. 0 3 p m       1503     I saw a boy being                lifted        over    the   fence     by other

su p p o r t e r s who       had m a n a g e d    to    climb the           fence.        he was a white          lad

a ged about            13 years      old,      his     limbs were           lifeless,       there was       vomit

coming       from his mouth.                 He had fair          hair       and was wearing           beige

trousers          and a light          coloured T shirt.                    He was    placed near          to edge      of

t h & p i t c h o n t h e g ra s s .

At    this       point     there were more and more                     people       climbing       over    the    fence

Police       Offic e r s      were     now     pulling        people        out of    the    crowd over        the

•Fences.          People were also               being       pulled up        into    the    seating area above

I saw a P o 1 ic e S u p e r i n t en dent              run o nt o the         p i tc h and the game was

s to pped .

I saw a Police Officer                    open the           gate at        the front       of the     fencing.

Within       seconds more and more Police                        Offic e r s        a r r i v e d and began trying

The    playing area soon became a mass                            of    people       some   of whom a p p e a r e d

injured.            I cannot ela b o r a t e           on    incidents        on the      pitch because           of the

             g r o u n d at about 3 . 2 0 p m       1520.

             I would          like    to add that        prior   to kick off          it a p p e a r e d that   there was

             no-one m o n i t o r i n g     the    crowd on the West S t a n d              terrace.

             A fter     the     disaster     there was       no a n n o u n c e m e n t    of what was    occurring

             made      over     the   tannoy system.

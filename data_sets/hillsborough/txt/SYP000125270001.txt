 IT WAS A CHAOTIC SITUATION.        A YOUNG LIVERPOOL FAN RAN THE jL          iGTH

 OF THE PITCH AND STOOD GESTICULATING IN FRONT OF THE FORES/Pft/lS. HE WAS

 PITCH INVASION AND BEGAN CHANTING “HOOLIGANS” ETC THE FAN RAN BACK AND WAS

 CAUGHT BY A PC AND TAKEN OUT.         MORE PEOPLE CAME ON THE PITCH. THE FOREST

 FANS THOUGHT THE INJURIES WERE SELF INFLICTED ON THE FENCE.

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.     AT 11.30 AM (1130) I SAW NUMEROUS FANS FROM BOTH CLUBS WALKING AWAY FROM

THE GROUND TOWARDS THE CITY.      FROM PAST EXPERIENCE I KNOW THEY WERE

GOING TO THE PUBS.      I SAW SEVERAL PEOPLE WAITING AT THE PUB DQORS FOR OPENING

TIME.
                                       T I O vC ^ T
2.      I RECOGNISED A TICKET TOUT OUTSIDE THE GROUND

        THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF FANS WHO CAME INTO THE SPION KOP END

MINUTES BEFORE KICK O F F .   I COULD TELL THEY HAD BEEN DRINKING BY THE SMELL

ON THEIR BREATH AND THEIR RED FACES.       A GROUP OF ABOUT FORTY JUST BARGED

PAST US AND ONE OR TO ARGUMENTS DEVELOPED.

AT ABOUT 3.20 PM (1520) THERE WAS A DISTURBANCE IN THE CROWD BEHIND ME.          THE

WORD GOT DOWN TO US THAT IT WAS LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS FIGHTING NOTTS FOREST

FANS.      PEOPLE WERE GESTICULATING TO THE POLICE ON THE PITCH TO COME INTO

THE STAND AND QUELL THE TROUBLE.        THE POLICE DID NOT RESPOND AND SHORTLY

AFTERWARDS IT WENT QUIETER WHEN PEOPLE REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE

^ p E R END.

 I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT LONG BEFORE KICK OFF I COULD SEE THINGS

WERE WRONG AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END.       JUST BEFORE THE PLAYERS CAME ON PENS 1

AND 2 WERE VIRTUALLY EMPTY.      THEN THERE WAS A SUDDEN AND MASSIVE SURGE OF

PEOPLE ENTERING.      I ’D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE AND I’M SURE

 THEY HADN'T COME IN THROUGH TURNSTILES IN THE NO/M^L WAY.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE? SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN A LOT OF POLICE LEFT IN RESERVE AT MY END OF THE

 CONFUSED BY THE EVENTS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE LET SO MANY FANS ASSEMBLE OUTSIDE

 THE LEPPINGS LN END BEFORE THEY OPENED THE GATES.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1.     I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE POLICEMEN BEING LINED UP ACROSS THE PITCH

 I THOUGHT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO BETTER USE,

 2.     THE ACCESS FOR THE EMERGENCY SERVICES WAS INADEQUATE.

 3.     TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION TO THE CROWD FOR A LONG TIME.

     AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

! FROM THE MOMENT THE HATCR^WAS STOPPED THE FANS STARTED CLIMBING THE         FENCES

     AND COLLAPSING ONTO THE PIThw.      THIS CAUSED THE FOREST FANS TO JEER , BUT I

     FORMED THE OPINION THAT PEOPLE\ w ERE INJURED.  AT THAT TIME I THOUGH THE
       c a t             £    C o M y y j •
i   POLICE RE ACTED SLOWLY AND WHEN I^RE     OFFICERS ENTtRED THE FIELD AND WENT TO

     THE L.EPPINGS LANE END THINGS STARTED    TO GET DONE.   WITH THE JEERING OF THE

j    FOREST FANS THIS CAUSED A NUMBER OF LIVERPOOL FANS TO COME DOWN THE PITCH

     IN A THREATENING MANNER , THIS MEANT OTHER OFFICERS HAD TO FORM A LINE TO

     PREVENT FANS CLASHING WHICH WASTED POLICE PERSONNEL BUT SEEMED NECESSARY.


    Q20


     m
     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

     JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

     I FEEL STRONGLY THAT MEMBERSHIP CARDS WOULD NOT HELP FOOTBALL IN ANYWAY„

     AND THAT SEVERAL CLUBS HAVE MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES BUT IT IS NOT INSIDE GROUNDS

     WERE THE MAJORITY OF PROBLEMS ARE, IT IS OUTSIDE AND AROUND GROUNDS.

     THE REMOVAL OF FENCES WILL NOT WORK AS FANS WILL INVADE PITCHES AND

     RUNNING FIGHTS WILL AGAIN BREAK OUT ON PITCHES.
;

     I CANNOT GIVE ANY LONG TERM ANSWER TO FOOTALL PROBLEMS, TO ME A SMALL

     PERCENTAGE OF TROUBLE MAKERS ARE BRINGING THE GAME INTO DISPUTE AND IT IS THIS

    U h l E N T THAT MUST BE PUNISHED.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ANNOUNCEMENT MADE INFORMING THE NOTTS FOREST FANS

 WHAT HAD HAPPENED. AS MOST OF THEM THOUGHT          IT WAS A PITCH INVASION AND

 STARTED CHANTING AT LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE TOTAL LACK OF FIRST AID EQUIPMENT AND LACK OF INITIATIVE TAKEN BY THE

 E|g?GENCY SERVICES TO ASSIST THE INJURED.          I FEEL THE POLICE IN PARTICULAR

 COULD HAVE DEPLOYED SEVERAL OFFICERS FROM THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD TO AS SIST

 IN THIS WAY.          THERE WERE FANS WALKING AROUND IN SHOCK WHO NEEDED ASSISTING.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

If.IVERFOO^ SUPPORTERS.

 (b) TICKETS SHOULfrygE ISSUED FOR PARTICULAR SECTIONS OF A TERRACE WHERE

 PENS EXIST.     THERE SHOubK|40T BE FREE MOVEMENT TO ALLOW BUILD UPS OF

 THIS NATURE TO OCCUR. THE GROl)N<L COMPUTERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

THE PEN CAPACITIES INDIVIDUALLY.

        EMERGENCY SERVICES HAD VERY POOR ACCESS TO THE STADIUM, AS A RESULT

 CONGESTION OCCURRED WHEN TRYING TO REMOVE CASUALTIES BY AMBULANCE.

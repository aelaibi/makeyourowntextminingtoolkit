HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


You wrote to Mr Sweet on 3 May with various documents and
statements relating to the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry.

In accordance with our normal practice, we have passed these on
to the Treasury Solicitor, who as you know, is preparing the
evidence for consideration by Counsel for presentation to the
Inquiry. It may be that the Treasury Solicitor will want to pass
on some of these documents to the West Midlands Police, who, as
you know, are conducting the detailed inquiries on behalf of Lord
Justice Taylor.

Perhaps I could mention that we have received direct from
Silverman Livermore the three bound volumes of the statements
which you sent to Mr Sweet.

            horsemen and six of my officers who tagged along with the agreement of

            Inspector Ellis.                 However due to the large numbers on the grass verge

            outside Halfords on Penistone Road,                        drinking and the large numbers of

            people still          in the area,              together with two officers,               I remained at my

            location.         It was now well                passed 1400 hours and fans were arriving

            by coaches,          several of which were dropping off                      in Penistone Road.                         My

            officers prevented at least six coaches from dropping passengers off

            the coaches,          in Penistone Road near Wadsley Bridge and directed them                                                    •

            to the drop off points in Halifax Road.                            The mood of the fans at this                                      ‘

            time was excited,                jovial,        but the vast majority were ©till drinking

            to find the rest of the serial and regroup ready for th# second

            phase.     However at Claywheels Lane,                     another mobile serial were
present.       Inspector Wardie amongst them.           The request from Ground

Control was received for all serials,                outside and at Claywheels Lane,

to go straight to Leppings Lane end of the ground.                  At this together

with other officers          I ran to a Police van and travel led to the ground

along Lepping Lane end,             passed several    serials of Police officers.

At this point no one understood or could see what was happening.

Once outside Lepping Lane             I met up with Inspector Ellis and together

we commandiee red other        constables and formed a cordon outside the

outer gates at Leppings Lane.                There were several ^undred fans \

outside wanted to gain access,                I then went to the away fans entrance

the West stand.           I was outside the ground when bodies wert being

persons were being laid down near the edge towards thi r l v f /i ’

helped to form a cordon of constables to shield the injured and

were directed toward the                        injured.

Doctors       came      forward also and were utilised accordingly.                                               I still at

this    point          had    no     idea       of    what      had     happened,          many       constables                were

walking          aimlessly          about        having         been     separated             from       colleagues             and

were    in my opinion                lost as to what to do.

Radio transmissions                   at this time were                   few and still               the       full    tragedy

was     not       known.            I,     at    no        time       handled       any        bodies,           other          than

directing             where     to       place       persons for            treatment.               All the           bodies       I

directed as such,                  had police             officers or civilians with them.

Once    I     entered         the        area    A/G       I    went     towards        the         tunnel,       many          fans

were    there         crying,        upset,          angered.          I attempted             to move          the     fans       to

what    now       was       becoming        a sterile             area.      (Area      1-16).             Many        moved       on

and     were          appreciative              of     what       everyone          was        trying to              do,       many

refused          to   move     and       showed        their      anger       towards          me    and        other       police

present.              I was     unable          to     clear       the       tunnel       of    fans. The              area      A/G

apart       from      the     tunnel       area was            almost       cleared.       Then        I directed               five

constables            up     the     stairs          to     the       seating      area        of     the       West        Stand,

where       in        the     passageways             behind,          people      were        stood, awaiting                   the

game    to restart.

At this time            I was not aware                   of whether the match had been abandoned

but    decided          under       the     circumstances               that      it would           be.         I therefore

instructed             the    constables              to       quietly       ask     who       was        present        to       get

their       families,          friends,          etc.,          and    to    leave      the     stand.            Surprising

the fans left peacefully,                        many asking how many were dead,                                  to which I

could not answer.                    The match had not been officially                                    called off,             but

fans    accepted             that    it would          be      and left.          The   odd      one       or    two passing

comments              about        Police            inadequacy             and      that           the     Police               were

repsonsible             for    what       had        happened.         The    vast      majority            however             being

stunned and shocked,                     left        the stand with little                     fuss.       It was       at this

point I was able         to enter the seating area of the West Stand and saw

the   commotion     on    the    field.    The   bodies    of    the    dead       having       been

already   cleared     from the pitch.          I helped   to clear the seating                  area

fully   and   after      which   I   decided   to make    my    way    back   to    Claywheels

Lane, where I was able           to re-group my serial.

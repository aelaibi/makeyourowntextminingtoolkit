                The atmos ph er e     seemed     good and they seemed         to b e    in good   humour,

                although    I     was s up rised      to see the    fans were   still     there   d ri nking at

                this    time and did not appear            to be    in any    rush to get towards         the

                ground for        the match.       I. would     estimate that   the    pub was    about 2       1/3 3

                miles away        from the     gro un d avid w ith the volume      of traffic     that were

                the    coaches    to get     there.

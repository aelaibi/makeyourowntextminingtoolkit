in                     We knew each other as a result                       of drinking          in public

houses        together.

We    planned to go                 together       to the        railway    s t at io n    in Hull    and travel             to

H i l l s b o r o u g h for         the match.            On the    15th April          1989 the four of us met

at    the     railway s ta t io n at about                   10       am and we had a rr an g ed             to meet

            in Sheffield.                  We got      on pfie train at about               11.00 am and          I was

not aware              of any       other    supp or te rs        on this     train.        We were we ar in g

L i v er p o o l       scarves       but apart         from that we were            dressed       in normal         casual

clothes.               The    train was          direct     to S h e f f i e l d an d     I think    the    only

s up p o r t e r s      picked up on route were a small                        group from N o t t i n g h a m and

they     got       on at D oncaster.                We did not         consume any alcohol             en route and

I did not see a n y b o d y d ri nking alcohol.

We a r r i v e d at           the m a i n railway stat io n               in S h e f f i e l d at about      12.30       pm

an d we were met                by

On our arrival                 at    the    railway stat io n          I saw a number of Police

Officers           near       to the exit and they a p p e a r e d               to be s eg re gatin g        the

various         s upporters and                 I now know they w o u l d         have      been d irecting          the

s up po r t e r s       to the a p p r o pr i at e         coaches     outside      the station.            Our    train

was    from Hull              and as       such    I dont think           they were        too   concerned about

the    people           on it,       however       they did ask us w here we were                    from and

we    told      them we were               meet in g      someone and       that we w ou ld be ma king               our

own way to the ground.                           I did not        notice any other           s upporters      in the

railway stat io n and there were                            no    incidents     of violence          or fighting.

After meeting                          we had a cup of tea                 in the S t at io n       buffet an d we?

t hen w a l k e d thro ug h the m ai n bus stat io n and we                               caught a number 71?

bus    to the ground.                  There were           very    few people          on this     bus and       I d o n ’t

t hink      there were any more                    s upporters       on it.       A ga in there was          no

alcohol         drunk         in our       group and no one else was                    drinking     on the bus.

               We    r ea lized that          once    our    jour ne y had        c o mm en ce d that we were         on the

               wrong        bus a nd we t r a v e l le d on a very               long    route     to the ground.           We were

               on the        bus    for about        forty minutes and              it w a s n ’t until      the    last ten

               minutes        that       I saw an y signs         of supporters.

               As    stated my first              sighting       of s uj/po r t e r s was as we         passed a public

               h ouse       in possibly Fo;< Hill.                Vaont         know the      name    of the      pub but    there

               w ere a bout         one h u n d r e d AL i va r po o l    s up po rt er s    standing      outside    drinking

               alcoh o l .         The y a p p e a r e d Jgo be quite           o r de rl y and    I w ou ld say that the

               time     of this          incident was about              1.20    pm.     I made      comment that      I was

               surprised           to see any        pubs open       in the a rea because              they are      normally

               closed.         During       the    rest of the           jour ne y there were          quite a

               n umber       of m a i n l y L i ve rp oo l      s upporters w al ki ng         in an orde rl y fashion on

               the    footpaths           in the     d ir e ct i on of the ground.                I did not see any

               incidents           of violence        or d runkeness and               I did not see any           persons

               drinking         alcohol       from    cans.

               We    got     off    the bus       near    to an    island at           the end of L ap pings Lane and

               we w a l k e d along         this     road towards          the    ground.         It w ould be about

               1.30     pm at       this    time and a l t h ou g h there was a lot of s upport ers about

               they were walk in g a bo ut                freely     in both directions.

               We were asking              s u pp or te rs   for S P A R E S     (entrance        tickets)     and we were

               unable        to get any.           I did not       notice any ticket               touts    in this    vicinity

               but    I did note           there were        hundreds        of other        people without         tickets and

               they were           trying     to buy them         like we were.

               We were        uns uc ce ss fu l      in L ep pings Lane           so we      turned aro un d and wa lk ed

               into P e ni st on e R oa d where              the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       supporters were

               a rriving.           On   reaching        this    location        I became      aware    that      there were a

               number        of Liverpool          suppo rt er s also           trying      to buy    ’s p a r e s ’ from the

               F o r e st    supporters.           We w al k ed to the j un ct i on of Winster R oad and                      I

a c c e p t e d my offer and              I g r f u l l y      accepted       the    tickets and        paid him

the money.            He     did not h ^ e           any more       tickets     for my mates.           I w ould

not descr ib e           this m a n \ * £ a tout         in view of the             price    he accepted,         and

I w o u l d describe              him as about         40 years       of age,       stpcky     build,    and

ca su al ly dressed.                I am unable         to descr ib e        him j&ny more and he was               not

w e a r i n g any     club colours.              The    tickets were          Pbr the S pi o n Hop,

occupied          by N o t t i n g h a m Forest and had a face                  value    of £6 each.

A l t h o u g h we    did not want             to enter       that    part of       the ground     it    is common

kno w l e d g e    that      once you have a ticket                  for a ny wh e re    if you ask the

Steward          on the      t u rnstile you wish             to enter       if you     can go into that

part     of the ground he will                   accept your          ticket and a ll ow us entry.

I was aware           that        the Live rpool        supp o rt er s    had been a l l o c a te d the

pens     in      front      of    it.

We w a l k e d     into L ep pi n gs          Lane and saw that           the    crowd had built up

c o n s i d e r a b l y since my first               visit and there were              still   a large        number

of    people asking               for   tickets.        A g ai n    I did not see any ticket              touts          in

L ep p i n g s Lane.             We were able         to make       our way quite freely towards                  the

t urn s t i l e s and a g ai n          I did not see any             instances        of violence       or

drunkeness.              My friends           r e m ained w it h us until           this stage as we

attempted          to get tickets              for    them,    but    they were        unsuccessful.          It was

my    int e n t i on on          reaching      the t urnstiles         to enter        the ground at

queues w h i c h s t r e t c he d back               for a distance          of about 20 feet           before

turning          into an u n or g a n i z e d mass of              people.      I sav^That       the queues

were     o r g a n i z ed    but    the    people      in them were          c rushed and were          being

                 In this        location          I only       saw one        police        officer       and there were          no

                    empty and         I then       c o nc e nt r at e d on the game and            paid no particular

                    a t t e n t i o n to what         was    happening        in the a dj o in i ng     pens.

                    The m a tc h had been              in progress          for a short while and just after

                    Li v er p oo l    had hit         the    crossbar       I saw a number         of suppo rt er s wan de ri ng

                    about at         the   back       of the Liverpool             goal.    I saw some of the             supporters

                    were    in distress and holding                       their    stoma ch s and were        being ushered

                    towards      gate       1 where         I was    standing.        On their arrival           at this         gate

                    the    police      officer was            throwing        them t h ro ug h the gate         into Pen         1.     I

                    looked to see what was                    hap pe ni ng and        I saw that       the supporters            had now

                    s pi ll ed onto        the     playing      surface        but    I was    unable     to see where           they

                    came from.             I did not see any               persons     climbing      the/fences          from where             I

                    stood.       I soon         r ea lized that           there was     chaos          this area and the

                    m at ch was       stopped.

A bout    five minu t e s        later        I saw a fire ma n go to him and a ga in                     heart

At about         the     same   time as        I first       saw this man my a t t e n t io n was                drawn

t owards        pen A3 on the map from behind the                          goal.       The y    laid this man

down on the            pitch and a        police       officer         or St Johns man tried              heart

m a ss a g e    and m o u t h to m o u t h      r e s u sc i ta t io n on him but they gave                   up after

a while.           I w o u l d d es crib e      t j f i s man as a bo u t 18 stone, very

eventually            pulled o ve iy hi s       face.        The    two men d escribed did not appear

to have any visual               injuries and           I stood there             in disbelief          thinking             I

was     having a nasty dream.                   Their       faces were         e xp re ss i on l es s and they

just     looked as           though    they were asleep.                  As   I stood at my           location          I

heard a girl             who was      s ta nding      to my    left ma ki ng a gurgling                 noise.

Suddenly         she went       quiet.         I heard a bang a n d / s a w she                had fell       to the

point A4.          and      laid her    down.         This    gi r l    was    out    cold and        I dont    think

she was         breathing.           I looked a ro u nd /he             pitch and saw bodies

               I saw a young            boy a ge d about         14 years         lying    on the     pitch at ^ o c t i o n

               A5.       I can't     describe        this boy apart            from him being          shirtlessand

                          told me he had seen a Police O f fi ce r                        place     his helmet         on top of

           it was        true.         E v e ry o ne    could see that there were masses                            of    people

           off    the       tunnel       and sending             the fans       e» t e/ing      to the sidejr w hich were

           empty.           I did      not see an y signs              d irecting           fans    to the^side           pens and          it

c5tOpsj6   is the r e fo re          obvious         that    fans w o ul d make             for tl\e j T i r s X    visual

           e nt r a n c e    to the ground,                that    being       the tunnel.           My final        c ri ticism        is

           the    obvious          one     in that         the    respective          suppo rt er s were a l l o c at e d the

           wrong        ends      of the g ro u nd as             it is well          k n^wn that the Liverp ool

           supporters             o u t nu m be r    the N o t t i n g h a m    supp or te rs       two to one.

           O n the a p p r o a c h to the               tu rns ti le s     tha^e were           no ticket          checks made          by

           the Pol i c e and a g a i n               I think       this ]/ b a c o n t r i bu t or y factor.                I

           feel     that         I p r obably sh ou ld have J ze e n              turned a wa y and told to go to

           the    end to w h i c h my ticket                     referred.

           I would          like to        conclude         by saying          that    I ma y have been vague                   in

           respect          of    certain events

           s ho u l d    I feel        I can be of further a s si s t a n c e                   I will      contact you.

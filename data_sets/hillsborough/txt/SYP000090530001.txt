him but         I did not see him a g a i n once we had e nt e re d the                      terrace.        The

reason we went            to the       left terrace P en 4 was              beca us e to the        right

s e emed very crowded.                We w al ke d d ow n the terrace              towards    the    pitch and

a g a i n out to the        left.        At this stage           it was     very    c ro wded a nd    it was

d iff ic ul t     to find a spat w here you felt                   comfortable.          As we made         our

for Kick         off.

Because         of the    crush       1 could not m ove          e ve n my arms w h i c h     I held a c ro s s

my     chest.      The    three       of us were    still        together.         I n o ti ce d that      play

I saw that fans            to my       left were    j um ping      over     the fence     out of P en 4

          Once                        had joined me          in P en 3 I saw that the gate w h ic h                    led

          onto    the    pitch was       open at the end of Pen 3.                    We made       our w ay onto the

          very upset all around.                 I jumped up i r>?o the p erimeter fence and

          s ta r t e d to pull     people up from Pejpr4.                           was   sat on the         pitch at

          this stage w i t h a n o t h e r       fan,    I had a ls o         lost sight      of              and

                         I was gra bb in g       people by the arms,               hair or a n y t h i n g just        to

          pull   them out.         At    this time       I still        did not know          if there was any

          fatalities.        W he n     I was    on the fence           some P ol ic e    tried to get me down,

          I swore at them a nd            told them what              I was     doing was only what            they

          could have        done.       I do not      remember a ny           part ic ul ar   p erson      I h el pe d at

          this    stage.

          I got down off the fence after about                          five    or ten m i nu t e s a nd then I

          saw    people     lying on the         pitch some            a p p e a r e d dead a nd others were

          gasping       for air.        I saw the Police had                put a line of m en a cr os s          the

          fans apart       but the       line seemed to stay foiyrtluch longer                       than necessary.

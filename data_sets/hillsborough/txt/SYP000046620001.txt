    NOTE FOR FILE



    On Wednesday             25 April      1990    I attended the Police Complaints Authority                                     in

    London and handed three copies of my report to Captain E N TAYLOR, who was

    supervising the complaint.                     After reading and discussing the file the PCA

    Certificate         was     issued      and     later       that      day    the    file      was    handed        to Mr       S

    WALKER of the South Yorkshire Police Authority.



    On Friday 27 April 1990                   I attended the               South Yorkshire Police Sports                         and

    Social Club building                in Sheffield where                 a meeting        of the       South Yorkshire

    Police Authority Finance and General Purposes Sub-Committee was meeting to

    consider my report.                 At the conclusion of the meeting I was called in and

    the Chairman thanked me                   for my report.               He explained that the findings                         in

    my   report        were     all    accepted      and        no    further         action     was     to     be    taken       in

    respect       of    Mr    WRIGHT,      the     Chief     Constable.               The   Police       Authority          would

    telephone          the    three     complainants            and       send    them      an    appropriate              letter,

    before        issuing       a     Press       Release.            If    I     wished         to     visit        the     three

    complainants,            that was a matter for me.



    At about 4 pm that day I visited Mr DEVONSIDE at his home address,                                                     and at

    5.30     pm    I    visited       Mr    HAMMOND        at       his    home       address.          In    company         with

    Detective          Superintendent            DARLING        I     explained         the      general        line        of   my

    investigation            and    read    out     extracts         from       the    papers     which       justified          my

    findings and recommendations.



    On Monday 30 April 1990 at his business address                                     in Keighley,          I visited Mr

    HICKS,    together with Superintendent DARLING.                               I explained in some detail my

    investigation into his complaint against Mr WRIGHT and read out appropriate

    extracts.          He expressed satisfaction with what I had done and had found.




    NB      I am unhappy that on Thursday or Friday 26 or 27 April 1990 the
           Yorkshire Post    and the Sheffield Star newspapers published articles
           which indicated   that my report had been "leaked" to them before the
           Police Authority meeting.   The "leak” could only have come from one or
           other of the sub-committee members.         ______________________

                     THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
                                  BY MR TREVOR HICKS


   On 7 February 1990 Mr Hicks w rote to South Yorkshire Police Authority detailing a
   number of complaints against the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Mr P e te r
   Wright.

   The allegations made by Mr Hicks, re la te to press interview s given by Mr Wright about
   the Hillsborough disaster. Mr Hicks alleges th a t Mr Wright abused the privilege of his
   position, by suggesting th a t inform ation would com e to light during the inquests th a t
   would present a different picture from th a t portrayed by Lord Justice Taylor's rep ort of
   th e incident. Mr Hicks alleges th a t these com m ents a re outside Mr Wright's jurisdiction
   and could prejudice the verdict of the coroner and inquest jurors. Mr Hicks further
   alleges th a t by inferring th a t th e re is additional information available which was not
   presented to Lord Justice Taylor during the public enquiry, Mr Wright seeks e ith e r to
   deliberately mislead, or failed in his duty to provide Lord Ju stice Taylor with such
   information.

   complaints and they were referred to the Police Complaints Authority under Section
   87(l)(b) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The Police Complaints Authority
   decided to supervise the investigation under Section 89(2)(a) of the Act. The Authority
   approved the appointment of Chief Constable Mr Leslie Sharp of Cumbria Constabulary
   as Investigating Officer.

   The Investigating O fficer's report was received by the Authority on 25 April 1990. The
   report was accompanied by 7 s ta te m e n ts and 16 o th er documents including the record of
   interview with Mr Wright

   The m a tte r has been thoroughly investigated to the satisfaction of the Police Complaints

  officers and his-own reputation. Mr Devonside fu rth er alleges th a t making sweeping

                 1. 3     In    these         articles    many     remarks     and     opinions          regarding     the

                          Hillsborough disaster of 15 April 1989, and the subsequent enquiry

                          and     reports       into     that    incident     by    Lord     Justice       TAYLOR,     are

                          attributed to Mr WRIGHT.                It is those remarks             and opinions which

                          have resulted in the complaints being made against Mr WRIGHT.

                       In    1975    he     was    appointed       an    Assistant        Chief    Constable        of    the

                4.     THE COMPLAINTS

                4. 1   The    three       complainants          made    their    complaints        by    letter     to    the

Docunent File          South Yorkshire Police Authority in February and March 1990.                                      The
Pages 7-10             complaints were referred to the Police Complaints Authority and on

                       2 April 1990 I was appointed investigating officer.


                4. 2   I    subsequently          saw     all   three    complainants        and      recorded     written
                       statements from them in which they repeat the allegations made                                      in

                       their letters to the South Yorkshire Police Authority.                                  It should

                       be    noted        that     whilst       making     his     statement        of    complaint       Mr
                                                        Continuation Form                                        Page No 4




                        DEVONSIDE was accompanied by a Mr                                      who was introduced to

                        me as a solicitor.


                 4. 3   Mr   HICKS      makes    seven       specific     complaints.            He      alleges       that   Mr

Statement File          WRIGHT has       abused his          privileged position            as     Chief      Constable       by
      1-5               making     public       statements,         which       have      b e en        reported       in     the

                        Sheffield Star newspaper,               concerning the Hillsborough disaster and

                        the enquiry and reports by Lord Justice TAYLOR into that incident.
                        He also alleges that Mr WRIGHT is attempting to pervert the course

                        of   justice,      particularly         with      regard    to      the       pending        Coroner's

                        Inquests, by making such statements.


                 4. 4   Mr DEVONSIDE makes             two    specific     complaints.             He    also    alleges       Mr

Statement File          WRIGHT has       abused his          privileged position            as     Chief      Constable        by
Paggs 6-8               making     such       public     statements        and     that     by        doing     so     he     has

                        attempted to exert persuasive influence on the judicial system.



                 4. 5   Mr   HAMMOND      makes    two       specific     complaints.              He    alleges       that    Mr
Statement File          WRIGHT's statements could affect the impartiality of jurors in any
Pages 9-11
                        related      judicial      proceedings,           and    that     by       making       such    public
                        statements       the    Chief    Constable        has    abused        the      privilege       of    his

                        rank.


                 4. 6   It   should      be     noted        that   the     complaints           made      by    the        three

                        complainants are remarkably similar in content.



                 5.     POSSIBLE OFFENCES

                      d)      Abuse of Authority.



                 6.   CIRCUMSTANCES
                      I have conducted the investigation into the complaints made by Mr

                      HICKS, Mr DEVONSIDE,            and Mr HAMMOND with the following in m i n d : -



                      (1)     Did Mr WRIGHT make public pronouncements                          in line with those

                              alleged to have been made?



                      (2)      If he did make such pronouncements,                   what did he say exactly?


                      (3)     By saying        those words did he commit any criminal offence?


                      (4)     Also,       by    saying       those     words,       did    he commit         a        police

                               disciplinary offence?



                      (5)     In saying        those words did he act in any way injudiciously?



                      (6)     In publishing Mr WRIGHT's                words, did any other person commit

                               a criminal offence?


                      I will       discuss      each    question       in    turn    and   in so      doing,          I    have

                      repeated      and   duplicated many            of the     quotations       and    extracts            for

                      the convenience of the reader:-



                 6.   Did    Mr    WRIGHT      make    public       pronouncements         in    line       with          those

                      alleged to have been made?



                      That Mr WRIGHT was              interviewed by press           reporters         on    5 February
                      1990    is    beyond     any     doubt.        There    is    written      evidence         from       Mr

                      WRIGHT       himself     and    from     Mr    HANNA    that    on    that      date       at       South
                      Yorkshire        Police         Headquarters,           Sheffield,         Mr     WRIGHT              was

                      interviewed         by    Mr     HANNA    with    the     intention of          both       that       an

                      article,       based      upon     the    interview,         would be published                 in    The
                      Sheffield Star newspaper around that date.                           Further corroboration

                      is supplied by Superintendent PRATT,                      South Yorkshire             Police,         who
Statement File
Page 14               was present at the interview.
                                                            Continuation Form                                        Page No 6




                      It was       the    intention of both Mr WRIGHT                   and Mr HANNA to cover                  in
                      the     interview          and       subsequent          newspaper      article,          Mr    WRIGHT's

                      previously announced retirement but both knew that the subject of
                      Hillsborough inevitably would be raised.



                      Although          neither      Mr    WRIGHT     nor      Mr   HANNA    say    so    expressly,         they

                      must    be    taken       to    know     that      the    subjects      of    the    interview         were

                      likely       to    be    of    such    public      interest      that    other       newspapers         and

                      media    would          seek    to     use   the    information         published         through       the

                      normal press             and media network for communication of                           information.
                      In fact this proved to be the case and articles appeared later in
                      other newspapers,              eg The Guardian.



                      The only other newspaper interview given by Mr WRIGHT on that date
Document File         was to The Times newspaper in which an article was published based

                      upon the interview with The Times reporter.                                  Because that article

                      is not mentioned by                  any of the complai n a n ts , I have                  confined my

                      investigation             to   the     interview with           The   Sheffield       Star       and    the

                      subsequent article in that newspaper.


                6.2   If Mr WRIGHT did make such pronouncements what did he say exactly?


                      Evidence          is available as to the exact words used by Mr WRIGHT                                   in

                      the interview with Mr HANNA of The Sheffield Star because Mr HANNA

                      made a tape recording at the t i m e .                        That tape has been transcribed

Document File         and reveals most of the exact words used by both Mr WRIGHT and Mr
Pages 16-23           HANNA.        Some       few parts       of the tape          are difficult         to hear but no

                      material          part    of   the     interview         is missed because           of    that.        The

                      article which             appeared      in The        Sheffield       Star    on    5 February         1990

                      has    been        copied,       the    copy    has      been    acknowledged         by       the    three

                      complainants,            by Mr WRIGHT          and by Mr HANNA.               The    Sheffield Star
                      newspaper has a circulation of about 140,000 copies daily,                                           mainly

                      in the Sheffield area.

6. 3   By saying those words did Mr WRIGHT commit any criminal offence?



 (A)   The   first    offence         to be    considered          is that         of Contempt             of Court

       both at Common Law and in the Contempt of Court Act 1981.


       A useful      definition of contempt of court is that of Lord DIPLOCK

       in Att.    Gen v       Times Newspapers               (1974) A.C.           273;       (1973)       3 W.L.R.

       298; 117 S.J. 617;             (1973) 3 All E.R.             54:-


                     "The due administration of justice requires                                      first

                     that all citizens should have unhindered access to

                     the        constitutionally                  established                courts        of

                     criminal            or      civil            jurisdiction                for        the
                     determination of disputes as to their legal rights
                     and      liabilities;         secondly,              that      they       should be

                     able       to    rely     upon     obtaining            in    the       courts      the
                     arbitrament of a tribunal which is free from bias

                     against any party and whose decision will be based

                     u p on     those    facts     only       that       have      b e en     proved       in
                     evidence adduced before it in accordance with the

                     procedure          adopted       in courts of            law;       and    thirdly

                     that,       once    the     dispute          has    b e en    submitted          to    a
                     court       of    law,     they    should be            able       to    rely     upon

                     there being no usurpation by any other person of

                     the function of that court to decide                                it according
                     to law.           Conduct which is calculated to prejudice

                     any      of      these    requirements             or    to    undermine            the

                     public confidence that they will be observed is a

                     contempt of court."



       In the Contempt of Court Act 1981 at                             Section 1,           there is a strict

       liability rule whereby conduct may be                            treated as contempt of court

       regardless of intent.


       The     strict         liability         rule        applies to            any    speech,           writing,
       broadcast,      cable          programme        or    other       communication              in     whatever

       form,   which       is      addressed      to        any    section         of    the    public.         The

       "comma" after the word                 'broadcast'         is omitted in the Act.

In Mr WRIGHT's        case the giving of the interview to The Sheffield

Star newspaper reporter using the words he chose to use,                                           seems to

be covered by the strict liability rule.



For the rule to apply, however,                     there has to be a substantial risk

that    the    course       of     justice          will           be     seriously            impeded      or

prejudiced.


              "the   risk      that has        to be          assessed         is       that which

              was    created      by    the    publication               of    the       allegedly
              offending          matter        at        the       time       when        it     was

              published.          The public policy which underlies                               the
              strict     liability          rule         in    contempt            of    court        is

              deterrence.              Trial        by        (media)         is    not     to        be

              permitted in this country.                        That the risk created

              by the publication when it was                            actually published
              does    not      ultimately           affect         the     outcome         of     the

              proceedings is neither here nor there."


              Evening Standard Co. Ltd (1954) 1 Q.B.                                578,    582.



The    proceedings      alleged        to   have         been      prejudiced            can     be    in   the

criminal court or coroner's courts, but those proceedings must be

"active"      for the strict liability rule to apply,                                    and the accused

must know that these proceedings are "active."



For criminal proceedings to be "active" the criteria in Schedule 1

of the Act require specified initial steps to have been t a k e n :-



a)      arrest without warrant;

b)      the issue of a warrant for arrest;

c)      the issue of a summons to appear;

d)      the    service      of    an   indictment             or    other      document          specifying

        the c h a r g e , or

e)      an oral c h a r g e .

In        Mr        WRIGHT's        case         it    cannot         be     said       that         any     criminal
proceedings                were        "active"        so     as     to     create       strict            liability.
However,             the     Coroner's           Inquests       into       the    95   Hillsborough               deaths

were       "active"           in    that        the    Inquests       had b ee n        opened        on    19    April

1989       and adjourned on 20 April 1989 and Mr WRIGHT knew that.                                                  I do

not       need        to     consider            any    civil        actions        which       may        have    been

commenced or stayed except to say that the definition of contempt
is wide enough to embrace improper interference with negotiations

between              parties       to       a    pending        cause        (see      Att.        Gen.      v     Times
Newspapers             (1974)          A.C.      273   ante).         Section          2 of     the Act           limits
strict liability by reference t o :-



     i)        the nature of the conduct complained of;

 ii)           the risk of interference with the course of justice;

iii)           the seriousness of the interference if it was to occur, and

 iv)           the stage reached by the proceedings.


To these I wo u ld add that there is an element of public                                                    interest

in general discussion being permitted.


The        "substantial                risk"      that        the     Coroner's         Inquests            would     be

"seriously"                impeded or prejudiced does not m ea n that the risk must

be    weighty,              but    rather         "not      insubstantial"              and     "not       minimal."

Perhaps             a more        useful        explanation would be                   that     if    there was        a

reasonable possibility that Mr WRIGHT's pronouncements might have
seriously              impeded         or       prejudiced          the    verdicts        of      the      Coroner's

Inquests,             then his intention one way or the other is irrelevant.



At this stage then,                     it seems that:-



     i)        The    Coroner's          Inquests        were        "active",         and      Mr    WRIGHT       knew

               that fact;
 ii)           Mr    WRIGHT        published           words        about        the    business           of     those

               I n qu e s ts ;
iii)           If     that       publication           created        a    substantial           risk       that     the

               business          and    verdicts         of    the        Inquests      wo u l d     be     seriously

               impeded or prejudiced,                    then Mr WRIGHT is guilty of contempt

               of court irrespective of his intention.

Because      of Mr WRIGHT's                 national             and local position and standing,

it     is        likely        that        anything              he    says           publicly              will           be        of

considerable         public           interest.              The public                are       likely          to    believe

that       any    Chief       Constable          has        access         to,        and    knowledge                of,       much

information not                generally known to others.                               This           is particularly

so    in Mr       WRIGHT's           case       in     respect         of    Hillsborough.                        He       is    the
local       Chief        Constable.               His       police          force           had       dealt        with          the

tragedy          and both       he     and his          force         had been              consistently                   in    the
public spotlight throughout Lord Justice TAYLOR's enquiry,                                                                 in the

Interim Report of the enquiry and indirectly                                                in the Final Report

of    that       enquiry.            So    clearly,          by       using       the       de        minimus          rule          of

strict           liability           for       contempt,              it         can        be        said         that          the

"substantial risk"               element of contempt is present.                                           He wo u l d know

of    the    substantial              circulation                of    The       Sheffield                 Star       to    whose

reporter he was speaking.                            He must have known that his words would
be read avidly b y a large number of people,                                            words which would be
repeated          in various          media          even        though          outside          of       The     Sheffield

Star       and     The     Times          the        words        published            would           be       hearsay              of

hearsay.          He would also know that some of the readers of his words

would eventually be empanelled as members                                             of the           Inquest juries.
But     whether          or     not        the       substantial             risk           of        prejudicing                the

Inquests          amounts       to    serious           impediment               or    prejudice                needs       to be

considered.               If    Mr        WRIGHT's          words          were       uttered              as     part          of    a

discussion          in    good        faith       or    matters             of    general             public           interest

then       they    cannot        be       treated           as    a    contempt             of        court       under          the
strict       liability          rule       if the risk                of    impediment                or prejudice                   to

the Inquests is merely incidental to the discussion.



For the strict liability rule to apply there must be proved a real

threat to          the    fair conduct or outcome                            of the          Inquests.                 In this

regard it has to be borne in mind that a jury is more likely to be

swayed by prejudicial matter                            than a Coroner.                          So    it       is always             a

serious matter to utter words publicly which may prejudice a jury

towards a particular verdict.                               But this does not mean there should

be    no    discussion,          publicly              or    otherwise,               when        it       is     simply         the

continuance          of        public           discussion             already              begun           provided             the

continued          discussion             is     not    used          as    a vehicle                 to    prejudge             the

                    cause.           Prejudgement          may    occur     by      a     direct    assertion        that       a

                    particular          verdict      will    be    reached,         or    by     stating    a     conclusion

                    about a particular issue in a case, or by making a statement which
                    might make          the    Inquest reach one            conclusion rather than another.

                    The       Inquests,       of   course,       are not       adversarial         so    there    can be       no

                    question,          in Mr WRIGHT's case of defaming,                         dissuading,      persuading

                    or        deterring        any    particular           individual            juror,     witness,           or

                    plaintiff.          The question is a difficult one which perhaps                                is best

                    addressed          by    considering         whether       or   not    Mr     WRIGHT's       words    were

                    fair and a c c u r a t e .


                    In order         to do     this    it is necessary              to consider          the exact words
                    used by Mr WRIGHT                to Mr HANNA,         the Sheffield Star reporter                     on    5

                    February 1990,             and not what the reporter chose to publish in the

                    subsequent          newspaper         article.     Although            Mr    WRIGHT has        stated on

                    more         than one      occasion      that    the       quotes directly            attributable to

                    him in the article are a fair reflection of the comments he made,

                    they are not in the order that he made them.                                   From a study of the
                    full transcript of the interview it is also clear that the direct
                    quotes are not in the context they were m a d e .


                    From the transcript the following matters can be confirmed:-



                         i)    The     interview was         called       as    a    result       of Mr    WRIGHT's       pre-

                                announced retirement from the Police Service on 1 May 1990;



                     ii)         That both he and the reporter knew that Hillsborough and the

                                Lord     Justice      TAYLOR       Interim          and    Final        Reports    wo u ld be

                                raised;


                    iii)        That both Mr WRIGHT and Mr HANNA were aware of the legal and

                                other constraints            acting upon them both.                     In respect of Mr

    Document File              WRIGHT I draw attention to Home Office Circulars 79/1981 and
    Paggs 58-65                 115/1982       which were         addressed         to    all    Chief    Constables        and

                               which        relate   to    the Contempt          of Court Act            1981 and    to     the

                                strict liability rule which is within it.

                 iv)   Understandably Mr                     WRIGHT        saw       a     need           to        explain         any

                       relationship between his forthcoming retirement and the Lord

                       Justice TAYLOR enquiry reports.



                  v)   Mr WRIGHT made it clear that he would go as far as the legal

                       and       other          constraints              would       allow        in      respect           of      the
                       Hillsborough tragedy.                            He even drew attention to advice he

                       h ad      received            from      the        Police         Authority             solicitors            by

                       sayin g : -


                                " ......         I've got           a    letter       from       our          solicitors
                                saying that I must not discuss the detail or pass

Page 17                         opinions          where        under          different         circumstances                I
                                would       like       to    be     open       about      it    but       I    can't        so

                                you'll have to understand that."



                 vi)   In the interview (and in his letter of retirement) Mr WRIGHT
                       made it clear that all material and information likely to be

                       relevant            to     the       Taylor        Enquiry        had     b ee n       passed        to     West
                       Midlands            Police        which          was     investigating                 the     matter        and

                       servicing the enquiry:-



                                ". . . . every          item       of     evidence        that     was         available

                                was    put       in     - and       it was       all brought              out       in    the

Document File                   open       and       that's       what    the       purpose      of    the          enquiry
Page 17                         w a s ."


                vii)   W he n       questioned               during           the        interview             he        speculated
                       reasonably               about        the    performance            of     some         of     his        senior

                       officers at the Enquiry without naming them:-



                                ". . . . I've         tried to put myself                   in their position

                                where      they were,              the senior            officers      who'd          taken

                                action          on     the     day,       being          questioned            in     great

Document File                   detail          about       the     events       that      took    place            in    ten
Page 18                         minutes,         quarter           of an hour over              a period of six

                                weeks       nearly          and     not    just       that      but       barristers,
                                                Continuation Form                                           Page No 13




                            highly         trained           barristers, following                 each other

                            picking and         probing           for    any    factors            that would

                            help     their          case    or reduce          their    responsibilities
                            and    officers           under       those      circumstances          naturally

                            were perhaps not themselves."



                       It   is worth       recalling here                that    the       evidence     given at         the
                       TAYLOR Enquiry was unsworn and not subj ect to the rules                                           of

                       evidence applied by the courts.


                viii) Mr    WRIGHT    asserts              that    he    was    not    launching        an    attack      on

                       Lord Justice TAYLOR,                 choosing to refer to the Interim Report

                       rather than         Lord Justice TAYLOR himself.



                 ix)   He defended         his senior officers further w h en he sa id : -


                            ” ....    Perhaps          if you've made               decisions,         or    taken

                            action or made                 decisions         to take action,            or made

                            inhibited in terms of answering questions.                                      But we

                            all had,        I don't know whether                      you can       see,      this
                            feeling        of       incredible          sense    of    guilt      merited          or

                            not."


                  x)   A n important piece of dialogue ensued which requires careful

                       scrutiny      because           it       not      only    appears          in    part        in   The

                       Sheffield      Star          article,        but      also     is    at    the       core    of   the

                       complaints against Mr W R I G H T : -


                            Mr     HANNA        -    "Do     you      feel     that    the       Sheffield         or

                            South Yorkshire public was as critical if you like

                    Mr WRIG H T     - "It's difficult isn't it.                       I mean you

                    can only go off what people tell you whether they

                    tell y o u one thing and someone else another but                                  -

                    there    seems      to be    a broader          understanding               - you

Document File       see Lord Justice TAYLOR was dealing with evidence
Pages 18-19         and     he    was    emphasising          the       evidence          that      was

                    available and one wouldn't expect him to do other
                     than that.         What    I found difficult               to understand

                    was     the     finding     that        there was        drink    amongst          a
                    percentage       of the     f a n s , and       that      they were under

                     the    influence of        drink,        but it had no               effect      on

                     the    events.       I     could       just find         that        a    little

                     difficult to come to terms with, but that was Lord

                     Justice       TAYLOR's      findings.              And    I     accept          his

                     findings.       He had the responsibility of coming to

                     conclusions        from the evidence               that was          given and
                     those were         the   conclusions          he   came    to.           I think
                     his final report is a superb document.                           I think he

                     recognises all the ills that are part of football

                     and in fact were present on the day."


                At this juncture it is worth noting that the manner in which

                The Sheffield Star article reports this statement presents a

                much more        provocative meaning           than the reasonable words                         of

                Mr WRIGHT        present when         set    out    in full.          Of       course      it    is
                only the article to which the complainants had access.                                          The

This     is    an     important             question             because        the       response          could

indicate       whether              or    not     the       additional              information,            which

the    complainants                 allege Mr WRIGHT mischievously                               claimed       to
have,       related to the effects of drink on the fans,                                               deceased
or otherwise.



       Mr WRIGHT replied - "I don't know."


       Mr     HANNA            -     "You've          not         been         in     charge           of

       collecting the evidence obviously."



       Mr WRIGHT           - "No we've not                    - but        - there will be
       another        hearing              and     that          will      have           been        the

       Coroner's           hearing           and        I        think     it        will        be     a

       different          hearing           and    I        think    a     lot       of    evidence
       that         perhaps          -     Lord         Justice           TAYLOR          was         not

       concerned with the rules of evidence,                                        that enquiry
       was not concerned with the rules of e vi d e n c e .                                           The

       Coroner's               enquiry           to         some         extent           will         be
       constrained by the rules of evidence and I think a

       different picture will                         emerge.            What        I'm anxious

       to     do     is        to    make        sure        that        all     the       evidence

       whatever           whether           it's        for        the    police           or     it's

       critical           of       the    police,           goes    forward          because           if

       things have been done wrongly then they must never

       happen again."


At this point Mr WRIGHT was clearly uphappy with his answer
because he next said:-



       "No.         It's       not       come     out       as     I wanted          to    say        it.

       It's almost as                    though    - It's almost an admission

       that        they    were           though        I    wasn't        wanting          to        say

       t h a t ."


       Mr HANNA - "Do you want the question again?"

Document File          Mr    WRIGHT       -       "What     I    want        to    say     is       that    Lord
Page 19                Justice         TAYLOR's          enquiry       is    finished.              It is the

                       Coroner          who       is now     going         to     conduct       a    different

                       enquiry.               He's       going     to       go     into    detail.               The

                       Coroner's          enquiry           will        go        on    for     months           and
                       perhaps          a different picture will                         emerge       from       the
                       Coroner's          enquiry         than     emerged             from Lord Justice

                       T A Y L O R 's enquiries."


                 It is worthy            of note that              this correction by                  Mr WRIGHT         is

                 not reflected in The                     Sheffield Star article.                      The       dialogue

                 c o n t i nu e s :-


                       Mr        HANNA        -    "Is      it     true          that     he        will        have

                       additional evidence?"


                 Until now there has been nothing to suggest that Mr WRIGHT,

                 by referring to additional                           evidence,          is referring             to fans,
                 deceased         or     otherwise,             affected          by     drink.            In    fact,   Mr

                 WRIGHT's         responses          thus       far     in       the interview         suggest         just

                 the     opposite.                The     reply       to     this question             is        therefore

                 important:-



                       Mr WRIGHT          - "Yes there will be a lot of evidence
                        presented         to       the    Coroner's             enquiry       that    was        not
                        presented         to Lord Justice                   TAYLOR's       enquiry which

                       may        put     a        different           complexion             on      the        end

                        product."



                 It is important to note at this point that the complainant,

Document File    Mr HICKS,         uses part of this quotation as it appeared in the
Pages 4, 7, 19   Sheffield Star article.                         Although Mr WRIGHT and the article

                 use the word "m a y " , Mr HICKS ignores it in his complaint and
Statement File   had        to    be     corrected          when        he        was     making           his     written
Page 3
                 statement.

                      There       is nothing          in     Mr WRIGHT's reply, or elsewhere                             in     the

                      transcript            of         the interview,                which suggests                that         the

                      additional evidence would or might relate                                        to drink but             the

                      manner       in which           the    article        is presented               in The          Sheffield

                      Star     could          be interpreted           that          way         by     selectivity            and

Document File         juxtaposition              in   respect         of    the       quotes.           On       the    contrary
Pages 13-15           there       is    good       evidence      as     to what            Mr    WRIGHT          believed       the
      30-37
      48-52           additional evidence would be in his letter dated 23 February

                      1990        to    his        Police       Authority;             in        his        prepared          typed
                      statement handed to me when he was                                   interviewed;            and    in his

                      answers          to     me          at interview.               The        additional            evidence

                      referred to by Mr WRIGHT appears to b e :-



                       i) the cause of the collapse of the crush barrier in Pen 3;

                      ii) the specific places where the deceased fans died;



                      - but he also has made it clear that he has no knowledge of
                      what the additional evidence might be or what effect it may

                      have on the outcome of the Inquests.                                      That may not be clear
                      to a reader of The Sheffield Star newspaper, but that cannot

                      be    the    fault of Mr WRIGHT who has                              no    editorial         control       or

                      influence over what that newspaper publishes.



                xi)   The    interview then continued as a dialogue                                      about the Final
                      Report       and      Mr     WRIGHT       made       it    clear          that    he       welcomed       the

                      Final       Report,           specifically            correcting                the        reporter,      Mr
                      HANNA,       who      lumped        the   Interim          and       Final       Reports         together.

Document File         Despite          this    correction,            the       article         and    the       editorial       in
Page 20               The    Sheffield             Star     newspaper           do   not        make    it       clear    to    the

                      reader that Mr WRIGHT's reactions to the Final Report differ

                      understandably from his reactions to the Interim Report.

                          *¥
                      Whatever impression the newspaper article may leave with the

                      reader,          there        should       be    no        doubt          that        Mr    WRIGHT       has

Document File         reservations about the Interim Report but regards the Final
Pages 3, 19           Report as a "superb document".                                 The    complainants               accuse Mr

                      WRIGHT       of       "double         standards"          because,          from       the       newspaper
                                                Continuation Form                                              Page No 18




                      article,       they believe he              describes            the Lord Justice                   TAYLOR

                      Report       as     a    "superb      document"                but     then       criticizes           the

                       findings.         That      is not the case and their misunderstanding
                      arises because of the rather sensational manner in which the
                      newspaper has used the various                            quotes by Mr WRIGHT,                  and     in

                       their overriding            interest          in,    and emphasis                on,    the    Interim
                      Report which is the one which specifically criticizes                                                South

                      Yorkshire Police.



                 xii) As     the   interview comes              towards         its end,       Mr WRIGHT             returned

                       to the constraints which are upon him:-


                             Mr WRIGHT - "I only wish that I could be more open
                             in what I've said about Hillsborough because                                          in a
Document File                sense I am constrained by the legal situation that
Page 21
                             I'm    in.        But       what    I    would          want     to     say       about
                             Hillsborough          are     those      comments             I would        want       to

                             make     on Lord        Justice         TAYLOR's          report       but       in    the

                             circumstances I can't."



                             M r HANNA        - "I am grateful for what y o u have                                 said

                             so shall we leave it at that I think."


                             Other voice - "I think you've said a lot more than

                             you've previously said about the - nothing to keep

                             you awake at n i g h t ."


                       The    other      voice      is    believe          to    be     that       of    Superintendent

                       present throughout the interview.


                 xiii) The    interview        continues         about          Mr    WRIGHT's          history       in     the
                       police       service        and    his     future             plans    but        it    returns        to

                       Hillsborough as the interview concludes


Document File                Mr WRIGHT         -            please         I would like             to project

Document File          if y o u       could      do    it   that    way.           If    I've     not      been
Page 22                able to deal with some of the issues                                in the depth

                       I    wo u ld    have      liked      to     and to      say             some     of the

                       things as strongly as I would like to it's because

                       of the constraints we're under."

                       Mr HANNA - "What about the possibility of a three

                       or    four      cornered         fight      as it       were            between the

                       C o u n c i l , Club and ...... "



                       Mr WRIGHT           - "Well we'll certainly agree to that.

                       There'll           either       be    an     amicable             acceptance              of
                       responsibility             or    there will            be    an    action        - but

                       there's        a    lot    of    information           to     come       out    that's
                       not already come out."

                       "Furthermore           the West Midlands                    enquiry       on behalf

                                                                         >

                       August         expanded         to    include          enquiries              for        the

                       are       still      ongoing         and    may        also       produce           fresh

                       evidence.            Indeed it wo ul d be               surprising             if nine

                       months additional investigation did not."



                Here "Mr WRIGHT             must be         referring         to     Lord Justice               TAYLOR's

                1 August         1989 and to Parliament later that month;                                       but Lord

                when       the    Final     Report was            presented         to    the Home          Secretary

                    and       to     Parliament          later    that    month.            Consequently,           any

                    relevant          evidence       coming       to     light       could       have     been     laid

                    before Lord Justice TAYLOR up to 18 January 1990.                                      However,

                    between 1 August 1989 and 18 January 1990,                                  it is true to say
                    that        Lord       Justice       TAYLOR     would          not     be     concerned       with

                    evidence coming to light in respect of individual cases, and

                    it was          in   respect     of     those      that    the       West    Midlands        Police
                    were accumulating information and e v i d e n c e .



                    I conclude,            therefore,       that the Coroner's                  enquiries and the

                    criminal          investigation would have                     uncovered      evidence       which

                    was       not    laid    before       Lord    Justice          TAYLOR       between    1 August

                    1989 and the press interview on 5 February 1990.


                xiv) The final quotation which needs                       to be         considered is almost
                    at    the       end of    the     interview when Mr               WRIGHT      commented upon

                     Lord Justice TAYLOR's Interim R e p o r t : -



                              Mr    WRIGHT    -             I    found    Lord       Justice       TAYLOR's

                              comments about the evasion of chief officers just
Document File                 a little harsh.              I thought      it was           - some    of his
Page 23
                              comments were s a v a ge , I t h o u g ht , but t h a t 's how he
                              saw    it.     But     I    think    they were          harsh      under     the

                              circumstances that the officers found."


                     That was reported in The Sheffield Star:-

                              TAYLOR's comments were "harsh" and "savage".



                     The words           published       in the newspaper                do not     do justice       to

                     the actual            words    used by Mr WRIGHT               and by        their    ambiguity
                     present a danger of misinterpretation among readers.

                     Clearly there are dangers inherent in press interviews under

Hillsborough tragedy.                      To be absolutely safe from committing

a    contempt        of        court       the         interview              should         be     framed          as

broadly as possible and                          in such a way                 that the public                     and
the courts would not regard it as improper or irresponsible

behaviour.               When        proceedings                 are     not       only        "active"            but
imminent          the     only        way        to     be        sure        of     being          safe       from

accusations          of        contempt          would           be     to    avoid          any    interviews

where any matter subject to the proceedings                                              is likely to be

raised.           If pressed,              then        perhaps           a    short          prepared         press
statement could be issued with no opportunity for questions,

supplementary             or        otherwise,              to    be     asked.              As    to    whether

proceedings           are       imminent              the    only        guidelines                of    a    legal

nature        seem       to     be        the    view            of     the     Director            of       Public

Prosecutions             who        has    in mind           a period              of    about          24    to    48

hours,        and        the        case        law     which           seems        to        suggest         that
proceedings              10     months           away        would            not       be        sufficiently
proximate.           When Mr WRIGHT gave his interview on 5 February
1990 he was under the impression that the Coroner's Inquests

would       not     be    re-opened             until            the    summer          of     1990      or    even

early in 1991.



During      the     interview he neither                          identified nor                   referred         to

any    individual             except perhaps                 Lord Justice                TAYLOR and            even

then     only       by    reference             to     his        Interim          and       Final      Reports,
both     of    which          are     public          documents.               The       information               and

opinions       expressed by Mr WRIGHT were                                   neutral          to the extent

that no        individual was                   referred           to by n a m e , and no                    direct
implication          as        to    the    guilt           or blame           of       anyone       was      made.

Neither       can        it be        said       that        Mr        WRIGHT       commented            upon       or

discussed           the        evidence           which           will        be        laid       before          the

Coroner,       other than in very general terms.                                         There is nothing

in    the     words       used by Mr WRIGHT                        which       can be             construed         as

inaccurate, unfair,                   irresponsible or unjust.


I am firmly of the view that the strict liability rule does

not apply in this case and there is therefore no requirement

for the papers to be submitted to the Attorney G e n e r a l .                                                      If
                               Continuation Form                                             Page No 22




       that be    so,        then for Mr WRIGHT             to be       guilty of a contempt
       under the Contempt of Court Act                      1981,       or at Common Law,                  it

       will be    necessary           to prove      an    intention           or    calculation            on
       his    part      to    impede     or    prejudice              the    administration                of

       justice.          Outside        of    the        strict          liability            rule        the

       proceedings likely to be prejudiced or impeded could include
       any     criminal        as     well    as     civil            proceedings,             including

       Coroner's      Inquests.         Although         the      contempt         alleged against

       Mr WRIGHT is not caught by the strict liability rule of the
       Contempt of Court Act 1981 because                             it cannot be           shown that

       the course of justice in question will be seriously impeded
       or prejudiced,          that does not mean                 that Mr WRIGHT cannot be

       liable for contempt of court in respect of conduct intended

       to    impede      or     prejudice        the      administration                 of        justice.

       Indeed,    Section 6(c) of the 1981 Act expressly provides                                         so.
       The   court      has    the    power    to   commit            for    contempt where               the

       intention         is     specifically             intended            to     prejudice             the

       administration          of     justice.         In      Mr      WRIGHT's         case       no    such

       intent has ever been expressly avowed or admitted,                                          so if it
       is present it has to be inferred from all the c ircumstances,

       including        the    foreseeability            of      the     consequences               of    the

       conduct.


       Finally,       the      contemptuous         intent            need    not       be     the       sole

       intention of the contemnor.


There are a number of established facts                           from which we can deduce

the intention of Mr WRIGHT when using the words he did during the

interview with Mr HANNA on 5 February 1990:-


  i)   The    interview        was     ostensibly           in      respect        of    Mr        WRIGHT's

       recently       announced        retirement         on      1    May    1990,          and    not    in

       respect of Hillsborough.                However,             as discussed previously,

       Mr    WRIGHT     must    have     known      that         Hillsborough           would        almost
       certainly be           raised during the             interview.             Indeed it seems

       clear     that    one     of    the    motivations              was    for       Mr    WRIGHT       to

       explain the relationship between his retirement and the Lord

       Justice TAYLOR Report.

                ii)   During the             interview with Mr HANNA it was made clear by Mr
                      WRIGHT that he was constrained as to what he could say about
                      the Hillsborough                     tragedy;          the       Lord Justice              TAYLOR         enquiry;

                      the    Interim and Final Reports;                                 and the Coroner's                      Inquests.

                      That    is       not        conclusive            of        innocent           intention,           of     course,

                      because Mr WRIGHT did,                           in fact,             discuss all of those issues

                      with    Mr        HANNA.                Superintendent                   PRATT,           present          at     the

Document File         interview,             spontaneously                remarked            that Mr           WRIGHT         had     said
Page 21               more    than he              had       ever      said        before           about      Hillsborough            but
                      nothing          to    keep          him     awake          at    night.            However,         Mr       WRIGHT
                      would       be    aware           of       the    Home           Office       Circulars         79/1981           and

Document File         115/1982;             he    confined             himself          to    general          comments          without
Pages 58-65           mentioning             any       specific         evidence,             additional            or     otherwise;

                      he    identified             no        individuals               by     name       or    otherwise             except

                      Lord Justice                TAYLOR;         and when he                 speculated,           gave        opinion,

                      or put       forward possibilities,                               he made          this      clear by           using
                      words       like           "may"       or     "I've         tried        to     put       myself         in     their
                      position          ..."       or       "perhaps".                 On    the     other hand,           there        are
                      two    examples             in       the    interview where                    the      reporter         seems     to
                      have        finished             with       Hillsborough                 and       the       possibility           of

                      additional             evidence             being       available             at     the     Inquests           which

                      was not available to Lord Justice TAYLOR,                                               and yet Mr WRIGHT

                      for no apparent reason returns unprompted to these issues



Document File                Mr        HANNA           -     "You've          not           been         in     charge          of
Page 19                      collecting the evidence obviously."


                             Mr WRIGHT             - "No we've not                      - but        - there will be
                             another             hearing           and        that          will      have         been        the

                             Coroner's              hearing             and       I      think        it      will        be     a

                             different hearing                      and       I    think        a    lot      of    evidence

                             that           perhaps           -     Lord          Justice           TAYLOR         was         not

                             concerned with the rules of evidence,                                            that enquiry

                             was not concerned with the rules of e v id e n c e .                                              The

                             constrained by the rules of evidence and I think a

                             different picture will                           emerge.               What      I'm anxious

                   things have b ee n done wrongly then they must never

                   happen again."


                   Mr HANNA - "Moving on from that."


                   Mr WRIGHT           - "No          it's not come out as                          I wanted to

                   admission that                    they were          though       I wasn't wanting

                   to say t h a t ."


                   Mr HANNA - "Do you want the question again."



                   Mr    WRIGHT            -    "What       I     want        to    say        is       that     Lord
                   Justice TAYLOR's                      enquiry        is    finished.                 It     is the

                   Coroner        who          is    now        going    to     conduct             a    different

                    enquiry.           He's          going to go into                 the detail.                 The
                    Coroner's              enquiry          will        go     on        for        months        and

                   perhaps          a different picture will                             emerge           from the

                    Coroner's          enquiry             than    emerged           from Lord Justice

                   T A Y L O R 's en q uiries."


                These answers gave the reporter the incentive to pursue the

                "additional         evidence"              question,          which was                 reasonable        under

                the circumstances.                   And again:-


                   Mr HANNA           - "The football authorities have perhaps

                    Mr WRIGHT          - "That's                a matter           for    football and if

                   years        police     service         and    the    only     thing        that
                   matters is Hillsborough.                     Can't escape it can I."



                   Mr HANNA        - "No.       On the other hand,               I think this

Document File      morning I wanted             to    look at Hillsborough,              I mean
Page 21            maybe if I'd had more time we would have gone over

                    other aspects."



                   Mr    WRIGHT     - " I       only wish         that     I could be         more

                    open in what I've said about Hillsborough because
                    in a sense I am constrained by the legal situation

                    that I'm in.           But what        I would want          to say about
                    Hillsborough          are   those      comments       I would       want     to

                   make     on Lord Justice               TAYLOR's      report    but    in     the

                    circumstances I can't."


                Once again the opportunity is given for the reporter to r e ­

                open his questioning on the "additional evidence" issue.



                And finally:-


                    Mr HANNA - "Just quickly looking through.                             I mean

                    M r WRIGHT      - "Whatever you want                 ... What      I'd like

                    optimistic and positive note about Hillsborough if

                    y o u could do it that way.                   If I've not been able
                    to   deal     with     some      of   the    issues     to   the    depth     I
                    w o ul d have liked to and to say some of the things

                    as strongly as I would like to it's because of the
                    constraints we're under."

Here     the   reporter             has       moved      on     to    other           matters      but    Mr

WRIGHT's response re-opens the Hillsborough issues.



H o w e v e r , w h e n asked directly b y Mr HANNA                              if there was           some

evidence       of   drink which was                     not   available           to        Lord Justice

TAYLOR but would come out subsequently, Mr WRIGHT replied:-



       "I d o n 't k n o w ."


That is not the answer of someone who has a malicious intent

to prejudice the Inquest verdict.                                  It is questionable as to

whether Mr WRIGHT would have allowed Mr HANNA to tape-record
the     interview         if    it        was      his     intention             to        influence      any
subsequent proceedings,                    and similarly it is unlikely that he

would     have      allowed          Superintendent                PRATT         to    be     present      to

witness it.          Those acts seem to indicate quite the contrary,

i.e. no criminal intention.



There      does     not       appear          to    be    any        evidence          of     a   specific
intention on Mr WRIGHT's part to prejudice any proceedings.

But should he have foreseen that consequence as a result of
his    interview?            He is a very experienced police officer and
Chief      Constable           of    long-standing.                    He    must           be    taken    as

having       knowledge          of        Home          Office       Circulars              79/1981       and

115/1982.               He      is        aware          that        in     his            position       his

pronouncements and opinions are of wide public interest.                                                   He

must have known that whatever reason was                                         given for a press

i n t erview, Hillsborough was                          certain       to be           raised      and    that

any     response,            statement             or     opinion           in    respect          of     the
disaster,        the enquiry,              the Interim and Final Reports,                               would

be     read       avidly        by        a        considerable             percentage             of     the

population          and      that    some          potential         jurors           at    the   Inquests

were likely to read the newspaper reports of the interview.
Such was       the weight that would be put on what he said that

there      was      a     likelihood               that       it     could        influence             their

decision as jurors.                       I put      this     to Mr WRIGHT                  at    interview

and he replied:-

      "I don't           think having regard to what                          I said that
      it    fell         into      any    of     those         categories.           I     have
      simply        said           that       additional              evidence       may       be

      forthcoming                 and    that       I    hoped        it    would        put     a

      different complexion on the public perception.                                             I

      have not said what the additional evidence will be

      necessary              statement        could       possibly          influence          the
      course of any judicial proceedings."



      Mr SHARP - "Why did you regard it as necessary?"



      Mr    WRIGHT            -    "As    a     Chief          Constable       during          the

      course of these events I have b e e n unable to avoid

      press        questions            and    in       addition       to    all    my    other
      responsibilities                   there      is    one       of maintaining             the

      morale       of the South Yorkshire Police.                                  The views
      expressed are the views held within the Force and

      it    is right              in my view that the public                       should be

      aware of them."



      Mr SHARP - "Even if the effect of these statements

      may     be        to    influence          people         within       the    judicial

      p r o c e s s ."


      Mr WRIGHT - "I don't see h o w they can"



It    is    worth        repeating            that       Mr     WRIGHT       had    no    control      or

influence over what was printed in The Sheffield Star.                                               One

can speculate that he should have realised or expected that

The   Sheffield              Star would not               print       everything he had              said

and would present the words                             in the most          sensational manner

possible.          That is no more than speculation.

                From     a    close       study         of    the     full       transcript             there        is    no

                evidence          that    Mr      WRIGHT        was     intending            to        influence          the

                Inquests       or any other proceedings;                         there       is no       evidence          to
                show that he should have foreseen that any proceedings would

                be   influenced;            and    indeed       in view          of    the wide          coverage          of

                Hillsborough             on     television,            radio,           national            and      local

                n e w s p a p e r s , there     is no evidence that any proceedings would
                likely,       or    even possibly,              be     influenced by what Mr                      WRIGHT

                said at the interview.


                I    draw    attention            to    the     submission            made     to       Lord      Justice

                Although          the    following           extract        is    out    of       any    context          the
                words stand alone, were known to Mr WRIGHT,                                    and are relevant
                to    what     he       said   during         the     interview         with       Mr       HANNA     on    5

                February 1990:-


                       "CRUSHING
                       Given       the propensity              in the       terraces          for fans         to

                       sway,       surge and move and that such actions are,                                   it

                       is     arguable,           in     themselves              potentially            highly

                       dangerous         (whether or not any barrier fails should

                       anyone        lose      their         footing      or     faint) ,         it    may    be
                       difficult to form any reliable v i ew as to how and
                       when       any particular              injury        or   death was             in    fact

                       caused.           The      situation         may     be    simple          or    may    be

                       hig h l y    complex,           but    the     substantial           injuries          and

                       death would appear to have been sustained in Pen 3,

                       and below the area protected by barrier 124A.                                           To

                       arrive at a view that because people went into the

                       tunnel        upon      the      opening        of      Gate     C     injuries          or
                       death were thereby caused would require a detailed

                       investigation              the    like       of which          has    not,       on     the

                       occasion of this Inquiry,                       been attempted.                   Whilst

                perhaps         convenient                 and        for     certain           purposes

                attractive such a simplistic view would not,                                          it is

                submitted be justified.                          This has not b e e n a trial

                nor      is     there,          it        is     submitted,          the        material
                available           upon which             such conclusions                might       even
                be tentatively based.                          Whilst it may be considered

                that     notions          such       as    the burden             and     standard       of

                proof may impede the enquiry process,                                     the fact is
                that they have not featured and that what has been

                done     has        been       done       whilst        evidence          and    further

                material            are    still          being        sought        and       gathered.

                Speculation will                 not       suffice           although          it may    be

                 interesting              to     ponder               what        satisfactory           or
                 sufficient           explanation                or     explanations             can     be

                 given for,          as appears to be the case,                            some deaths
                having        occurred          to    individuals who may have                         come

                 in at      the second opening of Gate C.                                 The enquiry
                 cannot it is submitted permit the conclusions post

                hoc ergo propter hoc.


                As    to the positions in which people m a y have died

                we    urge     that,        as has          been       indicated will be                the

                 case,        there        should          be        taken    into        account       the

                 material supplied by the South Yorkshire Police in

                 relation to Pen 3."


          The    words        are    different             from       those       used    by     Mr   WRIGHT     but
          they    certainly           seem       to be          a basis        for       what    he     said   on    5

          February 1990.


          I   therefore         conclude             that        there       is     no    evidence        that      Mr

          WRIGHT      has      committed             any       contempt        of    court,       either       under

          statute or at Common Law.


It   is       necessary         to        consider             the     Common       Law        misdemeanour         of
attempting to pervert the course of public justice.                                               There is some

overlap       with     the      contempt             of    court        offence          but    the    perversion
                                     Continuation Form                                       Page No 30




offence can be separate and distinct.                              It amounts to the wrongful

obstruction of the course of justice;                             defeating the due course of

justice;    interfering with the administration of justice;                                       defeating
the ends of justice; but since 1975 the offence has been known by
one title,       perverting the course of justice.                               It is indictable as

is an attempt           to pervert           the course of justice.                      In Mr WRIGHT's
case,    because        the     proceedings          have     yet      to    take     place       it    is   an

attempt to pervert the course of justice that we must consider.



The word attempt              in this       context       is misleading but                is convenient

to use     in    a case where               it    cannot     be    proved        that     the     course      of

justice is actually perverted.                       The real offence here is the doing
of    some act which has               a tendency and             is    intended to pervert                  the
administration           of     justice.            However,           to   do      an     act    with       the
intention of perverting the course of justice                                    is not enough;              the

act must also have that tendency.


It is not necessary to assess the conduct of the accused in terms

of proximity to an ultimate offence                           (as is generally necessary in

respect     of    criminal           at t e mp t s ) , it    is    necessary         to     consider         the

tendency     of    the        conduct       and    the    intention         of     the     accused.          The
prosecution         does        not      have       to      prove       that        the     tendency          or
possibility        in fact materialised but                       there must be a possibility
that     what     the     accused         has      done     "without        more"         might    lead       to

injustice (R v MURRAY (GE)                       (1982) 2 All E.R.           225CA).


The     offence    is wider           than the       contempt          of court          offence       already

considered because              it     includes      police        investigations            in progress

which     might     bring       proceedings          about.            (R v      SELVAGE         and   MORGAN

(1981)     73     Cr.    App.        R333    C.A.).          However,         the    question          of    the

imminent nature           of those proceedings                    is relevant.             The position,
status      and         influence           of     the      accused         is      also     a     relevant

consideration            as     to     whether       an      offence         has     been        committed.

Although there is some suggestion that in cases which involve the

publishing of matter likely to interfere with the fair conduct of

a trial it may be that ignorance of the possible consquences is no

excuse and intention is irrelevant (see R v ODHAMS PRESS LTD ex.p.
                               Continuation Form                                             Page No 31




Att.-Gen.       (1956) 3 All E.R. 484),                  the position is not clear so the
Contempt of Court Act test presumably would be applied.


The   considerations          in    respect         of    this       offence      are    no    different

from those considered previously in respect of contempt of court.

There is no evidence that Mr WRIGHT intended to pervert the course

of justice,       and there        is no evidence               that his conduct might have

perverted       the   course       of justice.                That    is   so    in respect         of     the

Coroner's       Inquests,          the       criminal          investigation            or    any     civil

actions laid or stayed.



The     final     offence          to     be     considered            is       that     of     culpable
malfeasance.          Every    malfeasance               or    culpable         non-feasance         of     an
officer of justice, which includes a police officer,                                     in respect of

his office,       is a misdemeanour at Common Law.                              The case-law arises

predominently from very old cases which arose out of failure to do
things required to be              done because               of the accused's office,                   (see

CROWTHER's CASE        (1593)       Cro.       E l i z . 654 and R v WYAT               (1705)      1 Salk

380).     The cases     indicate there is an offence of a public officer
wilfully neglecting to perform a duty which he is bound to perform
b y common law or statute but the neglect has to be wilful and not

merely inadvertent.            It has          to be culpable              in the sense of being

without     reasonable         excuse          or     justification.                In       this     sense

culpability is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty but has

to be    of such a degree               the misconduct               impugned     is calculated             to

injure the public           interest.           It would be            for the jury           to decide

whether the evidence revealed the necessary degree of culpability

in performing a duty badly which would include "neglect of d u t y " .

(R v DYTHAM (1979) 2QB 722).


It does not appear to be necessary to prove                                 that by so doing,              or

not doing, ^ h e      accused           intended to gain some personal benefit or
advantage       but    it   may         be     that      in     appropriate         cases,          e.g.     a

Registrar,      there must be a beneficiary to whose interest there has

been no proper regard.

From the evidence and discussions                              earlier     I conclude              there    is no

evidence       to prove          culpable misfeasance or malfeasance                                against Mr

WRIGHT.


Conclusion of investigation into criminal allegations



From my    investigation                and    consideration              of     the    criminal         matters
which arise          from the complaints                  against Mr WRIGHT I am satisfied

that    there        is    no     evidence         that        he   has    committed           any       criminal
offence     and          there     is    no    reason          to    submit       the     report           to    the
               •%

Attorney General in respect of strict liability under the Contempt
of Court Act 1981,                nor to       the Director of Public Prosecutions                                 in

respect of general criminal matters.


In saying those words,                  did he commit a disciplinary offence?



The     relevant           regulations             are        the    Police           (Discipline)(Senior

Officers)           Regulations          1985.           By    virtue      of     Section          105     of     the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, all police officers and the
Police    Complaints             Authority         are        required     to have        regard         for      the

Home    Office        Guidance          to Chief Officers                 on Police          Complaints           and

Discipline           Procedures           1985.               Regulation          4(1)        of     the         1985
Regulations              has     the     effect      of        applying          to     senior       officers,

including           Chief        Constables,         the           Discipline          Code    set        out      in

Schedule       1 of the Police                (Discipline)            Regulations            1985.        Because

there     is        no     special        provision            within       that        Code       for      senior

officers,           clearly       some        of    the        disciplinary            offences          are     not

applicable to a Chief Constable or are inappropriate.


Section 84(5)             of the Police             and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 makes

it clear       that       the complaints            system           is not applicable to matters
affecting           the    direction          or    control          of    the    force        by the           chief

officer.            It    is    the     conduct      of       the    chief      officer        which       can     be

reviewed not the exercise of the wide discretion vested in him.



The     disciplinary             authority          in        Mr    WRIGHT's          case     is the           South

Yorkshire Police Authority which is required by Regulation 7(1) of

                 the 1985 Regulations on receipt of my report,                             to consider whether

                 disciplinary proceedings need to be                      taken.          Such a decision will
                 be dependent u p on a statement from the Police Complaints Authority
                 that my      investigation has            been conducted            to    the   satisfaction       of
                 the    Police      Complaints       Authority         and    specifying         any    respect     in

                 which it was not so conducted.


                 In the    case     under       discussion       the    following         complaints     have     been

                 made against Mr W R I G H T : -



Statement File     i)    Abuse      of    the    privilege       of     his    position.          (Mr    HICKS,     Mr
Pages 1-11               DEVONSIDE and Mr HA M M ON D ) ;


                  ii)    He    publicised          information          which       was    confidential         until
Document File
Pages 7-10                deemed otherwise by H.M. Coroner.                        (Mr HICKS);


                 iii)    He prejudges the verdict of the Coroner which is outside his

                          (Mr WRIGHT's)          authority and insults               the jurisdiction of the

                          Coroner's office.              (Mr HICKS and Mr D E V O NS I D E) ;



                  iv)    He    could      prejudice        the     Inquest         jurors.       (Mr     HICKS,     Mr

                          DEVONSIDE and Mr HA M M O N D ) ;


                   v)    He has failed to do his duty by failing to make available to

                          Lord     Justice       TAYLOR      all       material       information        about     the

                          Hillsborough tragedy.               (Mr HICKS and Mr H A M MO N D ) ;



                  vi)    He   has    withheld        from    "us"      material       which      relates    to     the

                          consumption of intoxicating drink by football spectators                                  at

                          Hillsborough.            (Mr HICKS and Mr DEVONSIDE);



Statement File   vii)    He deliberately misleads when he says                            that there     is new or
Pages 1-11                additional        information          which       was    not    considered      by     Lord
Document File             Justice        TAYLOR,    an    offence       under       the    discipline      code,    or
Pages 7-10
                          worse.         (Mr HICKS and Mr HAMMOND);

viii)   He    is    guilty        of       double        standards            by   referring        to    the

        findings        of     the     Lord       Justice     TAYLOR           report     as    a   "superb

        document"         yet        persisting          in     a    claim         that       the   primary

        conclusion was wrong.                     (Mr HICKS);


 ix)    He   devalues          trust       and    faith    in       the       judicial    system.          (Mr
        D E V O NS I D E );


  x)    He   has    made       statements          which      are     derogatory          to    those     who
        lost their lives at Hillsborough.                             (Mr H A M M O N D ) ;



 xi)    He   has       deliberately              attempted      to        distort       the     course     of

        justice.         (Mr HAMMOND).


The disciplinary offences which have to be                                     considered in respect

 of these complaints are as follows:-


   i)   Discreditable Conduct
        Being a member of the South Yorkshire Police Force acted in

        a    manner           reasonably          likely      to     bring         discredit        on     the

        reputation of the force or the police service.

        Contrary to Regulation 5,                     Schedule            1    - Paragraph 1,        Police

        (Discipline) Regulations 1985.


  ii)   Falsehood or Prevarication
        Being a member of the South Yorkshire Police he knowingly or

        through neglect made a false, misleading or inaccurate oral

        statement required for police p u r p o s e s .
        Contrary         to     Regulation          5,     Schedule            1   -   Paragraph         5(a),

        Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.




 iii)   Improper Disclosure of Information
        Being      a    member        of    South        Yorkshire            Police     without     proper
        authority communicated to any person,                                  any information which

        he had in his possession as a member of a police force.
                                Continuation Form                                     Page No 35




       Contrary      to       Regulation      5,    Schedule      1     -    Paragraph       6(a),

       Police   (Discipline) Regulations 1985.



iv)    Abuse of Authority
       Being the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire                              Police and       in
       the execution of his duty did publish words without good and

       sufficient cause in such a w ay as to be oppressive,                              abusive,

       or uncivil to any member of the public.

       Contrary      to       Regulation      5,    Schedule      1     -    Paragraph       8(c),

       Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.


I will consider each of those disciplinary offences in turn:-



  i)   Discreditable Conduct
       Proceedings for such an offence should be brought sparingly

       and whenever possible a more specific charge should be laid

       under one of the other paragraphs of the discipline code.


       The   facts    in Mr WRIGHT's             case   are not       distinct        from   those

       underlying         any other possible            charges       so    it   should not       be

       additional to any of those other charges.


       The   offence          is committed where an officer acts                      in a manner

       likely   to bring            discredit      on the   reputation           of   the police

       force or service.              Clearly Mr WRIGHT's action in giving the
       press interview to The Sheffield Star (and other interviews)

       was known about outside the force and at least some of his

       words    used           in    the    interview       were           public      knowledge.

       Consequently            it would     be   necessary     only         to   show    that    his
       giving of the interview and the words used were                                  reasonably

       likely   to bring            discredit.       Because      the       complainants        have

       personal knowledge of The Sheffield Star interview,                                although

       there""~are passing references to other media and The Guardian

       newspaper,         I    do   not    consider     that   the         alleged      misconduct

       consists of a continuing state of affairs and have confined
       m y consideration to the single action of The Sheffield Star

       interview and subsequent publication.                          Although        I am aware
                         Continuation Form                                          Page No 36




that       Mr    WRIGHT        addressed             the     South          Yorkshire          Police
Federation Meeting on 4 April 1990 and used words similar to

those used in his interview with The Sheffield Star,                                           at the

time I interviewed the three complainants none of them were

aware of what he had said at that meeting and none of them
made any complaint about it.                     I am unaware of any complaints

made by anyone about                the meeting on 4 April                       1990.     Neither
am I aware of any complaints made about the Sheffield Star

interview        on    5 February         1990       and     subsequent           article       other
than those of Mr HICKS, Mr DEVONSIDE and Mr HAMMOND although

Mr HICKS        inferred that some of the other bereaved relatives

shared his concern about Mr WRIGHT'S actions.



It is not easy to see how Mr WRIGHT'S giving of an interview

on     5    February         1990     can       be     proved          to    be     in    any     way

discreditable.               Mr WRIGHT has been at the                       forefront of the
Hillsborough tragedy since it occurred on 15 April 1989, and

particularly           so     since       the        publication            of    Lord     Justice
Taylor's        Interim Report         in August 1989.                      He has been asked
questions        in the public part of the South Yorkshire                                     Police

Authority          Meetings;         the        First        Tuesday          documentary          by

Yorkshire          Television       was     broadcast             on   Tuesday       6    February

1990;       national          and   local        newspapers              have       consistently

reported and discussed the facts and issues surrounding the

tragedy;         there       have   been        numerous           television            and    radio
broadcasts         about      the   matter,          and     most      of    this    before       the
Sheffield         Star   interview          on 5 February               1990.       Although       it

was subsequent to this event, the BBC television documentary

broadcast         on Tuesday,         10 April             1990   presented         a frank       and

fairly          detailed       picture          of     the        West       Midlands          Police

investigation            including           the           relationship           between         the

football supporters and alcohol.



Mr     WRIGHT      had       announced      his       retirement             from    the       police
service and it was              a natural            consequence            of that for media
interviews         to be sought.            As discussed previously he would

have       known      that    Hillsborough            would       be     raised     at     such    an
                                         Continuation Form                                                  Page No 37




                interview,         but    that        is       not     to        say    that      he       should      not,

                therefore,        have    given           the    interview.                 Again,     as     discussed
                previously,        he would have known that reports                                    of    interviews

                by   Chief      Officers            can    be    presented             in    such      a    way       as    to
                distort     the meaning              of    the       interviewee,            but     that     is not         a

                reason     to    avoid the           interview at                all    costs.          Provided           the

                words are chosen carefully by the interviewed Chief Officer

                there      should    be        nothing          to    fear.            Mr     WRIGHT        is    a    very
                experienced Chief Constable and from a study of the complete

                transcript he was               circumspect             enough         to justify his               giving

                of   the    interview.               It    could        be       argued       that      a    much      more
                misleading picture would have                           emerged if he had refused                           to
                participate         in the          interview or had answered                          the questions

                about      Hillsborough             with       "No    comment"          or     similar        words         to

                that effect.


                Additionally,            it must          be     said       that       as    Chief      Constable           of
                South      Yorkshire       Police           he       has     a    duty       to     respond       on       its

                behalf.         In the words of Mr W R I G H T :-


                        "It is essential for the well-being and morale of

                        expression             to          their      views, and               it      is        my

                        responsibility as Chief Constable to do so."

                        "Given that additional evidence will be produced

                        expressing             the        belief            that this             additional

                        evidence         may    put       a different              complexion           on    the

    Mr    WRIGHT               -       "As    a Chief      Constable            during the
    course       of        those         events       I    have        been unable            to

    avoid press            questions            and       in addition to all my

    other         responsibilities there                             is        one            of

    maintaining                the      morale       of     the       South       Yorkshire

    Police.           The views              expressed are                the views         held

    w it h in the          Force and it is right in my view that
    the public             should be aware of them."


    Mr      SHARP          -       "Even        if        the        effect of         these

    statements             may be to influence people within the

    judicial process."



    Mr WRIGHT - "I don't see how they can."


    Mr    SHARP       - "Would you go                     so    far       then,      with    the
    benefit of hindsight to say perhaps your comments

    were injudicious."


    Mr WRIGHT          - "No.                I don't withdraw any of them.

     I cannot be responsible for leaps of imagination

     of those who choose to misinterpret what I said."



    Mr    SHARP       - "So everything you                           said      to The       Star

    was either true fact or true opinion."


    Mr     WRIGHT               -       "Yes.        What       I     said in         all    the

     interviews                    I    gave represented                  my      views and

     opinions         as        spokesman            for       the    South          Yorkshire

     P o li c e . "


It is my view that by agreeing to,                               and giving the interview

with Mr HANNA of The Sheffield Star,                                   even though Mr WRIGHT

must have     known Hillsborough would be                                 raised       and that    the
press do not always print what was actually said, he did not

act in a manner likely to bring discredit upon the force or

the police      service,               neither       did he          "abuse     the privilege       of

his position."

                Bearing      in mind Mr WRIGHT h a d no editorial control of what
                was printed,         a study of the complete transcript of what was

                said at       the    interview by Mr WRIGHT                       indicates he chose his
                words    carefully.             W he n    the     full      context         and   order           of    the
                words used are compared with the quotations in the newspaper

                article it becomes understandable as to how the complainants

                misinterpreted            Mr    WRIGHT's         meaning.             Anyone        with       just       a

                passing knowledge               of the Hillsborough tragedy who                              read       the

                published article               is likely to interpret the reference made

                by Mr WRIGHT          to    "additional           information",             to mean that                the
                additional          evidence      referred            to    alcohol        consumed          by       those

                who died at Hillsborough.                       Wh e n bereaved relatives read the

                words the misunderstanding becomes even more acute.                                               From a
                detailed       study       of   the      transcript             it becomes        clear       that Mr

                WRIGHT       said    no    such       thing.          I have         already      discussed             the

                precise nature of the "additional evidence"                                   earlier in this

                report.


                It is difficult to see how the actual words used can be seen

                as   prejudging           the    verdict         of       the    Coroner.           As   discussed
                previously,          there       can      be     no       doubt      that     information               not

                available       to    (or required by)                    Lord Justice         TAYLOR will               be
                presented at the Inquests.                       It follows,           therefore,            that the

                outcome of the Inquests will be in doubt until the final day

                but that would be the case with,                            or without any "additional
                information."             Certainly I cannot find any prejudging of the

                Inquest verdict by Mr WRIGHT.                             He did express an opinion at

                the interview when he said:-


                        Mr     HANNA        -    "You've         not        b ee n    in     charge           of
Document File
Page 19                 collecting the evidence obviously."



                        Mr WRIGHT          - "No we've not                 - but     - there will be

                        another       hearing            and     that       will      have     been          the

                        Coroner's          hearing         and        I    think      it     will       be        a

                        different hearing and                    I think a lot of evidence

                        that        perhaps       -      Lord     Justice            TAYLOR       was        not

concerned       with          the     rules      of        evidence,              that

enquiry      was        not    concerned        with        the           rules     of

evidence.       The       Coroner's        enquiry         to        some    extent
will be constrained by the rules of evidence and

I    think   a different             picture     will       emerge.               What

I'm anxious         to do       is    to make        sure       that all           the

evidence whatever, whether it's for the police or

it's critical of the police goes forward, because

if things have been                 done wrongly then they must

never happ e n again."


Mr HANNA - "Moving on from t h a t ."


Mr WRIGHT      - "No it's not come out as I wanted to

say    it.     It's      almost       as   though,          it's       almost       an

admission that they were though I wasn't wanting

to say that."


Mr HANNA - "Do you want the question again."


Mr    WRIGHT   - " What             I want      to    say       is     that       Lord
Justice TAYLOR's enquiry is finished.                                  It is the

Coroner who         is now going           to conduct                a different

enquiry.       He's going to go into the detail.                                   The

Coroner's      enquiry          will       go    on    for           months        and

perhaps a different picture will emerge from the

Coroner's      enquiry than emerged from Lord Justice

T A Y L O R 's enquiries.


Mr    HANNA     -       "Is    it     true      that        he        will        have

additional ev i dence."



Mr    WRIGHT        -    "Yes,       there      will        be        a     lot     of

additional         evidence          presented        to     the          Coroner's

enquiry      that       was   not     presented        to       Lord        Justice

TAYLOR's       enquiry          which      may        put        a        different

complexion on the end product."

                    but    those        words       cannot        be        interpreted             as     being           a

                prejudging of the Inquest verdict.


                Whether     or    not    Inquest          jurors       could       be    influenced             by        Mr

                WRIGHT's     words      has     b e en    addressed          earlier          in    this       report.

                Bearing     in mind      the       televising          of    the     tragedy         itself;          the
                public      nature       of        Lord     Justice           TAYLOR's             enquiry;           the

                publication        of    the       Interim        and        Final       Reports;          and        the

                intense     media       coverage          which       followed          the    event           and    the
                enquiry;     all of which occurred prior                        to the         interview on 5

                February     1990,      it    is    difficult to             see how Mr WRIGHT                   could

                prejudice or influence the Inquest jurors,                                   none of whom had
                b e en    selected       at     the       time        the    words        were       uttered              or
                published,       and many of whom had already b e en subjected to a
                barrage of information,                  findings,          opinions and speculation.


                O n numerous occasions,               including at the interview and in the

                published        article,        Mr      WRIGHT        has    asserted             that        all    the

                evidence     in    the       possession          of    South       Yorkshire             Police       has

                been     handed    to    West       Midlands          Police ffor            the    Lord       Justice

                TAYLOR's     enquiry,         for     the    Coroner's             Inquests         and        for    the
                criminal      investigation.                For        the    complainants                to    allege
                otherwise is due to their mistaken beli e f that Mr WRIGHT at

                interview with the press gave the impression that there was

                "additional         information"             which           related          to     drunken              or
                intoxicated             football            supporters                  at         Hillsborough,

                particularly        those deceased.                   Enough has         already been                said

                in this report to indicate that was not the case.



                The full transcript reveals no evidence that Mr WRIGHT tried

                to mislead deliberately,                  just the opposite.                   Neither should

                he be accused of double standards.                             At interview he clearly
                referred     to    the       Final    Report          of    Lord    Justice         TAYLOR           as    a

                "superb document"             in that it clearly and fully analyses and

Page 19         addresses the so called ills of football.                                    He has never made
                any secret        of    the    fact       that he has          reservations               about       the

                findings of Lord Justice TAYLOR in his                               Interim Report which

criticises South Yorkshire Police.                                As Mr WRIGHT said in his

prepared statement:-


          "There     is nothing          inconsistent              in accepting         the

          conclusion            of     judicial proceedings                without

          necessarily being in agreement with all the views

          expressed        or    the        weight       given to         the    various

          factors involved."


The views         of Mr HICKS that Mr WRIGHT was                          "guilty of double
standards" is based upon the newspaper article,                                    a view which

is completely dispelled by a study of the full transcript of

the press interview.


The       newspaper article, written                     by Mr HANNA the interviewer,

created         in   the    minds        of     the      three        complainants         a false

impression:-


i)        That Mr WRIGHT claimed to have additional evidence not
          available        to Lord Justice TAYLOR which would                            indicate
          to      the      Coroner's            Inquest            that     many        fans     at
          Hillsborough,              including         the   deceased,          were   under   the

          influence of intoxicating                     drink to such an extent that

          they played a much more significant role                               in the tragedy

          than Lord Justice TAYLOR had reported;



 ii)       That      evidence         had     b e en    withheld from              Lord Justice

          TAYLOR.


From      a reading        of        the article         it is      possible      to    formulate

those      opinions,        but       that    is not         so    in respect of the           full

transcript of the interview.



The full transcript makes it clear:-



     i)    Mr     WRIGHT        justifiably             presumed that                  the ongoing
          investigation              following         the    publication         of     the   Lord
                                 Continuation Form                                   Page No 43




               Justice TAYLOR Interim Report would produce additional

               information.


        ii) He did not know what that additional                         information would

               be but he had no reason to believe                       it would relate          to

               intoxicating drink.



       iii) That      he     had    not    withheld           any   information       from    Lord

               Justice TAYLOR.


               The complaints arise from the manner in which Mr WRIGHT
               is quoted in the newspaper article.


               I am satisfied that in giving the press interview to Mr

               HANNA of The Sheffield Star,                    and by using         the words he

               did, Mr WRIGHT did not act in a manner likely                            to bring
               discredit         upon    South    Yorkshire         Police,    or     the    police

               service.          He cannot be held accountable for the manner

               in    which    his       words    were    presented      in     the    subsequent

               newspaper         article because he h a d no             editorial          control
               and limited,         if any,       influence         over the words          printed

               as attributable to him.


 ii)   Falsehood or Prevarication
       It is not certain that this particular disciplinary offence

       applies       to    the     circumstances         of     this   case     but    there     is

       nothing       in the      full    text of        the    interview      to even       suggest

       that Mr WRIGHT either knowingly or through neglect made any

       false,       misleading      or    inaccurate          statement.       The    manner     in

       which the interview is presented in the subsequent newspaper

       article could mislead a reader to believe that Mr WRIGHT h ad

       said something he did not say,                    or mean something he did not

       mean.


iii)   Improper Disclosure of Information

       There is nothing in the full transcript,                         or in       the article,

       to show that Mr WRIGHT disclosed any                          information which was
                             Continuation Form                                            Page No 44




confidential            to     the Coroner           or    to    anyone       else.            The words
used    are       in    generalities            and       opinion       - opinions             which       Mr

WRIGHT           genuinely          holds.          He      did    not        require           anyone's

approval          to    give       the   interview or use               the words he              chose,
the necessary authority and discretion is vested in him.



Abuse of Authority
There is nothing to indicate that Mr WRIGHT w a s , or intended

to     be    oppressive,             abusive         or     uncivil       to        anyone,          or    to
influence           any      juror        or   proceedings.                   If    the        newspaper

article had             set out          the   full      text of        the    interview,             there
would have b ee n no question arising that Mr WRIGHT was being

derogatory             to    the    deceased,         or    anyone      else,        an    allegation

based upon the misinterpretation set out above.


Insofar as Mr WRIGHT is alleged to have withheld information

from the c o mplainants, I would be surprised if that was not

the case, whether or not it related to intoxicating drink or
otherwise.              From my          interview with           the complainants                it was

apparent           that       they       believe         the     Interim           Report       by        Lord

Justice TAYLOR                is the       definitive           document       for fixing blame

on the South Yorkshire Police,                             and exonerating the football
supporters,             particularly           the       deceased,       from        the       stigma       of

intoxification.                     Anything         which        might       be         perceived          as

tending to throw doubt on the                              Interim Report findings                        they

see as an attack on their bereaved loved ones.                                            They believe

they have a right to all such material.                                   Whilst at interview

I was        able       to     create      a better            understanding              of    the       true

position, but they had framed their complaints after reading

The Sheffield Star article,                         which is all they had to go on,

and     they       continue         to base      their         complaints           on    that.           They

have        no    grounds          for    believing         that     they          are    entitled          to

receive information of the nature about which they complain.



Mr WRIGHT did not require authority to give the interview or

use     the       words       he    chose.          He     did    not    reveal          any    detailed

information             which        could     be     described         as     confidential                and
                                      Continuation Form                                    Page No 45




         there       is        nothing       to     indicate       that      he    intended           to    be
         oppressive,            abusive,      or uncivil          to anyone,        or    to    influence

         any juror or proceedings.



Conclusion of investigation into disciplinary matters



I     find    all        of    the     complaints          to    be     unsubstantiated           and       no

disciplinary offences have b ee n commited by Mr WRIGHT.


In saying those word did he act in any way injudiciously?



In the present context the queston as to whether or not Mr WRIGHT
has    acted       injudiciously            is one of fact,            not   of law.           Within       the

law and without                breaking      the    discipline          code,     a Chief       Constable

has    to    use    his       own judgement          as    to    whether     he    will    do     this       or
that.        Advice       from circulars,            colleagues,          subordinates,          experts,

police authorities, Government Departments and many other sources,

is available but at the end of the day it is a personal decision,
authority          and discretion            for     which             is vested         in the        Chief

Constable.          The consequences                of the decision rest with the Chief
Constable          and        by taking      it     he    is    solely responsible              for    these

consequences.                 His judgement may be               criticised but          it is he who
has      to        balance            the     various           responsibilities,               sometimes

conflicting,             which       are    borne    by    his    office.          An    Inspector           of

Constabulary or a police authority may say "I would not have done

that",       or even "I would not even consider doing that",                                    but those

are words       of advice.             The Chief Constable has                  to do what is best

for his Force,            subject only to the constraints,                        of the law and the
discipline code and in so doing he stands alone.                                   A n exception may

be     the    case            of a    Chief       Constable           who commits         a series           of

injudicious         acts whereby the efficiency and effectiveness                                     of his

Force suffers to such an extent that the Inspector of Constabulary

or the Police Authority feel obliged to intervene, but that is not
the     position              in Mr    WRIGHT's          case.         Mr WRIGHT justifies            his

decision to give the press interview in several ways:-

                        my     personal           resolve     was    overtaken by                the    tragic

                        course of events at Hillsborough.                                It seemed to me

                        the proper course of action would be to await the

                        outcome        of Lord           Justice     Taylor's             inquiry       and    to

                        deal,      as I thought appropriate,                         with what emerged

                        from the findings.                    Lord Justice Taylor's                    inquiry

                         is     now     complete            and    all        the    necessary          police
                        actions from it have b e en commissioned and largely

                        concluded."

Document File            "Fortunately             or unfortunately                 policing       is day       to
Page 29                  day,     minute          by   minute       work       and       there    are     other

                         problems.               You   can only      devote          so much       time       and
                         thinking           to    Hillsborough.           I have          been    trying       to
                         say to my men that Hillsborough                             is over,          so long

                         as we        are    sure      that what we             do   takes       account       of

                         the      lessons.             We   have     to       go    on    policing        South

                        Yorkshire            in    the      manner       in    which       we    did    before

                         Hillsborough happened.


                         I think a new Chief, unconnected with Hillsborough

                         will come in and it is a natural move forward for

                         the force.              The best thing for the force is for me
                         to go at the right time and not hang on too long

                         or go too soon.                 I think I have got it right.



                         While I am here Hillsborough will remain.                                     I think
                         I am doing the best for the force in going now at

                         what I see to be the right time for an end and the

                         right time for a beginning."

                       and at my officers.                 They were down,            there was not

                       one    there      who      was     not    deeply        and    traumatically

                       affected by what              they were          having        to    deal       with.

                       The    questioning           that       was     taking       place       in     their

                       minds then was the questioning that took place in

                       my    mind.         What     went       wrong,        what    could       we       have
                       done,     what      should we have              done?         What    didn't we

                       do?

                       now .that       the     feeling          in my    force       of     the      Taylor

                       inquiry is one of                 injustice.           Officers       feel         they

                       have         carried          a        much       larger            burden           of

                       things       couldn't         have       been     done       differently            and

                       perhaps       had     a    different            end    product.               But    no

                       decisions         were      taken        with     malice       or    that          were

                       demonstrably wrong,                 it    is    just     that       they      turned

                       out     in    the     event       not     perhaps        to    have       been       as

                       effective as other decisions might have been.                                       But

                       we don't know."

                         have be e n read with                 avid interest.

                         potential       jurors       for       the       inquest      were          likely     to

                         that your reponses                  in the newspaper are likely to
                         sway    their judgement                and perhaps            influence             their

                         decision as jurors at the inquest.                                 That it could

                         be     argued       is    perhaps           a    contempt         of        court,     an

                         attempt to pervert the course of justice at common

                         law,    or a very old common law offence of culpable

                            Mr WRIGHT - "No."



                    My    investigation          has    revealed       nothing         to     make     Mr    WRIGHT
                    answerable        to his         Police Authority or           to       anyone     else.        He

                    has   properly        considered          whether      or    not     he    should        give    a

                    press    interview and has                properly     exercised his             mind     as    to

                    the   words     used.        Whether       or    not   some     other          person,     Chief
                    Constable      or otherwise,          would have            agreed to the             interview

                    and answered        in the way Mr WRIGHT                did,       is     irrelevant.           As

                    Chief    Constable       of       South Yorkshire           Police        he    chose,     after

                    due deliberation,            to act in the way               that he did for proper

                    reasons      of directing and controlling his                        Force.           Even with

                    has not breached the law or discipline code and if anything,
                    he has       lifted the morale,             and consequently the efficiency,

                    of his force.         He is clearly a caring and sensitive m a n with

Document File             by     the      Hillsborough        tragedy.          The    Foreword         to    his    Annual
Page 66                   Report          1989     gives     some        indication       of      his        professional
                          approach towards the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy.


                          There        is    nothing       which    suggests       that   Mr      WRIGHT       has    acted

                          injudiciously or unwisely.



            6. 6   In publishing Mr WRIGHT's words did anyone else commit a criminal

                   offence?


                   The only other matter to consider is the criminal liability of The
                   Sheffied      Star       newspaper.            The    article      published         on    5   February
                   reports the interview with Mr WRIGHT conducted earlier that day by

                   Mr HANNA.


                   Clearly     the     quotations          used     in    the   article        are    incomplete          and
                   sometimes      out       of    context,    but Mr       WRIGHT      has     confirmed,           and   the

                   transcript        of     the   full     interview verifies,            that       they     are a fair

                   representation of what Mr WRIGHT said.                          From a comparison between
                   the full      transcript and the whole                  article,       the reported              indirect

                   speech and other paragraphs are also a fair representation of the
                   interview.        That it misled the three complainants also seems clear

                   but    from       listening        to     the        tape-recording         and       studying         the

                   transcript there was certainly no malice or bad intent on the part
                   of Mr HANNA.             He did not press Mr WRIGHT                 to answer his questions

                   and heeded the cautionary words of Mr WRIGHT.                               The same arguments

                   already rehearsed in respect                    of contempt of court and attempting

                   to    pervert       the        course     of    justice       apply       in      respect        of    the

                   newspaper.


                   I am satisfied that no criminal offence has b ee n committed by The

                   Sheffied Star.

7.      FINAL CONCLUSIONS


          i)   Mr WRIGHT has not committed any criminal offence.



         ii)   Mr WRIGHT has not committed any disciplinary offence.


        iii)   The complaints are all unsubstantiated.


         iv)   There are no other matters for which Mr WRIGHT has to anwer.



          v)   No criminal offence has been commited by any other person      or

               co m p a n y .

                          I    am   the    father         of Victoria          Jane    and      Sarah   Louise HICKS          who

                          died      in    the       Hillsborough           tragedy     on 15     April       1989.       I     am

                          Chairman         of       the   Hillsborough          Family        Support    Group.         It    was

                          either      on the         evening of          5 February       1990    or    on   the     following

                          day,      6 February 1990 that my attention was                          drawn to an article

                          in    the      Sheffield        Star Newspaper          dated Monday          5 February          1990.

                          The       article         referred        to    featured       on     several      pages     of     the

                          newspaper        and was         also mentioned             in the    editorial      column.         In

                          this      article         the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire                         Police,     Mr

                          Peter       WRIGHT,         announced          his   retirement        and    he    is     quoted    as

                          saying,         and       it    is   my    belief      he     did     say,      several      remarks

                          concerning      evidence            relating       to          the         disaster         and to        the

                          forthcoming inquests.                   I considered some of these remarks to be

                          a   breach    of privileged              information           and     I subsequently                 made     a

                          complaint by letter to the South Yorkshire                                      Police Authority on

                          7   February    1990.          In    this    letter        I     outlined several                 areas      of

                           complaint which          I will now expand upon.                           I have         been    shown a

                           copy   of    the       letter      I    sent    to        the       Police       Authority            and     I

                           acknowledge that it is a true copy.

                          M y specific complaints are as f o l l o w s :

                           (1)    Any    information which                was     in M r         WRIGHT'S         possession            is

                                  confidential            and      I   consider            it        is    a    breach of           his

                                  privileged position for him to have said -

                                  "There      is a lot of information                       to       come out that has                 not

                                  already come o u t " .

                                  "There will be a lot of additional                                 evidence presented to

                                  the    Coroner's            enquiry      which         was     not       presented         at    Lord

                                  "What       I    found      difficult         to    understand               was    the       finding

                                  that    there was           drinking      among          a percentage              of   the     fans,

                                  and that they were under the influence of drink, but that

                                  it had no            effect on the         events.                 I found      that      a    little

                                  difficult to come to terms w i t h " .

                                  The    article        also reports            that       - Mr WRIGHT               suggests      that

                                  additional           evidence,          particularly               about      the       effect        of

                                  alcohol         on    fans,      will    present          "a       different        picture"          at

                               The    article        reports           that       - He     found        it hard          to    accept

                               TAYLOR's conclusion that drink h a d no bearing on the r u n ­

                               up    to    the    95    deaths.             "There        is    a   Coroner's           h e a r i n g --

                               and I think perhaps                     a different             picture will             emerge"       he

                               said today.

                               These       reports both directly and indirectly infer that he

                               had        information             in        his     possession              and       that        this

                               information         related             to    alcohol           levels       among       the     fans,

                               particularly the deceased.                           Even       if it did not relate as

                               he    inferred then any such information                                 is confidential               to

                               himself       and       the   Coroner's             Office         and   I       consider         it    a

                               breach       of    his    privileged               position          that     he    should         even

                               have       inferred      that       this          would paint         a different              picture

                               to'/the conclusions of the TAYLOR report.

                         (2)   I consider that my second specific complaint in                                           my letter

                               is self-explanatory and is again based on the article                                                  in

                               the Sheffield Star on 5 February 1990.                                    I accept that the

                               exact       quotation         includes             the     w ord     "may"       and      that     this

                               could be          inferred more               of a suggestion                than a        statement

                               but nonetheless               I believe             this    prejudges            the verdict           of

                               the        Coroner.           This           is     clearly          outside        Mr      WRIGHT'S

                               authority         and     insults            the    jurisdiction            of     the     Coroner's

                               Office.

                         (3)   I    believe       that       Mr    WRIGHT'S             pronouncements              during         the

                               Sheffield Star            interview and the                     rest of the media could

                         (4)       Mr WRIGHT        infers       in the pronouncements                    in the        Sheffield

                                   Star       on   5     February        1990       that       "There       is     a      lot    of

                                   information to come                out    that has          not   already       come     out".

                                   He has      therefore        failed to do his               job.        If he was        aware

                                   of information that was material to Lord Justice TAYLOR'S

                                   conclusions he              should have         ensured       it was      placed before

                                   him.        I   accept       that    if    any       information         came        into    his

                                   possession           after    Lord Justice           TAYLOR       closed his           receipt

                                   of       written      evidence       then       Mr    WRIGHT           could        hardly    be

                                   expected        to    do     so.     However I          find it         incredible          that

                                   there should be              "a lot of information"                available           in this

                                   short space of time.

                         (5) (6)        I   will    deal        with    complaints             (5) and      (6)        together.

                                   Basically what              I am saying         is that       if Mr WRIGHT has               any

                                   additional           information,         whether       it    relates          to    drink    or

                                   not,      it similarly would be                 confidential            and    as     outlined

                                   in complaint           (1) would be breach of privilege if released

                                   publicly,        if as       I suspect this                 is the same information as

                                   was      available         to TAYLOR      i.e. -        post mortem            reports       and

                                   Professor USHER'S summary then clearly this cannot be new

                                   or       additional.           Clearly     under        these      circumstances             his

                                   pronouncements constitute a deliberate attempt to mislead

                                   and/or influence prospective jurors.

                         (7)       Despite         the     fact       that    Mr     WRIGHT          is    quoted         in    the

                                   Sheffield Star editorial on the                         article        in the newspaper

                                   as       calling      the    TAYLOR       report        a    "Superb          document"       he

                                   persists        in     claiming      that       the     primary         conclusions          are

                                 wrong.        I believe this behaviour to be the application of

                                 double        standards         by     the    Chief        Constable       and    I consider

                                 such behaviour to be                   the worst of unprofessional conduct,

                                 and I suspect his motives for doing so.                                   I believe he         is

                                  trying       to       divert    blame        away    from     the     South          Yorkshire

                                 Police and on to the                   fans.

                         It is      my complaint that in making these claims now and publicly

                         Mr WRIGHT has           committed a            disagraceful act.             That     this      act    is

                         quite clearly not what should be expected from a chief o f f i c e r ,

                         that it could affect the Inquest's                           impartiality and finally                   it

                         appears     to     be      a    blatant        attempt       to     distort        the    course        of

                         justice.         By   this       I mean       that    at     the    time    the pronouncements

                         were made        it was         not known       to Mr WRIGHT           or    anybody          else    that

                         the     inquests           would    be        n o n-a dver saria l,         and     it        could     be

                         construed     that         Mr WRIGHT'S         motives       were     designed       to       influence

                         the verdict of the Coroner's inquest.

                         I   sign    this      statement          on     the    understanding           that       I    will     be

                       I am the father of Christopher Barry DEVONSIDE who died in the

                       Hillsborough        tragedy    on    15   April   1989.       Sometime        in   February

                       1990    I became     aware of an article which had been published                          in

                       the    Sheffield     Star     Newspaper      on   5    February       1990.        In    this

                       article the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police announced

                       his    retirement     and     several     quotations        are    attributed       to   him

                       concerning the Hillsborough tragedy and the Lord Juctice TAYLOR

                       report.     Having     read    the article        I considered that Mr WRIGHT,

                       the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire                      Police,       should not have

                       have made      the pronouncements          and in doing so was              in breach of

                       his    privileged position.            Because    of   this       I wrote a letter of

                             complaint           to South Yorkshire Police Authority on 3 March                                     1990.

                             In     this    letter       I outlined       areas        of my          complaint which              I will

                             now     enlarge       upon.         I have    been        shown          a copy    of    the   letter         I

                             sent     to     the Police       Authority          and       I     acknowledge         that     it    is    a

                             true copy.

                              (1)          I believe        that    Mr    WRIGHT           has    misused       his    position           by

                                           implying through          innuendo,             insinuation and veiled hints

                                           that    additional       evidence,          not        revealed      to    Lord Justice

                                           TAYLOR    would        show    alcohol          played          a major     part        in    the

                                           tragedy.        I quote from the Star Newspaper article.

                                           (a)     Mr      WRIGHT        suggests              that        additional       evidence

                                                    particularly about the                     effect of alcohol on f a n s ,

                                                    will     present         "a        different              picture"         at        the

                                                    held.

                                           (b)     He    found      it    hard        to       accept       TAYLOR'S     conclusion

                                                    that drink had no bearing on the run-up to the 95

                                                    deaths.         "There       is    a       Coroner's       h eari ng            and    I

                                                    think perhaps a different picture will e m e r g e " , he

                                                    said today.

                                                    he     was      emphasising                 the        evidence     which           was

                                 In    my    view        Mr    WRIGHT      is       trying     to      fabricate      a     smoke

                                 reputation.

                       (2)       Mr WRIGHT'S            apparent attempt               to    influence either public

                      My     overall concern             is Mr       WRIGHT'S          misuse,         in my     opinion,        of

                       privileged       information and              of    his      misuse        of    his    position      of

                       power and authority such as                        to devalue          our      trust and faith           in

                       the judicial system by exerting persuasive influence.

                      This      complaint          is     made      on     the       basis        that     the      additional

                       information that Mr WRIGHT refers to is available,                                        and if it is

                       not available this adds substance to my complaint.

                       I am the father of Philip HAMMOND who                    died in the Hillsborough

                       tragedy     on     15 April     1989.       Around   5 February        1990       I was   made

                       aware of an article in the newspaper,                   the Sheffied Star dated 5

                       February 1990.            The newspaper article dealt with the retirement

                       of   the    Chief      Constable       of   South    Yorkshire       Police,       Mr     Peter

                       WRIGHT.       Certain pronouncements             in the article were              attributed

                       to   the     Chief        Constable,        which    concerned       the      Hillsborough

                       tragedy and the Lord Justice TAYLOR                    report.        I felt Mr WRIGHT

                       should      not    have      made   these    remarks    and     I wrote       a    letter    of

                       complaint         to   the    South     Yorkshire      Police      Authority.           In   my

                             have     been    shown    a    copy          of       the       letter        I   wrote       to     the    South

                              copy.    The complaints I make are as follows:

                              (1)       I feel that Mr WRIGHT abused his privileged position as

                                        Chief     Constable            by          inferring          to        the       Sheffield       Star

                                       newspaper        that         he    h ad         "confidential"                information         that

                                       would    come       to    light             in    the    inquest,            and    that    this    was

                                        derogatory to those who lost their lives.                                          I accept that

                                        the word      "confidential"                        is my word          and does not            appear

                                        in    the article in the newspaper                             as being            attributed       to

                                        Mr    WRIGHT.           To     support                  this        complaint         Idraw attention

                                        to the following parts of the newspaper article.

                                        (a)     "There          will        be          a    lot      of       additional          evidence

                                                presented to              the           Coroner's          inquiry         which    was    not

                                                presented at Lord Justice TAYLOR'S                                        inquiry,       which

                                                may        put        a     different              complexion               on     the     end

                                                product".

                                        (b)     "What       I    found             difficult           to      understand          was     the

                                                finding that there was drinking among a percentage

                                                of     the           fans,          and        that        they       were       under     the

                                           disaster      which          is    expected          to   last       some       months

                                           beginning       later        this year          or early         in 1991,         will

                                           reveal "a different picture".

                                  (d)      Mr WRIGHT           said:        "There    is    a    lot      I would want         to

                                           say     about        Hillsborough.                  There      are    a     lot     of

                                           comments        I    would        want    to     make       on   Lord       Justice

                                           TAYLOR'S report, but in the circumstances I can't.

                                           There is a lot of information to come out that has

                                           not already come o u t " .

                       (2)   In     this    complaint           I      am    saying        that      if     there      is     any

                             additional          evidence       he     has    failed       to     do his        duty by       not

                             making this evidence known to Lord Justice TAYLOR.

                             It    is my    personal view               and belief          that     these      disgraceful

                             pronouncements by Mr WRIGHT,                      could effect the impartiality

                             of    jurors     in    both        Coroner's       inquest          proceedings           and    any

                             criminal proceedings.                     I feel       that Mr WRIGHT'S             actions       in

                             this       regard     are   not        what     should       be    expected        of     a    Chief

                             Constable and he has therefore abused the privilege of his

                             rank in doing so.

                        I    am   employed        as    a    newspaper       reporter         by    the       Sheffield         Star

                      announcing Mr WRIGHT'S                        retirement.         Bob WESTERDALE       is quoted as

                      the     reporter              in the         copy    I have been shown by           Superintendent

                      DARLING        but          the    article          is mine and      my    name     does    appear       in

                      later     editions                of    the     newspaper.           The     article       is     a    true

                      reflection of what was said by Mr WRIGHT and I transcribed the

                      tape     of    the          interview as            accurately      as    I could with          the    time

                      available              to     me before         the news     deadline.        The    parts       of     the

                      article            in       inverted          commas       show     they     are     direct        quotes

                      attributable                  to Mr      WRIGHT, although            not    necessarily          in     the

                      order he said them.                      I do not believe            they distort the context

                      of the        interview by changing them around in this                                fashion.          In

                      places        to       avoid repetition or ambiguity                      I omitted a wor d or            a

                      clause.            A    few words            I misheard whe n            I transcribed the            tape,

                      but     there'1 again              I    do     not    believe       such    changes        altered      the

                      essence        of what            Mr WRIGHT          was   saying.       In any event           following

                      publication of the article,                           there was      no     complaint made by Mr

                      WRIGHT or the South Yorkshire Police.                                I would also repeat that

                       the leader column quotation "Superb                               document" was       also      said by

                      Mr WRIGHT in the interview with me.                                I have handed the original

                       tape    recording            of       the    interview     to     Superintendent          DARLING.       I

                      sign this statement on the understanding that I will receive a

                      copy.

                      produce      copies    of those n o t i c e s .      I drew his            attention to           the

                      caution      printed     on   the    Notices      and   invited him             to       read   them.

                      He    then    signed the Notices           and returned         them to me,               retaining

                      an exact copy of each.                He then handed to me a prepared                           typed

                      Wright       that he had been cautioned.                 I then said,            "I       intend to

                       ask you      some    questions.         You are     not   obliged         to    say       anything

                      be    given    in    evidence."          Mr Wright      said,    "I    quite         understand.

                       Please ask your questions."                At 11.23am I proceeded to question

                      Mr    Wright     and    Superintendent           Darling    made       a    contemporaneous

                       Superintendent        Darling      then    read   the     contemporaneous                 note   out

                       loud to Mr Wright who              then initialled the bottom of each page.

                      At    3pm on Monday,        9 April 1990 I spoke              to Mr Mark HANNA at the

                      premises     of      the     Sheffield      Star    newspaper             in    York      Street,

                      Sheffield.           I     recorded     a   witness       statement             from    him      and

                      received    into m y        possession an audio           cassette         labelled        "Peter

                      Wright    5.2.90."          I   subsequently       made       a   transcription           of     the

                      sound track on the audio cassette.                   On Tuesday,               10 April 1990 I

                      was    present at Durham Constabulary Headquarters when the                                    Chief

                      Constable of Cumbria Constabulary,                  Mr Leslie Sharp,                  interviewed

                      the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Mr Peter Wright.

                      The interview took place in the Deputy Chief Constable's office

                      at 11.05am.          Mr    Sharp explained to Mr Wright why the interview

                      was    taking     place.        He    informed     Mr    Wright       that       he     ha d   been

                      appointed       by    the    South    Yorkshire         Police      Authority           with     the

                         approval   of    the   Police        Complaints          Authority         to   investigate         a

                         number of complaints made against him and that these complaints

                         embraced    allegations         of        criminal       and        disciplinary           matters.

                         Between 11.10am and 11.11am Mr Sharp                       served three Regulation 7

                         Notices on Mr Wright.           Mr Sharp signed the notices and drew the

                         attention of Mr Wright to the caution printed thereon.                                      He then

                         invited Mr Wright         to read the notices.                      Mr Wright        then signed

                         the notices      and returned them to Mr Sharp,                       retaining a copy of

                         each notice for his own use.                    Mr Wright then handed to Mr Sharp

                         a   prepared     statement      and       a    photocopy       of    an    article         from   The

                         Times   newspaper.         Mr    Sharp          read     the       prepared     statement          and

                         reminded Mr Wright         that he had been cautioned.                          Mr    Sharp       then

                         said "I intend to ask you some questions.                             Y o u are not obliged

                         to say axjything but         anything you do               say will be          taken down          in

                         writing    and may be      given in evidence."                      Mr Wright        replied,       "I

                         quite understand.          Please ask your               questions."            Mr    Sharp       then

                         proceeded to ask Mr Wright a series of questions and I recorded

                         the   answers     given   by    Mr    Wright.            The       interview      commenced         at

                         11.23am    and    terminated         at       12.05pm.         I    then   read      the    written

                         questions and answers to Mr Wright who                         then initialled the foot

                         of each page.       The interview was then concluded.

 Police chief’s
 sad farewell
 TODAY'S news that Peter Wright. Chief Corv-
 stable of South Yorkshire, is retiring will be
 met with very mixed feelings in this region.
      He Is the man who has borne the brunt o f.
 devastating criticism after the Hillsborough
 disaster. His force was condemned for Ineffl-.
 clency and Its senior officers came In for
 especially severe criticism.
      The final report by Lord Justice Taylor
 has not retracted &ny of that criticism.
      Today, although still under legal con­
 straints, be has spoken out more frankly than
 ever.before. He- ftas_made dear that hie
  accepts the Taylor report. He even calls It a“
 •‘superb document"                     ,'•>
       He id sympathetic towards'his' officere. ^
  who were underJremwdous pressure, both
  on the day and at the Inquiry.. He under­
  stands their feeling of. resentment and Injus­
  tice. But he believes a very different picture
 .will emerge when the ^coroner's'hearing Is ’
  held. * ‘               f ;• $ 7 :Vv*
  . To bis credit, Peter- Wright offered to
  resign after Hillsborough but' councillor*,';
   pensaaded him to stay. That was a measure .
   of their respect for his quallties.; He has,
   stayed bn “to pull the force together" for a
   new leader, so that h can go’forward with
   certainty. '        •
        During his years In ;charge of South
   Yorkshire’s force he has fought .consistently,
   for more manpower so that jstandards. of.,
   policing could be Improved.. He has mado
   safety In the streets his special target tod.
   has Initiated many improvement? and
   innovations.                   .• i
        ft Is,, therefore, :sad that ^.distinguished
   career of devoted public service shoujd end ’
   In this way, with a ctoud .of.^UcteriVsJJutt'
   could easily obscure the good achieved.
        Peter Wright is an honourable man arx* e-
   dedlcated professional. Hie 1s right to.go.birt.
    It Is also right to. thank him forall he has done
    for South Yorkshire and to wlsJi him happJ-,
    noss In his retirement. ..                   -

Dear

re:    Chief Constable Mr. Peter Wright.

I w i s h to file a complaint against Mr. Wright.
I would      ask  you  to  cause  this  to be   recorded and, in view of his
forthcoming "retirement", request urgent attention to its resolution.

Despite "setting aside" the   national press  on the  basis that  they are
r eporting second  hand, I consider his   actions and  comments during the
interview with the "Sheffield Star" of the 5th   instant to be at   best a
breach of   his privileged  position and  at worst a deliberate attempt to
divert the cause of justice.

As some comments can be considered as being actions designed to influence
the  outcome  of  the  Coi'bners Inquest,  1 have   copied this letter to
Dr.Popper at the Medico-Legal Centre for his attention.

Similarily, a copy will be forwarded to the West Midlands Police
Investigation Team and because of Mr.Wrights rank, The  Police Complaints
Authority.

My specific complaints are as follows:-

      1) Mr.  Wright is  guilty of abuse of the privilege of his position in
      suggesting to the media he was  aware that  information would  come to
      light in the Inquest,that would present "a different picture".

      He infers this relates to drink and or its effects.
      A ss u m i n g Mr.Wright has seen such "evidence" it is"confidential" until
      deemed otherwise by H.M.Coroner and should remain that way. Clearly a
      breach of priviledge.

      2)By  suggesting  that  this   "puts    a different complexion on the end
      product" he prejudges the verdict    of   the  Coroner.  This  is clearly
      outside his  authority and   insults the    juristiction of the coroner's
      office.

      3)1 believe   that his   pronouncements could  prejudice Inquest Jurors,
      w h o will of course   be drawn  from the  area covered by the newpaper
      cited.




                          i
                                                                                     1
   4 )He goes on to infer that Lord Justice Taylor was not aware.of all of
   the facts and "that there is   a lot   of information   that has  not yet
   come out."   He has  therefore, by   his own admission, failed to do his
   job. If he is aware of   information that   is material   to Lord Justice
   Taylor's conclusions he should have ensured it was placed before him.

   5 ) If,      as Mr.Wright  claims,  this   material  relates  to drink then
   p r e sumably it is additional to that contained in the summary document
   p r o du c e d by Professor Usher  for Justice   Taylor ( the one withdrawn
   from circulation) and to the post        mortem reports,-  in which case we
   shall be        asking our lawyers to obtain details of it and to establish
   w h y this was with^held from us.

   6 ) If,   as     I suspect,     this   is merely   the   same information, then
   Mr.Wright        is well     aware   that this   has   been available  for many
   month s . C l e ar l y it cannot be "new" or "additional"to that considered by
   Taylor.
   Under these circumstances          his actions constitute a deliberate attempt
   to mislead- an offence under the discipline code or worse.

   7 )Mr.Wright claims to accept  the findings  of The  Taylor Report, and
   even calls it "a superb document".
   Yet he   persists in claiming the primary conclusion is wrong. That is
   as clear an example of "double   standards" as  one could ever see and
   serves to underline questions regarding what his motives are.


It  is my   complaint   that  in making these claims now and publicly Mr.
Wright has committed a disgraceful act.  That this  act is quite clearly
not what  should be   expected from a Chief Officer, that it could effect
the Inquest's impartiality and finally it appears to be a blatant attempt
to distort the course of justice.

As  stated  earlier,in view   of   Mr.  Wrights  rank  and the time cycles
involved I have forwarded   a copy   of this  letter (and the article) to
Captain  Taylor  at   The Police Complaints A uthority for their immediate
attention and action.

I appreciate that the normal  protocols  will  need  to be   observed but
suggest that the 1st May deadline leaves little time for delay.

                               Yours Faithfully,




                                 Trevor Hicks.

Dear Sir

I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about
comments made by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
Mr Peter Wright, both stated orally and published in
particular, in ’The St a r ’ on 5 February 1990 and ’The Guardian*
6 February 1990. My complaint relates to the following:

1.  The distressing innuendo insinuation and veiled hints that
additional evidence, not revealed to Lord Justice Taylor, will
show alcohol played a major part in the tragedy. The post
mortem reports do show that some of the deceased had been
drinking; so what? It is not in a free society, an offence to
consume alcohol',' and if police officers were vigilant and
suspected alcohol-related offences outside the ground then no
doubt great play would have been made of those arrest figures.
In my view Mr Wright is trying to fabricate a smoke-screen
after the event to protect his officers, and maybe even his own
reputation.

2. An apparent attempt to influence either public opinion or
the minds of potential jurors by making sweeping statements in
and out of the press. I d o n ’t know how the sub judice rule
applies, but the lawyers in Liverpool have advised us strongly
not to allow ourselves to be exerting any persuasive influence.
Surely the same applies to Mr Wright?

My concern is the misuse of privileged information, or of
positions of power and authority, such as to devalue our trust
and faith in the judicial system.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely




B W Devonside

Dear 1

re: Chief Constable Mr. Peter Wright.

I am the father   of Philip  Hammond who died in the Hill s b o r o ug h
Tragedy and have taken  a close  interest in actions surrounding
the investigation of that day.

I w ish to file  a complaint against Mr. Wright and w o u l d ask the
authority to cause this to be  recorded and  arrangements made to
investigate  it quickly,   especially  in view of his forthcoming
retirement.

My complaint      is twofold

          1)In ma king v^ais pronouncements   immediately after announcing
          his retirement     Mr. Wright abused his privileged position by
          inferring to the     media  he  had   "confidential" information
          that w o u l d come to  light in the Inquest, and that this was
          derogatory to those who lost their lives.

          2 )He similarily  inferred that Lord Justice   Taylor w as not
          aware   of  all  of  the  facts and  "that there is a lot of
          information that has not yet come out." He   has therefore by
          his own admission failed to do his job.

It  is my belief    that   these disgraceful acts could effect the
Inquest's impartiality   and was  a deliberate  attempt to aistort
the  course of   justice.   Quite  clearly  not what should be the
actions of a Chief Officer.

In view of Mr. Wrights rank and the  time cycle  involved I would
advise that  I have forwarded a copy of this letter to the Police
Complaints Authority for their attention and action.

                               Yours Faithfully,

  COMPLAINTS BY TREVOR HICKS AND PHILLIP HAMMOND

  I refer to your letter of 20 February and the enclosed letters of complaint by
  Trevor Hicks and Phillip Hammond.  I think it would be appropriate if the
  Authority had some comment from me to consider when deciding how this
   complaint should be pursued-

   To put the complaints in context following the announcement of my retirement I
   gave a personal interview to reporters from 'The Star and The Times •
   agree that the direct quotes contained in the articles are a fa r re  ec
   of the comments I made but not necessarily in the order in which
   I accept no responsibility for articles that appeared in other newspapers.

   I will now comment on the specific complaints raised by Mr Hicks which also
   subsume the general complaints made by Mr Hammond.

            1        Mr wriaht is puiltv of abuse of the privilege of his position i n _

  To say as I did that this additional evidence "may put a different
  complexion on the end product" was a proper comment and not a breach of
  privilege, whatever that may mean.


   2,    By suggesting that this "puts a different complexion on the end
         product" he prejudges the verdict of the Coroner.  This is clearly
         outside his authority and insults the jurisdiction of the Coroner's,
         o f fi ce.

   In support of hits complaint, Hr IIlcKs uses a selective quotation which
   leaves out the qualifying words included in the article.    Given
   additional evidence will be produced and having regard to my role as
   spokesman for the South Yorkshire Police, I see nothing wrong in
   expressing the belief that this additional evidence may put a different
   complexion on the end p r o d u c t .


   3.    I believe that his pronouncements could prejudice Inquest jurors,
         who will of course be drawn from the area covered by the newspaper
         cltod.

   The allegation that my comments could prejudice potential jurors again
   has no basis when reflected against what I said during the interviews.
   Having regard to all the publicity given to Lord Justice Taylor s
   Inquiry, all that has been said by many people publicly during and since
   the Inquiry and specifically the recent ’First Tuesday' programme, the
   suggestion that my statement could prejudice jurors is quite simply
   nonse nse.


   4.    He goes on to infer that Lord Justice Taylor was not aware of all__of
          the facts and "that there is a lot of information that has not yet
          come out".  He has therefore, by his own admission, failed to do__his
          job.  If he is aware of information that is material to Lord Justice
          Taylor's conclusions he should have ensured it was placed before
          him.

    All the evidence in the possession of the South Yorkshire Police has been
    handed to the West Midlands enquiry and this includes information coming
    to notice sinco the conclusion of Lord Justice Taylor's Hearing.  The
    information not presented to the Hillsborough Inquiry and the basis tor
    my comments is indicated In my response at 1. and I cannot add to it.



    5.    if, as Mr Wright claims, this material relates to drink then
          presumably It is additional to that contained in the summ ary
          document produced by Professor Usher for Justice_Tajrlor (the one
          withdrawn from circulation) and to the post mortem.rggprts - In
          which case we shall be asking our lawyers to obtain details of,_it
          and to establish why this was withheld from us.

    I have not claimed that the material related to drink.

   6.     If, as I suspect, this is m erely the same Information, then Mr __
          Wright is well aware that this has been available for many months.
          Clearly it cannot be "new11 or "additional" to that considered b£
          Taylor.

          Under these circumstances his actions constitute a deliberate
          attempt to mislead - an offence under the discipline code or worse.

    I can only refer to my comments above in relation to new or additional
    evidence.   Solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police have sought
    Information on the matters outlined at 1. from the West Midlands Police
    but on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions and
    I!M Coroner they have declined to release It.


    7.      Mr Wright claims to accept the findings of the Taylor Report, and
            even calls it "a superb document".

            Yet he oersists In claiming the primary conclusion is wrong.  That
            is as clear an example of "double standards" as one could ever see
            and serves to underline questions regarding what his motives are.

    1 have from the outset made it clear that I accept the findings of Lord
    Justice Taylor and as Chief Constable I have ensured that all his
    recommendations have been pursued vigorously and with expedition.   I have
    also said that I consider his Final Report to be a superb document that
    addresses all the ills of football.  If the recommendations of the Report
    are Implemented they will go a long way to ridding the sport of the
    problems that have attended it over the past decade.

     There la nothing inconsistent in accepting the conclusions of judicial
     proceedings without necessarily being in agreement with all the views
     expressed or the weight given to the various factors involved.  For
     instance, the South Yorkshire Police accepting the criticisms contained
     In Lord Justice Taylor's Report agreed to settle compensation claims.
     Other parties involved who were also criticised declined to do ao.

     My motives, which Mr Hicks calls into question, are quite
     straightforward.  They are to ensure that all available evidence is
     forthcoming for those Investigating the events at Hillsborough whether or
     not it is critical of police action.  It remains a fact that all the
     evidence has not as yet been publicly presented.  It may be that when it
     is the conclusions already arrived at will be unaffected.  On the other
     hand It may present a different picture of the causal factors that
     resulted in the terrible tragedy at Hillsborough.


The only matter in Mr Hammond's letter not covered above is the rather
astonishing claim that my comments were derogatory to those who lost their
lives.  I am unable to account for how he came to tnat conclusion.

The interview I gave to 'The Star' immediately followed that given to 'The
Times'.  I think members should also see the printed account of that
interview, a copy of which I enclose.

                   TRANSCRIPT OF "PETER WRIGHT 5.2.90" TAPE

                  OBTAINED FROM THE SHEFFIELD STAR NEWSPAPER




 Reporter     The first question actually was going to be why now.
 (Mr Hanna)

 Mr Wright    You know that I was President of the Association up to October
              last year.       Two years before I took it on you           - the
              Assocation - as the President, the Vice President which you
              are the year before you're President and the immediate past
              President, before I took it on I wrote and said I would not be
              doing my immediate past presidency two years ago.           It was
              always my intention the moment I'd finished to retire but of
              course   with     Hillsborough and ongoing things it was       not
              possible sowith the publication of the final         part of   the
              Taylor report, with the knowledge that the investigation would
              be concluded in April I think ... and also it's fairly well
              known throughout the Force and the Service that I was going to
              go.   I think     it removes the uncertainty now.   The Force from
              the first of     March and under a new Chief can move    forward with
              certainty.    First of May.  What did I say.

 Reporter     March.  How old will you be on the first of        .....    You won't be
              quite sixty-one or will you.

 Mr Wright    Almost sixty-one.   I don't look it.

 Reporter     I'm trying to work     out   how   many   months   you've   stayed   on,
              another ten or ..

 Mr Wright    It's probably another five.       I had to stay on as the
              president.   I had to go on.     I was going to go in July,
              because I was president, I had to stay on until the .....
              October so really I've stayed on since October.

, Reporter    ........ and it was merely that, the publication of the           final
              report was that the trigger as it were.

 Mr Wright    Yes.   In a sense I mean I thought it was up to me to stay on
              to pull together the aftermath of the Taylor Report and in a
              sense provide the leadership to the Force during that period
              from April last year until the final report.     I think I've
              done that.

 Reporter     If there is still an aftermath after that as it were there is
              a Chief Const able.........

Mr Wright     Well it will go on for some time, the Coroner's inquest,
              that's not likely to be until the back end of this year, may
              even be the beginning of next year, so the actual knock on
              effects of Hillsborough will be with us for quite some time.
              But I've got no control over those events.
/




    Reporter    It's perhaps still early days but do you think the Force has
                recovered from the trauma of Hillsborough.

    Mr Wright   I think the Force, I think individuals within the Force, will
                take a long time.  A few individuals in the Force will take a
                long time to recover but I think the Force has recovered.    I
                think  there's  a very    strong  feeling  of  resentment  and
                injustice in the Force as a result of Hillsborough.   It would
                be wrong if that were not so because that's what I pick up
                going round the Force speaking to officers trying to keep
                soundings of what feelings are.  And there is this feeling of
                injustice about it not in a sense that we did everything right
                but simply nobody seems to have grasped the full picture.

    Reporter    Do you think the Force   itself might be   to   blame   for   that   in
                some w a y s .

    Mr Wright   One   of the difficulties I've got Mark in the ongoing          civil
                        in the enquiry is to discuss the detail ....

    Reporter    I appreciate that.

    Mr Wright   And I'll go as far as I can and say what I can but it's
                difficult for me to give - you know - I've got the Police
                Authority questioning me at every meeting.   There's a letter
                from the Director of Public Prosecutions, I've got a letter
                from our Solicitors saying that I must not discuss the detail
                or pass opinions where under different circumstances I would
                like to be open about it but I can't so you'll have to
                understand that.  Not being evasive, I'm just ....

    Reporter    No I appreciate .... one of the things I was going to ask you
                and you    may not take   it any further in view of those
                restrictions but - having just struck me.

    Mr Wright   What do you want and   let's see whether I can.

    Reporter    At the enquiry it struck me that thete was .... overhanging it
                was the possibility of the civil case all the time and in a
                way your    insurers presumably      were handling the course of the
                enquiry,   not what individual officers were saying that there
                was a framework which .

    Mr Wright   That's a fact.   That was cleared right at the beginning.  The
                question of civil proceedings did not alter any of the
                attitude     I mean the  officers  who  went  there  were  not
                constrained by the possibility of civil proceedings - every
                item of evidence that was available was put in - and it was
                all brought out in the open and that's what the purpose of the
                enquiry was.   So as such the officers were just simply saying
                what they had done on the day and why they did it and if that
                revealed evidence supportive of civil proceedings against us
                so be it there was no way that we would seek to hide that.

    Reporter    I think everyone was still shocked when the enquiry was taking
                place obviously but occasionally one felt     that the senior
                officers were keeping a rein on themselves not hiding facts
                but they weren't being as emotional as they may have done.   I




                                                                                          17
                                            - 3 -



            wonder if they'd been more emotional about their evidence and
            maybe that's .........

Mr Wright   You try.   I mean, I've tried to put myself in their position
            where they were, the senior officers who'd taken action on the
            day, being questioned in great detail about the events that
            took place in ten m i n u t e s , quarter of an hour over a period of
            six weeks nearly and not just that but barristers, highly
            trained barristers, following each other picking and probing
            for any factors that would help their case or reduce their
            responsibilities   and       officers    under   those  circumstances
            naturally were perhaps not themselves.

Reporter    Yes.   Presuming then you don't - I'm not         expecting   you   to
            launch an attack on Lord Justice Taylor.

Mr Wright   No I'm not.

Reporter    But he did say in his evidence that in his findings in the
            interim report that he felt some officers had been - to use
            that phrase - evasive and defensive.

Mr Wright   Yes.   Perhaps if you've made decisions, or taken action or
            made decisions to take action or made decisions not to take
            action and ninety-five people had been killed would you not
            feel a little inhibited in terms of answering questions.  But
            we all had, I don't know whether you can see this, feeling of
            incredible sense of guilt, merited or not.

Reporter    Yes.   Just sticking with this point, I don't expect you to
            name individuals, is it possible for you to say what kind of
            toll it has taken on some individuals without, I mean, what
            kind of things have been happening.

Mr Wright   Well, the point you see they cannot shake off Hillsborough
            because Hillsborough's not gone away it's still with them, it
            will be with them for some time.   They are the subject of an
            ongoing investigation about Hillsborough so consequently it's
            difficult to return to normality under those circumstances.

Reporter    Yes.

Mr Wright   Others suffered as a result of the events there rather than
            being involved in the enquiry and that's part of personality
            inorder,  that the individual might be deeply shocked and
            traumatized by Hillsborough.      We've had officers who've
            retired on ill-health whether wholly or in part as a result of
            Hillsborough.

Reporter    Yes.     you feel that the Sheffield or South Yorkshire public
            was as "critical if you like as Lord Justice Taylor or do you
            feel that their public support is not .....

Mr Wright   It's difficult isn't it.    I mean you can only go off what
            people tell you whether they tell you one thing and someone
            else another but - there seems to be a broader understanding -
            you see Lord Justice Taylor was dealing with evidence and he
            was emphasising the evidence that was available and one
®                                                - 4 -


                wouldn't expect him     to doother than that.           What I found
                difficult to understand was the finding that there was drink
                amongst a percentage   of the f a n s , and that they were under the
                influence of drink,   but it had no effect on the events.           I
                could just find that a little difficult to come to terms with,
                but that was Lord Justice Taylor's findings.        A nd I accept his
                findings.  He had the responsibility to coming to conclusions
                from   the  evidence  that  was       given   and  those    were  the
                conclusions he came to.   I think his final report is a superb
                document.  I think he recognises all the ills that are part of
                football and in fact were present on the day.

    Reporter    Yes I'll move on to the final ..... is there        - I'm not trying
                to read something you're not saying.     Is         there then some
                evidence which with the best will of all the        parties involved
                was not available at the enquiry, on drink         which might have
                been available or which may be available in        any other forums
                if it does come to a civil case.

    Mr Wright   I don't know.

    Reporter    You've   not    been   in   charge   of   collecting   the   evidence
                 obviously.

    Mr Wright   No we've not - but - there will be another hearing and that
                 will have been the Coroner's hearing and I think it will be a
                 different hearing and I think a lot of evidence that perhaps -
                 Lord Justice Taylor was not concerned with the rules of
                 evidence, that enquiry was not concerned with the rules of
                 evidence.    The Coroner's enquiry to some extent will be
                 constrained by the rules of evidence and I think a different
                 picture will emerge.   What I'm anxious to do is to make sure
                 that all the evidence whatever, whether it's for the police or
                 it's critical of the police goes forward, because if things
                 have been done wrongly then they must never happen again.

    Reporter    Moving on from that.

    Mr Wright   No It's not come out as I wanted to say it.  It's almost as
                 though, - It's almost an admission that they were though I
                 wasn't wanting to say that.

    Reporter    Do you want the question again.

    Mr Wright   What I want to say is that Lord Justice Taylor's     enquiry is
                 finished.   It is the Coroner who is now going to conduct a
                 different enquiry.   He's going to go into the detail.     The
                 Coroner's  enquiry will   go  on for months   and perhaps    a
                 different picture will emerge from the Coroner's enquiry than
                 emerged?from Lord Justice Taylor's enquiries.

    Reporter    Is it true that he will have additional evidence.

    Mr Wright   Y e s , there will be a lot of additional evidence presented to
                 the Coroner's enquiry that was not presented to Lord Justice
                 Taylor's enquiry which may put a different complexion on the
                 end p r o d u c t .

    Reporter    Hoving on then to the final report I think the         general
                reaction from most parties was that football needed    to have
                that kind of broad criticism for a long time.   Yo u   say you
                welcomed the re p o r t s .

    Hr Wright   I welcomed the final report.

    Reporter    Do you feel that this is football's last chance, looking at it
                from the police side I don't think there was any particular
                criticism of the way the police operation has built up over
                the y e a r s .

    Hr Wright   No .

    Reporter    Obviously it has got more sophisticated and more regimented if
                you l i k e .......

    Hr Wright   Because of what had happened though in the past decade police
                attention was focussed on disorder and on remedying it.   That
                was the end product of experience in a sense.    What happened
                was a public safety aspect emerged in what - what was never
                really revealed was people have had time to think about it
                over generations.   The safety of Hillsborough, the safety of
                the turnstiles, the numbers going through, the crush.   All of
                the experts within football would have time to think about
                that   and have done nothing about it     because they've not
                perceived any problem.   And then the problem emerges the only
                ones who seem to be standing there to take responsibility were
                police officers who had at the most a quarter of an hour or
                twenty minutes at the most to deal with a situation in very
                traumatic  circumstances.   It took some  lawyers that long to
                get to the point of a question.

    Reporter    Yes .

    Hr Wright   Why was t h a t .

    Reporter    Yes.    Doyou feel football must change now.   I mean I don't
                know   how specific you want to   be but areyou infavour of the
                all seater stadiums.

    Hr Wright   I think we've got to go that way.  There are people who would
                argue that those who are prone to cause misbehaviour will not
                be altered by sitting down but in recognising what        the
                problems are Lord Justice Taylor has endeavoured to come up
                with solutions that might work.

    Reporter    The football authorities have perhaps     as predictable are
                putting up yet another, if I can call it, a rearguard action
                but an effective action any way in saying they can't pay - I
                mean - do you feel that .... keep listening to those arguments
                or do you feel that ....

    Hr Wright   That's a matter for football and if it's not seen to do
                something, then if anything else goes wrong they must take the
                responsibility they regard as proper.  But here we are with 36
                years police service and the only thing that matters is
                Hillsborough.  Can't escape it can I.
                                                   6



Reporter      No.  On the other hand, I think this morning I wanted to look
              at Hillsborough, I mean maybe if I'd had more time we would
              have gone over other aspects.

Hr Wright     I only wish that I could be more open in what I've said about
              Hillsborough because in a sense I am constrained by the legal
              situation that I'm in.    But what I would want to say about
              Hillsborough are those comments I would want to make on Lord
              Justice Taylor's report but in the circumstances I can't.


Reporter      I am grateful    for what you have said so shall we leave                it at
              that I think.

Other voice   I think you've said a lot more than you've previously                     said
              about the - nothing to keep you awake at night.

Reporter      Hoving on then looking back over 35 years as a whole would you
              have made the same decision to be a policeman with hindsight.


Hr Wright     No. No I mean obviously the events since Hillsborough have
              been the worst part of 'my career,   I think, in terms of its
              history as a professional.  But I've literally loved this job.
              I think it's a wonderful service and that's what we're here to
              provide.  We do provide a wonderful service and I've enjoyed
              every minute of it.   There have been ups and there have been
              downs but not more low than the event we've just been talking
              about but you join this organisation and whatever level of
              responsibility you carry you meet those ups and downs and you
              meet those problems.    If you don't want difficulties if you
              don't want problems don't join the police service.

Reporter      Are   the   public    now    expecting   too   much   or   have   they   always
              expected too much.

Hr Wright     I think the fact that they do expect a lot shows the response
              that we give them and I want to see them expecting a lot from
              the police   service    and I want    to see  their levels   of
              expectation in t h e ' police service remaining extremely high
              both in terms of behaviour of police officers, both in terms
              of performance of police officers and the attitude of police
              officers.  We're there to help.     We've got to be  constantly
              perceived as being there to help.

 Reporter      On a personal       note.    Have you any     immediate plans      after Hay
               1990.

 Hr Wright     I've got one or two considerations.

 Reporter      When you say considerations         again not    to push you but        I mean
               do you want to stay working o r ....

 Hr Wright     No.   No.   I think that .... I think you've got to work at
               retirement.  I think - again retirement.  It's not resignation
               it's retirement.  You've got to work at retirement and both my
               wife and I are looking foward to doing the new period of life
               together which is something we've not done a great deal of in
               the past.




                                                                                                21

    Reporter    Would you be staying     in this     area    or   is    that   part    of    those
                consideration s.

    Hr Wright   Well, it will be.    It will       be.      We'll      be   remaining       in   the
                vicinity of South Yorkshire.

    Reporter    I've to check through some of the ...   Y o u haven't got any -
                again perhaps I'm pushing you too far, but is there any chance
                you might become an Inspector of Constabulary, something like
                that.

    Hr Wright   No.     There's no chance of that.

    Reporter    That's your own personal preference rather than                .....

    Hr Wright   Well no its an objective view of the situation.

    Reporter    Just quickly looking through:   I mean I didn't particularly
                want to go over the miners' strike and things like that again
                unless .....

    Hr Wright   Whatever you want .... What I'd like to do ... please I would
                like  to  project   an  optimistic  and  positive   note about
                Hillsborough if you could do it that way.     If I've not .been
                able to deal with some of the issues to the depth I would have
                liked to and to say some of the things as strongly as I would
                like to its because of the constraints we're under.

    Reporter    Well.   I think in your notes - in your resignation letter
                you're saying that you feel that the morale of the Force is
                high, and the Force is in good heart which is the kind of
                things I was going to ask you.

    Hr Wright   Yes .

    Reporter    I think you also anticipated my question about .... that some
                officers are frustrated as it were, so I won't go over that
                again.

    Hr Wright   And feel a sense of injustice - as strong as that.

    Reporter    Just as a matter of fact, I'm not asking you to comment the
                legal situation now is that the Authority has decided to meet
                some claims, without admitting strict liability.   Presumably
                there is now a negotiating process going on.   What about the
                possibility of a three or four cornered fight as it were
                between the Council, Club a n d ..........

    Hr Wright   Well we'll certainly agree to that.    There'll either be an
                amicable acceptance of responsibility or there will be an
                action - but there's a lot of information to come out that's
                not already come out.

    Reporter    So that would then be - you would - the Authority would pay
                damages to whatever hopefully is an amicably agreed level and
                then you would then try and reclaim a percentage of that from
                the various   ........................




                                                                                                       n
/




        Hr Wright   Our action was built to take the weight from the fans - the
                    relatives of the fans - to agree with - we felt that that was
                    most important and that's why we've done that.   We would have
                    liked the others to have gone along with us in that spirit but
                    they decided that they were not going to.    It's left for us
                    now to have apportionment hearings and actions to decide on
                    what level remuneration comes from each.

        Reporter     Yes.  You took that in your point when you say the police were
                     left standing for the moment ....

        Hr Wright    We've taken a high profile, we've not sought to evade the
                     issue.   I found Lord Justice Taylor's comments about the
                     evasion of chief officers just a little h a r s h .I thought it
                     was - some of his comments were savage, I thought, but that's
                     how he saw it.      But I think they were harsh under the
                     circumstances that the officers found.

        Reporter     Well ... I think I'll leave it there ....    I think you have
                     been very frank and I appreciate that.  I think we'll probably
                     be going round and round in circles over the same ground.
                     I'll just have a last check through.   I mean I would like to
                     pin you down more on your immediate plans but perhaps I'll
                     have the opportunity later.

        Hr Wright    It is really.   Perhaps there might be an opportunity later.

        Reporter     Thanks.

I have been appointed                                    investigate a s s B ^ ^ s g s l& f t /c o m p la in t which has been made
against you, written particulars of which are set out below :

Trevor HICKS of                                                                                       Middlesex,       has    made   seven
specific complaints against you.

Mr HICKS says, despite setting aside the national press on the basis that they are
reporting second hand, he considers your action and comments during the interview with
the Sheffield Star on 5th February 1990 to be at best a breach of your privileged
position and at worst a deliberate attempt to divert the course of justice.

Mr HICKS further states that some of the comments can be                                          considered as being actions
designed to influence the outcome of the Coroner's Inquest.

His specific complaints are:-

1.      "Mr Wright is guilty of abuse of the privilege of his position in suggesting to
        the Media he was aware that information would come to light in the Inquest, that
        would present "a different picture."

        He infers this relates to tii'ink or its effects. Assuming Mr Wright has seen such
        "evidence" it is "confidential" until deemed otherwise by H.M. Coroner and should
        remain that way. Clearly a breach of privilege."
                                                                                         (Continue overleaf as necessary)
You are not obliged to say anything concerning the above matter(s) but you may if you wish make a written or oral statement
to the Investigating Officer                       This statement may be made now or later and may be used in any
subsequent disciplinary proceedings. You have the right to consult a friend at ail stages of the investigation. This form is
served on you in accordance with ^Regulation 7, Police (Discipline) Regulations. It does not necessarily imply that
disciplinary pr                                     d to safeguard your interests.

                                                                                  f o

2.   "By suggesting that this "puts a different complexion on the end product"                 he
      prejudges the verdict of the Coroner.     This is clearly outside his authority         and
      insults the jurisdiction of the Coroner's office."

3.   "I believe that his pronouncements could prejudice Inquest        Jurors,   who   will    of
      course be drawn from the area covered by the newspaper cited."

4.   "He goes on to infer that Lord Justice Taylor was not    aware of all facts and "that
      there  is a lot of information that has  not yet come out."   He has therefore, by
      his own admission, failed to do his job.     If he is aware of information that is
      material to Lord Justice Taylor's conclusions he should have ensured it was placed
      before him."

5.   "If, as Mr Wright claims, this material relates to drink then presumably it is
      additional to that contained in the summary document produced by Professor Usher
      for Lord Justice Taylor (the one withdrawn from circulation) and to the post mortem
      reports, - in which case we shall be asking our lawyers to obtain details of it
      and to establish why this was withheld from us."

6.   "If,     as I suspect, this is merely the  same information, then     Mr Wright is well
      aware that   this has been available for  many months.     Clearly   it cannot be "new"
      or "additional" to that considered by Mr Taylor."

     "Under these circumstances his actions constitute a deliberate attempt to mislead
     an offence under the discipline code or worse."

7.   "Mr Wright claims to    accept the   findings of The Taylor Report,   and even calls      it
      "a superb document."         v'"

      "Yet he persists in claiming the primary conclusion      is wrong.  That is as clear
      an example of "double standards" as one could ever       see and serves to underline
      questions regarding what his motives are."

I have been appointed                                    investigate a rsRSffibtgdjflgatbS® /co m p lain t which has been made
against you, written particulars of which are set out below :

Mr Barry DEVONSIDE of                                                            Merseyside has made two specific
complaints regarding comments you allegedly made                               which were published in 'The Star'
newspaper on 5 February 1990 and 'The Guardian'                                newspaper on 6 February 1990.  His
complaints relate to the following:-

1.     "The distressing innuendo insinuation and veiled hints that additional evidence,
       not revealed to Lord Justice Taylor, will show alcohol played a major part in the
       tragedy.   The post mortem reports do show that some of the deceased had been
       drinking; so what?    It is not in a free society, an offence to consume alcohol,
       and if police officers were vigilant and suspected alcohol-related offences outside
       the ground then no doubt great play would have been made of those arrest figures.
       In my view Mr Wright is trying to fabricate a smoke-screen after the event to
       protect his officers, and maybe even his own reputation."

2.     "An apparent attempt to influence either public opinion or the minds of potential
       jurors by making sweeping statements in and out of the press.    I don't know how
       the sub judice rule applies, but the lawyers in Liverpool have advised us strongly
       not to allow ourselves toMbe exerting any persuasive influence.    Surely the same
       applies to Mr Wright?"

                                                                                                                         Continued/....

of power and authority, such as to devalue trust and faith in the judicial system.

I have been appointed                                    investigate a s ep ftft^ jia a fe M X /c o m p la in t which has been made
against you, written particulars of which are set out below :


     Mr Philip HAMMOND of                                                          , Liverpool        has    made    two     specific
     complaints against you.               They are:

     1.   "In making his pronouncements     immediately  after announcing                                     his retirement,
           Mr Wright abused his privileged position by inferring to                                          the media he had
           "confidential" information that would come to light in the                                        Inquest, and that
           this was derogatory to those who lost their lives".

     2.   "He similarily inferred that Lord Justice Taylor was not aware of all of facts
           and "that there is a lot of information that has not yet come out".    He has
           therefore by his own admission failed to do his job".

     It is Mr HAMMOND'S belief that these complaints could affect the Inquests Impartiality
     as well as being a deliberate attempt to distort the course of justice.




                                                                                                     (Continue overleaf as necessary)

        I will            now    comment        on    the        specific          complaints          raised       by Mr         Hicks       which

        also subsum e the g e n e r a l c omplaint s m a d e by Mr H a m m o n d and M r Devonside.




                 1.         Mr    Wright       is     guilty          of    abuse     of    the       privilege         of    his       position

                            in    suggesting          to       the     media       he was       aware        that    information              would

                            come       to    l ight       in    the    Inquest,         that      would        present        "a       different

                            picture".




                            He    infers       this        relates          to    drink     and/or           its    effects.            Assuming

                            Mr    Wright       has seen              such        'evidence'           it is    'confidential'                 until

                   it    quite       clear    I have        no    know l e d g e    of      what        specific          evidence       wil l

                   of    privilege,           whatever        that        may    mean.            It    is       ess ential        for     the

                   Chief C o n s t a b l e to do so.

                   In    support        of    his    complaint,           Mr    Hicks        uses       a     selective           quotation

                           and even calls                 it "a super b document".




                           Yet       he     persists         in       claiming         the     p r imary          conclusion         is    wrong.

                           That        is    as    clear     an       example         of     "double        standards"         as    one could

                     I    have       from     the     outset          made       it    clear        that      I    a cce pt    the     findings

                     of    Lord      Justice         Taylor       and       as    Chief       Constable             I have     ensured         that

                     all       his     recommendations                  have          been     pursued            vigorously         and       with

                     expedition.              I     have     also          said       that     I     consider         his      Final       Report

                  all the views             expressed or the weight given to the various factors

                  involved.           For    instance,            the    South       Yorkshire          Police       accepting          the

                  criticisms          contained            in     Lord       Justice       Taylor's            Report         agreed     to

                  settle    compensation               claims.           Other      parties        involved          who      were     also

                  criticised declined to do so.




                  My motives,         which Mr Hicks calls into question,                                    are quite straight­

                  forward.        They       are       to       ensure       that    all       available           evidence       within

                  my     Force    is        forthcoming            for       those       investigating              the       events     at

                  Hillsborough            whether          or   not     it    is    critical        of       police       action.        It

                  remains    a fact          that all            the    evidence has              not as yet been publicly

                  presented.              It, may      be       that     when       it    is      the        conclusions        already

                  arrived    at       will       be    unaffected.             On    the       other     hand it may            present

                  a     different         picture          of    the     causal      factors        that           resulted       in    the

                  terrible tragedy at Hillsborough.




        The      only matter          in Mr       Hammond's            letter not covered above is the rather

        astonishing          claim         that       my    comments         were     derogatory              to    those      who     lost

        their lives.             I am unable to understand how he came to that conclusion.




        The       interview       I       gave    to       'The    Times'          immediately           followed          that       given

        to       'The    Star',       a    copy       of    both       printed       accounts           is    attached.           I    also

        gave       two    television         and       two      radio        interviews         during        which       I   expressed

        similar comments.

                      A.     At a meeting of the Police Federation on the 4 April I

                             again made            a public      statement       which may           raise      itself
From     On
                             during your            enquiries      and    I    think      you       should      have     a

                      Q.     Is    it a complete transcript of what you said.
Persons Present

                      A.     It    is    a   complete          transcript      of    what       I    said.          COPY

                             veracity        of     your       claim    that    additional            evidence         or

                             information will come out at                      the   inquest.          Apart        from

                             what you've said already in your written statement can

                             you give an example.

Continued Record of Interview of Mr Peter WRIGHT                                                                  PAGE 2




                         A.    I hope       that     additional       evidence          will     emerge          to    show
                               that the opening of the gates was the direct result of

                               fans'    misbehaviour           and not      a     loss    of police             control,

                               and    the     other    two    areas       which    I    feel        is    vital       is   in

                               relationship to the place of death and the cause of the
                               collapse of the barrier in pen 3.                         I also hope that the

                               continuing           enquiry       will     have         revealed              information

                               additional to that given to Lord Justice TAYLOR.


                         Q.    Was there any evidence or information gathered b y your
                               force        subsequent       to     the    completion           of        the     written

                               evidence of the TAYLOR enquiry.



                         A.    Yes.


                         Q.    Could you give me an idea of the type of evidence.



                         A.    -X    have     prevented        my     officers           from        making           direct

                               enquiries into Hillsborough since TAYLOR as this may be
                               said to be           interfering with            the enquiry being                 carried

                               out     by     the    West    Midlands        Police.            I    have        received
                               letters        from    the    public       containing           information             which
                               may amount to evidence and these have been forwarded to

                                the    West    Midlands       Police.           Through        our       solicitors        we

                               have sought an independent police view of the events of

                                the    day    which     will      also     be     presented              to    subsequent

                               en qu ir ie s.


                         Q.    Because that information came to hand after TAYLOR had
                                completed his report it was impossible to lay it before

                               Lord     Justice        TAYLOR.            Did     any     of     that          additional

                                information relate to alcohol consumed by any of their

                                fans or the effect of alcohol on their behaviour.



                         A.    Every    item of evidence             that we possessed was                      fed     into

                                Lord    Justice       TAYLOR.            After     the     conclusion             of       the

                                TAYLOR       enquiry     all      additional           evidence           received         has




                                                                                                                             49
m tinued Record of Interview of Mr Peter WRIGHT                                                                            PAGE 3




                             been     fed        into       the    West      Midland         Police.               Some        of    it

                              related to the behaviour                       of fans.              The police             opinion

                              to which I referred                   is still with our solicitor and I

                              do not think it                 has been referred to the West Midlands
                              Police but they                 are aware of it.                   My statements to the

                             press         and     those          made       publicly             contain           two        basic

                              elements.            The first            is   I   do          not agree              with        Lord

                             Justice TAYLOR'S conclusion in the interim report that

                              the    behaviour           of       the    fans     outside          the gates             was        not

                              contributory             to     the       disaster.                The     second          is     that
                              additional evidence not to do with drunkenness will be

                             presented            at     the        Coroner's          hearing               and         for        the
                              information          of       the     Director           of    Public           Prosecutions.
                              These two statements have no link between them and yet

                              it     is    clear        that        those        who        have        complained              have
                              inferred a link.



                       Q.    You must be aware that you in your position carry a lot

                              of    weight        and       your        pronouncements                 and    opinions              are

                              given due weight because of your position.                                            Bearing in

                             mind that you realised when you agreed to                                         do the Star
                              interview that Hillsborough would come up y ou must have

                             realised           that    any       responses       you made              wou ld      have been

                             read with           avid       interest.            It    can be           argued       that           you

                             must have            known potential jurors                         for the      inquest were

                             likely        to     read        the       article.             It        could        be     argued

                             therefore           that       your        responses           in    the        newspaper              are

                             likely        to    sway       their       judgement           and perhaps              influence
                             their decision              as jurors at the inquest.                           That        it could

                             be argued is perhaps a contempt of court, an attempt to

                             pervert the course of justice at common law,                                           or a very

                             old common law offence                      of culpable malfeasance.                               Have
                             you any response to that.



                       A.    I     don't    think       having          regard        to    what        I    said        that       it

                             could possibly be argued that it fell into any of those

                             categories.          I have simply said that additional evidence




                                                                                                                                          50

                              may    be       forthcoming             and    that       I hoped          it   would          put    a

                              different         complexion             on    the public          perception.             I have

                              not    said what             that       additional         evidence will              be       and    I
                              think       it     incredible             in         the light        of    the weeks                of
                              discussion             and     public          statement          during            the        TAYLOR

                              enquiry, media and individual comment afterwards in the

                              press and the First Tuesday television programme,                                                that

                              my    reasonable             and    necessary             statement         could         possibly

                              influence the course of any judicial proceedings.



                        Q.   W h y did you regard it as necessary.


                        A.   As a Chief Constable during the course                                      of these events
                              I    have       been    unable          to     avoid press            questions           and        in

                              addition to all my other responsibilities                                       there       is one

                              of     maintaining             the       morale           of    the    South          Yorkshire

                              Police.          The views expressed are the views held within

                              the    Force       and it          is    right       in my view            that     the public

                              should be aware of them.



                        Q.    Even       if    the     effect          of     these          statements           may    be        to

                              influence people within the judicial process.


                        A.   I don't see how they can.



                        Q.   Would you go so far then,                         with the benefit of hindsight

                              to say perhaps your comments were injudicious.



                        A.    No     I    don't        withdraw             any     of       them.            I    cannot          be

                              responsible            for     leaps           of     imagination           of       those       who

                              choose to misinterpret what I said.



                        Q.    So everything you said to the Star was either true fact

                              or true opinion.



                        A.    Yes.            What    I     said        in        all    the     interviews              I     gave

                              represented my views                     and opinions as spokesman for the

                              South Yorkshire Police.

                         Q.   With     the benefit of hindsight would        you change anything

                                  you said.



                         A.   No.


                         Q.   Is there        anything else   you want   tosay.



                         A.   No.

           particular       part of the ground.                       The equipment was orthodox and

           its    manner      of        usage,   on talk-through,               well practised.             Radio

           equipment plainly has its limitations and even when functioning

           has to compete with the external noise.



           C OMM U NICATION



           Chief     Superintendent              Duckenfield has given his account of his

           understanding           of the peril of Leppings Lane entrances.                                He had

           a life threatening situation at the turnstiles,                                  the result of a

           throng in a narrow space and the requests of an experienced and

           valued        Officer,        Superintendent                Marshall,     for the gates to be

           opened.         Beyond the gates was ample space.                           The opening of the

           gates     would run counter to Policing policy.                                To open the gates

           whilst perhaps the obvious course was not a decision,                                      it may be

           said     easily     taken.             In      the circumstances,               whilst foresight

            (essentially       the        result         of     hindsight)          might        suggest      that

           various         matters         should        have         entered     his      mind,      his     pre­

           occupation was with the safety of those outside.                                      It is perhaps

           too     easy     here        to say what else he should have done.                              He gave

           the order to open the gates.



            CRUSHING



            Given     the     propensity           in the terraces for fans to sway,                         surge
                                   f
            and     move     and        that     such      actions         are,      it     is    arguable,         in

            themselves        potentially               highly         dangerous       (whether or not any

            barrier        fails        should      anyone lose their footing or f ai nt ) , it

            may     be     difficult to form any reliable view as to how and when



                                                                2 8

            any    p ar ticular                 injury             or     death        was       in    tact      caused.             The

            situation       may             be           simple         or       may    be highly complex, but the

            substantial             injuries                   and       death         would      appear         to     have been

            sustained          in       Pan              3     and       below the           area protected by barrier

            124*.         To        arrive at a view that because people went into the

            tunnel     upon             the             opening          of      Gate        C   injuries or death were

            thereby        caused would require a detailed investigation the like

            of     which       has              not,          on     the        occasion         of     this Inquiry, been

            attempted.              Whilst perhaps convenient and for certain purposes

            attractive such a simplistic view would not, it is submitted be

            justified.                  This              has       not         been    a trial nor is there, it is

             submitted,                 the                  material             available            upon       which              such

             conclusions            m   i   g   h   t    even be tentatively based,                         whilst it may be

             considered          that                   notions          such as             the burden and standard of

             proof    may           impede                   the     Inquiry process, the fact is that they
:>
             have     not       featured                      and       that what has been done has been done

             whilst evidence and further material are still being sought and

             gathered.          Speculation                         will        not     suffice        although              it may be

             explanation                or explanations can be given for, as appears to be

             the     case,          some                 deaths having occurred to Individuals who may

             have     come          in              at       the      second opening of Gate c.                         The Inquiry

               ACTIONS



               Criticism is made of the Police action taken upon the nature of

               the     problem        b e i n g realised.                    In this context it is urged that

               it was not unr ea so n ab l e for there to have been no specific plan

               to     deal     with        such            an event.                     It was not foreseen.                 When it

               occurred        it was horrendous and outside anyones expectation but

               Police        Officers           at    different levels displayed initiative and

               acted       whether         or        not they had been previously or were at the

               material        time        u n d e r instruction and direction,                                        officers w e n t

               to the tunnel w i t h i n mom en t s and made endeavours to relieve the

               throng        and br i n g out casualties.                                        Such was done quite quickly.

               The      perimeter          gates        w er e           opened,                    people were helped up and

                out.        Endeavours wer e made to cause the crowd to go back wh i c h

0               endeavours w e r e not it seems understood or immediately c om plied

                with.         Many in the crowd were oblivious that any incident let

                alone        some     t r a g e dy     had       o   c   c   u   r   r   e   d    although they were close to


                it.'


                A     major     incident               was set               in                  train,     operation support was

.3              called,        Ambulance               and help was summoned.                                    In so far as there

                was        chaos or confusion                that,                               inthe earlier stages, is perhaps

                understandable.                      People          did                 their            best    in   many instances

0               without        regard           for     their                personal convenience or wellbeing.

                Officers,           Messrs           Nesbitt, Greenwood and McKay for example set
1                about        arranging              and     organising.                             The     emergency       services

                 attended           and    it must, in the light of the material available,

                 be     doubtful          whether any lives or injuries would or could have

                    been     saved        in the circumstances by any ether course of action

                    once it was realised that people were trapped and crushed.

in      our submission,              close analysis- of the. accounts given to the

Inquiry           reveal          that        such        obstacles             as    may    have p resented

themselves             to        emergency           vehicles            (for example, non-emergency

vehicles           bl o c k i n g        in    part           an       access        route   or advertising

h oardings          on          the perimeter of the pitch) were temporary or no

impediment.                     M o s t significantly,                  the attention of the Inquiry

is      re s pe ctfully             drawn to the account given by Station O fficer

Higgins           at      Day       24        page        49C wh e re h e stated that,            so far as

 SYMAS Am b ulances were concerned:



             "I    t h i n k it w e n t as smoothly using the first entrance as

             it would have done using the in-out method"



 and       then        also        to the account given by Station Officer Easson

 on Day 24 at page 68E which suggests that the in-out method may
 have        been         available            to     s   u   c   h   Ambulances from the first or at

  least        from         a     stage        earlier than station Officer Higgins was

 hims e lf aware of.

              Sir

              H O M E OFFICE CIRCULAR HO 79/1981:'              CONTEMPT OF COURT ACT 1931

              1.       I am directed by the S e c r e t l y of State to inform you that the Contempt of
              C o u x t Act 1981 will come into force,-; for all purposes not relating to legal
              aid, on 27 August 1 9 8 1 .

              2.   Mu ch of the Act implements, with'some modifications, recommendations of the
              Phillimore Committee on Contempt of Court (197 ^1 Cmnd 579*0 • T h e following
              changes made by the Act are discussed in detail below:-    modification of the    •
              strict liability rule;    regulation of the use of tape-recorders in court;
              provision for punishing contempt in the face q £ magistrates 1 courts;   variation
              of certain penalties;   ’enforcement of fines;  and clarification of procedure
              under section 63 of the M a g i s t r a t e s 1 Courts Act 1 9 8 0 .                            ,

              3.      Oth er important provisions in the Act are                         as follows:

                      Section 8 makes it a contempt o f court to obtain, disclose^or solicit^
                      specified information relating to the deliberations of a 3urT      le gsl
                      proceedings;

                      Section 11 empowers a court which (in the exercise of existing powers)
                      allows a name* or other matter to be withheld from the public to give
                      directions pr ohibiting its publication;  and

                      Section 13 will maJ<e provision for granting legal aid to anyone liable to
                      be committed or fined for contempt in the face of the court (whether in a
                      m a g i s t r a t e s 1 court under section 11 of this Act, or in a county court or a
                      superior c o u r t) .

              M o di fi ca t io n of the strict liability rule

              k .    Sections 1 to 7 of the Act are concerned with the strict liability rule, whi
              is the rule of law whereby conduct tending to interfere with the course of justic
              m a y be treated as contempt of court regardless of intent.             Section 1 defines the
              rule ao set out above while section 2              limi ts its scope so that it apylicc only t
              publications which crcnte a substantial r i s k that the course of justice in the
              proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced.               The proceedings
              in nuestic •. rr.uct be 'a c t i v e 1 , as {defined in Schedule 1 of the Act, for the rule t



                                                                       -1-



                                                                                                                          58
      ply.    It is likely that the courts and the police v.-i1] r<‘-ec.-ive enquiries from the
  P r e s s who may wish to know whether particular proceedings are active within the
  m ea ni ng of the Act.   F o r the guidance of recipients of this circular a summary     of
  the relevant paragraphs of Schedule 1 is attached.

 5*      Sections 3 to 6 modif y the effect of the strict liability rule by providing
 a n um b e r of specific defences and savings while section 7 provides that p roceeding s
 for contempt of court under the strict liability rule shall not be instituted
 except with or by the consent of the Attorney General or on the motion of a court
 h a vi ng jurisdiction to deal with it.

 Tape-recorders in court

        Section 9 contains p rovisions governing the use of tape-recorders in court.     It
 provides that it is a conterv.pt of court (i) to use in court, or bring into court
 for use, any tape re corder or otlmr instrument for recording sound, except with
 the leave of the c o u r t ; or (ii) to publish a recording of legal proceedings or
 (iii) to use any such recording in contravention of any conditions which the court
 may have attached to the grant of permission to use the machine.       The section does
 not apply to the m a k in g 017 use of sound recordings for purposes of official
 tr an sc r i p t s . •        ' ;

7.        The section thus giv e s courts a complete discretion whether to permit the use
o f tape-recorders in court ana, if permission is granted, whether to inpose
 conditions.          Circumstances will, of course, vary and there may in particular
 circumstances be practical objections to the use of recording machines;                       there is,
r»owr / e r , no objection in principle to their use, especially by those connected
 *ith the proceedings.          The S ec retary of State accordingly suggests that in proper -
cases applications £rum parties or their legal representatives to use taue—recorders
should be given sympathetic consideration (especially when the applicant is unable
h i m s e l f to taice a note of t h e .p r o c e e d i n g s ) , as should applications from accredited
representatives of the Pr e s s or broadcasting organisations, who wish to use a
recording of the proceedings as an aide-memoire in compiling a report of them.
P a r t i c u l a r attention should be paid in criminal-cases, however, to any risk that
recordings might be used for briefing witnesses.

8 .     Practical objections which might lead to a refusal to permit the 'use of a
r ec ording machine might include the sensitivity of the subject matter of the
oroceedings, the nervous d is position o f a witness or any disturbance which the
    china might cause ,in court;    an d the court should not hesitate to revoke permission
a l re ad y granted if use o f a machine appears to distract any participant in the
proce ed in gs or otherwise cause a disturbance.

C o n t e m p t in magist ra te s 1 courts

9.    Section 12 gives magistrates' courts jurisdiction to deal with contempt
committed in the face of the court and empowers them to deal with anyone who
wilfully insults any justice, witness or officer of the court, or solicitor or
counsel having business in the court, during his sitting or attendance there, or
who interrupts the p ro ce ed in g s or otherwise misbehaves in court.  Under subsection              (2)
the court may order any o f f i c e r of the court or constable to take the offender into
custody and detain him un ti l the court rises, and may, if it thinks fit, commit
the offender into custody for a specified period not exceeding one month, or
impose a fine not exceeding £500, or both.        Subsection (5) precludes the making
o f an attendance centre or d e r (under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 19^0)
where it appears to the court that the offender is under 17.        Subsection (*+)
provides that the court may at any time revoke a corrj’ii ttal order mace under
 s ub section (2 ) and order the offender's discharge, while subsection ( 5 ) provides
 for the application, in relation to an order under section 1 1 , of certain
 provisions in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1930 (namely section % (restrictions
 on fines in respect of young persons);               sections 75 to 91 (enforces on t) ; section 1
 (appeal to C r o w n - C o u r t ) ; sect io n 136 (overnight detention in default of paynent);
 and section 1 ^ 2 ( 1 ) (power to re c tify mistakes)).

 Penalties

 10.     Section 1*+ and Schedule 2 together amend the maximum penalty for the offences
 in subsections (1) and (2) of section 19 and in section 25 of the Coroners Act 1 887
 (failing to appear or serve as a juror;       failing to appear or give evidence as a
 witness and, as a me dical practitioner, failing to obey a coroner's suunaons) to a
 fine of £200;      and that for the offence in section 97 of the Magistrates' Courts
 A c t 1 9 SO (refusal to be ;‘worn, or to give evidence, or to produce a document) to
 one month's imprisonment, or a fine of i'50 C or both.

 Enforcement of F in e s

11 • Section 16 is cor.cerncd with enforcement of fines imposed for contempt of cour
by superior courts ot he r than the Crown Court, the Court of Appeal, Criminal
D i v i s i o n or the H o u s e of Lor ds on appeal from that division. In particular,
subsection ( 1 ) provid e s that one way in which such a fine may be enforced is s s
if it' wore a fine imposed by the Crown Court.             Subsection (3) applies the c-rovision
o f sections 31 and 52 of the pow e rs of-Criminal Courts Act 1973 to a fine enforced
in this way.

Clarification of procedure untier section 63 of th-.- Kap;ir,tr.-it.es' Courts Act 1980

 12.      Section 17 and Schedule 3 establish the means by which proceedings are to be
 brought under section o3(3) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 for punishing
 disobedience to an or d e r o t h e r than for the payment of money.           Subsection ( 1 )
p ro vi de s that the powers o f a court under section 6 3 (5 ) may be exercised either of
the court's own motion or by o r d e r on complaint and is intended to remove any doubt
as to the proper means o f invoking these powers.                 Subsection (2 ) applies the
p r o vi si o ns of the 1930 Act to such proceedings and, with Schedule ,'5 ensures that
whe re the court proceeds of its own motion certain provisions of the 1930 Act
shall apply as if a complaint h a d beon made.                It is anticipated that this
clajrification will facilitate the enforcement of, for exanole, orders for the
custody of or access to c h ildren and for family protection or exclusion frox the
m at ri mo ni a l h o m e -u n d e r the M a trimonial Proceedings (Magistrates' Courts) Act 1960,
the Guardianship of Min o rs Act 1971 and the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates'
C o u r t Act 1978.

      Sir

      HOME OFFICE CIRCULAH NO 115/1982
      P0BTHE2 ADVICE TO THE POLICE 02J THE CONTEMPT OP COTJBT ACT 1981

     1.    Home Office Circular No 79/1981: Contempt of Court Act 1081,              •
     "brought the Act to the attention of chief officers of policeanH
     included a section on the strict liability rule. The purpose of
     this further circular is to enlarge on the advice to chief officers
     about the implications for them of the Act anH related matters.

     2.   As was set out in the Annex to the earlier circular, under the
     Contempt of Court Act 1981 criminal proceedings are deemed to become
     active from the time when any of the following has occurred:

              (a)   arrest without warrant

             (h)    the issue of a warrant for arrest

             (c)    the issue of a summons to appear

             (d)    the service of an indictment or other documents specifying
                    the charge

             (e)    oral charge.

    3.   As soon as criminal proceedings are active, under the strict
    liability rule any communication which ia addressed to the public at
    large or any section of the public may be treated as a contempt of court
    if it creates a substantial risk that the course of justice will be
    seriously impeded or prejudiced. Chief officers are reminded that
    although proceedings will cease to be active at the conclusion of the
    trial, they will become active again as soon as appellate proceedings
    are commenced. Hie detailed provisions to determine whether proceedings
    are active are set out in Schedule 1 to the Act.
%




    4.   The Secretary of State is particularly mindful of the danger
    inherent in press conferences following the questioning of a suspected
    person in connection with crimes where there has been intense interest
    by the media. Accordingly, he has consulted the Director of Public
    Prosecutions who has stated that he considers it right that any guidelines
    to chief officers of police on the holding of press conferences or the
    granting of interviews in these circumstances, should be framed more
    broadly than the Contempt of Court Act requires so as to guard not merely
    against the risk of contempt proceedings, but against any semblance of
    what the public or the courts might regard as improper or irresponsible •
    behaviour. Hence, the only safe guideline whenever the preferment of
    charges is -imminent is one that totally prohibits the granting of interviews,
    although allowing a brief prepared statement to be issued. The
    prohibition should cover, so far as is practicable, all conversation
    between the officers in the case and members of the media as well as formal
    press conferences. The embargo in interviews should apply whenever it is
    expected that a person will shortly be charged with an offence whether or
    not he or she has ..been arrested. By "shortly", the Director of Public
    Prosecutions Viaa in mind a period of about 24 to 48 hours although this
    must be left to the discretion of chief officers.

    5.   As far as any prepared statement is concerned, the Director of Public
    Prosecutions considers that it would be best confined to a formula such
    as "A £ manJ7 j^vomanJJ is being questioned by the police". However, the
    statement should also indicate whether or not the person concerned is
    under arrest or has been charged. This would signal clearly to the media
    whether criminal proceedings were active within the terms of the Act. If
    the person concerned has not been arrested or charged, it might be proper,
    if pressed, to give some indication of when a charge is likely to be
    preferred or when the suspect might make a court appearance.

    6.   The approach set out in the two preceding paragraphs applies with even
    greater force to any communication by a police officer to the media after
    proceedings have become active against a defendant. Information should be
    given in brief and neutral terms, eg "A fna.nj / w o m a a j has ^een charged
    w i t h an o f fe n ce of   £ "   ......   J"
                                                •   Comments which, however indirectly, might
    seem to the public to imply guilt, and discussion of or conxnent upon the
    evidence, should be avoided. Special considerations apply, by virtue of
    section 6 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, to cases in which a
    man has been charged with a rape offence *s defined in section 7 (2 ) of the
    Act. In such cases matter likely to lead members of the public to identify
    the person charged as the person against whom the accusation of rape has
    been made should not be published except in the special circumstances
    described in 9ection 6 of the 1976 Act.




                                                                                            64
       r




7.   The strict liability rule also affects communications such as
"wanted" posters, if proceedings against the person concerned are active
within the meaning of the Act, eg where a defendant charged with an
offence haa escaped. Chief officers should therefore guard against any
unwarranted implications of guilt in the wording of such posters. Por
example, the description "wanted terrorist" would be objectionable unless
the person so described was wanted in connection with an offence of
terrorism of which he had already been convicted. In appropriate
circumstances, acceptable descriptions could include "wanted for
questioning about f ~terrorist offences_7 £ serious offences involving
attacks on womenj".    There is no objection to the inclusion of
photographs in "wanted" posters worded so as to meet the requirements of
the Act, but chief officers will wish to bear in mind the possible loss of
evidential value of subsequent identifications of the wanted person.

8.   Circumstances will arise in some cases in which it will be necessary
for the public to be warned that a "wanted" person should not be approached
or is believed to be dangerous. Such warnings, if carefully worked to avoid
any unwarranted implication of guilt, are unlikely to be regarded as
prejudicial.

9.   The strict liability rule will not apply to "wanted" communications
when none of the steps listed in paragraph 2 above has been taken, but
even in these circumstances implications of guilt should be avoided.

10. The Director of Public Prosecutions has requested that if a possible
contempt of court is to be investigated by the police, whether or not at the
direction at any- stage of the trial judge, the Director should be notified
as soon as possible, whether or not he has assumed responsibility for the
conduct of the case.

                        Tours faithfully,

Hillsborough

Throughout the greater part of 1989 all members of the South Yorkshire Police, but
particularly those officers who were directly involved, have been preoccupied with the
disaster that occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April when 95 football supporters
tragically lost their lives and many others were injured. The then Home Secretary, The Rt
Hon Douglas Hurd, instituted a Public Inquiry and appointed The Rt Hon Lord Justice
Taylor to carry out the Inquiry. Lord Justice Taylor commenced his investigation into the
disaster at Sheffield on 15 May and concluded the public hearings on 29 June. He
published his Interim Report on 4 August and his conclusion was that although there were
other causes, the major reason for the disaster was the failure of police control at the
ground.

In consequence of the strong criticism he directed at members of the Force I thought it
appropriate to submit my offer of resignation to the Police Authority. At a meeting held on
14 August the Police Authority declined to accept it and I continued in office. My
immediate objectives in the aftermath of the Interim Report were to implement those
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor that lay within the control of the police and to take
such further action as I considered appropriate in the light of the Interim Report. One such ' f
action was the institution of an enquiry to establish if any criminal liability arose as a result I
of the deaths, and this will continue into 1990.

The on-going effects of that tragic event will continue for some considerable time to come.
At the conclusion of their enquiries the West Midlands Police will submit their report to the
Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision on the question of criminal liability in respect
of any individual. The Inquest to be held by Her Majesty’s Coroner cannot proceed to a
conclusion until the question of criminal action has been resolved and even on the most
optimistic forecast the Inquest is unlikely to be concluded before the end of 1990. Coupled
with the attendant civil proceedings, the legal aftermath of Hillsborough is likely to continue
well into the 1990s.

The traumatic and lasting effect this tragedy has had on the families of those who died, on
those injured and their families, and on many others involved, together with the safety of all
those likely to attend major sporting events in the future, demanded that the highest level
of scrutiny be devoted to all the various aspects of investigation and legal review. The loss
and hurt so clearly suffered by so many requires this lengthy and detailed consideration
and, regardless of where blame lies, it is essential that the causes should be properly and

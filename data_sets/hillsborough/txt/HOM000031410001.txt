Thank you for your letter of 3 June in support of recent calls for a new public inquiry into
the Hillsborough disaster.

I am currently considering what action to take in response to the representations which
have been made for a fresh inquiry. I have been following the families’ campaign for a new
inquiry closely, and since the broadcast of the television drama about the disaster in
December I have had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough
Families Support Group.

I am very conscious of the strength of feeling on this issue and will make an announcement
as soon as I can.

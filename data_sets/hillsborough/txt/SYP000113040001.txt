position ^fdsLVHtl       iris.  I have policed football              matches      at Sheffield

Wednesday F.C., Sheffield United F.C. and Barnsley F.C. for a total of 9 or

10 years on and off.           I policed most major marches and demonstrations in

the City Centre of Sheffield between 1983 and 1987-                 I have policed 4 semi­

finals - all at Hillsborough.            I have policed all disputes involving the

National Union of Mineworkers,           and sundry other disputes.               I enjoy big

occasions     and    believe    that    firm     but     fair   policing     is   the    key    to

successfully managing big crowds.



In April 1988 I was a Ground Commander at Hillsborough Football Ground,

Sheffield, when Nottingham Forest F.C. played Liverpool F.C.



I worked inside the ground and apart from minor problems of drunkenness,

theft, and the discharge of a pyrotechnic during the match, the game passed

off without serious incident.



The   earlier    rounds   of    the    1988-89    F.A.    Cup   competition       produced     the

identical fixture and it was learned in March 1989 that this Would, once

again, be played at Sheffield Wednesday's football ground at Hillsborough:




                                                                                                     i
the match to take place on Saturday, 15 April 1989, K.O. 3 pm.



As a Deputy Divisional Commander I expected to play a key supervisory role

on the day, and my then Divisional Commander, Chief Superintendent B. L.

Mole, discussed with me at a fairly early stage the question of my duties.

I had worked mostly inside the ground in 1988. .and_.therefo f r I agreed this

           perform an outside    duty,

Liverpool fans.
 %


In due course meetings were set up which were attended by police officers

from    ’F ’ Division and elsewhere, along with representatives of the Local

Authority, Public Transport, Ambulance, and the like.        Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield,   who   was   to take over   the   Division on Chief Superintendent

Mole's transfer, was also present.



A planning/logistic's team was set up, headed by Chief Inspector Beal and

Inspector Sewell: they commenced to prepare a detailed Operational Order to

cater for the match.



Shortly   after 6 April     1989 I received     from Inspector Sewell a detailed

Operational Order,    setting out the minutiae of detail associated with the

game.



During the ensuing week I read the order through and noted my own role and

responsibilities.



                                                             K      -
I noted th t I was to be in charge of Sector 2 (Liverpool) and that I would

be assisted by Chief Inspector Roy Waring, Sector 2A; and Chief Inspector
I have known both officers many years and worked closely during the late

1970s with Chief Inspector Purdy.                   Both officers have police experience of

working     in    the Hillsborough         area and        had    performed duty at the           ground

before.        Both officers had, to my knowledge, good and valid experience at

major public order events.



Both officers had my full confidence.



Sector 2 was split into two other Sectors, 2A and 2B.                              Sector 2A was the

area    to the South          of the Leppings Lane area (for which Chief Inspector

Waring was responsible); Sector 2B for the North West area (for which Chief

Inspector Purdy was responsible).



The    chain     of command devolved             to Inspectors, of which             there were       3 in

Sector 2A and 4 in Sector 2B.



Additionally, I was responsible, for coach searching in two locations, i.e.

in    Oughtibridge        Village,       about     two    miles     from    the   ground    (Inspector

Wardle);       and    Tankersley,        about     six    miles     from    the   ground    (Inspector

Morton).         Also,    6     mobile    "Tango"        units    under    the    direct   control      of

Inspector Walker and Inspector Robinson.



I was not actually in charge of the serials of police officers employed on

turnstile        duties    at    Leppings        Lane.      These    were     part    of   the   Ground

Commander's       -   Superintendent        Greenwood        -    responsibilities,        but   it   was

always my intention to be in the area of the Leppings Lane turnstiles as
f$




     the crowds built up.        I noted that Chief Inspector Creaser was in charge of

     this particular     area,    aided mostly by 'F' Division Inspectors, Sergeants

     and Constables.      The     officers   involved       have   a wealth of experience      in

     handling football crowds and most officers were known to me personally.



     I had thus no qualms that given a normal situation the number of officers

     involved was right and struck the correct balance between the maintenance

     of law and order - the necessity to search fans for offensive weapons and

     detect crime without an oppressive police presence - at what should have

     been _a pleasant afternoon of sport.



     At 10 am Friday, 14 April 1989, I attended a Senior Officers' briefing at

     the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.                All Inspectors and the two Chief

     Inspectors working with me in Sector 2 were present.                Chief Superintendent

     Duckenfield gave a detailed briefing from a prepared brief, and this was

     complemented   by   a briefing     by Superintendent          Murray,   who was   to be   in

     charge of the police control post.               Inspector Sewell then gave details of

     administration, meals, etc.



     When these officers had concluded their address I took my Chief Inspectors

     and Inspectors to an area off the North Stand where I personally briefed

     them in detail as to' what I required from them.                 I had earlier prepared

     notes of what was required of us collectively and what I required from them

     personally, and I spoke to these notes.                I have kept these notes and they

     are available for inspection.



     I provided an opportunity for questions and asked Chief Inspectors Waring

     and Purdy if they had anything to add.               Some questions were asked.



                                              _   4   _
■s




     Some of my Inspectors were from 'A' Division and 'C' Division and were not

     totally familiar with the area.        I therefore took them to a transit van and

     with PS Fidler took these officers on a guided tour of the locality and

     pointed    out   certain areas of concern,       such as Leppings   Lane   rounabout,

     coach and minibus parking, pubs and off licences.



     I asked all- the officers to ensure that they read the Operational Order and

     were familiar with its contents prior to attending at Hillsborough the next

     day.



     Later that day I received from Inspector Sewell a miniaturised Order, which

     I condensed so that I had a pocket sized overview of the duties involved in

     my sector of the operation.



     I added to this the colour coding of the tickets for the various sections

     of the ground.      I have retained this document.



     At 8.10 am Saturday, 15 April 1989, I came on duty at Hammerton Road Police

     Station.    The day was fine and sunny.     The weather was warm and ideal for a

     major sporting event.



     At 9-20 am I left Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief Superintendent

     Duckenfield      and Mr.   A.   Hymas, a Force   Press Officer.     We went   to the

     entrance to the police area at the rear of the North Stand.          Other officers

     were congregating     there and were,    in due course, moved into pre-arranged

     seating in the North-Stand.




                                             - 5 -
 At 10 am Chief Superintendent Duckenfield gave a briefing.                           He was followed

 by   Superintendent       Murray,   DS    Charlesworth         and    Inspector       Sewell.      Each

 officer spoke about particular aspects of the policing of the event.



 At the conclusion of the general briefing Serial Inspectors were invited to

  brief   their     Serials    in    accordance         with    their    general        and     specific

  instructions contained in their orders.



  I   spoke   to   Chief   Inspectors       Waring      and    Purdy    and       re-affirmed    what     I

  considered to be the salient points of our duty, i.e. searching, coach re­

  ception and general standards of behaviour.                     I told the officers that I

  would patrol on foot throughout the Sector and they could expect to see me

  out and about right up to kick-off.                 I distributed a one-sheet overview of

  Serial deployment,       along with       a list of pubs            in the locality where the

  landlord had been seen and asked his intentions,                      i.e. either to close or

  operate a selective door.



  About 10.15 am I went into the gym where I consumed a snack meal and took

  the opportunity of speaking to most of my Sector Inspectors individually.

  I distributed copies of the document mentioned above.



/ Manpower at my command was 2 Chief Inspectors, 11 Inspectors, 30 Sergeaijj

                                'his      did   not    include    the    Mounted       Officers,        Dog

                                                ir, 2     Inspectors,         4    Sergeants     and     40

 Constables who would be working outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles prior

  to kick-off.



 About 10.45 am I commenced foot patrol in the_Leppings Lane area, checking



                                                  6 -

    that barriers had been placed at the ends of streets opening on to Leppings

    Lane.     The    purpose     of    the     barriers      is     to prevent      access   by   fans   and

    minimise the nuisance to local residents caused by fans (a) using the back

    gardens    and   gennels     as    toilets;       and    (b) trying to climb over walls and

    fences to gain free access into the ground.                        Most of the barriers were in

    place and each set was manned by 2 Constables.                            I met and spoke to all

    these officers and asked them if they knew what their duties were.                                   All

    appeared to know what was expected of them.



    Inspector      Selwood     was    in     charge    of    this    area   and   we   met   briefly     and

    discussed what to do about an Audi car which was causing an obstruction in

    the mouth of V€re Road.



    I then continued to Leppings Lane roundabout                        and on into Penistone Road

    North and Claywheels Lane: all the time meeting and speaking to policemen

    and women but checking that they had been briefed as to their duties.                                  I

    paid particular attention to the Claywheels Lane coach reception Serials
                                             N«5lVL
    (Serials 34 and 35 - PS Sherratt and PS Lindop respectively) as a key role

    was required in respect of them so far as ticket checking and standards of

    behaviour were concerned.



    Some    fans were    already moving about at this time and going from public

    house to public house looking for those which were open.



    I   remember     sharing    a     joke    with     the   manager     of   the    newly    refurbished

    Travellers Inn in. Penistone Road Nbrth.                        The pub was closed and the car

    park was thus available for use.                    Our joke concerned how much he could

    charge to allow fans to park on it.                     All this area was well policed and I
  was happy that everyone seemed to know what they were doing.



  I then patrolled back towards the ground and into the Middlewood Road area.

  I continued as far as the main shopping area, all the time meeting and

  speaking to police officers about their duties.                In the shopping arcade I

 met and spoke to two officers and the security manager of the precinct.                    We

  discussed possible problems involving stealing from shops, as had occurred

  in 1988.   I then popped my head round the door of Thresher's Off Licence in

 Middlewood Road.         Two female staff were working.         Thefts had occurred there

  in 19.88 and I therefore assured them that the police were not far away if

  there was trouble.


 '                                          X
 There were already substantial numbers of fans wandering about the streets

I and I was saddened to see that most were openly drinking alcohol from cans
I                                     ■ ■          „ __ «._
  and litre bottles. Many were carrying four packs and I was asked by a
     jAhfu, . -                                   ^
                                                              were open.      All the fans I

 encountered were Liverpool supporters.              I spoke to one man who was drinking

 from a can of strong lager and had another 3 cans in his possession.                        I

 expressed   the    view that were     he     to drink all      the    lager he had     in his

 ^possession he might later have difficulty getting into the match.



 I   patrolled     back   towards   Wadsley       Lane,   arriving    there   ab^it   12 noon.

 Crowds were now startling to build up.               Many Liverpool fans were wandering

 about and I was being asked where open pubs could be found.                      Again, many

 fans were openly drinking cans of beer and lager.                    Fast food outlets were
                                              /

 very busy indeed. ,
V   •


        About this time I heard some radio traffic ,concerning two public houses.

            e first was the^Fc^cJjin^ir^ Foxhill which was said to be very busy indeed.

        This     was   not    surprising      as   the    landlord     had    publicly     expressed        his

        intention in the Sheffield Star that he had obtained an extra 10 barrels of

        beer for consumption by Liverpool fans.                  The pub had apparently been drunk

        jiry in 1988.   I radioed control and asked that officers visit ana see the
                      —   —   —                                        >< m F - <
        landlord and warn him about servl’ng"drun ks .



            ie second pub was the Horse and Jockey in Dykes Hall Road, where 100-200

        persons were said to be ^dr^nki^i^                        .   Again this concerned me.                I

        contacted a D"6'g~~Vmi— set—                       of Middlewood Road and Wadsley

        PC Roger Pearce was a passenger in this van, which was being driven by a

        Dog Handler from Nottinghamshire Constabulary.                       I spoke to PC Pearce and

        directed them to go to the Horse and Jockey and monitor developments.



        I     then   continued    patrol     along   Middlewood       Road    out    of   city   as   far    as

        Barnett's Off Licence.              This was closed and was being guarded by a male

        constable      and   a female       constable.    • I spoke     to both officers.             I then

        crossed the road where I saw the manager of Willis'                          Supermarket.      These

        premises also have an off licence facility.                     I spoke to the manager who

        gave me the erroneous impression that drink was not being sold.



        I continued my patrol, walking down Leppings Lane, past the turnstiles and

        into Fenistone Road North.             The time was now about 1 pm.               A lot more fans

        were wandering about.           I adjusted the points of two groups of officers,

        firstly to prevent coaches entering Leppings Lane for unloading purposes;

        and     secondly     to   prevent    obstruction     outside     a    fast     food   outlet    near

        Leppings Lane roundabout.

                                                         - 9 -
I met Inspector Millett at the end of Claywheels Lane and we arranged for a

policewoman,     who     was    directing     coaches    into   that    road,    to be   given    a

fluorescent waistcoat to increase her visibility and personal safety.



I continued towards the Wadsley Bridge railway station and en route I met

Chief Inspector Purdy.            There was some radio traffic that Mounted officers

had stopped a transit van full of fans and this was parked on the Comet car

park of Kilner Way.            The Mounted officers suspected drink was on board and

required assistance.            There were a lot of police officers about but as we

were not far away ourselves I decided to go to the scene.                          On arrival at

the car park I saw a nondescript minibus which was filled to capacity with

mostly male      fans.         They   were   truculent   and    all    appeared    to have     been

drinking.    They were not drunk.             I took charge of this situation and with

other officers invited each of the passengers out of the van one by one.

With the exception of the female all were searched,                       as was the van.          I

remember one of the males claiming to be an ex-policeman from Cheshire and

he provided his service number.                The search was negative and I gave the

people    some   advice    about      their behaviour      and directed         them towards     the

ground.     I permitted them to leave their van in Kilner Way rather than

remove it to Wardser.d Road.                                      /



With Chief Inspector Purdy we returned back along Kilner Way.                        'H ie g a teway

Supermarket was doing a roaring trade at its 'off licence' section with a

queue of fans buying drink through a d o o r There is a large grass verge

outside   Halfords       at the junction        of Kilner Way         and Halifax    Road and I

estimated that 100-150 persons, mostly male, were lying or sitting on the

grass drinking from cans and bottles in the bright sunshine.                        At this time

there was no trouble,            and despite what segmed to me to be far too much
 drinking going on fans were well behaved.




 I continued back down Halifax Road towards Claywheels Lane.              I remember

 seeing a coach stopping    in Halifax Road and fans disembarking.              I went

 across to this coach with Chief Inspector Purdy and spoke to the driver.

 He assured me that his passengers knew where they could rejoin the coach

 after the match as they had all been before in 1988.           There was not much I

 could do about this situation at that stage so I let it go at that.



I returned to the Claywheels Lane area and by radio checked with the Serial

Sergeants that coach parking was going to plan.           There were no problems and

room for another 15-16 coaches at that stage.




I continued   into   Middlewood   Road    where   I met   Inspector Humphries.     We

discussed the progress of the operation to date.           There was then some radio

traffic that youths were causing a nuisance in Wadsley Lane by urinating in

gardens.   Again I was near to Wadsley Lane so I decided to patrol in that

area, and with Inspector Humphries I walked up the. road..



There were now very many Liverpool fans about.            Many were drinking.    They

were mostly male.    Some fans were picnicking in their cars.        We encountered

two youths walking down' Wadsley Lane.       One had a half full pint glass, the

other had a half-full half-pint glass.       I asked them what they thought they

were doing.   Both mumbled a reply to the effect that they had had a drink

at the pub.   I suggested they return the glasses to the pub and after a

little hesitation they accepted this advice and turned about, ostensibly to

return to the Horse and Jockey.          We followed them for a short distance.


                                         - 11 -     '' .
On/arrival at the end of Marlcliffe Road I saw the off licence was very

busy    indeed.       About    30 males were    standing or sitting on the pavement

outside.     All were drinking a variety of intoxicating l i q u o r . I saw some

drinking          •   The majority were drinking beer, lager and cider.                Some of

these persons were clearly intoxicated and I spoke to two or three youths

about their behaviour.            At this point a 'Tango'           van drew up, under the

command of Police Sergeant Miller.               I told him to keep an' eye on these

youths and also the crowd drinking outside the Horse and Jockey.



With ..Inspector          Humphries   I   returned   back    down    Wadsley   Lane    towards

Middlewood Road.           As I passed    the Park Hotel (whichhad closed for         the day)

I saw groups of fans.            They     were drinking on the pub forecourt          and were

chanting football slogans.            I told them to shut up and save their shouting

for inside the ground.           There were five constables nearby and I told these

officers to keep an eye on them.



I returned once again back along Middlewood Road to the top of Parkside

Road.     It was now busy with fans, and cars very much in evidence.                   I saw a

large group of skinheads moving' along Middlewood Road and I followed this

        £*01? 3. time •



Shortly before 2 pm I"heard some radio traffic that the special train had

arrived    at Wadsley Bridge Station and that               the passenger-s and escorting

Serials (Serials 36 and 37) plus Chief Inspector Purdy and Mounted officers

were en route to the Penistone Road turnstiles.



I patrolled towards the turnstiles, pausing en route to clear youths from

the roadway outside the Four Lanes Cafe.                I instructed two constables to
prevent the overflow of fans into the road.



Leppings      Lane   was     now    becoming      increasingly      congested.          Crowds       were

building up.         There was considerable open drinking going on and the fast

foot outlets were very busy.               There were no problems at this stage and in

my view there were ample police officers in the area to help and assist

fans to find the right entrance and carry out the preventive role described

earlier.



Fans -were entering the ground.                 A lot were stood around.            I saw four or

five    'F'   Division CID officers,             all dressed     in casual clothing.                Their

brief was to keep an eye open for criminal activity, i.e. pick-pocketing,

and I was pleased to see them in the area although I did not acknowledge

their presence.



I was    now    effectively        the   most    senior   officer    in    the   vicinity       of    the

turnstiles,      although      Chief     Inspector    Creaser was         in   charge   up     to    that

point, assistedby Inspectors Sykes and Purdy.



..Serials 16, 17, 18, 19, 4 Sergeants and 40 Constables were on duty, along

with Mounted officers from South Yorkshire and Merseyside.



The    area    was   busy,     noisy     and    colourful.     The    crowds     were    not     a    lot

different from a normal match day at that stage, although there were many

more people about.           The ma,                           from the Merseyside, area.



               that many fans had come without tickets to get in.                       I heard many

passing to and fro asking other fans for 'spares'.                        This toing and froing
    was constant and there seemed no desire or urgency on the part of fans to

    gain entry to the ground.

                                                                        •


    Foot   officers,   in   accordance     with   our   usual   practice,   were    stationed

    outside   each turnstile chatting to and searching fans as they queued to

    pass   through the stiles.     Other officers were actively encouraging fans to

    enter the ground.



    Mounted officers were actively shepherding people into the turnstiles area

    to get them into the ground.           I was not anxious at this stage and as I

    surveyed the scene I considered events were proceeding to plan.                I remember

    discussing with     Inspector Sykes,     the most senior and experienced of the

    Inspectors, how we would handle, the non-ticket holders post kick off, and

    we agreed that we would try to contain them in Leppings Lane and, as has

    happened in the past,      they would probably find someone with a radio on

    which they could listen to the game.          I did not wish fans to roam the roads

    around the perimeter     of the ground at will or unsupervised as this has

    caused problems in the past for local residents.



    By 2.15 Dm Leppings Lane was
                                                                                                 Hite.
                   numbers    at   about    6-8   thousand.      They   were   spilling    off

    footpaths into the roadway and making movement of vehicles difficult.                 Many

    fans continued to drink from cans and I continued to hear people ask
L
    others for spares.



    My own position was in Leppings Lane roadway itself at ground level, where

    I continued to monitor events, talking to policemen and fans.

directionof     the       roundabout       and    some   service     buses   came         down     from

Middlewood Road.           I walked up Leppings Lane to the traffic lights at the

junction with Catch Bar Lane where there was a queue of 3 service buses

being ..held    up by a constable. The constable asked what he was                       to do and I

toldjiiffi to let         the buses go through.            I then radioed match         control and

repeated my request that Leppings Lane should be closed but added th*

measures are not usually necessary on normal match days.



I left a constable on duty at the                     junction and walked back towards             the

turnstiles.      Most officers were now actively suggesting to fans                         to enter

the ground.         The time was about 2.30 pm.



I continued to actively involve myself in crowd control, especially in the

vicinity of turnstiles A-G.                These consist of 3 double turnstiles and one

single turnstile and feed spectators directly into a large concourse at the

rear of the West Stand and Terrace.                   All the turnstiles were open and were

admitting a steady stream of fans into the ground.                      I saw Inspector Purdy

to the right of the turnstiles and he was keeping an eye on the queues.

The Stand area          turnstiles     1 to      16   were   all working and again          a steady

stream of spectators were moving through.

        The   crowd outside the turnstiles at this stage appeared reasonably good

        humoured and I was neither frightened nor anxious for anyone's safety." I

        heard     nothing   from    match   control   other   than    continuous          radio        traffic

        describing relatively minor problems here and there inside and outside the

        ground.     However, as time progressed the situation at the turnstiles began

        to deteriorate.



        At one     stage I remember moving on the outskirts of the crowd outside turn­

        stiles     A to G to the relatively free area beside Gate C.                     The crowd were

        contained by an open, chest height, steel barrier and Gate B.                                This is a

        fairly narrow       area.     I saw   Inspector   Purdy watflbing movement                    and also

        Detective Superintendent McKay and PC Bocking, who were observing the crowd

        for pickpockets.       There was a lot of pushing and shoving going on which was

        causing discomfort within the press, and four or five Mounted officers were

        within     this part of the crowd, trying to maintain order.                  I recollect that

        I entered the crowd myself andshouted loudly to people                  to    stop pushing and

        shoving as this was hurting people at the front.                       I used phrases like,

        "Don't worry, you'll all get in"; "Don't push", etc. etc.                        Sadly this had

      took his advice and went to the bridge and climbed onto the parapet.

From this position I could see over the heads of the crowd and the only

area which was obscured in part was the aperture of Gate B.                      The time was

about 2.40 pm.
                                                    V

i     vast and progressively more unruly crowd was now assembling.                   It was a

    volatile and seething        mass of people.        They were pushing and shoving        as

more and more people continued to arrive in the area.                   At one point I saw a

    youth of perhaps 11 or 12 years start to scale the facade above the West

Stand turnstiles.           He   reached the top and a great cheer went up but he

    clearly did not enjoy        what he saw on the other side and returned back to

    the crowd.



    My attention    returned        to   the area   infront   of turnstiles A-G.       I saw

    Inspector Purdy standing on top of the steel barrier between the queuing

    area and the road to the South Stand.               He was balanced like a tight rope

    walker and was     shouting and clearly doing his level best to maintain a

    semblance of order.      The Mounted officers were in the thick of this press

    and   were   clearly   having    the    most    difficult   time.    Their    horses   were

    struggling and I saw anxiety written on the face of more than one officer.



The crowd build up continued to increase and it seemed to me that tempers

were becoming frayed.



I trifid to radio control that I needed assistance1 quicfcfly and a tarmoiMd*

announcement over          the turnstiles loudpseakers to urge people to queue in

orderly fashion and also^that. PC Buxton, who normally drives a Landrover

equipped with a public address facility, to come directly to Leppings Lane
to assist me J          X-^did not get an acknowledgement from control,lalthough I
                       w m m
                       heard PC .Imid-lv and„iOUf?r
                                              clearly saying * ^I'm on mir way".
                                                                           way'  I

cannot now say with certainty how long it took for PC Buxton to arrive but

I recollect looking over my shoulder at some stage and seeing PC Buxton

speaking       into   the microphone            in the Landrover which was                           in the road in

Leppings Lane: I could not hear what he was saying due to the noise of the

crowd.



Haying no acknowledgement of my jpequlft for a tannoy I guessed that sorne^'

technical       fault had affected              the radio                      system.   I therefore changed my

mult\i channel set from Channel 25 (the match channel) to Channel 35. which

is Hkmmerton Road Channel, and asked the controller to pass on my request

            tannoyed announcement to ground control by telephone.       I subsequently

learned that this was passed at 2.44 pm and actioned, but I cannot remember

everM^earing what         was broadcast.



Over the next few minutes the scenes outside the turnstiles deteriorated

very    rapidly       indeed.    An   enormous                   crowd           continued   to     converge   on   the

turnstiles.        There was total confusion as many did not know which area they

had to queue in to gain entrance, and the signs atove the turnstiles are

raverse a ledge over the river on the outside of the bridge to brirjg^him

learer to the turnstiles.          Some scrambled o'n tfl^riv'

As I watched I felt someone pushing at my ankles and I interpreted this as

an attempt to push me off the bridge into the river.                             I jumped down and

remonstrated with a man.               He appeared drunk.           I remember he was wearing

sunglases       and these    fell off his face,             only to be crushed underfoot by

others in the crowd.             I could only remonstrate with this man and he was

soon swallowed up in the crush.



      about 2.45 pm the crowd was jammed against the turnstiles in all areaj

but the press was worst., against turnstiles^A-^^^Fans were swarming over

the    gates,    parapets    and   facade      of   the     turnstiles.         I recollect     seeing

inspector Bennett on "the roof above turnstiles I - i d ;                   H§" iTITl ITUI Jdwiu 11.

fans back down into the crowd.                The turnstiles and gates were effectively

 nder seige.        There was absolute bedlam.              People were kicking and fighting

each     other    and    clearly   many
                                were absolutely terrified.     The Mounted
                                    — m "a 11       -—             mat**"
officers were absolutely valiant but their work was of little avail.



Inspector Purd                              o me and I climbed from the parapet of the"

bridge    and     forced    my   way   to    the    right    hand   of    the    blue   heavy    steel

perimeter       gates.     He joined me       and we spoke          to each other through the

gates.



Inspector Purdy told me that people at the :front of the crowd by turnstiles

A-G were .being crushed.....and asked me to open gates.                  He was not specific as

to which gates he thought should be opened but his anxiety was apparent.

It confirmed my perception, unprecedented in my experience, that this was

no ordinary crowd; of fans but an enormous press of people determined to

enter the stadium come what may.               I was, nevertheless, unhappy to agree to

the    reque       -to— IfflpleffierTT" if '‘'would lead 'to lln'Ctrrrfcifeilsd— access         to the
stadium and negate all our efforts to prevent hooliganism inside.                          I told

him that we would have to hang on.                 He responded by saying that unless

gates were opened people would be crushed.                  The look of extreme anxiety

remained    on   his   face.      I   took   account   of   the     fact     that   this   was   an

Inspector speaking to me and I made my mind up immediately that the only

>ractical way to prevent deaths outside would be to open the gates’^                              T

fodded    to Mr.    Purdy   and   told   him I would contact            ground control.          He

ieturned to his position by the steel barrier and J/j pushed my way back to

ny vantage point on the bridge parapet.



The    situation    was   uncharged    and   was   worsening   by      the    minute.      It had

outgrown our       capacity to manage        it effectively.         The situation w^s un­

precedented in my experience.



I saw a beer can thrown from within the crowd jammed inVrront of turnstiles

A-G.     It hit a Mounted officer and the contents ran down his coat.



    radioed ground control and asked for the gates at the Leppings Lane end

      the ground to be opened.        There was no acknowledgement.             >                ..



Initially I thought my own radio was defective so I jumped down from the

bqidge and pushed my .way across to Inspector Ellis.                    I asked him for his

        It is    difficult        to put   into words now the scene of which I and other

        police officers were a part.           Radio messages were almost inaudible due to

        the noise.           The situation at the turnstiles was obviously frightening as

        more and more fans pushed to gain entrance.                 There was no semblance of

        queues’; neither was there any self-di:                   or order.

                                      V
         Dout 2.48 pm I saw C Gate opened slightly from within th^ ground.                       This

        was not immediately apparent to the crowd in the turnstiles.ajrea A-G as the

        gate was invisible to them from where they were standip^T                   A trickle of

           )le passed through the -ga-fc-i*. *T saw Inspector Purdy physically pulling

        people from the press under the barrier and thrusting them bodily through

        the gate .



        A Mounted officer was'by the gate, as were numerous Foot officers, and it

        seemed to me that the action of opening C Gate brought a little respite to

        the area in front of the turnstiles, but this lasted only seconds as the

        crowd was topped up by others still pushing in Leppings Lane.

            After a short period C Gate was closed.                                                    Large numbers of persons were

            still flooding into the area.                                                The crowd now spilled out over the road to




            Mounted                 officej’a                       then,     of their ,own volition,       succeeded   in closing the



                                                  the              crush      on   the    turnstiles       These   officers    statione

                                                       hind the gate.                Fans    continued to climb over the walls,



            prevent their being crushed                                              or to gain free entrance to the ground,              I

            cannot say.



            The           heavy steel perimeter                                    gate was being shaken and was clearly coming

            under enormous pressure.                                           I believed that it would only be a matter of time

            before it was knocked down completely and the thought crossed my mind that

            our horses would be impaled on the points of the metal rails of which the

                                     instructed



            About 2.52 pm the gate burst open and the Mounted officers were brushed

                                                Fans entered but I cannot say now in what numbers.                              I noted

            there were poti^e officers on both sides of the gate and they seemed to be

            quickly in control of the si

Apfrr   The Mounted officers were still trying to controT^tfee^situation. Ab­

                                                                      pvoa*****

Some still went in through the turnstiles but the crush visibly diminished.



            see Gate B opened at any stage.

                                                                        available

officer to assist.



There were still large numbers of people in Leppings Lane so I sent about

30 men inside: the remainder stayed in the vicinity of the turnstiles.



There was further radio traffic that there were injured people inside the

..ground.



It quickly became apparent that there had been a serious incident on the

Leppings Lane Terrace and soon the concourse at the rear of the West Stand

was thronged with fans coming from the tunnel.         Some were carrying injured

comrades.    These persons had the appearance of having been crushed.



Some casualties appeared dead, although I could not say how many or from

what area they had come.
All   police officers present responded immediately and we tried to bring

order to a scene of pandemonium and chaos.                      Many officers were trying to

resuscitate people, using mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.



Whilst officers were trying to save lives of fans-the conduct of other fans

was deplorable.      A drunken man swore obscenely at me and I was spat upon.



We were joined at the back of the West Stand by many other- police officers,

then, by first one, then a growing fleet of ambulances.                         Ambulances could

not enter through Gate C so as best we could we                         triedto get casualties

down through the concourse to the roadway by                      the gate.      They were   there

separated     into   three    groups    -   those          apparently   dead,   those   seriously

injured, and those less seriously hurt.                    At some stage I spoke to a senior

fireman and asked him for some sheets to screen bodies which were being

placed in the road.          I recollect asking for the major incident boxes to be

brought from Hammerton Road Police Station to the ground.



All officers present were employed attempting to bring some order to the

very difficult situation.



I learned that the match had been abandoned and when this became public

knowledge fans started to drift out of the ground.



I   was   directed   to   report   to   match          control,   and   about    5-15 pm     I was

transported    to Headquarters where I briefed the Chief Constable and the

Deputy Chief Constable regarding these events.

     I was on duty at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on Saturday, 15 April

     1989, on the occasion of the F.A. Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool F.C.

     and Nottingham Forest F.C.                                       Tragic events occurred on that day at the

     stadium,        as     a       result           of          which                 95        persons            lost   their       lives        and        a

     substantial number of persons were injured.



  At that time Hillsborough Stadium held a Safety Certificate granted by the

     Local Authority in accordance with the provisions of the Safety of Sports

     Grounds Act 1975.                Each part of the viewing area had an approved capacity

     for spectators to stand or sit as the case may be.                                                                     At the time of the

  Disaster          the Leppings                    Lane Terrace                             comprised               6 pens.           The      approved

     capacity of the whole terrace was 10,100 spectators.                                                                    I was not aware of

     the capacity of the individual pens and there was no accurate way of




Signed                                                                      gnature witnessed by
                                            STATEMENT OF WITNESS                                       *

                      (CJ Act, 1967, s.9:    MC Act, 1980, s.102: MC Rules, 1981, r.70)


        Continuation of statement of             Roger MARSHALL


        determining whether the capacities were exceeded.                      Spectators were able to

        move from pen to pen,          albeit not without difficulty.                  A practice had

        developed of allowing spectators to "find their own level" in these areas.

        For a variety of reasons the Club did not steward these areas, although

        police officers were normally assigned to provide supervision.



        So far as I was aware on 15 April 1989,                        there had been no particular

        problems caused by overcrowding in any part of the stadium.                         However, as a

        result   of   the Public       Enquiry,      I subsequently            learned of    an incident

        involving crushing of spectators on the Leppings Lane Terrace.                              This

        occurred in 1981.       I was not on duty on this occasion, nor was I a serving

        officer in 'F ' Division at that time.

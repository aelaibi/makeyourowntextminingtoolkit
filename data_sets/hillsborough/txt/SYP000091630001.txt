arrival     at the ground and after                    the official      match br i \ / i n g , I took up

the s tandby        location a ll o c a t e d      to El Crime and Vandal                at the Leppinas

Lane     end of the ground.



A r o u n d noon    (1200)    the          ial w a s / m o v e d   from this     location to assist

with the monit or in g                    e\t>rf nsti les on Penistone R o a d .               My first

impressions         of this                ca-triTon being that         the    crowd was       orderly,

early and of good humour.                   I also was aware            that a number          of

turn st il es were         closed,    I counted          b of them being in-operative as the
number     of    persons a t t e nd in g      the game       did not warrant all             gates       to be

o pened.



For     the next     two   hours     or so together with other members                       of the unit

we searched,         turned awa y and a d v i s e d many N o t t i n g h a m Forest                 supporters

who     either     did not have       tickets          or were      carrying    cans of alcohol.                The

cans were        c onfis ca te d accordingly.              Nothing at this            time a p p e a r e d     out

of the or dinary from any other m atch duty.                            Even the       number       of

* scousers * searching           for tickets a p p e a r e d          normal.        B e h a vi ou r a pp eared

          3 pm (1410),        I had cause          t     arrest a N ot ti n g h a m Forest           supporter

   r a t t em p ti ng   to enter      the g               wi>ilst drunk.         As    is   custom,       he

/as conveyed to the Police                  iHffioiyy d o c u m e n t e d apd detained,          I was       then

informed to         complete my report             in the     gymn^yiuj?! (prior to           returning         to

my serial.         As    1 e ntered the        gym other           Wrials     were meal in g and other

in dividuals were           completing        paperwork.            I would estimate         some 40 to 50

officers        in the gym at this            time.       I did not have a radio with me and

I was     unaware       of any other officers              in the      immediate       v ic in it y who        had

one either.          There was       no    indication of anything               happening        that was

untoward.

Just       prior    to 3.QQ      pm    M5QQ),     I heard someone        shout,       I have       no    idea

who       that    person was as         I never    saw the    face    behind the         voice,         words

to the effect            that    officers       in the gym may be        required as trouble was

brewi n g .



Some       two or three m inutes           later another       shout,       a g ai n u ni de n t i f i e d and

unable       to say      if it was       the same       voice as before,        that all          officers

must       go onto the       running      track at L ep pings Lane as there was serious

crowd trouble.



T o ge th er with many other              officers       I left the gym and went              into the

playing a re na and as                I looked towards       the Leppings         Lane      end    I saw a

m ul t it u de     of   persons       clambering    over    fences and up the            rear wall            to

the       stands    from the      paddocks       below.     It lqroked       to all    intents          and

purposes          like a major         pitch    invasion.     The    time    I first went           onto the

grass       I am unable         to say but both teams were             leaving        the    pitch and

a number         of Forest       players were       kicking a ball about              in the Hop

half       of the ground.



As    I a p p ro a ch ed the half way            line,     I was    still convinced that                an

invasion of the            pitch was about          to     happen.



It was       only as      I neared the goal             line of that     end,     that      I saw that

a major          problem was      evident.        I was a p p r o a c h e d by one Liverpool

            supporters.          I a p p r o a c h e d an open gate to the           right       of the goal and

            a s se s se d the    situation,



         O ff i ce r s were       trying     to get    in but were        forced back by supporters

        j e t t in g    out or at least        trying    to get out.            I was aware at          this

 tl     time        of the      smell   of vomit and beer.            The scene was           total    confused

            chaos.      Going     towards    the gate     I saw on ti~ye gra^s a male a ge d about

rat     25,      w e ig hi ng    some 14 stone,       totally bl ue/an^j/^i f e               s , officers

         were       trying      to revive    him but     he a p p e a i ^ j ^ ^ a ^ i ^ ^ ^



        Again        I was      c h allenged by Liverpool          supporters         to get       into the

            crowd and do something             but    I was unable        to get any          closer   to the

            fence than the         running     track.     The    feraty of the abuse                I was

            receiving made me fear             for my safety as well as that                     of others ar ou nd

        me.



        After a moment             or two     I even tu al ly found myself                                   ate and

        was able to assist wit h the e v a c u a t ion of the                        pj            ^fiose able to

         get     out.



         The     pen that        contained     this    particular       gate was          full   to overflowing

         a nd    it was      only whe n      I looked further          into    the    crowd to my        left and

            saw a confused t er rified section of s upporters                         being       crushed against
                                                            • 'm
            the fencing.          Faces were     contortsd<<e«ith the            pressure        of wire     on

            them,    the screams and shouts,            abuse and threats                 coming    from all       sides.

            I left the gate as           I was unable       to get      into the          crowd and m o ve d some 5

         yards       to my      left where     officers were         tearing at the fencing with their

      ijj^bare hands.            I j oined    in as best      I could and after a time                 the fence

            gave way and an officer             tied the fence up w it h a red and white                          scarf.

As a gap de ve lo pe d          in the    fence    fans     poured onto         the    pitch and       '’blue*

people were        handed up from a heap of bodies,                     some 4 deep below the

fence.        I saw officers        in the       crowd a tt em p t i n g    to revive those            dead

but all       seemed to no avail.               I remained at the gap and by this                      time

the Liverpool           fans were       very hostile,        w ords   like B a s t a r d s , Murderers,

Pigs,     rained down from those                seated above       the terracing.



The    fans    on the     pitch were          pushing    fighting     to get back         into    the    crowd

a nd for a moment             it seemed that       for    every two        persons that         came out,

one went       back     in.



A fter a tirne an orderly               confusion d e v e l o p e d and some           form of

disorganised           system    came    into    being.      Bodies     of persons were           handed

out    of the terraces           into the arms          of anyone     on the outside            of the

fence,     the body was          placed on the grass and              left.       At    the time       that

s ee m e d the best       policy,       I was    handed a body,         I carried        it,    placed

it,    left    it then went        for another.           E ve r y o n e was   blue,     lifeless and

limp.      I cannot acco un t           for   how man y    1' carried,         I am unable       to

d es cribe any         particular       one nor    can    I say how        long   I was    doing       that,

but    I was s ud de nl y aware          that    the hoa rd in gs ar ou nd me were              being

torn apart and these were                 being    used as stre tc he rs          to    carry the bodies

towards       the Hop end of the field.



As    I placed a body on the              ground     I was    physically

s up po rt er who       insisted that         I should assist w it h a n o t b e r M ^ o d y          of a

male aged       18 or so,       slim w it h      light    coloured h a i r , \ / e > s blue,

covered       in vomit and traces             of blood.       I was     informed that           1' had

m u r d e r e d that    person and that          I should     revive       him.       I said    I was

u nable    to do so as          I could feel       no    pulse whatsoever.              I was    informed        1

   -        I returned to the               fence and was ha nd ed ,the              body of a young           boy a bout

       rmk O n /a r ri va l at that end I saw about 20 bodies lying on the grass, all

            we    had      run up        the e nt rance to the gym area.                In that area I saw

            a n o t h er    10/13        bodies     lying on          the     concrete.



            I a m unable           to    recall    what    I did next        nor    the time       scale     involved but

            the next         thing       I find    is that       I have    r et urned to the L ep p i n g s Lane              end

            w he re a mb u la nc e and fire me n were               in attendance.



            B o di e s were        still    on the     grass and as          I felt    for a pulse           on one,      a

            a nd said        “He's gone"          "He's    dead" He's        gone",    a mi so on and so forth.

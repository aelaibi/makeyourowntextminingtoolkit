                       states:-


1.   I was born on 1st March 1964.

2.   I am a qualified ambulance woman and I am      based at Longley.

     I joined SYMAS on 6th October 1980, as a cadet and remained

     a cadet for two years.       During this time I gained experience
     in basic first aid training.       After two years, I attended a

     six     week   residential    training   course    at Markfield,

     Leicester, and thereafter I attended a two week driving

     course,    also at Markfield.      Subsequently,   I have attended
     various other courses.         Following my driving course at
     Markfield,     I spent a one year probationary period on the

     road.     Thereafter I took the Miller examination and passed

     to become a qualified ambulance woman.        I became qualified

     in 1983, and I have no paramedic training. .


3.   I have been based at Longley for just over 12 months.        I was

     not on duty on Saturday 15th April 1989.       I was actually in

     the middle of a fortnight's holiday, and was at home when I

     became aware of the incident.       I was cutting the lawn, when

     my husband telephoned and informed me that he had heard on

     the radio that an incident was taking place at Hillsborough

     and a lot of people had been crushed.       He had heard that an

     appeal had been made on the radio for all ambulance staff,

     not on duty, to help out with the incident.        I received this

     telephone call from my husband shortly after 1500.
I immediately telephoned Control but there was no answer at

first.    I eventually got through to control,          and was
requested to go to my own station.           I drove straight to

Longley Station, and when I arrived, I noticed an ambulance
man from Rotherham speaking on the emergency telephone

situate outside the station.     I drove behind the station in

my car   and used my    staff key to allow the Rotherham

ambulance man into the station.      We both tried to contact
control but with no success at first.        Eventually, after a

number of attempts, we managed to contact control.       We were
requested to take an ambulance vehicle down to Leppings

Lane.    During this time,     Leading Ambulance man

         and Ambulance man             had arrived at Longley.

           has paramedic training.


            collected his paramedic equipment as quickly as

possible and put the same onto an ambulance vehicle.           I

called control on channel 1, and was advised to go to gate 0
on Penistone Road, where I was to report to the duty officer

on the scene.   I advised control that I had a paramedic on

board.


I approached Penistone Road via Herries Drive turning left

onto Penistone Road.         Just opposite    to the   gates on

Penistone Road,   I stopped the vehicle and allowed Leading

Ambulance man           to get out.     He asked me      for my

assistance and I left the vehicle and followed Leading
     Ambulance man into the gymnasium area.            I was then advised
     on the instructions of Superintendent Dale to return to my

     vehicle and remove it because it was blocking access along

     Penistone Road into the ground.           I travelled a short way

     down Penistone Road and then was directed over the central

     reservation by police officers and joined the back of a
     queue of ambulances waiting to gain entry to Hillsborough.



7.   When I got to the top of the queue of ambulances I was

     advised by Station Officer Eason that my vehicle was not
     required as it was a Renault and had no emergency warning

     lights.    I was told to park the vehicle on Penistone Road a

     little further up, which I did, and then I made my way into

     the area in front of the gym.            I was then advised by Mr
     Eason to return to my vehicle, where I remained for a short

     while.    Mr Eason then advised me to go to Herries Road Bus
     Depot where I was to remain on standby with a number of

     other vehicles.


8.   After    remaining at Herries Road bus depot for some time the

     other     ambulance crews        and   I were   advised   by   Leading

     Ambulance man             to proceed back to the gymnasium area

     inside Hillsborough.      At this point in time I teamed up with

                         who    had    his own vehicle,        and on the

     instructions of Mr Eason, the keys to my vehicle were handed

     over to the chief mechanic at the bus depot.



                                  3
9.    When                        had parked his vehicle in front of the
      gymnasium we were asked by the officer in charge whether we

      had on board some body bags and rubber gloves.


10.   Mr Jones then gave a briefing meeting,              stating that the

      gymnasium was the official morgue and there were 94 dead
      bodies inside.         Mr Jones sorted out who was on emergency

      duty, day duties and who were volunteers.             Some crews were

      sent back to their own stations, and                         and I were

      asked whether we were prepared to remove the bodies from the

      gymnasium.    We both volunteered.


11.   After a short break, Mr Jones began to organise which staff

      were to go with each ambulance vehicle.           I was not required

      for this task.       I got into a mini bus and took ambulance man
                        back to Parkway Station.    I then drove the mini

      bus back to Longley Station.          I had been asked to look after
      Leading Ambulance man                   paramedic equipment,        which

      had been loaded onto the mini bus.           When I arrived back at

      Longley I informed Leading Ambulance man                         (who was

      then on duty) of my knowledge of the events, and he took

      charge of Leading Ambulance man                        equipment.        I

      refuelled the mini bus and for a short while I was left on

      my own at Longley Station.           Some time later, an ambulance

      man, who I believe is called                 arrived at Longley.         I

      would say that the time was approximately 1930                    and he

      advised      me    t h at    stretchers   were   r eq u i re d   down   at
     Hillsborough.    I assisted           to load some stretchers on

     to his vehicle, and at approximately 1940 I signed off duty

     and went home.



Dated this   1   day of   MY       1989.

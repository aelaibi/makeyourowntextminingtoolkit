           On Saturday 15 April           1989 I wen t to the Semi Final at Hillsborough

           F ootbal1 Ground Sheff ield with

                                  and

           We arrived at the ground around half past two and queued to get into

           the turnstile      1 to 8 at the Leppings Lane End of the ground.             As we

           approached the turnstiles the crowd got tighter and tighter and I

           could hardly move at all.

                                                                                                 I

           tried not to panic my heart was jumping and I started to get

           palputations and pains in my chest.               I eventually reached the

           turnstile and then saw a young Policeman who appeared rather small

           pressed up against the wall between the turnstiles and asked the

           officer to radio for help because another supporter by me was
                                                                             PAGE     2
                                                                             S3517

unconscious.      The officer said he had not got a radio,        so I told him

we wanted help or someone would get killed.

I eventually got through the turnstile gatehouse and the ticket

collector who was on my right as I went through took quite some time

in examining my ticket.

He had no urgency w ha ts oev er , I got through and it was the first time




had been outside came through the turnstile the one I had come

through.      He appeared shocked and went over to three or four officers,

who were standing by Gate       ’A ’.

I was still kneeling down and                 came over and said "Come on you

will get crushed if       that gate goes.11

I estimate the time       at about ten to three. I     then moved over to the

wall at the side of       the ground.    (Which I have marked X on the Plan      of

the ground)     Ex. No.        where     I saw a man and his son talking to      a

Policeman standing by himself.          The Policeman was about




                   The Policeman was being abusive to the man and his son

and threatening

to lock them up if they did not go away.

I went over to him to complain about the situation outside,            1 was



    j^rtual ly ignored my pleas,        told me to go away or he would lock me

     He just ignored my condition and the situation at the time,

^wish   to make a complaint about his attitude and total           lack of

i nte rest.

We eventually got to our seats in the North Stand and the match

started.      The disaster then happened and I saw people spilling over
                                                                               PAGE          3

         onto the pitch and supporters climbing over the perimeter fence.          I

         then saw the Policemen pushing Jthe supporters back into Pens 3 and 4.

         I could not identify any of them I was too far away.

         i then saw a young lad in his late teens go across the pitch from the

         lest Stand towards the Spion Hop and got to the goal area and tried

          o speak to an

                   This Senior Officer   looked towards two Policemen in helmets who

         toyed towards the lad to stop him speaking to the Senior Officer.             The

          ad tried again and then gave up.

           feel* the Senior Officer should have listened to the lads pleas but

          t jj^st seemed that he did not realise what was going on and just
         / /
         tanked backwards and forwards as though nothing was happening yet         if

         se had looked towards the West Stand it was obvious there was serious

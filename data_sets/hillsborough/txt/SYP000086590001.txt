          The    Police         came       along         then    and        these      lads        moved          on.     I told a

          recognise            the      policeman*             he wa s       about       30    years         of age,           deanshave,

          started         to    help       people         the    n et s      were      being        taken          down and          this        caused

          the    Motts         Forest         fans       to    shout,        I think          they'thought                it w as         a    p i tc h

          invasion.             This       caused         a    reaction           from       the    Liverpool             fans       and       the

          Police        formed a           cordon across                  the     pitch.           At    one       point        1 saw         the

          Liverpool            f an s    running          towards           the      Forest        fans.           I saw      the     Chairman                of

          Notts       Forest         talking         to       their       fans,       I didn't           hear       what       he wa s         saying,

          but    he w a s          basicaly calming                   them        down.        Around          4    pin I w as s t i l l             on the

          pi tch w h en 3 saw              fans      chasing          cameramen.               Liverpool                fans,        I think, a n d

          we    thought         that       we      hadn't       better          get    too     close         to     that      end     of       the

          pitch       either.           I eventually             left        the      ground        at     about         5.30       pm.

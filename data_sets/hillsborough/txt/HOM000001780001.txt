CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT J.A. NESBIT - OPERATIONS & TRAFFIC

I am a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police and at the present

time I am the Divisional Commander for the Operations & Traffic Division.

At 9.00 a.m, on Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Claywheels Lane

Traffic Office,       and with a driver                                             |, 1 commenced

patrol in a liveried Police Range Rover, call sign OHY1.

Throughout    the morning we          inspected the Ml motorway and all of the other

designated and signed routes for the football traffic.

At   approximately       1-40 p.m.     the   same    day,    I collected the Assistant Chief

Constable    (Operations)       Mr.   Jackson,       from Police Headquarters and conveyed

him to the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

Whilst en route to the ground along Penistone Road, I was conscious that the

Police Officer working traffic at Hillfoot Bridge was only allowing a single

lane of traffic to travel towards the ground, when quite clearly there is a

facility to allow two lines             to form at that point, with vehicles entering

Penistone     Road       from   Neepsend     Lane.          Therefore,   together    with   1

                     I returned to that location positioned the Range Rover in the

 centre of the junction and assisted the uniformed officer to form two lanes

 of traffic as previously described.

 I remained       at Hillfoot     Bridge     until    approximately      2.20 p.m. by this      time

 traffic was beginning to ease and there was no congestion.                         I then resumed

                                                    and we    travelled back towards the City
 patrol with

 Centre.
                                                                   and at 2.58 p.m. I informed
 I remained on patrol with

 Force Operations         that the designated         traffic routes were clear and having

 travelled    from the City Centre            to Hillsborough Stadium,        I arrived shortly

 after     3.00   p.m.    , and   entered     the    stadium on foot      through the emergency

 entrance that gives access to the Gymnasium and the Police Room.                       My driver,

                                  returned    to West       Bar Police Station to re-fuel the

 Range Rover which we had been patrolling in since 9-00 a.m.
As    I       approached          the    Gymnasium     entrance,    I    was    approached         by     Inspector

Sewell,        'F' Division, who told me that the game had been stopped and that

evacuation            of    the    Leppings     Lane    terracing       was    taking      place    and       that   he

believed a number of people had been injured.

I immediately went on to the playing area by way of the access gate at the

Penistone Road end of the North Stand which was clear of vehicles.                                            I looked

towards Leppings Lane and saw what appeared to be a mass pitch invasion with

spectators climbing over the perimeter fencing and some were being assisted

by uniformed Police Officers who were                            reaching over the fencing into the

terracing.

As I approached the goal area immediately in front of the terracing, I could

see that the perimeter track was filled with spectators and Police Officers

and       a   number        of    casualties     were    being    attended      by   St.     John's       Ambulance

personnel and uniformed Police Officers.

Upon reaching the perimeter fencing of enclosure No. 3, to my horror I could

see bodies            piled on top of each other with other spectators being pressed

against the fencing, a number of those appeared to be already dead.

I saw          that    the       perimeter    gate     to No.    3 enclosure         was    open,       but    it was

blocked         by    two bodies,           the lower one was       lying face down and overhanging

onto the perimetelNtrack.

I spoke to uniformed officers who were near the gate and told them to remove

the bodies.                I walked along the perimeter track to enclosure No. 4, where I

saw Inspector Dews,                     'D' Division and Inspector White,             'F' Division, who was

on the perimeter fencing helping spectators to climb out of enclosure No. 4.

The perimeter               gate was       open and people were being helped through the gate

onto the playing area.

Although people were being pressed against the fence, I could not see any

bodies on the ground and no one appeared to be dead, although a number were
                                                 -   3-




in obvious distress.

Throughout    this   time   people      were   still        climbing     over    the perimeter i*ence

from enclosure No. 4 and jumping down onto the perimeter track.

I returned to enclosure No.            3 and I saw that the gate was still not clear

and the officers were having difficulty in lifing a powerfully built man who

was   lying   face   downwards,        his   lower        body   being   trapped     by   other bodies

inside the enclosure.        I instructed the officers to pull the man through the

gateway rather than try to lift him.                      This we eventually did with a number

of officers taking hold of the man and pulling him through onto the playing

area.   Having cleared the gate it was then possible to move bodies from the

enclosure.

Police Officers and spectators in their endeavours to help, were getting in

each others way.      I then physically pulled some away and told them to make a

chain and pass bodies along the chain onto the playing area.                              I then walked

along the perimeter track towards enclosure No. 2.                          I could see that there

was room in that enclosure, but the dividing fence was preventing any

 lateral movement of spectators.               A number of Police Officers were assisting

 the spectators      to climb over the dividing fence and I told some uniformed

 officers to enter enclosure No. 2 and attempt to alleviate the pressure in

 enclosure No. 3 by moving spectators through the gate in the dividing fence

 underneath the West Stand wall.

 As   I was   returning     to   the    gate   at No.        3 enclosure        I saw a small boy in

 obvious distress.        I reached through the fence and                   hand over hand I lifted

 him up   the   fencing.         However his         shoe    lace became        entangled   in the wire

 fencing and I was unable to lift him further.                         I then shouted to Detective

 Sergeant Gutcher who was inside the enclosure and he reached over a number

 of bodies and relased the boy's foot and I was then able to lift him up the

 fence where he was lifted from the top by another uniformed officer.
                                                            -   4   -




I moved along the perimeter track to the gate giving access to enclosure No.

3 and I saw a small boy who appeared to be dead pressed against the fence. I

could do nothing to help this small boy as the fence at that point was of a

narrower and smaller gauge and as a result I could not get my hands through

to take hold of him.

Throughout this time I was conscious that other spectators were walking over

the bodies and climbing onto the perimeter fencing.                                           On reaching the gate to

No.    3 enclosure,             I saw that once again Police Officers and spectators,                                               in

their    efforts           to    get       people    out,       were          getting      in       each    others          way    and

achieving nothing.                   I therefore moved them back from the gate and told them

once    again        to    form      a chain.         I remained               at    the     gate     and with Detective

Sergeant      Morton,           Headquarter          Serious            Crime       Squad,      I    began    to       clear       the

gateway into the enclosure.                         At   this           stage I saw Superintendent Greenwood

who was standing to my right hand side.                                       He was holding a loud hailer.                          I

told    him     to    get       up    on    the     fence   and          to    ask    people        to     back       off    and    if

possible       lift        bodies          back   towards       the           rear    of     the     enclosure.               Whilst

Superintendent Greenwood continued to use the loud hailer, I, together with

Inspector Harvey,                                                                                     began to clear the

No.    3 enclosure.               It has to be           said that all of the bodies we managed to

extract appeared to be dead.

Whilst    carrying              out the      evacuation         I saw that unformed officers were now

removing      bodies            up the       terracing      towards the               tunnel underneath                 the       West

Stand.        Once an open area had been achieved, valiant efforts were made to

revive people by mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.                                                            Whilst

not     being        able       to     identify       all   of           the officers         involved,           I     can       name

Inspector        Harvey,                                                                     and     Detective          Constable

Humphries,           'C'    Division,         although      it has             to be said that there were many

other Police Officers involved, including some spectators.

                                                                                                                              A      =v
Once the enclosure had been cleared, I returned to the perimeter track and

noticed    that   the     fencing    had    been    broken      open   and bent upwards.              I was

informed by Inspector Dews that this had been done by Police Officers and as

such   it had     enabled    a number       of    spectators       to clamber         through on to the

perimeter track.

It was     only   after    I returned       to    the    playing area that I noticed that my

trousers and shoes were covered in vomit and I was conscious that I had lost

my hat and gloves.          However, shortly after I returned to the playing area an

officer returned my hat to m e .

Once No. 3 and 4 enclosures had been cleared, I was aware of heightening of

tension with verbal abuse and threats being directed at Police Officers from

spectators who had remained on the terracing, particularly in enclosure No.

2       Threats     and    offensive       remarks       were   also   being         directed    at   Police

Officers by spectators           on the playing area.               I walked along the perimeter

 track speaking to Sergeants, Inspectors and told them to keep their serials

 together and not allow any officers to become isolated as I believed that

 there could possibly be            assaults due to the frustration, anger and overall

 distress which was apparent on many spectators faces.

 Shortly    after    this    I     noticed       that    spectators       on   the    playing     area   were

 drifting    down    the    pitch    towards       the    Spion    Kop.        I borrowed a radio and

 instructed Ground Contrtol            to ask Police Officers on the Spion Kop end of

 the ground to advance up the pitch to prevent Liverpool fans from getting

 close to the Nottingham Forest supporters.                       I also instructed Inspectors and

    Sergeants to take their serials down the playing area and to                                sweep up and

    hold the Liverpool fans on the halfway line.                    I also asked Ground Control to

    deploy dog    handlers    on    the perimeter          track    in front         of the Spion Kop to

    prevent a pitch invasion.

    I was joined at the central circle by Superintendent Chapman who having
                                                       -   6   -




heard my instructions had moved up with the officers from the Spion Kop to

the halfway line.             He remained there in charge of the line of officers. My

instructions were that Liverpool supporters should be allowed to remain on

the playing area until a decision had been made as to whether the game would

continue.

I was then joined by Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr. Jackson who

was   in   civilian          clothes.        He     informed            me   that     the   game   had   now    been

abandoned       and    it was       agreed that an announcement should be made over the

public     address          system    that     the    game          had        been   abandoned,     but     asking

supporters       to remain          in the ground until the fleet of ambulances had left

the stadium with injured spectators who were being taken to hospital.

Some time after 4.00 p.m., having established that the ambulances and other

emergency vehicles had left the stadium,                                it was agreed to allow spectators

to leave the ground.                I directed Superintendent Chapman and Chief Inspector

Sumner     to   take     a contingent of uniformed officers                           from the cordon at the

halfway line into Penistone Road to prevent any confrontation between the

rival supporters.

As    officers        left    the    line under Superintendent Chapman,                       I moved      officers

across the pitch to maintain a continuous line of uniformed officers for the

 full width of the playing area.                    Once the spectators had left Leppings Lane,

 I instructed a number of uniformed officers to remain inside enclosure No. 3

 to   preserve        the    scene    and    also    to    collect           property which        had   been    left

 there.     They were also told to ensure that the broken crush barrier,                                       broken

 cross member and broken fencing were to remain in-situ until they could be

 photographed by Scenes of Crime Officers.

 Having    secured          the   enclosure       and having been               informed that there were no

 problems       outside       the    ground,      I went           to    the    Gymnasium where      a     temporary

 mortuary had already been organised under the directive of Detective Chief
                                                          -   7   -




Superintendent Addis and Superintendent Bates.

I was      then joined by Superintendent                      Brookfield who told me that Operation

Support had been implemented and that large numbers of officers were

arriving at the ground.                    He suggested, and I agreed, that officers arriving

without     any     specific         duties      should       be      directed       to     the    now vacated North

Stand for deployment where necessary.                                 Superintendent Brookfield undertook

to arrange t h i s.

In conclusion I am satisfied that the broken crush barrier in enclosure No.

3 played a crucial part in this unfortunate tragedy.                                          The cross member had

broken      at    the      'neck'     of     the securing             stand.          Having snapped          the cross

member           still     under      considerable            pressure         appears       to have        been    pushed

forwards and downwards towards the playing area                                      and the leverage, prior to

it    breaking,          had    partially        uprooted             the    now     bent     and    distorted           other

securing         stand.        The   position      of     the         dead and injured people                immediately

below      the    broken barrier            and on either              side of the perimeter gate giving

access to enclosure No. 3, does, I believe, support my observation.

Some years ago I was present at a local 'Derby' between Rotherham United and

one of the Sheffield teams at Millmoor Football Ground.                                             The boundary wall

 at the Tivoli end of the ground collapsed causing spectatoros to spill out

 on   to    the     perimeter         track      and    playing             area.      Spectators       who        had    been

 standing        well      back      from    the wall     because            of      a surge in       the     crowd were

 catapulted         over       the   top    of   the    people          who    had    been        leaning    against       the

 boundary wall -which at Miilmoor is level with the playing surface.                                                      This

 could not have occurred at Hillsborough because of two significant points.-

 (1) the terracing is approximately 2 ’6" lower than the playing surface, and

 (2) people who were pushed forward would undoubtedly have collided with the

        perimeter fencing and then fallen on the top of people who were trapped

        alongside the perimeter wall.

I remained on duty until 1.30 a.m., the greater part of my time being spent

within Hillsborough Stadium.

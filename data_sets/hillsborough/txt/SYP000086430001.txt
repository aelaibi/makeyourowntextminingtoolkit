                 I have been involved at West Bromwich Albion FC for 40 yrs and I nave

                 been the qround director             for S years.              Perimeter fences were first

                 erected at the ground about                 15 years ago to^,             T)i./ soectaiors

                 the system has remained the same although we have had the

                 fences strengthened and about 8 years ago                         rakes were added to the top

                 of the fences to prevent             spectators          climbing over.         The gates are

                 secured by means of releasing a bolt.                          Trained Stewards man each gate

                 on match days.          In the    light of the events at Hillsborough it was

                 decided to paint the inside of the gates                         in the perimeter       fence

                 fluorescent orange to highlight                  the emergency exit.            We have neve r

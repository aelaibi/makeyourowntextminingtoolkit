              Du r i n g d i s c u ssions w i t h yourself and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t              Mole    on

              Monday      17 April       1989,    a means was       sought       of    collating       information

               that was a v a i l a b l e   of events       o c c urring at various             locations at

              Hillsborough,            so that a c o mparison         could be drawn b e t w e e n the

              a c t i v i t y at the     locations and an overall                view perceived.



              D e t ective S e r g e a n t Carr suggested,            and    it was agreed,            that an A n a c a p a

              m e t h o d known as a case a n a lysis            charting        be used.         This    is a method,

              which,      by a daptation,         the   r e c o n s t r u c t i o n of events     in a    chart form

               can be visua l l y di s p l a y e d w ith th© use of                labels,      showing a

               information.            Selected    locations were           chosen and the           i n f o r mation

               about those        locations       set out on the         chart        reading     in chronologial

S U M M A R Y OF E V E N T S



At    1400 hours,        officers at        the briefing         of the    19.4.89,      stated that

commu n i c a t i o n became       impossible       due to loud         interference.            This

appears      to be a problem that             persisted.



Comme n t s made at            th© briefing    of    19.4.89,      indicate that the               terracing

of Pens 3 an d 4 were filled but not tigh t l y                         packed.     This must

however be c o n s i d e r e d against         views of the same a r e a at              1420 hours

which      indicate      otherwise.



Photographs         t aken outside       the ground at Leppings Lane                  betw e e n     1407 -

1417 hours show a gradual                build up of fans,              they are under escort

from P e nistone R o a d and appear              orderly.



Views towards M i d d l e w o o d Road,          at this       time,     show L e p pings        Lane

th r onged w i t h fans.



Comments made at the               briefing    19.4.89,         indicate     that a r o u n d      1415

hours      the sea r c h i n g of fans who          came t h r o u g h the t u r n s t i l e s     into the

enclosure       became         impossible    because      of    crowd density.          Other

information w h i c h shows an              influx of fans w h e n Gate B was opened

tends to       put this         circumstance at a later time an d p r o b a b l y                  1430 h o u r s .



     /
At/ 1417 hours S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall            requests    the    closure of

L e p p i n g s Lane.     Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d makes the      comment

that L e p pings Lane            d i d n ’t look so b a d , then the         request was m a d e ,
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   R 1A

traffic was flowing,                a l t h o u g h a bus was    having d i f f i c u l t y getting

through.



The video summary shows at                  1420 hours a continuous              build up of fans

at turnstiles          going    through to the Wes t S t a n d Enclosure.                  The
                                                                             S   '
terra c e d are a      inside       the ground     is sparse.



At    1425 hours fans are on the                pavement        but are spilling        onto     the

roadway and a bus             can be seen       in L e p pings Lane heading            towards

Pe n i s t o n e Road.      W i t h i n the next few minutes               J
                                                                       s^omjr views     show the

crowd occupying             the road,     whereas     other views        show less      conce n t r a t i o n

of fans.         There      does appear      to be some         restriction of m o v e m e n t     to

vehi c l e s .



There       is no    inform a t i o n as to whe n the           road was    closed by Po l i c e        but

it appears          by 1426 hours v e hicular m o v e m e n t w ould be impossi ble as

the    crowd in L e p p i n g s Lane        (towards P e n i s t o n e Road)     was    filling        the

whole       road.



By    1430 hours the          pressure      begins    to   increase a r o u n d Gate B and

reports of a stew a r d at this                gate being        concerned of the        crush

developing.           There    is heavy c ongestion at the               immediate      turnstile

ar e a and       peopie are tightly           packed a l t h o u g h at this     stage one

p h otograph view shows a section to be orderly.                            It was e s t i m a t e d

continuous          entry    into the ground.          A r o u n d this time more        horses were

deplo y e d from the S o u t h S tand area.



At this time Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Mur r a y    recollect       that    there was ample        space on the t e r racing            but the

two    centre      pens were          filling up and the West S t a n d was                       quite     full.



A n interesting           feature       is that a r o u n d this time there develops a

problem w i t h the Police Radio C o m m u n i c a t i o n s w h i c h                    persists        for a

number      of minutes.           There      is no e v i dence on the document                       e x a mined to

pinpoint an exact             time for the fault                 in its d u r ation but              comments

made    by officers at the briefings                       indicate        it to be a r o u n d        1430 hours.



The    steward on Gate B , on his own initiative,                                opens      this gate to

release the         pressure          of the    crowd and a number of fans enter.                             There

is a conflict of the number                     of fans admitted,                the figures          provided

are    between 50 and 500.



Once    into the enclosure               fans     passed their            tickets       under      gates etc.           to

the    crowd outside.



According        to comments made at the                   briefing        by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall

problems also began to develop at Gate C a r o u n d this                                    time and he was

unable      to notify g r o u n d control              of this due to the                 problems        of Police

Radio C o m m u n i c a t i o n s .     S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M c K a y speaks      of "Gate C not

being under         the    pressure        t h at...."       (in the briefing               of     16.4.69)       and

Gate C opening and              closing        several       times to admit             injured persons

through.         This     is not e x p a n d e d upon a n d at the moment                         indicates a

possible a rea of            conflict.          It is possible             there      is c o n fusion over

the    identity of the            gates      or S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r s h a l l ' s    comments

relate      to a later time.



At    1432 hours Gate B               is seen to be          closed,                  is climbing           the

parapet a d j a c e n t      to that gate a n d there                 is a large          number      of fans

densely       packed at the main gate at L e p p i n g s Lane.

Comment     11 made at the briefing               of    19.4.89,      that after the arrival                of

the train contingent             the orderly queues were               lost and never           re-formed,

Fans were      entering       the ground        in an    injured and d i s t r e s s e d

condition.         It appears       by e x a m i n a t i o n of the    photographs an d video

that this s i t u a t i o n arose at about              1435 hours.



It appears       from the video summary that at                   1433 hours the scene              is

calm but by 1435 hours              photographs a n d the same video summ a r y show

fans    climbing the fencing and a d e n s e l y packed crowd of at                            least

including m o u n t e d are       having a p p a r e n t d i f f i c u l t y    in e xercising

control.       There     is an overspill          of    1,000 or more          fans a w a y from the

t urnstiles      into the S o u t h S t a n d ac c e s s      road so that there was              no

op p o r t u n i t y to relieve     pressure m o u n t e d at the turnstiles.



The video summ a r y of the si t u a t i o n at             1433 hours         to   1435 hours      shows

differing a c c o u n t s     of events.        This     could either          be as a     result      of

viewing d i fferent         locations at the L e p p i n g s Lane are a or an

e s c a l a t i o n of a c t i v i t y there.



The video summary shows there was                      no opport u n i t y to relieve           pressure

at turnstiles at           1440 hours and ther e a f t e r          fans       climbing over the

parapet and turnstile wall.



There are       reports     emanating       from the      briefing       of     19.4.89,      that Gate A

was    being   bounced an d looked as             if it was       going to          come off the wall.

This sit u a t i o n s u b s i s t e d for the next         10 to     15 minutes.

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall,    Inspector D e l a n e y a n d       Inspector P u r d y all

turnstiles a l t h o u g h Det e c t i v e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M c K a y   indicates Gate C

not under         pressure.       This    is c o nfirmed by Inspector D e l a n e y who

speaks of passing            t h r o u g h Gate C to go from the West S t a n d E n c l o s u r e

to Leppings Lane a n d observes fans                    being       crushed.       Superintendent

Marshall makes          comment at the briefing that he was a s k e d by Inspector

P u r d y to do something          to relieve the           pressure at L e p p i n g s Lane.

Whilst       it is d i fficult to pinpoint              the times of this,            it   is confirmed

by reference         to the C o m m a n d a n d Control            Log that at      1444 hours

Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall     requests     gr o u n d    control    to tannoy for people

not to push at the L e p pings Lane                  entrance        indicating      d i s order at this

time.



The briefing notes            show c o n f i r m a t i o n of this from officers             present.

In the briefing          notes S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall m a k e s       reference to

going     into the      crowd and asking           people         to stop pushing.



There    is an      indi c a t i o n that a request was made                 to open Gate C in

order    to relieve        the    pressure      not at Gate C but at the turns tile area

It is not k nown if this mess a g e was                   received by G r o u n d Control.

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d makes     comment at the briefing that

he was a ware S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r shall       had requested the gate             to be

o p e n e d but    it is not known if it was at this time or later w h e n a
second    request was made.



Wh i l s t there were     problems outside             the ground        it appears         by   reference

to the briefing         notes    that    there was       space at either               end of the

t errace and there were           no a p p a r e n t   problems      inside      the ground.

In addition,         comments are made             by officers        in the briefing of

of the fencing and at the outer                      b o u n d a r y gates are m o u n t e d officers,

apparently attempting               to     control    the      crowd.          Huge    numbers       of

spectators are see n in Leppings Lane and fans                                  in very       large numbers

move    down into the service                 road and thro u g h Gate C.                   Mention         is made

by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d at the briefing                of fans harassing

a horse and a rider having                    difficulty         in Leppings Lane,               an d      in fact

comment      is made       in the briefing           of    19.4.89 that at some time a horse

was    1 ifted bodily by the               crowd.     Fans were          forcing         their way between

horses      legs and       ignoring P o l i c e ’s directions.                   The video summary

shows m o u n t e d officers attem p t i n g              to m a i n t a i n    control       but soon

running towards            it.     Once through,           the    crowd        (according        to the video

summary)       is quite orde r l y and            leisurely         in terms          of m o v e m e n t    to

At    1454 hours the turnstile area                    is still          s e v erely   c o ngested and

surging,       w i t h fans     climbing the wall an d huge numbers                       before      the

perimeter       gates.         A Police     Inspector         or Chief        Inspector        can be seen

on the turnstile              roof using his          radio.           This may be      Inspector Bennett

as outlined by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall                in the briefing,            who was

a sking    for addi t i o n a l     serials     because           he    could see the      problem.          His

view was that the              crowd was tigh t l y          packed,       no one      could move and

people were         being      crushed.



Offic e r s    do make        reference to o c c u r rences at the time                   Inspector

B e n n e t t was on the turnstile             roof.         There       is one o c c a s i o n whe n

Inspector B e n n e t t was         seen on the            roof    (video summary)         a n d this       is

timed at       1454.         This time has been t aken as the only time he did so,

therefore,        the time       of the oc c u r r e n c e s       connected by offices              to this.

If Inspector Benn e t t            climbed the         roof on more           than one o c c a s i o n then

a d j u s t m e n t s will    need to be made.



At    1455 hours the           sit u a t i o n does    not    change.         Fans     still    stream

area.      People      can be seen at a gap                 in the wall         dividing the enclosure



Mention       is made at the          briefing        of    19.4.89 of hundreds            entering

t h r o u g h Gate A releasing           the pressure at the turnstiles.                         O f f icers at

that    gate were        faced wit h a severe               situation.         As d e s c r i b e d earlier

the gate was         being      bounced and       looked as             if it was going         to   come off

the wall.         S e r g e a n t Higgins    repor t e d that            if the gate      i s n ’t opened

there     is going to be serious               injuries and              possible      "loss of      life".

The    reply he      received was         "if that          is the       case open the gate".               The

At   1500 hours        outside      the ground the Police                  barrier     has been a d v a n c e d

climbing        the s u r r o u n d i n g wall.



It does appear           that    in the       preceding        few minutes         large     numbers    of

fans    (possibly 2 , 0 0 0 to 3,000)                 have    been a d m i t t e d to the       ground.

      Inside the g r o u n d at        1500 hours        there are a number of occurrences

      including a crowd surge,                track gates          in the open position,                climbing

      by fans of fences           between Pens 2 and 3 and the                     perimeter        fencing,

      fans on the track are a and both P o l i c e and St.                         John's Amb u l a n c e

      personnel     in a t t e n d a n c e at what appear            to be Track Gate 4,                  Fans are

      still    being a d m i t t e d to Track Gate            1.     Evidence        of the      surge       is from

      two sources,       ie    comments       by Inspector Bui las at the briefing                           (CCS      16.4,

      who says     "At k i c k-off       c o n s o lidated    push to the front,                people

      screaming at       front".         Mr. Bui las adds at the briefing of                        19.4.89 that

      the surge,     w h i c h did not        come back,        c o incided w ith a roar from the

      crowd.     It is a s s u m e d that         kick-off was at           1500 h o u r s .       The video

      summary shows that fans at the barrier                         between Pens 2 and 3 appear                        to

      be surging at the           rear,     but    it is d e s c r i b e d as a m inor           situation.

move.        There      is obvious           severe    pressure     on them,      some      fans are     seen

climbing         between Pens 2 and 3.                  Fans are      continuing       to    climb the

perimeter         fence      out of the         pen.     Track Gate 3 is open and fans are on

the track a rea behind the goal.                         Police O f f icers are hurryin g               to the

scene and fans are now seen to be                         climbing on the outside                   of the

perimeter         fence an d         reaching      over to the        fans    inside Pen 3.

other than the              pressure         has been    reduced at the turnstiles.



At    1503 hours          fans appear          to be panicking,          and large numbers are

scaling        the     perimeter       fence.         Some are    climbing       from Pen 4 into Pen 5

        SUBJECT:



        INTBOOIICTIOH

        During discussions with yourself and Chief Superintendent Mole on Monday
        17 April 1989, a means was sought of collating information that was
        available of events occurring at various locations at Hillsborough, so
        that a comparison could be drawn between the activity at the locations
        and an overall view perceived.

        Detective Sergeant Carr suggested, and it was agreed, that an Anacapa
        method known as a case analysis charting be used. This is a method,
        which, by adaptation, the reconstruction of events in a chart form can be
        visually displayed with the use of labels, showing a description of the
        activity, the time (if known) and the source of the information.
        Selected locations were chosen and the information about those locations
        set out on the chart reading in chronological order frccn left to right.
        The intention is that by reading the chart, activity at the various
        locations is provided and can be ccmpared with what is happening
        elsewhere.

        The locations selected are as follows

        Outside Ground     This is the whole area from the turnstiles and gates
                           extending into Leppings Lane.

        Gates A - B        These are the gates marked as such, adjacent to the
                           turnstiles behind the West Stand.

        Gate C             This is the gate marked as such, adjacent to the
                           turnstiles behind the West Stand.

        Turnstiles         The turnstiles behind the West Stand.'

        West Stand         The concourse area between the turnstiles/gates

        Tunnel             The central tunnel underneath the West Stand linking
                           the West Stand Enclosure and the Terracing.

        Terracing          The standing area within the ground at the Leppings

SUMMARY OF EVEWTS

At 1400 hours, officers at the briefing of the 19.4.89, stated that
communication became impossible due to loud interference. This appears
to be a problem that persisted.

Conments made at the briefing of 19.4.89, indicate that the terracing of
Pens 3 and 4 were filled but not tightly packed. This must however be
considered against views of the same area at 1420 hours which indicate
otherwise.

Photographs taken outside the ground at Leppings Lane between 1407 - 1417
hours show a gradual build up of fans, they are under escort fran
Penistone Road and appear orderly.

Views towards Middlewood Road, at this time, show Leppings Lane thronged
with fans.

 Canments made at the briefing 19.4.89, indicate that around 1415 hours
 the searching of fans who came through the turnstile into the enclosure
 became impossible because of crowd density. Other information vriiich
 shows an influx of fans when Gate B was opened tends to put this
 circumstance at a later time and probably 1430 hours.

 At 1417 hours Superintendent Marshall requests the closure of leppings
 Lane. Chief Superintendent Duckenfield makes the ccranent that Leppings
 Lane didn't look so bad, then the request was made, traffic was flowing,
Ialthough a bus was having difficulty getting through.
 The video sunrnary shows at 1420 hours a continuous build up of fans at
 7 ^ 2 if* goin9 through to the West Stand Enclosure. The terraced area
 inside the ground is sparse.

 ? L 142u h°UrS ^ans are.on ^ e pavement but are spilling on to the roadway
      a " f 0311 be seen in leppings Lane heading towards Penistone Road.
 Within the next few minutes sane views show the crowd occupying the road,
 whereas other views show less concentration of fans. There does appear
 to be sane restriction of movement to vehicles.

 There is no information as to when the road was closed by Police but it
 appears by 1426 hours vehicular movement vould be impossible as the crowd
 in leppings Lane (towards Penistone Road) was filling the whole road.

 By 1430 hours the pressure begins to increase around Gate B and reports
 of a steward at this gate being concerned of the crush developing. There
 is heavy congestion at the immediate turnstile area and people are
 tightly packed although at this stage one photograph view shows a section
 to be orderly. It was estimated 3,000 - 4,000 had built up and this
 figure was increasing, despite continuous entry into the ground. Around
 this time more horses were deployed fran the South Stand area.

At this time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray
recollect that there was ample space on the terracing but the two centre
pens were filling up and the West Stand was quite full.

An interesting feature is that around this time there develops a problem
with the Police Radio Coratunications vriiich persists for a number of
minutes. There is no evidence on the document examined to pinpoint an
exact time for the fault in its duration but comments made by officers at
the briefings indicate it to be around 1430 hours.

The steward on Gate B, on his own initiative, opens this gate to release
the pressure of the crowd and a number of fans enter. There is a
conflict of the number of fans admitted, the figures provided are between
50 and 500.

Once into the enclosure fans passed their tickets under gates etc to the
crowd outside.

According to ccranents made at the briefing by Superintendent Marshall
problems also began to develop at Gate C around this tine and he was
unable to notify ground control of this due to the problems of Police
Radio Ccnrnunications. Superintendent McKay speaks of "Gate C not being
under the pressure that...." (in the briefing of 16.4.89) and Gate C
opening and closing several times to admit injured persons through. This
is not expanded upon and at the moment indicates a possible area of
conflict. It is possible there is confusion over the identity of the
gates or Superintendent Marshall's carments relate to a later tine.

At 1432 hours Gate B is seen to be closed, a fan is climbing the parapet
adjacent to that gate and there is a large number of fans densely packed
at the main gate at Leppings Lane.

Comment 11 made at the briefing of 19.4.89, that after the arrival of the
train contingent the orderly queues were lost and never re-formed. Fans
were entering the ground in an injured and distressed condition. It
appears by examination of the p h o t o g r a p h s and video that this situation
arose at about 1435 hours.
                                                                            \ (X.
                       - 4 -



It appears fran the video suntnary that at 1433 hours the scene is calm
but by 1435 hours photographs and the same video sunitary show fans
climbing the fencing and a densely packed crowd of at least 3,000 seen
back fran the turnstile areas in the main road. Officers including
mounted are having apparent difficulty in exercising control. There is
an overspill of 1,000 or more fans away fran the turnstiles into the
South Stand access road so that there was no opportunity to relieve
pressure mounted at the turnstiles.

The video sunmary of the situation at 1433 hours to 1435 hours shows
differing accounts of events. This could either be as a result of
viewing different locations at the Leppings Lane area or an escalation of
activity there.

The video summary shows there was no opportunity to relieve pressure at
turnstiles at 1440 hours and thereafter fans climing over the parapet and
turnstile wall.

There are reports emanating fran the briefing of 19.4.89, that Gate A was
being bounced and looked as if it was going to cane off the wall. This
situation subsisted for the next 10 to 15 minutes.



Inspector Delaney in the debrief speaks of disorder in the West Stand
Enclosure and being deployed therein. However, it is not clear whether
it is at this time he was deployed or later at about 1454 hours when the
situation has escalated further and action is taken by deploying serials
there.

At about 1445 hours Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent
Marshall, Inspector Delaney and Inspector Purdy all speak of the enormous
pressure of fans at Leppings Lane at the turnstiles although Detective
Superintendent McKay indicates Gate C not under pressure. This is
confirmed by Inspector Delaney who speaks of passing through Gate C to go
fran the West Stand Enclosure to Leppings Lane and observes fans being
crusted. Superintendent Marshall makes comment at the briefing that he
was asked by Inspector Purdy to do something to relieve the pressure at
Leppings Lane. Whilst it is difficult to pinpoint the times of this, it
is confirmed by reference to the Catmand and Control Log that at 1444
hours Superintendent Marshall requests ground control to tannoy for
people not to push at the Leppings Lane entrance indicating disorder at
this time.

The briefing notes show confirmation of this from officers present.
In the briefing notes Superintendent Marshall makes reference to going
into the crcwd and asking people to stop pushing.

There is an indication that a request was made to open Gate C in order to
relieve the pressure not at Gate C but at the turnstile area. It is not
known if this message ws received by Ground Control. Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield makes corment at the briefing that he was
aware Superintendent Marshall had requested the gate to be opened but it
is not known if it was at this time or later when a second request was
made.

           Whilst there were problems outside the ground it appears by reference to
           the briefing notes that there was space at either end of the terrace and
           there were no apparent problems inside the ground.

           Photographs taken at 1446 hours show that Pens 3 and 4 of the terracing
           are packed with fans to the rear but the front of the terracing is
           reasonably loose. Fans are seen to be climbing above others around them
           at the rear. The situation is calm and Track Gate 4 is closed.

           At 1448 hours the video sumnary shows that Gate C is opened and fans are
           moving fran the service area through this gate and into the West Stand
           Enclosure. It is not known whether it was opened as a result of pressure
           fran fans or in response to Superintendent Marshall1s earlier request, or
           otherwise.

           Mounted officers are seen to control the influx and force the crowd back
           towards the proper side of the turnstiles. There is a relaxation of
           pressure in the service area and the gate is closed.

           At 1450 hours, according to the video summary, large numbers of

At 1448 hours the video suntnary shows that Gate C is opened and fans are
moving from the service area through this gate and into the West Stand
Enclosure. It is not known whether it was opened as a result of pressure
from fans or in response to Superintendent Marshall's earlier request, or
otherwise.

Mounted officers are seen to control the influx and force the crowd back
towards the proper side of the turnstiles. There is a relaxation of
pressure in the service area and the gate is closed.

Photographs at 1450 hours shew Gate C closed.

At 1450 hours, according to the video summary, large numbers of
spectators are converging at the turnstile area from Penistone Road and
Middlewood Road areas. Estimate of numbers amassed outside turnstiles
are put at 3/4 thousand and a fairly large section of the crowd are
spilling down the service road and up against Gate C. However,
photographs at the same time (MWL 15) show no pressure of fans against
Gate C but do show a very large crowd, severe congestion at turnstile
area with fans climbing the walls and barriers. Mounted officers are
within the crowd trying to exercise control.

In the briefing notes Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Sup>erintendent
Marshall speak of an acute situation and opening gates to relieve
pressure fearing loss of life. Consideration was given to delaying the
kick-off because of the situation outside, but whilst such consideration
was being made the players came on to the pitch. Chief Inspector Creaser
also refers to consideration of the delay in the start of the game in
that he made such a request by use of the Police Land Rover radio. Gate
C is seen as closed at 1451 hours (photo MtfLi5) with the pressure in
front of the turnstiles maintained. There are photographs to suggest no
movement of fans at the turnstiles in the section of the crowd being
viewed.

In addition, ccratents are made by officers in the briefing of 19.4.89,
that turnstile G is distorted and became inoperable and fans were stuck
in a turnstile for some time.    Cannents made by officers at other
briefings also shew severe problems at the turnstiles, including non
ticket holders present, unlawful entry and attempted corruption. Fans
were also resisting attempts by Police to rescue them from the crush at
the turnstiles for fear of losing their place in the 'queue'. Police
were also trying to reach the ones who were there bartering with the
turnstile operator. In an attempt to relieve the situation at the
turnstile the operators were asked by Police to allow fans through
quicker by retaining pressure cm the release pedal.

At 1452 hours Gate C is opened (unknown by whan) with spectators moving
through in large numbers. Inspector Sykes contents at the briefing that
at the second opening of Gate C, Gates A and B were opened. This may
well be the occasion referred to. Inspector Delaney also mentions Gate B
being opened, as does Police Sergeant Burns, although they cannot be
specific about the time, this could be the occasion referred to. Police
Sergeant Burns specifically mentions Gate B being opened by two uniformed
officers.

At this time in excess of 20 fans can be seen on top of one section of
the fencing and at the outer boundary gates are mounted officers,
apparently attempting to control the crowd. Huge numbers of spectators
are seen in Leppings Lane and fans in very large numbers move downinto
the service road and through Gate C. Mention is made by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield at the briefing of fans harassing a horse and
a rider having difficulty in Leppings Lane, and in fact comment is made
in the briefing of 19.4.89 that at sane time a horse was lifted bodily by
the crowd. Fans were forcing their way between horses legs and ignoring
Police's directions. The video summary shows mounted officers attempting
to maintain control but soon overvrfielmed by the numbers who walk through
Gate C. Movement of the crowd, then accelerates fran walking towards and
through Gate C to running towards it. Once through, the crowd (according
to the video summary) is quite orderly and leisurely in terms of movement
to spectator areas.

At 1454 hours the turnstile area is still severely congested and surging,
with fans climbing the wall and huge numbers before the perimeter gates.
A Police Inspector or Chief Inspector can be seen on the turnstile roof
using his radio. This may be Inspector Bennett as outlined by
Superintendent Marshall in the briefing, who was asking for additional
serials because he could see the problem. His view was that the crowd
was tightly packed, no one could move and people were being crushed.

Officers do make reference to occurrences at the time Inspector Bennett
was on the turnstile roof. There is one occasion when Inspector Bennett
was seen on the roof (video summary) and this is timed at 1454. This
time has been taken as the only time he did so, therefore, the time of
the occurrences connected by offices to this. If Inspector Bennett
climbed the roof on more than one occasion then adjustments will need to
be made.

At 1455 hours the situation does not change. Fans still stream through
Gate C, scaling the walls and entering through the turnstiles and gates
in their thousands, making their way towards the tunnel area. People can
be seen at a gap in the wall dividing the enclosure.

Mention is made at the briefing of 19.4.89 of hundreds entering through
Gate A releasing the pressure at the turnstiles. Officers at that gate
were faced with a severe situation. As described earlier the gate was
being bounced and looked as if it was going to cane off the wall.
Sergeant Higgins reported that if the gate isn't opened there is going to
be serious injuries and possible "loss of life". The reply he received
was "if that is the case open the gate". The gate was opened.

1456 hours shows a similar scene although the crowd in the service road
is much smaller with mounted officers across it. The boundary gates
appear closed holding possibly 1,000 fans in Leppings Lane (yet to
enter).

1457 hours again shews a similar scene with the West Stand Enclosure
densely packed and the crowd almost universally moving towards the tunnel
entrance. It would appear that Gates B and C are open.

At 1458 hours the area around the Police barriers (near the service road)
is reasonably clear with no pressure of fans. The gate there is open
(photo MfL 11), ie Gate C.

Hie video sunmary at 1459 hours shews both the northern and southern end
of Leppings Lane terraces with space available there. At the same time
(1459 hours) fans are seen approaching Track Gate 1 frcm the north
direction and filing through Gate 1 into the terraces.

At 1500 hours outside the ground the Police barrier has been advanced
towards Leppings Lane past Gate C and entrance through that gate has now
stepped. Although the crcwd outside has greatly reduced, large numbers
are approaching and moving through the turnstiles and climbing the
surrounding wall.

It does appear that in the preceding few minutes large numbers of fans
(possibly 2,000 to 3,000) have been admitted to the ground. Detective
Superintendent McKay, who was positioned outside the ground adjacent to
Gate C speaks of a cheer inside the ground whilst fans were flowing
through the gates which added an urgency for the fans. It may be that
the occasion Detective Superintendent McKay is speaking of is this
occasion, although it could well have been another occasion such as the
players appearing on the pitch at about 1450 tours or sane other
incident. Detective Superintendent McKay also mentions that in a period
of 20 minutes Gate C was opened on a number of occasions.

Inside the ground at 1500 hours there are a number of occurrences
including a crowd surge, track gates in the open position, climbing by
fans of fences between Pens 2 and 3 and the perimeter fencing, fans on
the track area and both Police and St John's Ambulance personnel in
attendance at what appear to be Track Gate 4. Fans are still being
admitted to Track Gate 1. Evidence of the surge is fran two sources, ie
contents by Inspector Bullas at the briefing (CCB 16.4.89) who says "At
kick-off consolidated push to the front, people screaming at front".
Mr Bullas adds at the briefing of 19.4.89 that the surge, which did not
care back, coincided with a roar fran the crowd. It is assumed that
kick-off was at 1500 tours. The video summary shows that fans at the
barrier between Pens 2 and 3 appear to be surging at the rear, but it is
described as a minor situation. Photograph album DB17 shews Police
Officers and St John's Ambulance personnel at the track gates.

There was space in Pens 1 and 2 and at 1501 hours fans are still passing
fran the track area into these pens.

At 1502 hours the pressure of fans at the turnstiles is now reduced but
once through appear to be running towards the tunnel entrance.
Photographs show fans in the tunnel at the terrace end looking towards
the pitch although Superintendent Greenwood at the subsequent briefing
made the comment that the tunnel at the back of the terracing did not
appear to be full at about this time.

On the terracing the crowd is packed at the area of the tunnel with sane
fans standing on the rear walls and fencing. The fans in Pen 3 are
pressed solidly against the pierimeter fence and appear unable to move.
There is obvious severe pressure on them, some fans are seen climbing
between Pens 2 and 3. Fans are continuing to climb the perimeter fence
out of the pen. Track Gate 3 is open and fans are on the track area
behind the goal. Police Officers are hurrying to the scene and fans are
new seen to be climbing on the outside of the pierimeter fence and
reaching over to the fans inside Pen 3.

Hiere is no information of any activity (if any) outside the ground,
other than the pressure has been reduced at the turnstiles.

At 1503 hours fans appear to be panicking, and large numbers are scaling
the perimeter fence. Sane are climbing from Pen 4 into Pen 5 and fans at
the front are solidly pressed against the perimeter fence in the same
position as in the previous minute.

Photographs show there is space available on the north side of the
terracing. Track gates 1 to 5 are all open and fans are still entering
the terracing through Gates 1 and 2.

Hie track area shows an increasing number of fans and Police there, with
fans obviously injured and receiving attention. First Aid personnel are
also in attendance.

At the briefing Inspector Bullas mentions that upon witnessing the surge
he took officers to the tunnel and found it packed with fans. He tried
to drag the fans back and later assisted with passing dead people back.
It is not clear from where the dead people were recovered from. The
Hires of these events are not clear, but the earliest time when Police
Officers are seen at the end of the tunnel at the terracing by photograph
is 1512 hours (PR3).

At 1504 hours photographs show Gate 6 open with fans being shepherded
into the north side of the terracing. There are increasing numbers of
fans cxi the track and grass area adjacent to the pitch, sane being
treated.

At 1505 hours fans are seen scaling the railings between Pens 2 and 3,
track Gate 2 is closed but there is a steward in attendance, numbers of
people on the track are increasing and encroaching on to the pitch and
advertising hoardings behind the goal laid face down.

Play is stopped by Superintendent Greenwood's approach to the referee.
Track Gate 2 is open at 1506 hours as are Gates 3 and 4. A view is shown
of a victim being carried by fans to St John's personnel at the track
side (north). On the track area the number of fans and Police are
increasing.
At 1507 hours it can be seen there is extreme pressure at the front of
Pens 3 and 4, fans shewing facial expression of distress. At the rear of
the terracing fans are being lifted into the West Stand. The track gate
towards the South Stand is open and Police are helping fans out.

There is increasing activity on the track area in that fans are stood and
laid in varying positions. At this time (1507 hours) Ground Control
requests Operation Support.

At 1508 hours fans continue to be pulled from the terracing to the West
Stand and there is increasing acrtivity on the track. Both fans and
Police are at the perimeter fencing.

At this time (1508 hours) Ground Control requests a fleet of ambulances.

At 1509 hours there is still extreme pressure at the front of Pens 3 and
4. Fans are tightly packed at the rear and there appears to be little
movement in the crowd.

At 1510 hours there is still tremendous pressure on fans at the front of
the terraces and photographs indicate one or more may be dead. At the
rear of the terraces at the entrance to the tunnel it is tightly packed
with little movement to the tunnel. Fans are still being lifted into the
West Stand.

At 1512 hours Police Officers are now moving into the crowd, scrne are at
the end of the tunnel where it meets the terracing, others are in Pen 2
assisting fans from Pen 3 into Pen 2. The number of fans and Police at
the track side increases and a stretcher with two ambulance personnel
arrives there and subsequently tends to a fan.

From 1514 hours Police are now inside Pen 2 and 3 directing their
attention to the fans in Pen 3. The pressure in Pen 3 appears to be
easing. Makeshift stretchers can be seen laid out on the playing area.

By 1515 hours pressure at the front of Pen 3 has now gone but the crowd
is still tightly packed. The front of Pen 4 is still tightly packed,
although pressure is easing at the centre and rear of this pen. More
Police can be seen in Pen 3.

With the time at 1516 hours an ambulance (believed St Johns) is seen
arriving at the track side and greater numbers of fans and Police are
seen at the track side and pitch.

At 1517 hours the Command and Control log shows the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital being put on standby for a large number of casualties and at
1518 hours Ground Control requests Casualty Bureau to be set up at both
hospitals.

Viewing the terracing at 1519 hours a line of Police can be seen from the
tunnel entrance down the terracing steps in Pen 3 where the congestion is
easing. Pen 4 is still tightly packed.

It may be that this is the time that gave opportunity to pass the dead
people back towards the tunnel entrance.

Police Sergeant Morgan in the briefing of 19.4.89 states that bodies were
not found in the tunnel but that casualties were evacuated via it. It
appears that Police and fans at the rear were unaware of the situation at
the front.
A further stretcher arrives with two ambulance personnel and is seen
crossing the centre of the playing area.

The Coranand and Control Log indicates cutting equipment to scene and the
Northern General Hospital informed to expect casualties.

At 1520 hours make-shift stretchers are used to carry victims. Police
and fans are on the fencing assisting those inside. The Ccrmand and
Control log indicates the ambulance service forewarning Rotherham and
Barnsley Hospitals of casualties.

Fran 1521 hours climbing of the fencing ceases and at 1523 hours the
pressure in Pens 3 and 4 has gone. The perimeter fencing of Pen 4 can be
seen to be cut and ripped open. The general scene fran this time
continues with victims being carried away on makeshift stretchers.

Fire Brigade Officers can clearly be seen in attendance at 1526 hours.

The Ccnrnand and Control log show that at 1529 hours the Medico Legal
Centre was warned to expect several bodies and at 1533 hours local radios
wsre requested to broadcast for doctors and off-duty police to assist.

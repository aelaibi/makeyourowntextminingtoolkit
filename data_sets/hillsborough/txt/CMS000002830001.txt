                  Comments on Taylor Final Report

Introduct ion
You may previously have seen the submissions made by this group
to Lord Justice Taylor during his "phase two" considerations. Our
views remain unchanged and the contents of that document are
still completely valid.

However, to ease cross reference and with the belief that the
Governments  "Initial Response Document" (r e f :h s .1.26/sstadia.dm
issued 29/1/90) is a useful  summary we have used this as a
reference point

Recom.l to 4:- All seater stadia
We agree with all seater stadia.

Recom.5 - Advisory Design Council
Regrettfully, no time    limit was set.   The "leadership" track
record of the FA/ League is appalling and we understand that no
progress towards the recommendation has yet been made.

Recom.6 - National Inspectorate
Government  has committed to bringing forward Part     1 of the
Football Spectators Act  1989   legislation and thus create and
empower the Football Licensing Auth. - but when?

Taylor stated that    should there be "substantial delay" other
arrangements should be made,    he also expressed a desire to
include other sports grounds within FLA /other body jurisdiction.

What are    the mechanisms    for  formal      monitoring   of   Local
Authorities until the FLA is established?

Appendix A: shows an extract   from the South Yorkshire Police
Authority / Police Report of November       1990 which, even post
Hillsborough, clearly illustrates how Local Authorities  (and the
Police!)   cannot    be   relied    upon   to   enforce   Taylors
recommendations.

Recom.7 -10 Maximum Capacities for Terraces
Government supports these recommendations and states that Local
Authorities will be urged to implement them and that the reduced
capacity figures will used in the next edition of the Green
Guide.

As with Recom.6 above we are concerned at interim arrangements
-especially when one considers Appendix A . !!
When will the New Green Guide be published??
Can we be assured that      it will it be less discretionary than
previous editions.( as Taylor Final Report page 25 paras 147-150)

Recom.11-12 Filling and monitoring of terraces.
We are concerned at the effectivity of "statements of intent" and
feel this "relaxation"is a retrograde step at this time.

Even under the interim recommendations .where it was considered
"contractural" there are examples of dangerous situations being
allowed to exist:- see Appendix A (examples of Rotherham and
Barnsley position as per P.Wright report).

Recom.13 - Gangways
Agreed

Recom.14 - 21 Fences and Gates.
It is a common misconception that Taylor recommends the retention
of perimeter fencing of 2.2mtrs height.
In the body of the report (para 189) Taylor actually states

     "In making this recommendation       I am merely indicating a
     maximum height should perimeter   fencing be used.I do not
     suggest there must be such fencing or indeed any fencing.
     Those who have presently have no perimeter may well think it
     is safe to continue that way.Others may emulate them. Still
     more may consider that they can dispense with      fencing or
     bring it down to a lower level... e t c .11

Taylor suggests that the     local Advisory Body and the Local
Authority should have the discretionary powers to decide.

We feel this position should be more positive and government
asked to    declare a positive movement towards NO FENCING-
preferably prior to the emergance of the FLA and its overview
function.

Many major grounds already operate quite safely with no fencing,
and many more security devices, such as cameras,    are available
should conditions suggest their use.      Their use is based on
outdated and dangerous strategies and their roots, especially the
2.2 metre height requirement, are at best tenuous.

If we consider Bradford as well as Hillsborough then perimeter
fencing has no place because the "conveinance v safety" equation
clearly weighs against    them.  The four minutes that life can
continue illustrates their totally lethal nature.

THEY MUST COME DOWN N O W ! !!

All the other recommendations on fences would become redundant!
Recom.22 -23 Crush Barriers
We agre e .

Recom.24 -31 Safety Certificates
We agree wholeheartedly.    The Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
order could be made immediately! When will it be made.

The track record, even post Hillsborough, is appalling!
We would like to see a requirement for copies of certificates to
be displayed publicly, as is the practise for fire and insurance
certificates at other places of work and leisure.

Rec o m .32 -43 Duties of Football Clubs.
Agreed but overview required urgently.
Can the FA/ League be trusted to overview clubs. Can Local
Authorities be guaranteed to perform themselves, let alone force
erring clubs? History says not!!

Recom.44 - 69 Police and Emergency Services
We are   in general agreement      with the  thrust  of   these
recommendations and as we do not have expertise in these areas,
we must take guidance from others.

Recom.70 - 73 Offences and penalties
We agree,  and despite considering the enforcement of "mass"
chanting charges to be    frought with difficulty, feel them a
worthwhile objective.

Recom.74 - 76 Green Guide
As illusrated earlier we agree wholeheartedly.       Hillsborough
illustrated this to be an urgent requirement. Government has
declared a similar position,but how urgent is urgent!
When, how and who will  carry out this    involved but essential
task. We cannot await the FLA!

Taylor (para 147) illustrates the problems with making the whole
thing mandatory and this we accept.
In addition to the overview function that will eventually
exist,we feel that the new guide should assume "Code of Practise"
status to reinforce the areas not to become mandatory.

General Comments
There are three areas where we     feel comment   is   required in
addition to the specific points made abo ve :-

1)Segregation
Taylor (paras 37 - 45) makes many good points on this outdated,
costly and in our view,    counter-productive practise   but he
appears to make no specific recommendations.
We feel this to be an area that should be reviwed urgently and
revised actions implemented.
Perhaps this could be part of Green Guide review ?
2)Alcohol Sales
We are prepared to be guided by Taylor, but there is no timescale
for review. What is it and will it be a function of the FLA.?

3)Responsibilities of Promoter/ Football Clubs
Despite some clarification by Taylor it      is our view that many
areas of responsibility,and legislation still remain unclear.
(e .g - H e a l t h & Safety Inspectorate involvement,  do/ should
football grounds come under the somewhat         stricter "leisure"
requirements, which regulations apply to other stadia/ the use of
stadia other than for football etc.)
Perhaps some of this should be further reviwed,    or will  it fall
within the remit of the FLA.?

   RBCX*MENDATION 4



   A written agreement, setting out their respective responsibilities for

   crcwd       safety      and     control,        has     been      approved        and     signed      by

   representatives of South Yorkshire Police and Barnsley PC.                                  A copy of

   that agreement is attached at document (6) . Whilst there have been no

   variations to this agreement since it was signed by the club on the 22

   August 1989, it is clear that the club are failing to comply with the

   agreement. (See Recarmendation 3 above).



    RECOMMENDATION 5



    Barnsley PC claim that there are a number of stewards, deployed to each

    side of the ground, whose sole duty is to check crow3 conditions in

    those areas for possible overcrowding or distress.                           However, despite an

    undertaking in the written agreement with the South Yorkshire Police,

    and numerous subsequent requests made to the club secretary, the club

    have not yet provided a plan of the ground indicating where the

    stewards, who have this responsibility, will be situated.




  RBOOtdENDftTION 1



  It is noted by the police that the existing Safety Certificate for

  Rotherham United           Football       Club     was    issued      in    1984     by   the     South          ^

  Yorkshire County Council. Capacity figures for ^he various sections of
                          f *---------- ------------- ---------------------------------------- ------ ----------
  the ground are therefore out of date.                        New capacities have beeny^.

j ,calculated and the certificate requires updating.

We have had tremendous problems with the South Yorkshire Police
Authority, Its Chairman Sir John (Jack) Leyden, and Peter Wright -
Chief Constable.


This has revealed -


1    That each Authority and each Chief Constable is "A Law unto
     themselves".


2    The Quality of Senior Officers leaves a lot to be desired.

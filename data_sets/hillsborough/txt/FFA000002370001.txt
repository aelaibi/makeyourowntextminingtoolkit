 Dear Sirs,
                                            Re; Ground Safety

      Following the tragic events at Sheffield Wednesday F. C. last
 Saturday, you are instructed to undertake, in conjunction with
 your Local Licensing Authority, an immediate review of ground
 safety.   This should include the perimeter fencing installed, the
 agreed capacity levels of all standing areas and the routes to and
 from the ground.

      A report should then be forwarded to The Football
 Association, stating any immediate action taken to implement
 changes and any longer term measures that you have initiated.
 You should also advise us if no changes have been found necessary.

                                             Yours faithfully,




                                           / Chibfe Executive

              On S a t u r d a y    15th April         1989(150489)             I got    to work at about           11.30 am

              fans.      During         this    t i m e I was aware             that    the    pub across     the     road ____

                                          was   full     of Notts For                  fans and at one        point a few

              forest     fans       tried to get          into our        pub but        tH'&'xJ.anfHoiN;l

              say we had about            thirty Liver                                in the   pub a lt ho u gh

              others were           coming and goi                    ime         i|me r however    they were       no

              trouble and all            seemed       to                             were   out to enjoy the day,

              At about       13.30pm      to    14.00pm             ome              Liverpool     fans   left the

              pub but whe n they got              outside     the^Sjae r e a t t ac k ed    by Notts Forest       fans

              who had      came out from                                             he Forest   fans were armed

              w it h   chair        legs and    two Liverpool       fans
                                                                     ans     qotsi i n.j ure d r one a young

              had a cut on his head and the other                      had    cuts    to his face.

              The Police and a mb u la n ce were              called and a t t e nd e d and      I beleive        that a

              number      of Notts Forest             fans were arrested.

              In my opin io n this             incident was       caused totally by the Notts Forest

              fans and the Liverpool                  fans were     blameless.

D.O.B.       23/2/53

Telephone        Number

Will    say    as    follows:-




1)      I make      this    statement            in c o n n e c t i o n      with     an    incident        which

occurred       on    15th      April       1989      at    the    Hillsborough              Football        Stadium,

Sheffield        which      resulted           in    the    death       of




2)     I was     interviewed              at   the     same      time     as    Mr                           who

also gave        a statement              to M a c e      & Jones       Solicitors          on     4t h M a y     1989




3)     The    history       of    the      incident         is    largely        the       same    as M r

has    stated.       Mr                    is m y c o u s i n




4)     I would      like       to s t a t e      in a d d i t i o n     that     I remember when                we

were    outside.the            turnstile            saying       to            "Here's      a barrier           lets

get    under".        I tried          to g e t      under       but    there        was   difficulty.               I

became       trapped.




5)     With    regard       to    the      Police,         I can       remember        that       there     was      only

one    Policeman       about         in    the      crown.        He    was    on     a horse.          I remember

that    there    was      an     empty      space      on     the      other    side       of     the   crowd

control       barriers         and     I saw        some    Policemen           there      but     they weren't

doing    anything.
6)     I can    remember                   that            suddenly                     some           gates               opened                and           I was

swept       through         the         gates              with            the          crowd.                   There               was             a    tunnel

directly       opposite                 the g a t e s                  but           I went                to        the          left of                     the    tunnel

and    I managed            to g e t              into            the         terraces                     and          I was              looking                  for

                                     I couldn't                         find            them.




7)     I looked         all          around                th e         area            around                the          back            of            the    stands.

At    one    stage      I     tried              to g e t              back             through                  a gate                 to g e t               into       t he

stand       area.       I     told            the          steward                   that            there              had         been                 an    accident.

The    steward       wouldn't                    let me                 through                  the g a t e                  and          said               that       he

couldn't       open         it b e c a u s e                  th e            Police                has           the         key.                   I climbed                over

the    top of       the       gate            and m a n a g e d                     to g e t               into            the          stand.                  I still
                                                                                                                                                                     »



couldn't       see     where my                      friends                  were            and          I came                 to       the            back       of       the

area    to    the    rear           of        the          terrace.                        I seen                that            people                   were       dying

all    over    the     place.                    I carried                       on        looking                   on        the         terraces.

Before       that    a Policeman                          had           tried              to       stop me                   getting                     in b u t        I had

persuaded       him         to       let me                in.             It w a s              terrible                      in       there.                  I can

remember       seeing            many            Policemen                       who          appeared                     to be              in s h o c k .

No    one    seemed         to      know what                       was          going              on.




8)     Eventually             I found                  lines              of        bodies.                      I was              looking                    for

I checked       a    lot         of        the         bodies.                           Many            of the               people                     w h o had       died

were    very young,                 possibly only                                      in       their twenties.




9)     I spoke       to       a Policeman                           and                told           him that                    I had                  lost my

     Policeman          had        drawn me                    to h i s              attention,
                                                                                                                                                  old         me       that his
     father        had died.




     11)    I had       to     leave             him          to        look            for my

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                          Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 2 9 July.                                                   We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department.                                             We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
                With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows
(a)             We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate.                                             There is already a gate in
the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
police.              This same gate will still be available for the spectators
in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.                                                    This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Par t y rs visit on 7 August.

(b)             The foundations'for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                       An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144                T*    dfO             + C C.
                                                                                                       ^              «£AJ
                                                                                                                 *2 .         ■ ‘BS
EASTWOOD &■ PARTNERS




  the way you suggest.

  (c) and    (d)
            We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
  single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
 walls.      The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
 vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
  Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
 durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

  (e)     The      refreshment area is under the most westerly
  staircase up to the north west corner terrace.        There will
 be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

  (f)     The      handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
  above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
  step.

  (g)     The      stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
 chamfers which will not form good footholds.

  (h)     Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
 object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
 the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

  (i)     As with point     (a), we are not sure what is intended,
 and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

  (j)     Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt^J 3e
 taken care of by Mr. Chester.


          It will be much easier for your Working Party to
 appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
 construction.        There will also be an opportunity to see
 the metal decking of the South stand.


                                 Yours sincerely,




 c.c.     Mr. R.H. Chester

of visiting spectators at the Leppirigs Lane end of the Hillsbwga^i
Stadium.;      .

Subject to the following points and to the submission of the necessary
detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals are
regarded as generally acceptable

(a)   Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency agrees
purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

(b)   Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the
outer (river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Thmstile
16 and the new handrail not to he less than the width of the roller
shutter gate between Thmrstiles 16 and 17;

(c)     Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the internal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be s^stantial enough, and a

be ..required;.

(d)   Plan No.     6705/10A - same consents as for plan 9A;

(•)   Plan No. 6705/HA - no objection in principle, but details of exact
location required;

Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
the Police Sports and Social Club, Niagara, Sheffield, on 29th July, 1985

PRESENT:    S. Allcock (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).
                         (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
                           (South Yorkshire Police).

           |            (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
            D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council).

1_.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. The plans also included details .of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop,

2.     Consideration of Prfepo^als                   ' /:

The   14 detailed plans submitted were each cons 4;d£red anddiscussed individually

IT WAS AGREED ■*■?. that, subject to the following points and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally acceptable:-

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes
a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

(b)   Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)   Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)        Plan No. 6705/10A - same comments as for plan 9A;

(e)Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but          details of exact
location required;

(f)    Plan No.   6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
indicated;

(g)   Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements to give
foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
over will have to be borne in mind;

 (h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
.possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No.' 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May, 1985,
it is essential that all the new gates-are fully supervised by Stewards,
who must be fit, able and properly trained.

Dear Mr. Vaughan,                               \.
                      Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                 Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                    However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph                            (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                   If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                        a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                      It is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                   Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1985
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

    In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
    Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April
    to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
    Service requested additional time to consider the means    escape
    aspects.

    I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the
    following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
    calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and
    Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
    generally acceptable

    (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile
          numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

    (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral
          area or visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in
          half by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel
          entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
          so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
          appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
          adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
          abandoned);

    (c)   the right hand areaof the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
          terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial
          fence running from back to front with two gates (the existing
          radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
          area and home supporters - to have a second gate installed);

               Note of a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
               District) held at the Police Sports & Social Club, Niagara
                             Sheffield, on 18th April 1985


PRESENT:               (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
           R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County   FireService)
                       (South Yorkshire Police)
                       (South Yorkshire Police)
           G. Sykes    (South Yorkshire Police)
           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
                        (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


1.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.     Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject to:-

 (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
       and the wall of the inner access road;

 (b) the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
      visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in half by a new
      central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
      pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
      to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
      secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
      on the plan to be abandoned);

 (c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
       terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
       running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
       fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
       home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

 (d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
       installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.

(b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

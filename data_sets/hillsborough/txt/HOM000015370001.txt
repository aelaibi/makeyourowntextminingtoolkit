     Dear Lord Justice,

     As you will be spending some considerable time in
     and around Sheffield in the near future I would
     like to extend to you and your guests the
     facilities of The Sheffield Club for use at lunch
     t imes.

     The Club is now situated on the second floor of
     The Cutlers' Hall and is open from 11,00 a.m. to
     3.00 p.m.   If you would prefer to take lunch
     privately with your guests a suitable room, with
     self contained facilities, is available for up to
     10 persons but notification of such a requirement
     would be required in advance.

     Yours sincerely,




     CHAIRMAN

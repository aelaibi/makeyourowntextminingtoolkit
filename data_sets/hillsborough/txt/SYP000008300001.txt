          I am employed as Senior Plan Drawer with the West Midlands Police

          Authority.



          On Wednesday 10th October 1990 (101090) I was asked by Inspector

          PERKINS to prepare two plans showing details of Pens 3 and 4 of the

          Hillsborough Ground, and the positions of the deceased last seen alive

          and the first positions of the deceased when believed dead.



          Details of the pens and terraces were taken from measurements and

          observations made on site on Tuesday 25th April 1989 (250489), while

          the locations of the deceased were taken from visual evidence produced

          by the video and photographic section of the Hillsborough Inquiry Team,

          West Midlands Police.        These positions were transposed as accurately
                                                                  PAGE     2

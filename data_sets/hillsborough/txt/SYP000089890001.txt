Football         Stadium.            My    informal     place    of duty at f o o t b a l 1 matches            is at

 Gate 3 on the S pi on Kop end of the stadium w hich                                   is situated,         when

facing the Spion Kop to the                          right    of the goal        posts.

I am used to the feelings                          of the    crowd and       consider myself          to be

e x tremely e x p e ri en ce d             in crowd control,           and of possible          tension       caused

by incidents           on the field of play.                    To accen tu at e       this    I will    say that

on   11 M arch        1989      (110389),          a s i tu at io n occurred on the S pion Kop

involving M an ch es te r U ni t ed supporters a nd S h ef fi el d W e dn es da y

other     offenders.

At 9 . 4 5 a m    (0945),           S at ur da y    15 April    1989    (150489),       together wi t h other

                               fy
At a p p r o x i m a t e i y    12.00 noon a small              number       of N o tt i n g h a m Forest

supporters           took      up positions           on the S pion Kop and stood               in small

groups.          The atmos p h e re          from these        supporters was excellent.                 By

1.30pm      (1330),         the same date,             more supporters           had entered the Kop

and were         enjoying           the a tm os ph er e      of the a nt i ci p at e d football match,

then,     as     previously arranged,                  obtained a meal           from the West Yo rkshire

M obile C a n t e e n w hi ch was              situated a dj ac en t         to the east wall          of the
                                                                                                   PAGE         3
                                                                                                   S3415

G ym n a s i u m behind the N orth Stand,                 The meal    was   consumed    in the

Gymnasium.           After       finishing my meal         I returned to my a l l o c a te d duty at

Gate 3 on the S pi on Kop of the stadium,                          I immediately became aware

that     the number            of supporters       on the S pion Kop end of the ground had

increased and that                the a tm os p he r e was    of an electrical       and    carnival

nature.         Thro u g h the       fencing     I conversed wit h older N o tt i n g h a m Forest

supporters         regarding         the teams      recent W e mb l ey a pp ea r an c e and was

myself      enjoying           the friend ly atmosphere.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.50pm    (1350)   the same date,       a sit ua ti on arose which

caused me some             concern.        I was at my gate and was a p pr o a c h e d by a

number      of Liverpool           supporters who a t t e m p t e d to explain         that they were

f ri g h t e n e d because        they had been placed            in the wrong     end of the

stadium.          I inspected their            ticket stubs an d was sur pr is ed to discover

that     the tickets were               for that end of the ground.              1 then,    by radio,

the Liverpool            supporters        to be escorted to the L ep pings Lane end of

the ground because                the tickets      sold for that        location were       to the

lawful      limit.         I was     instructed thrift an overspill a re a had been

terraces       shouting Liverpool          chants and displaying a Liverpool                    banner.

I took this as not only stupid but downright                         dangerous and e n p v w $ d my

gate    to a p pr eh en d him.      This    I did with the help of Chief                 h y f BEAL

near to the overspill             are a and after         documentation,

must at this       point      request the        reader    to remember     the    incident

described.        From this m a n , I was          told that he had a t t e n d e d at the

g round with no ticket and had in fact                     purchased his            et outside          the

turnstiles       in Leppings Lane          for    the sum of £25 a^ra that he had

expected to be taken to the enclosure                      cosvtai ru'ng the Liverpool

s upporters after          entering    the N o tt i n g h a m Fj/rest enclosure.             This

information about            the ticket     tout was       immediately     passed to Ground

C o n t r o l . I then    returned to my duty         position and observed              that    the re

was a ho 1 iday a t m os ph er e with        inflatable       trees,    bananas and other             toys

being flaunted.            I, at this      time,    was    enjoying    the a tm os p he r e and saw

no    problems whatsoever.            In fact      it was a pleasure to be           in that

location.       To keep themsel ves amused,                prior   to the start      of the game,

the fans were knocking a beach ball along                      the    length of the S pi on Kop

and e v entually         it cleared the s ec urity fencing and              landed between the

advertising       hoardings and the goal             post netting.         I,    contrary       to the

proper ways       of behaviour        for a Police Officer            on duties such as these,

picked the ball          up and    placed it through my gate              into the S pion Kop.

An    immediate    cheer went       up and the game          continued.         I will    repeat      that

the a tm o s p h e r e was    of a holiday nature and              I must admit     I was       enjoying

the    duty.

At 3 . 00pm     (1300)     the m atch started and due to the               roar of the          crowd

and to the fact          that   I had not been        issued with a radio           earpiece,

I could not hear any            radio transmissions.               I sat on my foldable             seat

and    could hear garbled messages w h i c h to me was                  indistinguishable.

No    problems     of any nature were          felt    from my    location.      From my

position        I could see the Leppings Lane end of the ground a nd                      it seemed

that after Peter B E A R D S L E Y had n ar rowly m is s ed a goal             by glancing        the

crossbar        that Liverpool       supporters       had spilled out onto        the    playing

area.     A l t ho u gh   I could hear my       radio transmitting,          I could not

u nd er st an d any messages and t h o u g h t , as did the N o t ti n gh a m Forest

supporters,        that Liverpool         supporters     had    invaded the    playing     surface.

The    play was       stopped and as       previously      instructed,      whe n on the

perimeter        track,   all    officers    stand     in view of the       crowd and face them.

This    is to monitor          the tension and to attempt           to see where        trouble

might    occur,       From being a holiday atmo sp he re            on the S pi on Hop,      the

supporters        became ang r y , jeering,        swear i ng and boo i ng to show thei r

descent at what was             taking    place.      On glancing    towards     the L ep pi ng s Ln

end of the Stadium,             I could see     peopie     laid on the g r o u n d , peopie

climbing        the security fences a ss is t ed by police officers and csther

supporters        being    pulled    into the seated area w hich overl oo ke d the

t er raced standing area on that end of the ground.                         I immediately

realised that a serious              si t ua ti on had a ri s en and on glancing          back

towards        the Kop saw many       police officers          descending    the aisles     towards

my g a t e .    Due   to the noise of the          crowd    I had not heard any

instruction on my           radio.       The officers were        let onto the     playing

surface via my gate and              I was shor tl y joined by Chief           Ins jjfrEAL who     I

thought        had taken control         of the situation.         H e , havirW'to shout/, told

supporters and the Liverpool                supporters.         I , /q say the    least,    was

the terrible            disaster which unfolded.                I then became aware             that a

vast     number        of officers       had joined the Kop serial                from what       I be 1 ieve

were     outside        the groudd and          I was very relieved.              The a t mo sp he re was

wor se ni ng and n ea r l y        er*fpted with         persons       rushing to the gates when

a Liverpool              pport¥ r ran the full            length of the ground and

g e st ic ul at ed v io lently towards               the N o t ti n gh a m Forest     supporters        from

the goan. mouth.              He was     chased back by a police                officer and

a p p r eh e nd e d    inside    the Liverpool         half of the field.             This a pp re he n si o n

  relieved somewhat              the tension of the Kop and a ga in a cheer went                          up.

A further Liverpool               fan,   what     I w ou ld describe as           in his forties,

repeated the same man oe uv re                  but for some          reason this was laughed at                by

the Forest            supporters.

May    I say that,            time at this stage          time had no meaning             but   I was

sur pr is ed when a Liverpool                 supporter was          led past my position

o bv io us ly not        injured but being            f or ci bl y ejected from the ground.

This man was            the    supporter      I had earlier          ejected from the Stadium.

Although        concentrating           on the    crowd      in front        of m e , I did see an

a mb ulance      drive onto        the    playing      surface and           then became aware       that

Liverpool        supporters were             breaking     up a dv er t is e me n t   hoardings at         the

Leppings Lane            end of the ground and were                   gra du al ly moving       towards the

S p i on Kop.         A n u m b e r , well    over    100,    ran     the full     length of the

playing       surface and         I recall       thinking      that they were breaking              the

hoardings        to use as        stretchers.

I informed a press               camera-man to move           his expensive          equipment which

was    placed behind the hoarding at my                       location.         By this    time the

No tt in g ha m Forest          supporters       had become more             calm and w hen the first

of the      casualties were             being    carried off via the             ramp they       clapped.

The    running         supporters       by this time         had reached our         location and were

obv io us ly      in a state       of shock and began kicking                   fren::iedly at      the

                am bu la nc e and fire         personnel      were    now in a t t e n d a n c e .

                I will    repeat,       time       had no meaning and even             I was   becoming       emotionally

                upset and       in fear       of my own safety.              I will    be honest,      I did not think

                I was    going       to get away from that            location alive,          such was       the   panic

                and a n im os it y of the supporters who were                     transporting,        by this      time,

                dead bodies.           I heard a scream for a driver                   to take a badly         injured to

                hospital       and    I ran for an am bu la nc e         door.        At the door,     S er geant HARDY

                told me to keep going and that                   he w ou ld drive the vehicle.                 This    he

                did and    I then was a p p ro a ch e d by someone who said he was a doctor.                                   He

                as ke d me who was           in charge.        I was a b so l u t e l y stunned by his          remark          in

                the mayhem.           I am af ra id that        I was    rude and told him,            "anyone you             can

                see".     1 then told him,             "walking w o un de d were against              the wall,       dead

                were    behind the          police bus and people             in a prone       position might         be

                breathing".           The    doctor a p ol o gi s ed and       immediately set to his task.

time    shaking,      sweating a nd totally e x h a u s t e d / ^ I        couldn't      stand still

 On my way back            to the area where Ihg^ d e jm          and dying were         I saw a

y outh who     I   r ecognised as a S p e c i al J#i-ns t a b l e .      He had his shirt on

but his uniform trousers w e re - c o m p l e t e l y           ripped from the w a is tb an d to

the turn up.          He was       in a             of semi    consciousness and         I must admit

that    in a ki nd of           panic.    A    grabbed him by the shirt          f ront and     lifted

him into     the     p o 1 i c e / r o a m where a blanket was      placed a r ou n d h i m .

T og e t h e r with PC HUUlEY,            we   pul led and    carried him to an amb ul an ce and

again    left him         in^he     care of amb ul an ce       personnel.       All    the time    I was

s c r e a m i n g , "bre^ethe,     keep breathing" .          Dead we re still        be i ng brought

to the    rear a /        the    stand but thank God the          carriers knew that they

were    dead and a l t h o u g h they were           shocked and    irate,      I, at    this stage,

felt as though            I was    calming      down and     regaining   some    control myself.

P r o blems arose with the               lack of space at the entrance            to the G y mn as iu m

door and s upporters              tempers again got frayed.              I can only describe

that    trying      to get a body on a stretcher with 20 people                        carrying    the

stretcher      caused ma y he m and a gain            I felt    fear for my own safety.             In

my exh a u s t e d state         it was all      I could do but to help          carry the dead

inside the building.                The    number    of bodies    inside was      horrendous and

a 1 though we know that there were a lot of d e a d , that sight will                             haunt

me for the         rest    of my    life.       I nterscaped with the       carrying of the

dead,    first aid was        given to the other             injured and       I gave    cigarettes

to deeply a f f ec t ed and shocked s upporters and helpers who were                             sat       in

disbelief.        I, by this time,           was    in need of a drink          of water and as             I

obtained    this water which was situa te d by the side of the                           prison,          but

I saw that       the juvenile        contingent       of the St.       Johns A mb ulance Brigade

had been placed         inside     that bus for their own safety.                     I was glad they

were    there    but to mar this,           a dead person,          covered,    was directly by

the door.        I felt upset and deeply              regretted that          the    children had to

see this    carnage.         Eventually,       and at what          time God only knows,             the

support    services     gained       control and the total             panic of the situation

subsided.        I wa nt ed to throw awa y my uniform and                    run away.     I was

totally exhausted,           a lt ho ug h   I could not stand still.                 When the    last of

what    I w ou ld describe as the walking w o un d ed                 left    by ambulance,          I

w a l k e d down the    ramp towards         the    playing area a nd wept a tear               of

relief    that all     the    crowd had gone home.                 It is hard for me to admit

that whilst       the disaster was taking              place,       I felt    fear    for myself and

guilt at    feeling     this     fear and to see            no   crowd was,     in some way,          a

selfish    relief.       I then went         into    the Gyrnnasiurn, not because           1' wanted

to but to keep busy,            possibly helping with               identif ic at io n of someone

but    things were      in the     charge     of the major          incident    group and       rather

than    pester anyone        there    I went outside.              The sight    in there was

horrendous.

People    by this      time were asking about               persons    they had       come with and a

table was       set up in the N orth S ta nd where a long queue                       had formed.

This    point was ma nn ed and we were               then told that anyone who had

nothing    to do was      to sit      in the N or th Stand.

Some    kind of d e-briefing          took place and myself,             together       with other

officers were       stood down from the ground and were                       told to go to

N i ag ar a Sports Club.         This we did and a l t h ou g h         I was to be on duty

from that       time and until        1.00am       (0100)    the    following morning       I had 2

stiff    drinks.            A lt ho u gh    these drinks     relaxed me somewhat,           I sat

outside        on the wall adjacent                 to the entrance      steps and tried to

reflect and admit                 just what had happened.              This was    impossible,       so I

made a telephone message                     to my daughter       to the effect      that    I wanted

her to bring my vehicle                     to Niag ar a   from where     I had    left    it at her

b oyfriend's          home.        This     she    did and on her arrival      she enquired          as to

whether        I had tele ph on ed home.               I had not and felt      a ga in      guilty and

tearful        for    not doing so.

Whilst        sat    there,       a Liverpool        s upporter   of about   18 years       came up to

us and a sk ed how to get to Colley Roa d C at ho l ic School                         where    his    party

had    left their           transport.            I tried to expl ai n the quickest way to walk

a nd finally told my daughter and her                        b oyfriend to take him there.

This    they did a nd             I sat on my own very quiet and taking                   stock of

thi n g s .

During    this        period       I was     joined by PC GR O O H E and was        spoken to by Ins

S Y K E S and Supt GREENWAY.                  I could not face going         inside       the Club

because        I did not want              to hear a ny th in g about what had happened.                I

did after           some    time and on the           return of my daughter,         I continued my

tour    of duty until              1.00am     (0100)    wit h PC G R O O M E but   in all    honesty, I

cannot        recall       what    duties     I    performed.

This    is a true and accurate                     account   of what   I recall a nd        I sign it       so.

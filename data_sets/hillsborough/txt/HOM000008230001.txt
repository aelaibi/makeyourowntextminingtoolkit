Dear Lord Ferrers

                              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TR A G ED Y            NX
                                          JUDICIAL EN Q U IR Y
                                                                          fU             v*

      The recent meeting of the Police Consultative C o m m itte e fo r the J2 Sub
Division of the West Midlands Police A u th o r ity was concerned to learn of the
possibility th a t a l l , or p art, of the huge costs of the Judicial Enquiry into the
HilIsborough tragedy may be borne by the West Midlands Police A u th o rity .

        I understand th a t you received a delegation fro m the West Midlands Police
A u th o r ity on 25th May 1989 and th a t, whilst an undertaking was given th a t no
costs would be incurred by the A u th o r ity , no decision has yet been published
w ith regard to the present drain on the resources of the West Midlands Police,
both fin a n c ia lly and in term s of manpower.

      We are concerned th a t the e ffe c ts of this enquiry are already being f e l t
in the manpower losses w ith in the relatively smalI area of B rie rley H ill and any
long te rm financial dislocation w ill have f u r t h e r e ffe c ts on the amount of
overtim e available to cover the policing w ith in our area.

     I would be most grateful i f you would consider this m a tte r w ith some
urgency in order to bring a speedy resolution to the problems.


                                            Yours sincerely

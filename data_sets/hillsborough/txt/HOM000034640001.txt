    Thank you for your further letter of 10 June.

    The responsibility for considering complaints and allegations
against police officers of the rank of Assistant Chief Constable
and above lies with the police authority for the area concerned,
in this case the South Yorkshire Police Authority, and not with
the Home Secretary.


    It would be wrong for me to become involved in any complaints
about the activities of officers of the South Yorkshire Police,
whatever their rank. This is because if a police officer is
disciplined, he or she has a right of appeal to the Home
Secretary. I can only be seen to be impartial in the hearing of
an appeal if I have not been previously involved in the case.

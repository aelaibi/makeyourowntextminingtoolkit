Dear Mr Dickinson

I am writing to thank you for your letter of 18 December 1989 and
to confirm the details of our telephone call on 22 December.

As I explained then, the Technical Working Group, set up under
the chairmanship of Professor L Maunder, one of two Assessors to
the Inquiry, has met on a number of occasions since October and
is now concluding its work.  Its members have a wide range of
engineering experience and a number are closely involved in the
practical application and administration of legislation relating
to safety at sports grounds.

The Working Group was invited by Lord Justice Taylor "to review
technical aspects of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds;
identify areas requiring clarification or amendment;  and
recommend accordingly." I indicated that if there was anything
you wished to contribute, the group would, of course, be prepared
to consider it but that I would need to receive it in writing as
soon as possible.

I hope this is helpful, but if you have any other queries, please
do not hesitate to contact me on 01 273 2370.

                                        Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,
                                                                  ;   'i
 )ur Company has ten years experience in Barrier Testing, both in design and
"manufacture of Testing Equipment, and in the provision of a complete Barrier Testing
 Service, yeilding quantative data which enables the owners of sports grounds, or their
 technical advisors, to monitor the condition of barriers and retaining walls and to
 decide on corrective action to preserve public safety.

The Gilmat Barrier Testers incorporate a number of design features which have evolved
from our practical experience, ensuring that test results can be read without difficulty
or ambiguity, that the results can be recorded as they are taken, and that readings
and records can be made tamper proof.  We share the view of owners and engineering
advisors alike that third party testing offers significant advantages.

From our discussions with the administrators of sports grounds, and with civil and
structural engineers, and architects,  it is clear that the "Green Code (1986)",
The Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, and the procedures for issuing and controlling
Safety Certificates needs improvement.

We are willing to contribute to appropriate work, parties set up and suggest such
improvements, and to provide knowledge of our first hand experience in this field.




Yours faithfully,
Gilmat Engineering L t d . ,




S. Dickninson.

THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION AT THE LEPPINGS LN ENTRANCE A POLICE OFFICER WAS
TRYING TO HELP BUT HE WAS GETTING CRUSHED THIS WAS ABOUT 1455HRS
THERE WAS A BLUE CONCERTINA GATE TO THE LEFT OF LEPPINGS LN SOMEONE OPENED IT
AND WE WENT TROUGH THE CROWD HAD BEEN SHOUTING FOR THIS GATE TO BE OPENED
I SAW 6 MOUNTED POLICE TRYING TO PREVENT THE CROWD GOING THROUGH BUT THE
CROWD JUST PUSHED THROUGH ON ANYWAY
THERE WERE NO STEWARDS
WE WALKED THROUGH THE OPENED GATE WITHOUT ANYONE CHECKING MY TICKET I THINK
THAT 2000 PEOPLE CAME THROUGH THAT GATE WHEN I DID I WAS CARRIED AWAY IN IT
THE STAND THAT I GOT TO WAS VIRTUALLY EMPTY BUT I COULD SEE THAT BEHIND THE
GOALPOSTS IN THE WEST STAND PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED I THINK I SAW SOME OF
THEM DIE
NOONE CHECKED MY TICKET I STILL HAVE IT INTACT

I WASN'T ABLE TO GET STRAIGHT TO MY SEAT AS PEOPLE WERE GASPING FOR BREATH.
ALL THE SUPPORTERS WERE SCREAMING FOR SOMEONE TO OPEN THE GATE. MY FATHER
GOT IN JUST BEFORE ME AND WE WERE BOTH TRYING TO GET OUR BREATH. WE BOTH RAN
TO OUR SEATS. I WAS RIGHT AT THE VERY BACK OF THE NORTH STAND. WE STARTED
TO^gATCH THE GAME AND DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNTIL I SAW
PeIPLE BEING PULLED UP OVER THE TERRACES. WE STAYED THERE 'TILL ABOUT 4.20 -
4.30 AND THEN WE WALKED OUT THE GROUND THE SAME WAY WE GOT IN.
I MENTIONED MY FRIEND,                      I HAVEN'T GOT HIS ADDRESS BUT I'LL

THE POLICE WERE TRYING VERY HARD TO RESCUE   THE PEOPLE. A PARTICULAR OFFICER,
PC 159 WAS TRYING TO RESCUE A SMALL BOY,HE   WAS GIVING MOUTH TO MOUTH AND A
LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER WAS KICKING HIS HELMET   AROUND. EVEN THOUGH ALL THIS WAS
HAPPENING ONE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER RAN PAST   THE OFFICERS AND BEGAN STICKING
HIS FINGERS UP AT THE NOTTS FANS WHICH MAY   HAVE CAUSED EVEN MORE CHAOS.

LACK OF ORGANISATION. I COULD SEE THE CONCERTINA GATES BEING PUSHED IN FROM
WHAT I THINK WAS THE PORESSURE FROM PEOPLE OUTSIDE. I SAID TO THE POLICEMAN
NOT TO OPEN THE GATE AS THERE WERE ALOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE WITHOUT
TICKETS. I THEN WENT TO MY OWN SEAT AS THE POLICEMAN TOLD ME TO SHUT UP OR HE
    jD LOCK ME UP. I DID NOT ACTUALLY GET TO MY SEAT UNTIL APPROX 3.05PM THE
      HAD STARTED LIVERPOOL HIT THE BAR AND THEN ALL HELL LET LOOSE BEHIND THE
GOAL AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END. I FIRST THOUGHT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THAT
FIGHTING WAS BREAKING OUT BUT REALISED SOME 20 MINS LATER IT WAS ALOT MORE
SERIOUS. I WAS ACTUALLY SAT ALMOST DOWN BY THE SPOIN KOP.

YEAR WERE INFACT USED LAST YEAR TO ALLOW A BETTER FLOW OF PEOPLE INTO THE
GROUND. THE SIGNS OUTSIDE THE GROUND ARE VERY CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD TO
GO INTO THE NORTH STAND AND ONCE INSIDE, THERE WAS NOONE TO TELL YOU THE WAY.
I WISH TO SAY THAT THE POLICE WERE VERY HELPFUL, BUT THERE WAS DEFINATELY A
LACK OF COMMUNICATION WHICH RESULTED IN OFFICERS BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
FIELD, WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASSISTING WITH THE INJURED. ONCE THE
TRAGEDY HAD OCCURRED, THERE WAS NOTHING PUT ACROSS THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM
T q f ELL FANS WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
I ATTENDED THE MATCH WITH 4 OTHER PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES ARE AS FOLLOWS, I DO NOT

THEIR DETAILS. WHEN I GOT TO THE TURNSTILE THERE WAS ONE MASSIVE CRUSH TO
GET THROUGH THEM. THE MAN NEXT TO ME WHO I WAS FORCED AGAINST CRACKED HIS
RIBS AND WAS SCREAMING IN PAIN, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ANYONE COULD DO TO HELP
HIM AS WE WERE ALL TIGHTLY PACKED IN. THERE WAS ALSO AN OLD MAN WHO WAS ABOUT
TO FALL DOWN WHEN HE SHOUTED ' PLEASE DON'TLET ME GO DOWN' AND WE HELPED HIM
UP. THERE WAS A POLICEWOMAN RIGHT BY THE TURNSTILE AND THERE WAS NOTHING SHE
COULD DO,SHE HAD TO COME INSIDE WITH US AS SHE WAS GETTING CRUSHED AGAINST
THE WALL AND WE HELPED HER IN. ONCE I HAD GOT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE IT WAS
E * FOR ME TO GET TO MY SEAT. I GOT TO MY SEAT JUST AS THEGAME WAS ABOUT TO

THE LEPPINGS LANE END GOAL AND I ALSO SAW BODIES BEING PASSED OVER.

IN TO GROUND. WHEN I GOT IN TO THE GROUND I SAW 12 POLICE OFFFICERS STANDING
AROUND DOING NOTHING. MY FRIEND WENT OVER TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS GOING ON,
THE PRESSURE WAS COMPLETELY UNBEARABLE. THE POLICE OFFICERS ARRESTED MY
MATE. BUT STILL DID NOTHING TO HELP.
              THE POLICE THOUGH IT WAS A PUBLIC ORDER SITUTATION THAT WHY
THEY DID NOTHING TO HELP.

THERE APPEARED TO BE TOTAL LACK OF SUPERVISION ON THE BEHALF OF THE
POLICE,THE POOR OFFICERS APPEARED TO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON DUE TO
THE LACK OF SUPERVISION BY SUPERVISORY RANKS. THE POLICE APPEARED TO BE
DEPLOYED IN THE WRONG AREAS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT PREVIOUS MATCHES
HAVE BEEN LIKE.
ANOTHER THING I NOTICED WAS THAT THE PERSONAL ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS NOT WORKING
YOU COULD NOT HEAR A THING AND MAYBE IF THAT HAD BEEN FUNCTIONING AND HAD
BEEN USED CORRECTLY IT WOULD HAVE HELPED A GREAT DEAL AND EVERYBODY WOULD
HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON.

AS A PERSON WHO GOES TO A LOT OF FOOTBALL GAMES, I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE
FILLED EACH PEN PROPERLY, BUT ONLY THE CENTRE PENS WERE FULL, AND WAS GETTING
OVERCROWDED EVEN THEN. THERE SEEMED TO BE A GENERAL LACK OF INFORMATION AND
NO REQUEST FOR PEOPLE TO BE CALM, AND POLICE MARCHED ONTO THE PITCH AND STOOD
IN FRONT OF OUR STAND. WE WERE VERY ANGRY THAT THEY WERE JUST STANDING THERE
AND NOT GOING TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUFFERING. THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY
POLICE JUST STANDING IN A LINE WATCHING THE NORTH STAND. THEY ARE TRAINED IN
FIRST AID - THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING THE INJURED.

INFO      » I TOOK MY SEAT AT ABOUT TEN TO THREE. THE GAME KICKED OFF AT
            THREE. NOTTS FOREST HAD JUST GONE BACK TOWARDS THE LIVERPOOL END,
            WHEN LIVERPOOL HIT THE CROSSBAR. I COULD SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER
            THE FENCES BEHIND THE GOAL, AND THE REFEREE STOPPED THE MATCH.
            MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SPILLED ONTO THE PITCH FROM THE LEPPINGS
            LANE END AND STRATED TO FILL THE PITCH AT THAT END OF THE GROUND.

SHORTLY AFTER THAT, A LIVERPOOL LAD WITH LONG HAIR, RAN TOWARDS THE FOREST
END AND STARTED GESTICULATING AT THE FOREST FANS, BUT THE POLICE CAUGHT UP
WITH HIM. THEN A NUMBER OF OTHER LIVERPOOL FANS DID THE SAME THING, BUT THE
POLICE WERE STRUNG OUT IN FRONT OF THE FOREST END, TO KEEP THE LIVERPOOL FANS
AWAY FROM THE FOREST FANS. WITHIN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, THE FIRST AMBULANCE
DROVE UP TO THE LEPPINGS LANE END AND REMAINED THERE FOR ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN
MINUTES BEFORE IT GOT THROUGH THE CROWD AND OFF THE GROUND. ONE STRANGE THING
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WAS WHY THE LARGE CONTINGENT OF POLICE OFFICERS ALONG THE
S ^ k TOUCHLINES (NOT THE ONES IN THE CENTRE CONTROLLING THE FANS), DOING
NOTHING TO HELP OR CONTROL THE FANS. FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES INTO THE
INCIDENT, THEY WERE JUST STANDING THERE. I COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING PULLED UP
INTO THE WEST STAND TO ESCAPE THE CRUSH. I LEFT THE GROUND AT ABOUT THREE
THIRTY, BUT AGAIN, THERE WERE A COUPLE OF LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS WHICH
WERE BARELY AUDIBLE, AND AT NO TIME DID THEY ASK FOR ANY MEDICALLY OR FIRST
AID TRAINED PEOPLE TO ASSIST.
I AM FULLY TRAINED IN FIRST AID AND IF I HAD KNOWN THE EXTENT OF THE DISASTER
I WOULD HAVE GONE TO ASSIST BUT I HAD NO WAY WHATSOEVER WHAT HAD OCCURRED.
I STILL HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING - I COULD HAVE HELPED.
WHEN I LEFT THE GROUND I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA THAT EVEN ONE PERSON HAD
DIED.

OVERWHELMED AND I DONT THINK THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IN PARTICULAR
 I THINK A LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER RAN ACROSS THE PITCH TO THE NOTTS SIDE TO LET
THEM KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE POLICE SEEMED MORE CONCERNED WITH HIM THAN
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE TERRACES. THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION
WITH THE CLUB OFFICIALS AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL ABOUT 1 HOUR LATER THAT THE
iLIVERPOOL MANAGER CAN ON THE INTERCOM AND TOLD THE FANS TO KEEP CALM AND NOT
•PANIC. THE MEDICAL AID EQUIPMENT WAS INADEQUATE AND THE ST JOHNS AMBULANCE
PERSONAL WERE THIN ON THE GROUND. I WAS WITH MY FRIEND

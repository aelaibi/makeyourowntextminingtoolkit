overcrowding              and      our    emergency          pla ns        ar e    frequently             updated.

I go       not     negotiate         with       the    football            asociation           in       respect          of

perimeter           fences         but    deal      with     the      local        police       and       Brent          Council.

As    a    result        of    the   Hillsborough               Disaster           a decision            wa s       made       that      the

pe riitie t er      fences would               be   removed        for      t hi s    years         FA Cup          Final       between

Everton           and Liverpol.                I had      hoped       that        on t h i s    occasion             the       f an s

would       have     conformed            to    everybodys            request         to    stay         off    the       pitch         but

this      wa s     not    the      c a s e , at     the    end     of      the     game     about         two       hundred         fans

.came      onto     the       pit chi a n d o n c e       the    FA Cup was               pre sente d more                came      o nt o

This       w as    despite         the    efforts         of a b o u t      1200      s t e w a r d s . I formally

believe           that    s o me     form      of   dsterant          is    required           to    prevent

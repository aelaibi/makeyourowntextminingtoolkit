I,     GRAHAM        HENRY      MACKRELL,    of.
                                      WILL SAY:-


My date of birth is __________________               \



I am employed as the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club.       My employment history is as follows


After completing my O-levels at school I joined Thornton Baker
(as      they       were then known), a firm of Accountants,               at    their
Bournemouth office.                  I qualified as an Accountant and became a
Fellow of the Association of Certified Accountants in 1976.


In     the interim I left Thornton Baker in about August 1974                           to
join       the      staff       of   Bournemouth Football    Club,     and      I     was
appointed Club Secretary shortly after that.


At     that time Bournemouth were a Third Division Club but                           they
were       in fact relegated to the Fourth Division the year                        after
I     joined        them.        The facilities at the Club     were       therefore
fairly        basic, but when the Safety of Sports Grounds Act                        1975
 ("the       Act")         became     law I was aware of it and of      the         Green
Guide        that         was   subsequently issued.      The Club   was        not     of
course         a designated Club within the terms of the Act                    because
of     its status, but certainly work done at the Club thereafter
had      regard to the provisions of the Act and the Green                       Guide.
One      of the Directors of Bournemouth F.C. at that time was                          an
Architect,            and he took a lead part in organising            alterations
and       improvements to the Ground, but I worked closely with him
throughout that time.
                                                     -    2 -




In    November’ 1981                following            an.    approach      from         Luton        Town
Football Club I resigned my position at Bournemouth and became
Secretary        to Luton Town F.C.                      I remained with that Club until
I    resigned in November 1986, and virtually immediately there­
after     joined Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in my                                          present
position.                                                       - -


When I joined Luton Town Football Club they were in the Second
Division       -and      won the Second Division championship that                                      year
becoming       promoted to the First Division.                              At that time            First
and     Second Division Clubs were designated under the Act,                                             and
as    Secretary          to      the Club I had                 responsibility             for     safety
matters.            As        such       I    was    the        Club's      representative                at
meetings       of        the Committee set up by the Local Authority                                     for
the     purpose          of     licensing            the       Ground     under       the        Act.      I
reported        on       safety          matters         to     the     Board,       and     the        Club
retained        a firm of Consulting Architects who dealt                                    with        all
matters        relating             to       safety requirements.             I      dealt        with     a
particular           Partner in that Architectural Practice, one Philip
Dodd     who     would          inspect' the Ground and the facilities                              on     a
regular         basis          to        ensure      that       we    did    comply         with         the
requirements of the Act and the Green Guide.


When     I joined Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as                                       Secretary
the     Club     had already an estabished system for                                 dealing           with
safety     matters, licensing by the Local Authority and require­
ments     of     the          Act and the Green Guide generally.                             The        Club
retained         Consulting                  Engineers,          Eastwood        &   Partners,           who
performed        the          same        role      for        Sheffield     Wednesday            as     the
Architects retained by Luton Town F.C. had performed for them.
Similarly        in       my        position as Secretary I am                       in    effect        the
Chief     Executive             of the Club, and I have overall                            control        of
safety matters reporting to the Board on that as well as other
topics connected with the running of the Club.


Since       my       appointment               the       composition        of       the    Board         of
Directors        has not changed.                    The Chairman is Mr. Herbert McGee
and      there        are 6 other Board members.         They       are in     effect        a
non-executive            Board who take nonetheless a close interest                        in
the      affairs        of     the    Club and    who   regularly          attend     Board
meetings.             Thereare regularBoard meetings, perhaps 9                     each
y.ear.         The Club is, *to my knowledge, a little unusual in that
the      members        of the Board betweeii-^hem hold only 4.8% of                       the
issued         share     capital and there is in fact no                  single    entity
who      has        anything     approaching      control of        the    Club.       Each
member         of     theBoard,       in his     non-executive       capacity,        takes
special         responsibility          for a particular activity.             Thus        for
example         Matthew Sheppard, the Vice-Chairman, is an Accountant
and      responsible           for     financial matters.          Keith     Addy     is     a
builder/developer              with     responsibility       for     the     Ground        and
premises.


Insofar as the full time management'of the Club is concerned I
am assisted by 6 departmental heads as follows


         Position                                Name of Person

         Team Manager                            Ron Atkinson

         Commercial Manager                      Bob Gorrill

         Lottery Manager                         Tony Rosse

         Administration Manager                  Sharon Lane (responsible for
                                                 the office and ticket office)

         Sports Hall Manager                     Neil Graham

         Catering Manager                        Steve Russell (through Compass
                                                 Services)

         Maintenance Manager                     Ron Ward


Douglas         Lock has special responsibility for security matters.
I have seen and read a copy of the Statement he has already
prepared, and it accurately describes his position and role as
Chief of Security.     He has primary responsibility for the
recruitment, training and supervision of Stewards and Gatemen.
I     am   aware        of     the fact that      Stewards     are        given     written
instructions             at     the commencement of each Season, as                 to    the
duties        they are required to perform etc.                   Furthermore, at the
start        of    each Season, Mr. Lock organises training                      evenings.
There were 2 successive training evenings for the commencement
of      the         1988/89          Season,     on   one   of   which      there        were
instructions, demonstrations etc. "J.%id;on for Stewards, and on
the     second          evening for Gatemen, Car Park Attendants and                      the
like.         I    was present throughout the first of those                      evenings
and for part of the second evening but I had to leave early on
the second evening to attend a Board meeting.                            At the training
evening video films dealing with emergency procedures etc. and
produced          by one of the country's Police Forces were shown, as
well as demonstrations given on First Aid techniques, mouth to
mouth        resuscitation             etc. and talks also by the Fire              Brigade
personnel as well as Mr. Lock himself.


I     have        always considered Douglas Lock to be a very able                         and
reliable Security Officer, perhaps uniquely experienced in the
sense        that he was previously a Superintendent with the                            South
Yorkshire Police Force in which capacity he had a good deal of
responsibility for supervising the policing of Sheffield
Wednesday           Football           Ground at Hillsborough.       He is a man          who
has written and had published articles on policing of football
matches           and        because     of his background he has also            been      of
assistance to me in liaison with the South Yorkshire Police.


Ron      Ward           is     the     Club    Caretaker    in   charge     of      general
maintenance.                  He has been with the Club some 40 years and                   is
in     fact        approaching retirement.              Essentially he carries             out
running           repairs of a maintenance nature, and will often carry
out     small           works        requested    by Mr.    Eastwood.       He    has      the
assistance of 2 men who work in his team, Sean Hardy and Barry
Monks and there are also about 10 cleaners who are employed on
a regular part-time basis.


The     Groundsman is David Barber, and he has a number of                               staff
working with him in keeping the pitch in good condition.
In    my     capacity             as Secretary to the Club                I    have        executive
responsibility effectively for the overall organisation of the
Club's       activities.                As      such I am the       person         with         overall
responsibility                for       safety matters,, and liaise directly                       with
the     Working            Party        set     up    under;=the    aegis          of     the     Local
Authority.              This        Working Party consists              of      representatives
from        the        Police          and     Fire    Brigade,     and        also       from        the
Surveyors/Structural                          Engineers'       Department                 and         the
Environmental                Health          Department    of the       City        of     Sheffield
(formerly              the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County                             Council).
These      meetings              are held on an annual basis for the                        purposes
of     licensing the Club under the Safety of Sports Grounds                                          Act
1975,       and the Safety Committee make a thorough inspection                                        of
the     Ground          each year for that purpose.                  In the             past,     those
inspections                would        normally       take ...place      in       about        August.
However          in     1988 we brought the inspection forward to May                                  of
that       year, and the same is happening this year, the intention
being       to        give       the     Club plenty of time            to      carry       out       any
necessary             work that          might        be required as acondition                  of
issuing the License.


Prior       to         theannual meeting of the Safety                       Committee           it    is
usually          the       practice           for Eastwood & Partners to                  carry       out
their own thorough inspection of the Ground to make sure that,
so     far       as we can, it is in first class condition before                                     the
Safety Committee inspect.                        In fact as part of that process the
Consulting             Engineer will issue a Certificate confirming their
inspection,                and     they are also required to carry out                          certain
tests - for example tests on crush barriers.


If     Eastwood             & Partners, upon carrying out their                          inspection,
came       across           any matters upon which they needed a decision                               I
would        be the person with whom they would liaise at the                                     Club.
Similarly                  if there was          any    member     of        the        Club     staff,
including              Mr.Lock, who thought that there                       was        some     matter
relating              to     the       structural       integrity       of      the       Ground       or
                                                   -   6 -




otherwise          relating to the Green Guide or the Act, they                               would
draw    it to my attention and I would then deal with Eastwood &
Partners.          Thus, for example, Douglas Lock would not                            normally
have    direct contact with the Consulting Engineers -                                  anything
he had to do or say would be done through me.                                                           ,


I am also primarily responsible for--liaison with the Police in
relation          to the policing of matches at the Ground.                         The        Club
signs       an     annual          Contract with the            South     Yorkshire       Police
Authority          for the provision of Police Officers on match days.
There        is     an    annual          meeting       called     by     the    Police        with
representatives               of     all 5 Yorkshire Clubs who come under                       the
jurisdiction             of        the     South       Yorkshire       Police.     They          are
Sheffield           Wednesday,             Sheffield         United,     Doncaster       Rovers,
Rotherham          and Barnsley F.C.               At that meeting there is usually
a     general       discussion relating to policing and football,                                and
it     is     invariably my practice to attend with a member of                                  the
Board       of Directors. In addition to that annual meeting                                  there
is     regular        liaison            with the Police throughout              the     Season.
Thus,       for example, when the Fixture List is published in June
of     each       year I send a copy to the Police for                          their    comment
prior       to     commencement             of     the Season and they           may     have       a
particular           request         in     relation to matches            on     the    Fixture
List.         I     recall,         for     example, that last Season               we    had       a
fixture           against Newcastle United on Boxing Day and the Police
asked       us to bring the kick-off forward to 12 noon and we                                   did
so.         I do not recall them giving a particular reason for that
-     the position is that if the Police, with their knowledge of
policing           matters, ask me to co-operate with them in                            relation
to     particular matches I will always attempt to do so in every
way     possible and I would not, for example, require a detailed
explanation           from         them     as in that instance, as to                  why    they
wished a particular change to be made.


For     matches played at Hillsborough the Police Liaison Officer
(Inspector           Sewell)         would normally contact me a week or                        more
before        the match was to take place.                      For a normal match where

                                                                                               .. / . •

an     unusual      crowd was not expected the contact would be                              made
probably       to     find      out such details as              which    turnstiles           we
intended       to     open, what time they were to be opened                          etc.     so
that     he     could      be    sure     that     our     plans     for       manning        the
turnstiles          and      stewarding      the        Ground     complied         with      his
knowledge        of arrival times for vi&|ting fans etc.                           If it were
a particularly large match where we--would expect, for example,
a     large number of Away supporters- as well as Home                             supporters
then     the degree of liaison will naturally increase as a                                  good
deal     of more detailed planning has' to go into the policing of
it     from the point of view of providing extra Police                               Officers
and,     from       the Club's point of view, deployment of                         Stewards.
Inspector           Sewell      is     assisted     in     his     liaison         duties      by
Detective        Constable Charlesworth stationed at Hammerton                               Road
Police     Station, and I would have a degree of contact with him
as     well.        For example it would be-my normal practice,                            prior
to     a Home fixture, to speak to the Secretary of the                               visiting
Club     for     informationas to the number of Away                           fans     to     be
expected       having regard to their ticket sales etc. and I would
pass that information on to the Police to assist them in their
planning.


The     average       gate      this year at Hillsborough has                   been       about
20,000     fans.          For    the     normal     or     average       attendance           the
Contract       with       the Police will lay down the number of                        Police
Officers         who are deployed.                 That    number        can       however     be
increased        at     the discretion            of the PoliceAuthority                if    a
particularly heavy gate is expected, for example, or indeed if
the     Away fans are expected to be unruly.                       Where the number is
being increased it is not the practice of the Police Authority
to     discuss and agree with me beforehand how many extra Police
they     will involve.           I have never required them to agree extra
numbers         with me or              queried a Police invoicefor manning -the
invoice        is in fact related tothe size of the gate as set                               out
in     the Contract with them, save for some matches such as                                  the
F.A.     Cup     semi-final, which would be charged on                         a    different
basis.         The Accounts for the Club indicate that for the                               year
                                                 -    b -



ended     May 1988 the Club paid a total of £97,731 to the                                South
Yorkshire Police for policing the .Ground.                          Of that sum a total
of     £39,800 related to the policing costs of the 1988 F.A. Cup
semi-final between Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C.


I- am aware of the fact that the South Yorkshire Police draw up
an     operational          plan for each Hoirfe-game at" Hillsborough                         and
they do not normally provide a copy of that plan to a Club.                                      I
have however in the past asked for one if only out of interest
to      see     how       they        organise       the    deployment    of     Police         in
controlling crowds, and when I have asked I have been provided
with a copy.


In     my dealings with the Police over the years, in relation to
Hillsborough          policing,            I   would say that they have              made       it
plain     that        they regarded the function of Stewards                        from       the
Club     as     directing people to their seats, and                      manning          gates
around        the Ground.             They very much regarded the Police                   being
in     charge of crowd control generally, both inside and outside
the     Ground,           and indeed the written instructions to                     Stewards
which     we        issue every year take these factors                      into    account.
They     were       drafted by Douglas Lock and approved by me, and                              I
have     no     doubt           he    drafted them having           regard     to    his       own
experience           as     a        Superintendent         with   the   South      Yorkshire
Police.


I     would say that in my experience in the context of                              policing
within        the     Ground, the Police are most concerned                         about      the
question        of segregating Home and Away fans.                       It is my         belief
that they regard that as the primary means by which they avoid
crowd trouble.


There     are        contingency plans agreed with the^Police, to                           deal
with     an emergency situation at the Ground. Arrangements                                 with
the     Police        basically           cover evacuation of the Ground                  in    an
emergency           and     all        Stewards are trained in           that       procedure.
Their     task        is        simply     to man and open the           gates       to     allow
people       out of the Ground in an orderly                   fashion.            Beforeeach
game     the         Police meet with the Rieferee and discuss                         with him
the    emergency procedures which would be involved in                                 stopping
the    game        and evacuating the Ground.                 To my knowledge                these
emergency            procedures              have been tested during match days, to
ensure       that     they work properly, ..ji.Qfi. the test procedure                          will
involve        the    broadcast of a message? over the tannoy,                          by       the
Police       Operator,        which will act as a signal to the                        Stewards
and    the      Police Officers to take their positions for                             dealing
with     an emergency situation.                      In that context I would explain
that     the       tannoy system is one where the Police Control                                Room
has    the      ability       to     operate it as well             as       the    Club        Disc
Jockey/Announcer,             but the Police have an override facility so
that     they can cut across any announcements being made by                                     the
Club     Disc        Jockey     in       order to       broadcast        a    message.           The
procedure            for emergencies involves the Police control of the
tannoy         system     and        I       cannot    envisage     a        situation       where
emergency          messages would be broadcast by Club staff.                            If, for
example,        I became aware of an emergency which necessitated                                  a
tannov       announcement,               I    would report that to the              Police        so
that     they        could make the announcement, rather than                          make       it
myself.


As to contingency plans for coping with spectators coming into
the Ground, this is done on specific occasions when the Police
would     be       aware that visiting supporters who may have an                                all
ticket        arrangement, might have a contingent arriving                              without
tickets        or,     for    example, where they might                      expect    a        large
number        of     spectators to arrive who would be seeking                             to    pay
cash     at        the turnstiles.              They would then         have       arrangements
with     us for turnstiles to be opened to admit such                                 spectators
or,     in     the     case     of an all ticket match,                  they      would         have
arrangements           made     to remove spectators without tickets                             from
the     vicinity of the Ground.                    That, for example, happened very
recently with “the Middlesbrough game where the space available
for     Middlesbrough           supporters was severely restricted due                             to
the     closure        of the west stand area following the                           events       on

15th       April.            The Police anticipated there might be a lot                             of
Middlesbrough                supporters and had contingency plans in                          place,
to     my knowledge, to hold spectators arriving without                                     tickets
at     a     nearby Police sports ground.                       Other than that I am                not
aware of any other contingency -plans to deal with the question
of a mass of spectators arriving fpj: ’entrance such as happened
at the semi-final on 15th April.


I     have       stated that Stewards are instructed to man                             all        exit
gates        from the Ground, but the exception to that is the gates
in     the       perimeter fencing which allow access onto the                                pitch.
During        the period that I have been with Sheffield Wednesday I
cannot        remember any instance where those gates were manned by
Stewards          - it is Police who are normally stationed along                                   the
perimeter and I believe that the numbers of people standing on
the     perimeter            would         be     kept as low as        possible        to        avoid
obstructing the view of spectators behind the fence.                                     I cannot
remember              however        any        instance     where     there     was         express
discussion             and        agreement with the Police that they would                          be
responsible             for manning those perimeter gates instead                            of Club
Stewards          -     it is just something that has always happened                                in
practice          during          my time with the Club.               Overall I would              say
that       there        is very close liaison between the Club                          and        the
Police        and       this        is     particularly so having              regard        to     the
relationship between Doug Lock and the South Yorkshire Police.


On     a     match          day     the Police will             have   their     own     briefing
sessions         with         the     Ground, both a general briefing                    for        all
Officers              and     specific           briefings       for   Officers        posted        to
different             sections around and within the Ground, as far as                                I
am aware.             They also brief our Stewards on a sectional basis -
i.e.       the Officer dealing with policing in the west stand area
will brief the Stewards who are working in that area and like­
wise       the        Officer in charge of the Spion Kop will                          brief        the
Stewards          in        that area and so on.                The Stewards will also               be
briefed          by Douglas Lock on match day, and since he has direct
supervision             of those           Stewards I leave that               aspect        to     him
                                                 -    11 -




although I am generally aware of what goes on and have in fact
from     time to time attended briefing sessions.


F.A.     Cup           semi-finals have been held at Hillsborough in                            1987
(Leeds       v. Coventry City); in 1988 and 1989.                        These latter two
games         have        both     involved      Liverpool     F.C.       ana     Nottingham
Forest F.C.              In      1987 the match was moved to a Sunday at                        the
request        of the Police because thejy anticipated there might be
difficulties             with      Leeds    United       supporters.        Chief           Super­
intendent              Brian Mole was in charge of the policing as                          indeed
he     was     for the           1988 game.          For the 1987 game I do            in_fact
have     a     copy ofthe Police operations mannual                       which         is       the
written        instructions issued by the South Yorkshire Police for
policing           the     game.         I cannot now remember           exactly       when        I
obtained           a     copy     of that - it may well have been                 after          the
fixture        took        place and to the best.of my recollection I                           was
given        a copy when I requested it because I was interested                                  to
see     how they were organising the match from their end.                                      That
match         took        place     on Sunday, 12th April, 1987                  and        a    few
weeks        before        there     was a briefing meeting arranged                    at       the
request        of        the     Police.     The earlier briefing           was        on       20th
March        and        involved Brian Mole together with David Dowse                            and
Maxwell        Holmes of Leeds United, and Graham Hover of                             Coventry
City.        I attended, with my assistant, Sharon Lane.


For     the        1988        semi-final, which took place on 9th                 April          of
that     year,           the     early     briefing meeting took           place        in       the
Boardroom              at Hillsborough on 23rd March with Mr. Mole present
and     with           Peter     Robinson     of Liverpool         and    Paul     White          of
Nottingham              Forest..         It involved discussion with the                    Police
and     the        participating Clubs as to which areas of the                             Ground
their        supporters           would     be attending, how tickets              would          be
colour-coded              and marked for each set of supporters, where car
parking            arrangements            and   parking      of    coaches       would           be
organised and matters of that nature.

    For    the 1989 semi-final there was'~no such prior meeting                               with
    the     Police - I understood they felt one was not necessary                                 as
    the    game       involved effectively an action replay of                     the        year
    before,       when      the     same teams were involved           and       once        again
    Nottingham          Forest      fans were to be^accommodated in the                      Spion
    Kop and the south stand areas, and ..the Liverpool fans would be
    accommodated in the north and west stand areas.


    My own recollection of the semi-final which took place in 1988
    is     that everything went extremely smoothly, and indeed I have
    referred          to the file I kept for that fixture and the                       records
    indicate          that we had comparatively little by way of damage to
    the     Ground        afterwards.          There      were in   fact     a     couple         of
    letters        from     supporters         afterwards, including             one    from       a
    Liverpool supporter who expressed his appreciation for the way
    in     which       the game had been organised and stewarded.                       My     own
    recollection           is     that there were no problems in                 getting       the
    fans     into       the Ground on time for'kick-off that year, but                            my
    memory       is     that      the    Liverpool fans        in   particular          arrived
    earlier that year than they did for the 1989 semi-final.


    The     draw        for the F.A. Cup semi-final took place                    on    Monday,
    20th     March.        I was telephoned by Steve Clark, the Competition
    Secretary of the Football Association, that morning before the
    meeting        of     the F.A. took place.             He asked me to contact • the
    Police       to     confirm         that   if Hillsborough       were        awarded          the
    semi-final           between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, that they
    would        once again insist upon the Nottingham Forest fans being
    accommodated           in     the Spion Kop and south stand areas.                       As     a
    result        I spoke on the telephone to Chief Superintendent Brian
    Mole     who confirmed that that would be the case.                          I was        aware
    of     the     Police reason for so insisting - it enabled                         them        to
    have     more        effective control over the flow of fans                       into       the
    Ground,        since the Nottingham Forest fans, in journeying                             from
    Nottingham,           would     normally arrive at the Penistone Road                         end
of     the     Ground via Junction 34 of the Ml, and Liverpool                          fans
would        exit the Motorway so as to arrive at the Leppings                          Lane
end via the A61 from Junction 36 of the Motorway.


I. telephoned             Steve      Clark and confirmed       what     Chief       Super­
intendent            Brian        Mole   had   tolc£rme:.     The     semi-final           at
Hillsborough was later confirmed by telephone and this enabled
us     to     put arrangements in hand for the printing                   of       tickets
etc.


I    recall that a couple of- days before the semi-final the F.A.
telephoned           to     enquire whether the Club would be providing                     a
Doctor        positioned           near the playing area.           Arrangements          had
already        been made by Sharon Lane for the Club Doctor,                        Doctor
Bill        Purcell,        to attend and he had been allocated                a    ticket
which        would seat him in the south stand in the pen behind the
dug-out.          I believe the F.A. were concerned about the presence
of     a Club Doctor because of a recent event which had received
some publicity, where a Bristol Rovers player had been injured
on the field and had swallowed his tongue and needed emergency
treatment.


I    now      turn to events that occurred on the day of the                        match,
15th        April,        1989.      I arrived at the Ground          between       7     and
7.30 a.m.           Immediately after arriving I walked right round the
Ground,        as is my normal practice before a game, to check                           for
myself        the     general state of things.              I would be    looking          to
see, for example, that the Ground was generally tidy.


I    had      a     number        of tasksto perform that           morning        such    as
finalising           T.V.     arrangements, including means of access                     for
television            crews,         dealing    with   the     issue     of         passes,
co-ordinating arrangements for a luncheon to be held involving
Management           of     the 2 competing Clubs, and F.A. Officials                     and
local dignitaries.                 The guests started to arrive shortly after
II a.m.
                                                        -    14 -




I     recall, during the course of, that morning, that I met                                             with
Douglas          Lock in the reception area in the south stand offices
and     talked to him about the arrangements for the day.                                           It     is
normal           for Doug Lock to seek me out on a match day to enquire
whether           I    had         any     special instructions             for        him     and       -the
Stewards.              On      this       occasion I needed to talk to                       him        about
arrangements                 for opening the turnstiles.                  That arose               because
originally             we had agreed with the-Police that the                                turnstiles
would open at 12 noon, and a potential problem had then arisen
as     a        result        of some information that was                      inserted           in     the
Liverpool -Programme,                          for Liverpool fans, the previous                      week.
That       arose            because Sheffield Wednesday played                         Liverpool           at
Anfield           on Saturday, 8th April, and the Sheffield Police                                        had
arranged              for     an     article        to be inserted          in        the     Liverpool
Programme              giving        instructions to Liverpool fans as to                               their
journey               from     Liverpool           to       Sheffield     for     the        F.A.         Cup
semi-final,                 arrangements           for      car parking etc., and                  it     was
stated           in     that        document        that "Gates will             be    opened           from
II a.m.,              with          pre-match           entertainment       and         refreshments
available               inside           the     Ground."           Subsequently       the          Police
realised              that this information clashed with the                           arrangements
that they had made with me, for the turnstiles to be opened at
12     and I was asked by Inspector Sewell, as I recall,                                           whether
we     could assist by having Turnstile Operators there to open a
few        of     the        turnstiles           early if there          was     a    build-up           of
spectators outside.                       I had confirmed there would be no problem
with that, since Stewards and Turnstile Operators had standing
instructions                 to be at the Ground no later than 11 a.m. on the
semi-final day.


During           the        hours leading up to the start of the game                               I     was
busy        dealing with a variety of organisational matters.                                           As is
my normal practice I would, from time to time, walk out of the
office and check the position in the Ground itself.                                           Thus, for
example,              on more than one occasion I walked down the players'
tunnel           to     see        how the spectators were building up,                            and     my
principal              recollection is that Nottingham Forest were filling
up     their       end        of     the Ground at a   quite    early     stage,       but
Liverpool          supporters were not.          ‘-As- I recall that in fact           was
remarked        on by several members of staff during the course                         of
that     day.        From time to time I would also walk outside to see
how     matters          were outside the Ground.         I remember walking            up
the     private          road       that   runs alongside the     river     from        the
Directors' entrance to the Leppindfs^Lane entrance.                        The Police
had     created          a     sterile area along part of that          roadway,         by
erecting barriers just beyond Gate C at Leppings Lane end, and
a     further series of barriers near.the "dog-leg" corner                         close
to Gate E.           I did in fact have to speak to the Police there to
arrange for some cars to be allowed to park within the sterile
area,        since       visiting dignatories from Nottingham Forest                    had
been     allocated parking spaces there.                 As I recall there was a
group     of foot officers of the South Yorkshire Police                        manning
each     of     those          2 barriers - perhaps of the order of 8              -     10
Officers at each barrier.


The     last occasion when I visited the Leppings Lane end before
problems built up later was probably shortly after 2 p.m., but
I     cannot       put anything like an exact time on it.                 However        my
recollection             of        the situation at Leppings Lane at that              time
was     that       the number of Liverpool supporters was starting                       to
build up - there was a substantial group of them present but I
would        not say that the area was packed solid.                I can say that
nothing        about the scene at that time struck me as unusual                         or
potentially dangerous.


Subsequently             I     was     in and out of the office (I        had    placed
myself        in     Sharon Lane's office that afternoon) at                intervals
and     on     more than one occasion I would have walked                   down        the
players'           tunnel to see what was happening on the pitch and on
the     stands        and          terraces, from inside the     Ground.        It      was
still        the     case          that it was noticeable that     Liverpool           fans
were     slower building up in the north stand and the west stand
areas than the Nottingham Forest fans.
I     had agreed with the media and with the television crews                                   in
particular             as to how they should'position themselves prior to
commencement               of      the match because they were anxious to                     film
the     teams          coming          out onto the pitch.       In   particular            Brian
Clough,          the       Nottingham Forest Manager, was very much in                         the
news     at       that          time     because    he -4isd- : been.. banned      from        the
touch-line             and I knew that they were anxious to film him                           and
were     aware             that     he     had been allocated a seat          in    the        pen
immediately                behind        the dug-out.      As I recall, I was          out      on
the     pitch          when the Liverpool team came out, and                    just        after
they     came onto the pitch Doug Lock came up to me and told                                   me
that     Gate          C     had either been opened or broken             down         at      the
Leppings          Lane end and as I recall he told me that about 300 -
400     people             had entered through the gate.              I said I would            go
and     see what the problem was and I immediately pushed my                                   way
through          the        photographers          in    the.area and   walked         up      the
players '         tunnel.              At that stage the Nottingham           Forest          team
were     also          on the pitch, but the photographers                 were        waiting
for the arrival of Brian Clough, I believe.


I walked out of the Ground and around through the sterile area
to     Gate       C at Leppings Lane.                   I imagine the match        must       have
kicked        off at about that time but I cannot be certain.                                 Once
the     teams were out on the pitch the noise from the huge crowd
inside the stadium was such that it- would be difficult to tell
from     outside whether the kick off had taken place and in                                    any
event        I    was concentrating on the problem in hand.                         In        going
through          the sterile area I did, of course, pass the groups of
foot     officers               who were on duty at each set of barriers,                       and
when     I       arrived           at Gate C the gate was         partially        open.          A
mounted          Police           Officer was positioned outside the               gate         and
there     was          a line of fans walking in and as I recall                         he     was
shouting          to the fans indicating to them that they should                               not
come through in that queue unless they had a ticket.                                 The fans
who     were walking through were holding up the tickets for                                    him
to see that they had one.                      There seemed to be a number of fans
around          who did not have tickets and could not get access as a
result.


As     I    walked through the gate I recollect that there                         were         a
couple          of Police Officers stationed just inside it and one of
our        Stewards, Richard Beadsley, t£=^hom I spoke.                      Looking           at
him he seemed a bit shaken, and I asked him whether he was all
right        and        he answered in the affirmative.              I was     intent         on
making          my    way to the Police Control            Box to find out           exactly
what       was        going    on and to do that I         had to walk        around         the
southern             corner    of    the    west stand     and go through          a        gate
adjacent             to turnstiles 19 - 22 to get to           the Box.          That gate
was     manned           by Club Stewards who also man the exit Gate E                         at
that point, and they let me through.


I     climbed           up into the Police Control Box and I                 recall          that
Chief           Superintendent             David   Duckenfield       was     there          with
Superintendent                Bernard Murray and I believe 2 other Officers.
When        I     looked out of the window of the Police Control Box                            I
noticed           for     the first time that they were a large number                         of
Liverpool             supporters      on the pitch around the Liverpool                      goal
area,        that        other supporters appeared to be seeking to                         climb
over the perimeter fence to gain access to the pitch, and some
were        also        climbing or being pulled up from the back                      of     the
terrace up to the seated area in the west stand.                             I cannot say
whether           the     gates in the perimeter fence were open                   at        that
stage           - there was such a mass of people around that it                            would
not        have       been     obvious.       I recall that      I    asked      what         was
happening             and was told that people were being crushed in                          the
pens        because of pressure from behind.               No reference was                  made
at     any        stage       to    the gate having been opened,             and       it     was
clearly           an urgent situation where I did not wish to interfere
with        the       Police operations.           They were   giving        instructions
over        their personal radios to Officers as to how they                            should
deal with the situation on the Ground, and I recall that Chief
Superintendent                Duckenfield was talking to the Police                    Officer
who        had       control       of the Tannoy system telling            him     to        keep
                                                      -   xo -




talking       to the crowd.                   As I recall the message that was being
repeated over the Tannoy at that stage was asking the crowd to
keep    calm and remain patient without giving any reason why                                            -
i.e.    without explaining the nature of the emergency that                                           had
arisen.           I     recall          that        I did ask whether         there      were         any
fatalities             and     Mr. Duckenfield replied "I.believe so,                            yes".
The     impression I had was that there was a confused situation,
and     I    heard the Police giving instructions to deploy men                                         at
the front of the perimeter fence and to seek bolt cutters.


I left the Police Control Room and went back to the Directors'
area    via           the     kitchens of the Riverside Suite,                      seeking            out
F.A. Officials,                    in         particular      Graham      Kelly,      the         Chief
Executive,             to advise him of what was happening.                         I met him in
the     offices' area, as I recall near the Boardroom, and I told
him         that            what        was     involved      outside       was    not      a     pitch
invasion          but        was a major incident and I took him                         and      Glenn
Kirton       of        the F.A. back to the Police Control Box.                             When       we
entered       the Control Box you could see through the window that
there       were        a     number           of    people      in   obvious      distress            and
receiving             mouth to mouth resuscitation.                       In discussions              with
the     Police          it     was        agreed       that 'the       match      could         not     be
re-started             but     the Police were anxious not to announce                                that
fact        to the fans because they feared that fans who might then
leave        the        Ground           would       impede      access     to    the     emergency
services.              Consequently whilst the Police announcer was still
talking        to the crowd at regular intervals over the Tannoy.                                        I
believe        no       formal announcement was made even at                            that      stage
that we had a major incident on our hands.


After        a short while I left the Police Control Box again                                        with
Graham        Kelly          and        Glenn Kirton, and Mr. Kelly said                    that        he
wanted         to           convene            a    meeting      in   the        Boardroom            with
representatives                of all 3 Clubs, F.A. Officials and the                             match
referee.              Between the 3 of us we gathered the various                                people
together          in        the Boardroom where a meeting took place and                                we
discussed             the     abandonment             of the match and agreed               that        we
                                               -     19 -




would     not formally announce it was abandoned until the Police
considered        that it was safe to d o “so, having regard to                          their
concern        about     access for emergency vehicles.                   I recall        that
during        the meeting Doug Lock entered the room and said he had
a message from Brian Clough that he was putting his players in
the bath and taking them home, or -words to that effect.


Subsequently           I recall that I went back to the Police                     Control
Box     and     was     there when the announcement was made                     over      the
Tannoy        that the match was formally abandoned, the crowd                           were
informed        that there was a major incident and they were                            asked
to remain patiently in their places until they were advised by
the     Police        that     they could disperse in an            orderly        manner,
without        impeding        the    emergency services.          As I      recall        the
announcement           was effective and later the supporters did leave
the Ground in an orderly fashion.


As     to access to the Ground generally, for an all ticket                               game
I     would expect each turnstile to admit at a rate of about 800
per     hour     with        a good operator on it.           I am aware         that      for
spectators        for        the     standing area at Leppings Lane                on     15th
April     we     expected to have full capacity (10,100)                         and     their
tickets        would indicate that they should gain entrance through
turnstiles        A     - G.       With 7 turnstiles operating I              appreciate
that     it     would        take a period of time before             all        spectators
could     be admitted.             However given that the turnstiles were to
be      opened no later than 12 noon for a kick-off at 3 p.m. and
given     the     experience              of the previous year where             there     had
been     no     difficulty with spectators getting into                      the        Ground
(albeit        some     will always arrive late) I did                not        anticipate
that     there would be a problem on 15th April.                      I would           expect
that      Basil        Jones       would      have     put   his   more      experienced
turnstile        operators           on     the turnstiles at the          Kop     end     and
Leppings Lane end, for the terraces, that day.


I     would expect the Stewards manning Gate C (there were some 3
in     number)        to assist in the orderly dispersal of                      spectators
once    they           had    come through the turnstiles, for              they       would
normally          be     coming LliruuyU at such a rate that it            would b*»
possible          for        Stewards    to direct them in a        particular way.
Similarly          the        gate in the dividing wall at the rear                of    the
west    stand           which      divides the area behind turnstiles A                 -    G
from    the        area covered by turnstiles 11 - 16 would be                      manned
by     Stewards,              even    though    it   was    open   throughout           that
afternoon,             and     those Stewards would also           direct    spectators
towards        the       standing       area in pens 5, 6 and 7 in           the        north
west    corner.              I would not expect our Stewards to be                standing
on     the terraces themselves because it is not an easy task                               to
ask     a    Steward to stand on the terraces                  surrounded         by     Away
fans        for    any        football match.        Those terraces       are     normally
patrolled          by Police with the assistance of visiting                      Stewards
where        appropriate.            I know that there were Liverpool Stewards
in     attendance             at this game.       Apart from those who          may      have
entered           via       the turnstiles, a group of them arrived                at       the
Club's        offices on 15th April and I authorised their admission
to the Ground as Liverpool Stewards.

 in    conclusion I have been asked to comment on two matters                                in
 case it should be felt that they had any bearing on the tragic
 events       of 15th April - they relate to the provision of                           first
 aid equipment and loudhailers for Stewards.


 In     1988       the        Local authority        Environmental       Health     Officer
 inspected             with specific reference to this item and wanted the
 Club       to provide such equipment as was considered necessary by
 the St. John's Ambulance -Brigade.                      I spoke to Peter Wells, the
 Duty       Officer of the St. John's Ambulance, Sheffield area, and
 he provided me with an extract from a booklet listing what was
 required.              I     gave    that     to Alan     Smith   who     organised        the
 purchase           of       the     equipment.      X       not   aware    whether          the
 Environmental                Health officer came back to check that they ha
 been purchased.
St.     John's       Ambulance Brigade are responsible           for     providing
first     aid       cover     at the Ground during matches.            This        is     a
standard        arrangement         with   the   Football    League     and        as     I
understand          that they undertake to provide adequate first                       aid
cover       They          will have details of-^our Fixture List             for        the
Season     and       a     degree     of local knowledge as     to     the     likely
attendances.              If there is any variation m        that Fixture           List
they     are     notified       and     they are also   notified       of     special
occasions such as the holding of an F.A. Cup semi-final at the
Ground.         They       were sent a letter“prior to the match on                 15th
April     this year and asked to provide adequate cover and                         they
confirmed they would do so.


Prior to the incident the Club provided no loudhailers for the
use     of Stewards but I was aware tha’t the Police had them                           for
their     own       use.     The Tannoy system was in my view the way                    to
deal     with        any    announcements that needed to be made              to        the
crowd     and        the    system     is such   that   announcements         can        be
directed        to       particular sections of the Ground including                    out
into the Leppings Lane area to people outside the turnstiles.


The     number of safety stewards we employ is not a factor which
is     raised        for discussion at Safety Committee meetings in                      my
experience           of    attending such meetings.         X believe       that        the
Club     would stand comparison with virtually any other Club                            in
the     country in relation to the number that we do employ on                            a
regular        basis, and those numbers can be increased for certain
matches        if     a    large crowd is expected, this         being       done        by
agreement between Doug Lock and the senior stewards•


 I    have read this Statement and it is true and correct to                             the
best of my knowledge and belief.

 LA- OTH.                                   I ^ A p n l , 1989.

 Dear Peter,
       Through Liverpool F.C, on behalf of the Merseyside County
 Schools' S'.A., our deepest sympathy to the families and friends
 of ‘
    gill the Liverpool fans who died so tragically at Hillsborough
 laSt Saturday.
      Our association suspended its county fixture_against Durham
 in the U-15 Northern Counties Qhampionship semi-final last
 Tuesday and also suspended association finals scheduled to be
 played t h i % w ^ k .
       In the -nettr future we will be making a donation towards the
 Disaster Appeal- When we eventually play our association and
 school finals the proceeds from the gates will be donated.
 M y own school, Gateacre Community Comprehensive School, has
 collected £815*56 towards the Appeal.
      On a personal note, I was outside the Leppings Lane end
 at about 2.25pm last Saturday, arriving late because of road
 works and heavy traffic on the motorway around the Manchester
 area- I had a ticket for the West Stand.^ I was^disturbed that
 the Police were not marshalling the fa n s _into ordered lines
 towards the turnstiles. The whole area immediately outside
 that part of the ground is a bottle-neck. The crowd was _
 already considerable in size and I was gladto get inside the
 ground, not without too much difficulty I plight add, due
 only to the fact that I was going into the stand and hence
 through the designated turnstile. My y o u n g friend,^whom I
 took to the game, had a ground ticket and it took him about
 25 minutes to get in, fighting and jostling all the way.
 He was safe at end of it all, thank God.
           I cot the impression that there were enough Bobbies there
  except only two on horses (more mounted Police should have been
  there) - but they stood around in groups and m rows doing
  nothing to sort out the ever increasing numbers of fans
                                                                                              •••
  arriving at the Leppings Lane end and the subsequent pressure r:        .   '-- -L':
  agaSst the railings and perimeter wall of the ground ^which                         -----


  inevitably ensued. They seemed more concerned in preventing
  "Yobbo” behaviour and looking out for people with fogged
  tickets tnan than -cne
                    the safety   o f - the crowd.
                         saxei^y ui               The ------ -^ ation.■
  incredibly naive and amateurish in^dealing with the situation. ;
  To allow a crowd to build up in this fashion over a o n e t
  hour period prior to kick-off was simply u ^ e l i e v a b l e . ^  ;
  the end Of the day I felt extremely sorry
  Bobby, for he was in m y opinion, let down terribly by his
  S e h i o r Officers, who seemed in the main to exercise littl
  i n   the way of leadership


                                                                              ■               •
On entering the ground I saw a young fan standing on a flat
roof (about 12ft off the ground; adjacent to the perimeter wall*
The Police ran over (several) and the fan took great length
to explain that he was not trying to get in without paying and
showing them his ticket. Outside, he, like hundereds of
others were simply desperate to enter the ground - time about 2.35pm-
This situation should never have been allowed to develop,
     I would be willing to testify in front of any Tribunal
as to what I witnessed last Saturday.

                       , in great sadness,

     opened         gate         4 and assisted                    the     first         injured man                who      I saw         onto       the

     them      back         on     the       terrace           through           gates        5 and       6 which            I opened.                At

     this      stage         I was           joined           by a n o t h e r      serial          which       arrived              from       the

     direction              of     the N o r t h          Stand.           The      first          body       I s a w was            on    the       terrace

He     seemed       uninjured            but       very       distressed.               I carried               his       father        onto

A Police        Officer            who       I d o n ’t k n o w           but    I think         he       was    either          from

Barnsley        or W o o d s e a t s          was      near        by s a i d     " m ak e      sure       he    d o e s n ’t s w a l l o w

regained        consciousness.                      By      this     time        an ambulance                  had arr i v e d and

wa s    parked       near       to    the      g o al .          I carried            this      man       by h i s a r m s         and       a

civilian        had       his      legs       to    the a m b u l a n c e .            Inside         the a m b u l a n c e          there

was    a body        on    the       bench and              one     or     two    on    the      floor.              We    had     to       put

the     casualty          down and            t a ke     the       bodies        out    of      the       ambulance             then        put

him     i n s i d e . . He w a s         still         breathing and                  conscious            and       his    s o n was

w i t h him.         I obtained               no    details          and        don't       know      what       happened            to      him.

I d o n ’t k n o w        how      long       I stayed with                 this       particular               casualty           but

whilst        I was       reviving            him      on     the     grass       many       more         bodies          had    been

brought        from Gate             4 and were               covering           the    gr a s s .         At    some       stage           I saw

the    first        officer,          he w a s         Inspector            Harper.             I said          to    him       "Can't           we

get     rid    of    these         bodies".              He      replied         "Bodies?"            with       disbelief.                  It

appeared        to    me      that       officers             were        being       directed            to    that       end     of       the

DAVID ALFRED ILLINGWORTH




POLICE CONSTABLE U17




SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HAMM EP.TON ROAD POLICE STATION




During my service with South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield and Rotherham,                                             I have beer,

to     many     large     football        matches   at Sheffield Wednesday                Football Club,         and during my

time at West Bar did many duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

In September 1987, I started serving with the Community Constables at FI and have beer,

on duty       at the majority of matches.                    At all        these games I have been on Serial 1 (the

u r a c k ) and    I have      placed myself         behind         the    goal near to gate number 5. and PC 128;

Smith has been near gates either 3 or ^

I     originally        took   up   this     position      as       there    was   less manpower        at   that      end    of the

ground.         I have never been detailed any particular position on the track.

On Saturday        15 April 1989, I arrived at the ground at 9-^5 am and went into the North

stand     for     the briefing at 10 am.               Inspector Darling was in control of our sector and

PS Chapman         was    in charge of Serial             1.        After the briefing           from Chief Superintendent

DuckenfieId         and    Superintendent           Murray      I    had    a packed      meal    in   the     North    Stand      but

received no other instruction regarding my duties for the day.

     collected      a     stool     and    placed    it   near        to    gate   5-     At   most    games    I sit        at   this

position as it            is directly between two sets of railings on the terrace and often fans

climb up on to            and over the        railings and gives easy access for climbing the perimeter

fence.        (Two Liverpool         fans scaled the perimeter fence at the start of the 1988 semi

final    ran     onto     the pitch.         I detained one as he attempted to get back in the crowd.

The    other      one     got back    in     but    was   later       taken out         by St Johns     with     a leg       injury,

caused when he fell from the fence).

The fans began arriving at the Leppings Lane end before 12.00 and I stood on the track

behind    the goal with PC Smith.                   The next officer on the track was PC 442 Cookson who
                                                                     -   2-


was    near    the small gate in the North Stand.                               I d o n ’t know where the next officer we;

in the opposite direction (South Stand)

There       were    very   few    Liverpool          fans in    theground but              the ones near PC                Smith and       **

were       sober and well         behaved.           I am not    sure of the               time but at about          1 pm I heard          i

radio       message    from      PS    Chapman       (The      radio          was    on   talk   through)     to     the    effect       "I't

taking half my serial for meal before it gets busy" Reply "Roger".                                               I then saw a groui

of officers on the track, near the players tunnel leave the track via the North Star.;

obviously going for their meal.

About       half an hour later I saw PS Chapman back near the players tunnel and assumed h

had had his meal and I was anticipating a radio message to go for mine.                                                    At 2 pm I ha

received no instruction regarding a meal                                 and walked over to PS Chapman and asked hi:

if    PC    Smith    and I could         take    our meal.                He    said OK.         On    our way     to the      canteen

message came over the radio "The canteen will close in 20 minutes".                                                On our arriva; a

the    canteen       we found it was closed and one of the ladiessaid:                                    "We're closed for th

next       twenty    minutes" PC Smith and I then stood                              in the queue until          they       re-opened a

approximately          2.20.      We    were     served        and       returned         to the      track at 2.*45~2.50 pm.              P

Smith       went    to the      toilet    I walked          onto         the Leppings        Lane      end   where    I found PC 70

Helliwell was standing behind goal.                            I saw the centre pen (CN & CS) was very fu^.1 bt

the two outer pens were only about half full.                                       This surprised me as I'd never seen th

fans       so badly distributed.               At first there didn't appear to be a serious problem tr

fans were swaying back and forth and some were climbing from the pen marked N on tf

map    into the stand above.                  This    is a common occurrence at large matches.                               The swayir

and pushing          became much worse to the extent that females                                  were screaming and fans wei

beginning          to panic.          I put    over    a radio message to the                      effect:     "There is a senoi

crush       down    here   it     is    serious” .       I don't               know if it was          received or not         as    I    v<

unable       to hear my radio due to the noise.                                At thistime I was near gate 4 and it                       we


obvious       that    people      against       the     fence      were         in    serious      trouble.      There       was    only !

Smith and me at this section and I think he was near to Gate 3-                                                I opened gate 4 ar
assisted the first injured man who I saw onto the track.                                      The fans began to spill out.

I   assisted        this    man    with    a     leg    injury      to     the St Johns        at   the corner of the North

Stand.        All   the     fans who were            spilling onto the track and the grass I was attempting

to get them back on the terrace through gates 5 and 6 which I opened.                                          At this stage I

was joined by another serial which arrived from the direction of the North Stand.                                             The

first    body       I saw was       on    the    terrace       just behind the fence.                I cannot describe this

person    as    I could see little of him due to the crowd but he was male, white and laid

flat out with             fans standing         on him.        It was          impossible     at that    stage to get to him.

We were dragging             fans out of gate 4 as quickly as possible.                             They were climbing over

the    fence       onto    the    track    and       over   the railings into the North pen.                   The fans began

pushing       the    dead    and    injured          through the gate.             Officers     began resuscitation on the

grass.        I assisted in pulling a large fat                           man from gate 4.           He wasabout 50 years of

age, I think bald/greying, wearing a greenjumper.                                   He was with his         son about 30 years

he had black          hair and a black moustache.                        He seemed uninjured but very distressed.               I

carried his father onto the grass but I thought he was dead as he wasn't breathing and

wasn't conscious.                I began to give him heart massage but it didn't appear to have any

effect    but       I continued          and    he     began   to breath for himself.                A police officer who I

don't know but I think he was either from                                 Barnsley or Woodseats was near by said "make

sure     he    doesn't       swallow      his        tongue"        I      turned      him   onto   his side   and    after a few

minutes       he    regained       consciousness.              By       this    time   an    ambulance   had   arrived and was

parked near          to the goal.              I carried this man by his arms and a civilian had his legs

to the ambulance.                 Inside the ambulance there was a body on the bench and one or two

on the floor. We had to put the casualty down and take the bodies out of the ambulance

then put       him inside.           He was still breathing and conscious and his son was with him.

I obtained no details and don't know what happened to him.

I don't know how long I stayed with this particular casualty but whilst I was reviving

him on        the grass many more bodies had been brought from gate 4 and were covering the

grass.        At some stage I saw the first officer, he was Inspector Harper.                                        I said to him
"Can't       we   get   rid    of     these     bodies".       He   replied'.     "Bodies?"      with    disbelief.     It

appeared to me that officers were being directed to that end of the ground who had no

idea what was taking place.                   At some stage I ended up at gate 3 where the crush to get

out    was    enormous,       several        fans    had   fallen   over   the    small   wall   and were     trapped   by

their    legs and       the    crush    behind       them and as a consequence            they   began   to pile up.      I

think    it was at this stage            the fans          began to pull at the fencing which started             to rip

away     I together with other officers,                   fans, ambulance staff began to kick at the             bottom

of it, sufficient gave way so we could get the fans under it.

I did several journeys                carrying bodies and injured on advertising boards, at first to

the ambulance station.                I first remember seeing about 6-10 bodies or injured on boards

on the floor outside the gym.                   I made another journey and on my return with a body the

whole floor outside the gym was covered.                       I made another journey and on returning thas

time I saw the bodies were being taken into the gym itself.                                I followed suit.      I don t

know how many       trips          I made,    the descriptions of the bodies or who                I was with     during

this     time. The only recollection of staff in the gym I have                            is an officer      shouting:

"Someone must stay with the bodies” .

After    all the dead were             in the gym and the injured had gone I was                    informed we should

all    go to      the North Stand            where    we were de-briefed          by Chief Inspector Beal.            After

that     I was     asked      by    Inspector Calvert         to sit with        fans on a S.Y.T bus        in Penistone

Road.        I went with PC 700 Helliwell and 295^ Morledge. The fans were in fact missing

friends and relatives.                We obtained their details and descriptions of persons missing.

After this was completed a coach arrived in Penistone Road and we put the relatives on

the coach which I was informed was to take them to Hammerton Road Police Station.

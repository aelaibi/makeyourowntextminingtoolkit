Police      officer      on horseback          told us       to get      off    *Jrt-e   road    and move into

the ground.         We   joined the          large        crowd and we ygot split                up.     The

people were        pushing and shoving                in order        to m e t to the t urnstiles and

then     I found                 and he told me             that    he\i/ad had his wallet

nicked.       It could have been anyb o d y                  because        there was so many             people

on this      corner.         The atmo s p h e r e was        still     good w ith the            people and

there was        no sugge s t i o n of any fights what                  so ever.           I assu m e d       the

reason      they wanted        us off      the    roads was o b v i o u s l y because              of the

numbers      of supporters.             There was a fair amount                    of foot       patrol

officers      in this area,            how many      I can't        say and        they were keeping

the     people    on the      path and through the                 turnstiles.           There was about

two or     three officers           on horseback.             We all        found each other

the    tickets.       We then went          to a Police Sergeant who was                        near     the

entrance      of the ground at Leppings                     LN and     told him what            had happened

               and that we wished                 to make an official             complaint.              I u nderstand      that

               from     conversation wiyri                          his wallet         containing about £40 and                    the

               tickets were           taken /from his            back    pocket.        The Police S e r geant            then-

               tried to draw t h e / a t t e n t i o n of someone inside the around by knocking

               the door        set    in the gate and spoke                 to the Sergeant,

               The Sergeant           e x plained what           had happened and what                he was going to

               do.      We f o 11owed            the 5 e r g eant thr o h        the     gate and         the door was shut

               behind      the four         of     us,,     The Sergeant led           us through           the ground. - We

               complaint        regarding          the     theft.       He was    then shown some             photographs           of

               what     I ’m led to believe were                   suspect    'dippers'         from Liverpool,              This

               was a board displayed                    in the     g y mnasium by the West Y o rkshire Poli ce.

           on the      terracing.          At     this    point       I knew that           it was       going    to be very

           tight     in the     terracing and             I was       beginning            to    perspire    very
                                                                                                             t
            quickly.       We were moving at an angle                        towards        the front all           the    time,

            there was       no room to stand s t i 11.                     11 f e 11 as though you were                   faeing

            sucked by a vaccuum to the front as well                                 as    being       pushed with great

            force    from the       rear.         The    players were          on tWe           pitch at this        point

            but the match h a d n ’t started.                   I had trouble               in being able           to see       the

            players      on the     pitch because           of the          sho/ing and           pushing and        I had

            trouble      keeping     hold of Karen.                  At ^-hi/s point            I was    beginning        to feel

            f righ t e n e d for    the safety of Karen a^d myself.                               People were        shouting

and some         looked in fear             for    their    own safety           but you just        c o u l d n ’t do

anything.             I managed       to keep hold of K aren and keep behind her and we

found ourselves            down at          the    very front          of the terracing,            possibly

about five yards from the right hand side of the goal.                                             At the front
      C/VT'                «<
was a large metal fence perhaps eight to ten feet high.                                             This    fencing

was    embedded         into    the    concrete       wall       which was        set at waist         level.

There were            spikes    on top o f the fencing                  pointing      towards       the    fans,

these measuring about 6 inches                         in length.             As soon as we found

ourselves at the               front    of the terracing                the     crush from the         left,

right and behirid a p p e a r e d to get                   stronger        in strength,           at this    point

my hair was            soaked with          sweat as well           as my entire         body.       People were

starting         to    push back       people were          crying and at           times     I was       finding

i t di f f i c u .11 to breathe             because     of the         c rush    i n the uppe r part         of my

body.        During      this    period Karens             right       hand side      of her       body was

em b edded against             the    fencing with myself                positioned         on the     upper    step

behind her.             I was    being       pushed     into Karen as was              other       people,     and

they too were            crying and shouting                -- "Get me out,           get me o u t . ”       I kept

telling        Karen     repeatedly          “ I ’ll get you out              in a minute         it w o n ’t be

long     just        keep going       sweetheart."

On several            occasions       I f o u n d m y self       b s i n g f o r c:e d a g a i n s t t h e fenc i n g

above Karen.             I held onto          the    fenci ng with            both hands at head height

possible        behind me and           could see          people who were            stood at the          back

being      pulled up into             the    stand.        As    the    crush gained         in s t r e ngth on

my body        1 was     shouting       "Push back,             push back,        the res    people       dying at

the    front.”          I also       noticed       that K aren was            beginning      to    loose    colour

in her       face and whilst            in this       position          1 noticed      vomit all          over my

left arm.             At one    point       I saw some Police Officers at front                           facing     us

and    it a p p e a r e d to m e that             they d i d n 't realise wiiat was                happening.

I was     s c reaming at           the P o l i c e       Officers          to >/et onto            the    fenc i n g     and

said      to Karen          "Reach out and grab the                       fencing."           Whilst        doing       this          1

could hear            her    scr e a m i n g    and     crying a g a i n         saying       "Get me out                get ms

one     point       I found my arm         reaching and grabbing                  the fencing and my

chest     being       pushed     into     it,     For a split           second      I looked up         into    the

sky and thought              theres     no way out,           I ’m g oing      to die.        The    people     that

were     stood around me             could      clearly be seen to be                 in the    same state as

myself     and       I noticed      one or two faces               loosing      colour    rapidly and some

faces were           beginning      to turn blue.               One    lad who      had been        pulling     on

the     left    hand side of my sweater,                    on my      left arm had suddenly               let go

a nd he seemed to disappear                     into other        bodies.        As    I was    embedded

against        the front       of   the   fencing          I began to         pull myself       up w fth the

assisted        to the ground ana staggered                      onto    the    pitch.        I fell     on my

knees wit h my head              in my hands,             I was       shaking,      sweating and         felt

exhausted.            I was    crying.          I. looked back          into the       terracing and there

were     bodies       layed all       over      each other and           people       still    trying     to get

out     crying and screaming              for     their       lives     for    some    help.        I d i d n ’t see

               Karen or Chris and suddenly                      I sta g g e r e d across       to the S o u t h

the West Stand           I was      trying       to    look for        the other       lads    in our     party as

i had a rough idea as                 to where         they w ould       be.     As    1 gazed along           the

seats     I could see that              people        in that     stand were all          stood up and            I

arm     in order       for them to        corns on the           pitch,        I did this       for a few

seconds        as    they d i d n ’t really appear               to know what          had happened.

                              then came out o f the s tand and joined me on the

pitch in part           of the      stand.        At     this    point      I was     still    shaking,

They then went             to the West Stand terracing and                     I helpl e s s l y

to help       other      people get out.                 then started         to    look for K a r e n on

the    pitch and found her                somewhere       in the      18 yard box of the goal

mouth.        She /was sat         down    crying,       shocked and with vomit all                  ar o u n d her

right ar m / i n a sling and               1 knelt       down beside         her and said to her

alright,         we're     safe,    ther.es other         people      dead    in there,         w e ’re out."

I was    trying       to    reassure       her    that we were         still       alive.        I put my arms

around       her and kept kissing                her    to reassure       her.       We were       then joined

by Chris who a p p e a r e d f r o m no-where and he decided to                             lead her away

from the         tunnel     and    I helped her          to the    edge      of t h e    pijrch    but on

doing    so      I just     felt    I couldn't          go on any      longer.          Thf&y    continued t o

of my neck and over my head and someone                            had ta/en my jumper               off and

like a balloon replacing                   the oxygen that            I had    lost      prior     to this.        1

                    a ssisting me         back onto my feet and                it hail been decided we

were      going    home,      we wa l k e d back       over      towards      the Lceppings LN exit

when      I suddenly saw numerous               dead bodies           laid o w       on the ground and                   I

just      broke    down a gain and           I couldn't       go     past    them.        1 thought       it was

an eme r g e n c y mortuary.            We    then turned around and made                    our way        past

the      rear   of the S outh Stand,              I again        felt my      legs    being       unable       to

carry me and had to stop and                     I was     put      into    the back       of a Rolls Royce

W 1t h              in order       that we      can r e s t .        After a few minutes               I was

then a s s i s t e d away from the             ground by                   and one other.            We were

all      together     Py then.        Whilst we were going                  through tne          park other

people were asking              if they       could help and at one                 point    on reaching

the      park gate     the exit       point     next      to the      road we shad walked down to

the ground a few supporters                    of both teams           began to bait each other

into fighting with stones and                     pieces      of wood and dirt.                  We just       kept

going and made            our way back         to the      car.       Whilst       en-route       numerous

Liverpool         supporters       offered      their a s s i s t a n c e     to us to whic h we

refused their          help but thanked them.                 On     reaching       the    car    I was     placed

the    city there were              numerous    hold ups due to the             large    number       of

people       leaving     the    staduim.        Somewhere       in S h e f f i e l d whilst     on the

                I have always          been a Liverpool          supporter       a l t hough    I have

only    recently       been a t t ending        their matches,          home and away whenever

possible.         I have       stood on the S pion Kop at               the Liverpool          verses

L v e r t o n derby match and am fully aware                   of what        the effect       of an

enormous        crowd on this          terracing       is like    but    I have    never       been

crushed and felt              ill whatsoever.           Myself:

visited H i l l s b o r o u g h     earlier     this    season and       stood on the          terracing

m     front     of the West         stand a l t h o u g h there was a lot of Liverpool

support       there was        no   problems.

fro m what       1 saw of the         police    o p eration and         the way the officers

responded the way              it became apparent            to them at the front              of the

terracing        they did everything            they      could as      did other       emergency

services        and members         of the     public and from the experience                   J. had with

the m e d i a    I criticise         them as    only being        interested       in taking

photographs when they                could have        been ass i s t i n g    people who were

            dying.          I was   d i sgusted at          the    i n s e nsitivity of the        reporters who

            a p p r o a c h e d us following          the    disaster,

            I   w ould      recommend that           the West       stand not         be penned off      but    be used

            as an open terrace                so that       people    can -fan out       once     on the      terracing

            and   1 only saw one              gate    situated       behind the        goal    that was       opened.

            People         c o u l d n ’t get out     because       of the    large      crowd all       trying to      get

            out   of this        one gate.           Whilst       I was on    the      pitch    1 saw    people going

            to bodies          laid out.        They were helping             in every         respect   to

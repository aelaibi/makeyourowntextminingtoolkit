  LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
  It has occurred to me that in this very difficult and complex
  inquiry you are undertaking on the Hillsborough disaster,
  questions may arise about the antecedent behaviour of Liverpool
  football supporters, particularly at all ticket games.

  I enclose papers which may just be of interest to the Inquiry,
  related to a match which occurred in F,gbruar^l988 when r-jjYA'rr*nr>1
  came down to pla^_Watford and despite aJ^^THSTSre-match warnings,
  l.stiu of -fckosft ians did'not have tickets and caused difficulty
  outside the ground. T t WSB "dfe'CTaed on the day, as a matter of
  expediency, rather than have this un-policed group wandering about
  the nearby centre of Watford, it was safer and easier for them to
  gain admission to the ground.

  The reports I attach are all self-explanatory, and you may take
  the view there is no relevance but at least you should be aware of
  the previous practice of people speculatively coming to venues of
  football matches from Liverpool, which we have not experienced from
  other clubs to such a degree, and their expectation that one way
  or the other they will gain admittance to the ground.

RE:   LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Attached hereto is the Football Match Summary relating to the match
played between Watford and Liverpool at Vicarage Road, Watford on
13 February 1988,  the total crowd attendance being 23,838 this
included 6,200 Liverpool Fans.

 Together with Superintendent HOWLEY I was responsible for policing
 this particular game.       I was responsible for policing outside the
 Football Stadium. Prior to kick-off it became apparent that approx-
 imately 1,500 Liverpool supporters had~arriV(5a without tickets . The
~game. which had been decl^Sfl ''fill Tick e t 1 at Police instigation, was

»well publicised prior to 13 February. The majority of all fans
 attending were in possession of tickets.

 behaviour was generally good.
                                                Some of the 1,500 fans had
 been d r i v i n g and were somewhat noisy although I am bound to say the
                                     The prevailing weather, without doubt,
 assisted the policing-'sf the crowd and after consultation with
 Superintendent HOWLEY I decided to hold the 1,500 supporters in the
 Cardiff Road area at the bottom of the walkway giving access to the
 Stadium.      Given that it would have presented severe policing
 difficulties and problems were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and
 run the town and frequent local public houses.       After further consul­
 tation with Superintendent HOWLEY and Club Officials it was decided
 prudent to let these fans into the arena upon payment.       I was aware
 that"there would be sufficient room in the StacTium to accommodate
 these fans because of the shortfall on sales of tickets in Liverpool.
 I was also conscious of the fact that previously Liverpool fans had
 attempted to enter the ground by forcing open gates.       The match was
 relatively trouble free there being 2 arrests of Liverpool supporters
 and 14 ejections of Liverpool supporters.

At the match briefing officers were told of the strong possibility of
visitors arriving without tickets and seeking access to the Football
Stadium.

      The estimated number of visiting supporters was such that it was necessary to make
      the match ALL-TICKET. Despite publicity some 15C0 Liverpool Supporters turned up
      without and were kept in a holding area some 500 yards from the ground until a few
      minutes before kick-off.  It was decided prudent to allow these 15C0 entrance to
      the ground rather than have them in the Town Centre.

     (t>) Inside Ground:

        Minor difficulties at start of match with l a r s r e numbers of none ticket holders
        trying to get into the ground quickly.




     fc; Im m e d ia te Vicinity of Ground:
         Some pushing and shoving around the turnstiles.                    Much of it good natured.




         A holding area for none ticket holders was established in Cardiff Rd to prevent
         problems at the turnstiles. This was possible because of the fenced walkway
         leading to the visiting support area. By not allowing none ticket holders to
         enter the walkway, they were kept away from the ground until it was clear that
         they could be admitted.

      i.e. Escorts, Tu rn stile Searches, Control of Licensing L a w s etc.:



           Searching carried out at turnstiles. Escorts to Shuttle Trains from Stadium
           to at ford Junction. Large number of Liverpool Supporters travelled back into
           London on the Local trains. No problems.

           The tactics of establishing a holding area for those non-ticket holders was a
           success and will be done at future all-ticket games where this is likely to
           prove a problem.

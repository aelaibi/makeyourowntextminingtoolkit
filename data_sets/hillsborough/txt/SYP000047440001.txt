    Mr Richard Wells Esq
    Chief Constable
    South Yorkshire Police
    Police Headquarters
    Snig Hill
    Sheffield S3 8LY




    Following our telephone conversation of recent date I write to you with a
    proposition in connection with the routing of the papers arising from the crime
    investigation into the Hillsborough disaster.

    You will kn o w that my investigation into the criminal and disciplinary aspects
    is being supervised by the Police Complaints Authority.    At the end of my
    investigation, which is not far off, the PCA must make a statement that it is
    satisfied w i t h the conduct of the investigation. That statement will be sent
    to you, the complainants and to the officers whose conduct has been called .into
    question.   The only exception to that will be the PCA statement in respect of
    your Assistant Chief Constable Mr Walter JACKSON.    In his case the PCA
    statement will go to your Police Authority.

    In strict accord with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the way for
    this to be achieved is for me to submit my original report to the PCA, and at
    the same time send a copy to you (or your Police Authority).     Once the PCA is
    satisfied w i t h my investigation it sends the forementioned statement to that
    effect, to you (or to your Police Authority).

    You (or your Police Authority) are then required first to consider matters
    related to any criminal offences revealed in the report and refer them to the
    Director of Public Prosecutions.  Thereafter you are required to submit a
    report to the PCA setting out your opinions as to the merits of the complaints
    against police officers; any disciplinary charges preferred or proposed; the
    merits or otherwise of convening a disciplinary tribunal; and any reasons for
    not preferring disciplinary charges.

    My proposition is that for various reasons; including the referral of the
    matter by Peter Wright to the DPP in the first place; the complex circumstances
    of the investigation; the bulk of the documentary and other evidence; and the



                                                             Co ntinued...


   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                       2.




need for expediency; you allow me to deal direct with the DPP in so far as the
crime aspects are concerned.  Of course, you will receive the PCA statement at
the appropriate time and you will receive all of the evidence and reports in
time for your consideration of the disciplinary aspects with the PCA.  The
matters relating to your Assistant Chief Constable would not be affected.

I hope that this letter is comprehensible and that you will agree to my
proposal, in whi c h case a short letter of reply would be appreciated.

Dear Mrs. Chowdharay-Best,

Thank you for your letter of the 29th November, received today, which has crossed with
mine to you of yesterday. I shall have to consider your request in the light of the outcome
of the inquest and the rules. You should understand however that the transcript of evidence
might be substantial and the cost is based upon its length.

Yours faithfully,




J. A. Turnbull

            LORD JUSTICE T A Y L O R 'S INQUIRY pwA-C â€¢

            The Secretary of State has seen your minute 6 June together with
            APS/Mr Moynihan's minute of 8 June. He is content with the package
            of material you propose to send to Lord Justice Taylor but he would
            be grateful if you would pursue Mr Moynihan's points 2 and 3.
            However, he does not wish to pursue Mr Moynihan's first point.

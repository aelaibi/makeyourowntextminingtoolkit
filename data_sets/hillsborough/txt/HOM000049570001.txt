0. But you met them in that l o c a ti o n ? - A. T h e r e was a
   g r e en bank where we sat and d r a n k and they w a l k e d up
   Leppings Lane, from the ground. I think they had
   parked somewhere and we met them.
Q. Anyway, after a w hi l e you m a d e your way d o w n to the
   g r ound and you got there at about what time? - A. We
   arrived at the ground I w o u l d say betw ee n 20- p a s t and

                                                                  J.   THOMAS


    half-past-2. I could not really be sure b e c a u s e I did
    not have a watch. It is only rough.
Q. There was a large crowd there by then was there, or
   not? - A. Tnere was a large crowd hut you could mo v e
   freely about.
0. You had been b e f o r e so you knew that you had to get
   through some p e r i m e t e r gates, like park gates? - A.
   That is right.
0. Were you able to get through those gates w i t h o u t too
   nucn d i fficulty? - A. There was a large crowd there.
   There was queues but they were n ' t really o r g a n i s e d by
   anyone special, but tnere was queues.
0. Are you saying that the queues when you went t h r o u g h
   were there right up to the turnstiles? - A. Yes.
0. Such as they were? - A. Yes.
Q. Who were you w i t h at that point? - A. I was w i t h Philip
   Bickley, Giles Hutt, C h r i s t o p h e r Devonside, some more
   lads who had arrived by minibus, we just sa w them on
   the off ch ance d r i v i n g along Leppings Lane, and they
   waved to us and said Wait there". T here was a ga n g of
   about 13 or 14 of us.
0. Quite a big crowd, in fact? - A. Yes.
Q. Group, I think we h ad bett e r say, not crowd.                    It is so
   di fficult with these words, isn't it? Do I g a t h e r from
   that that you had no p a r t i c u l a r d i f f i c u l t y g e t t i n g
   through the turnstiles? - A. It was more time not
   difficulty, b e c a u s e of the amount of pe ople a c t u a l l y
   outside the g r o u n d trying to get in. It w a s n ' t really
   difficult.
0. Did you see a n y b o d y who was d i s t r e s s e d or u p s e t or
   anything like that? - A. No, people w e r e happy, they
   were looking forward to gett i n g into the m a t c h and
   there was no trouble or anything. The mo od w as happy,
   looking forward to the garae.
0. Did you see any P ol i c e h orses at all? - A. I saw one
   Police horse but of a c t u a l P o lice there we r e very few.
0. When you got to the t u r n s t i l es were you s e a r c h e d at all
   on the outside? - A. No.
Q. When you got through were you se a rc h e d ? - A. I think I
   was searched by an O f f i c e r when I came through, yes.
                                                                    27

                                                           J.   THOMAS


You were. H a ving got through the turnstile, did you
see any big c o n c e r t i n a type gates opening at any point?
- A. I d i d n' t see any gates opening, no.
At this point you were still with this group, including
C h r i s t o p h e r ,,Simon Bell, yes? - A. The s i t u a t i o n was
people went in d i f f e r e nt queues but we all met up
inside the concourse. People decided to go in
d i f ferent queues.
Yes, I understand, but once you had all m a n a g e d to get
through you regrouped, so to speak, w i t n i n the
c o n course area? - A. We all met up inside, yes.
I am just running through some of the names - I d on't
need to know all 13 - were you with C h r i s t o p h e r and
Simon Bell, and Gary Church? - A. Yes, I was.
Within the c o n c o u r s e area, and also your other friends,
Philip Bickley and Giles Hutt? - A. Yes.
So the six of you, plus a few others? - A. Plus the
others, yes.
Jason, I think, p r o b a b l y was among that nunber? - A. We
were all there.
You didn't have a w a t c h so o b v i o u s ly it is very
d i f ficult for you to say, but can you give an es timate
of how long it took you, not to get thro u g h the
turnstiles but to r e g r ou p on the inside, from the time
that you arri v e d in Leppings Lane to the time tnat you
were ready to m a k e your next move into the tunnel, so
to speak? - A. When we got through the turnstiles, only
a m a tter of minutes. We we re in various q u eues but
about the same stage in each queue. I was one of the
first to get through and we all w a ited for eve r y o n e
else. I would say it was about five minutes.
Tell me, having got through you then went do w n the
tunnel, is that right? - A. Yes, I did.
Is that because you k n e w that was the way, or what was
the reason why you chose the tunnel? - A. The reason
that we w e n t down the tunnel was b e c a u s e in '88 we had
been told to go on the side, but we k n e w the tunnel,
when you went through the tunnel it w o u l d be benind the
goal so we could have a b e t t e r view.
You liked being behind the goal? - A. Yes.
The tunnel, was it clear or packed, or what was it? -
A. The tunnel was fairly c l ea r at this time.
                                                            J.   THOMAS


There were o b v i o u s l y p e o p l e going down? - A. T h e r e were
people going down but you could move freely in the
tunnel.
When you got out of the tunnel at the other end, just
coming out, okay, no f urther? - A. Yes.
Did you    chance to look at the pitch at          that point?      - A.
Stop to    look at the pitch?
Yes, at that point did you look to see             what was going
on? - A. Yes, I did.
And what was going on? - A. There was nothing on the
pitch at that moment.
Nothing at all, it was empty? I mean there were no
players on it? - A. I think there might have been --
there was like a s o c c e r skills c o m p e t i t i o n w i t h
schoolboys, I think.
Something, but .... - A. No players on the pitch.
Which side did you go into, the right or the left-hand
side? - A. I went in the r i g h t - h a n d side.
The r ight-hand side, and where w e r e you a c t u a ll y
intending to go? You p r e s u m a b l y had some idea where
you w a nted to end up? - A. Yes.
Where did you want to end up? - A. We w a n t e d to go, not
exactly right do w n at the goal but just to the right of
the goal.
Were you able to m a k e y o u r way to that p o s i t i o n or not?
- A. At that time we m a d e our w a y to a p o s i t i o n a b o u t
half-way do wn the terrace.
At that time what was the terrace like? - A. I re member
saying to a few of my friends, "It is p a c k e d in here,
isn't it?".
It's what? - A. "It's f a i rl y p a c k e d in here, there's a
lot of people", b e c a u s e there was m o v e m e n t of g o i n g
back and f orth up a nd d o w n the terrace, and there was a
lot of p e ople in there.      It was u n us u a l b e c a u s e you
expect to stand s t i l l at a m a t c h really.
Are you saying that it is unus u al to have sways then? -
A. Not to h a v e sways, but it was u n u s u a l even m o re so
than any other g r o u n d I h a d been to.
What you are saying is the swaying or the surging was
stronger? - A. Stronger, yes.
                                                                      29

Q. I just want to try and pin the time when this happened.
   Do you r e m e m b e r a beach ball being knocked about at
   all? - A. I don't, no.
Q. You d on't remember. Can you recollect the players
   being a n n o u n c e d ? Do you know what I me a n by that, over
   the tannoy? - A. Yes, I do. I do r e m e m b e r that.
0. Do you r e m em b e r tne players coming onto the pitch at
   all, pr e - m a t c h ? - A. I remember the players c o m i n g onto
   the pitch, yes.
0. Let's just deal wit h the announcement, okay? Where
   were you? Was this the position h a l f - w a y do w n the
   terrace where you were at that point? - A. Yes.
Q. At that point you w er e e x p e r ie n c i n g these surges, is
   that right? - A. Yes, that's right.
Q. You found it a bit tighter than you would have liked? -
   A. It was very u nc o mfortable.
0. Did you move from that position at all? - A. You could
   not move from that position. There was that many
   people a round you that if you tried to get out it would
   just be usel e s s because you kept g e t t in g forced further
   down.
Q. Was the p r e ss u r e c oming from behind? - A. From behind,
   yes.




                  /0 What h a p p e n e d ....
                                                             30

                                                      J. THOMAS


 Q. What happened after that? Just take me through what
    happened after that? - A. The surges gradually got
    worse.   You were moved further and further down the
    terrace and when you went to get back up again you
    found it steadily harder to get back up to your
    original position until it came to a stop. The
    surges stopped and you could not move forward or back
    any more.

Q. Initially you were able to recover your position,
   though with some difficulty, and a point came when
   you could not recover your position at all. You had
   got forward and that was it, is that right? - A. Yes,
   that is right.

Q. Do you know when that was? I do not mean the time,
   because you did not have a watch, unless you happened
   to look? - A. When the crowd actually stopped moving?

Q. Yes? - A. Only roughly.   I could not really say a
   time.

Q. Did you know what was going on, on the pitch? Can
   you remember by any chance? - A. When the crowd
   stopped I was not really concerned about what was
   going on.  I just wanted to stay on my feet.

Q. Were you at that time near a crush barrier? - A. I
   was.

Q. You were. Who was still with you at this point out
   of all these friends? - A. I was on my own then.

Q. What about Gary Church? Was he anywhere near you? -
   A. He was to the right of me but I didn't see him.
   The only time I did see him was when he shouted to me
   for help. That is when I did see him.

Q. When was that? - A. That was just after the crowd had
   stopped moving and he was getting crushed.

Q. Just after the crowd stopped moving? - A. That is
   right.

Q. Were you at that point already against the crush
   barrier? - A. I was.

Q. Was it in front of you or had you managed to get it
   so that it was behind you? - A. It was in front of
   me.

Q. It was just after that that the crowd had solidified,
   so to speak? - A. Yes.
                                                            31

                                                     J. THOMAS

Q. Gary shouted "Help"? - A. That is right.

Q. You could not because you yourself...? - A. I was in
   no position to help him because I was in exactly the
   same state as he was in.

Q. Do you know whether he then got swept away, so to
   speak, or not? Did you see that or do you not
   know? - A. He shouted for help for a while and I lost
   sight of him.   I saw him again and he just got swept
   under the crowd.

Q. You saw him again? - A. I saw him again.

Q. What was happening to him then? - A. He wasn't moving
   and he just got swept under.

Q. The barrier which you were against, did that stay
   intact or did it break at any point? - A. At the time
   I thought it had broke but the only explanation I can
   give as to why maybe it didn't was that I might have
   gone over it because I was in a bad state at this
   time.  I didn't know what was really happening to me.
   I might have gone over it but it seemed that it had
   given way because a lot of people sort of went
   forward in a further rush which would indicate that a
   lot of people went forward at the same time.   That is
   what I thought it was.

Q. We will sort out in a minute whether you are right or
   not as to whether it went but describe to me what
   happened to you and the others around you which made
   you think that the barrier had given way? - A. We
   were getting crushed and all of a sudden a rush of
   people went forward even more, which seemed
   impossible at the time.  I would say about 50 people
   went forward in an instant.

Q. Were these people who went forward ahead of you, do
   you think, or were they behind you? - A. They were
   probably on the same level.

Q. They just suddenly seemed to move forward? - A. Yes,
   that is right.

Q. You have already told me   you were more interested in
   what was going on around   you than what was going on
   on the pitch and I quite   understand that? - A. I
   didn't care what went on   on the pitch.

Q. Are you able in   any way to relate it to what was
   going on at the   pitch when that happened? Were the
   players playing   or not? Have you any idea? - A. I
   couldn't really   relate it.
                                                             32

 Q. You thought at the time that the barrier had gone? -
    A. Yes.

Q. Now you are a little bit more doubtful about it in
   that you think you may have gone over the top of
   it? - A. Yes.

Q. What has happened to make you have that   doubt? - A.
   After seeing the video evidence of when   the barrier
   actually broke.  I had already left the   terrace,
   which I couldn't possibly be there when   the barrier
   broke.

Q. Let us just establish when you left the terrace.
   When was that? - A* It was four minutes past three.
   I have seen it on the video.

Q.   You are sure about that? - A. Yes, I am. There was a
     clock on the video and I have seen myself being
     carried out at that time.

Q. You are absolutely certain you recognise yourself on
   the video being carried out? - A. Yes.

Q. Across the fence or which way did you get out? - A.
   Through the gate.

Q. Through a gate? - A. Through Gate 3.

Q. Does that mean you were conscious or unconscious at
   that time? - A. I was conscious but only just about.

Q. A bit dazed? - A. Yes.  In other words, there was no
   way I could get myself out on my own.  I needed help
   there.

Q. You say you have seen the video and you noticed the
   time at 15.04, four minutes past three? - A. Yes,
   that is right.

Q. After you got out obviously it was a great relief for
   you? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see anything of the match after that? - A.
   No.

Q. What makes you say that the video evidence indicates
   that the barrier broke after that? - A. I think they
   explained to me that the barrier had broke after I
   got out of the ground.

Q. Somebody told you that? - A. Someone told me.
                                                                33

                                                       J. THOMAS

 Q. It was what somebody else had told you? - A. You
    could not see it on the video but the Police told me
    it broke after I got out.

 Q. That is why the doubt has come into your mind? - A.
    Yes.

Q. Forget about what the Police told you or what the
   video might or might not show with regard to the
   breaking of the barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. The video is very good if you can see yourself on it,
   fair enough, but I want you to describe to me again
   what you felt and why at the time you felt that the
   barrier had broken? Forget all about whether you are
   right or wrong? - A. Because I went forward very
   suddenly. That was the main thing.

Q. You were obviously against it, were you not? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Did you feel it move at all so far as you now
   remember? - A. I did feel it under strain, the
   barrier under strain.

Q. It is really the forward movement which made you
   think it had given way? - A. A sharp forward
   movement.

Q. If you are right that the barrier went and you were
   definitely out at four minutes past then it must have
   happened before four minutes past? That is what you
   are saying? - A. If I was right.

Q. Show us on the little plan where you were? - A. Yes.

Q.    THE CORONER:       I just want to show you what you
     said in your statement about the barrier. It is more
     or less what you told me.  It is the bottom of the
     first page and the first line on the next page.   I
     want to just explain to you - hang on, that is the
     wrong statement.  Just give it back. This is the
     right one.  It is James Thomas? - A. Yes, that is
     right.

Q. Can you see in the middle? - A. Yes.

Q. That   is    basically what you are saying to me now? - A.
   Yes.

Q. What you are saying is that around three o'clock you
   felt the pressure of the barrier give way at that
                                                      J. THOMAS


     time? - A. That is what I felt had happened at the
     time.

Q. I, just want to go back to 1988 for one moment,
   okay? - A. Yes.

Q. Which pen were you in then in 1988? - A. I was in Pen
   4 in 1988.

Q. How did you get to that pen? - A. I came through the
   turnstiles, on to the concourse, and we were going to
   go up the tunnel but there was a steward actually at
   the front of the tunnel saying, "No, it is full up
   here, lads, go that way" and pointed us right -and we
   were into Pen 4. This would be around two o'clock.

Q. At two o'clock you say? - A. Yes, we got there early
   that year.

Q.   Can you just put up the plan of the ground? Who were
     you with that year? - A. I was with the lads who came
     in the minibus, Anthony Owen, Ian.

Q.   Were you    with Christopher?   - A. I wasn't, no.

Q.    You were much earlier that year? - A. We were a lot
     earlier.

Q. Just walk up to the plan and just direct us as to
   where you were going? Pick out the turnstile for
   him. - A. This is the turnstile we came through. We
   came to there and the steward was here and he
   directed us down this way. So we came in at this
   pen.

Q. Is that the   pen you were in where you are now
   pointing? -   A. This is the pen we were in. We    were
   around this   area by      Gate 2.

Q. That was in   1988? - A. That is right.

Q. You said it was Pen 4. Can you just show him where
   Pen 4, in fact, is so that we make sure? - A. It is
   this o n e .

Q. It is that one? - A. I thought the numbers were going
   the other way.

Q. It is the one you pointed to? - A. Yes.

Q. Just point again where you were? - A. This one.

Q. That is actually Pen 2? - A. Yes.

     MR. KING:  Sir,I think he said he thought the
numbers went the other way and    so  Pen 3,Pen 4, would make
sense.

Q.         THE CORONER:   Yes, it is quite all right. I
     just was not quite sure how it got to Pen 4 and I
     wanted to be clear in my mind. You are saying you
     arrived about two o'clock? - A. Yes.

Q. A steward was directing people round to the side
   including yourself at that time? - A. Yes.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:

Q. I just want to try and clarify, if we can, what you
   expected as normal and how, if at all, this differed
   from that. You said that as you got in you were able
   to make your way to a position about halfway down? -
   A. That is right.

Q. Did you have more than normal difficulty in making
   your way to that position halfway down? - A. Yes, it
   was difficult.




                          /Q. Because there were a lot of...
                                                                                36

                                                                      J.   THOMAS


Q.   Because there were a lot of people there? - A. That is
     right.
Q.   But that was not s o m e th i n g that s u r p r i s e d you, bearing
     in mi n d that this was a s e m i - f i n a l ? - A. It surprised
     me bec a u s e I e x p e c t e d a lot of people but not that
     many.
Q.   Of course, you were m ak i n g your w a y to what is the
     most p o pu l a r spot on the terrace, in other words just
     to the side of the goal? - A. That is right.
Q.   It is fair to say of that spot, b e c a u s e it is the
      choice spot, that people try to get that sort of
      pos i t i o n if they can? - A. Yes, they do.
Q.   What you said about it then to your friend was, "It's
     fairly p a cked in here" ? - A. That is what I said.
Q.   When you r e a c h e d your p o s i t i o n h a l f w a y down the
     terrace, h o w man y of your o r i g i n a l group of 13 or so
     were able to be r o u g h l y t o gether h a l f w a y dow n the
     terrace? - A. We sort of had to b r e a k off in groups
     them, m a y b e one or two, or e v e n on your own, because
     the surg e s were that s t rong we got split up straight
     away.
Q.   So h o w m a n y were sort of in your i m m e d i a t e vi c i n i t y ? -
     A. A f t e r a f ew m i n u t e s I w as on my own.
Q.   But w h e n y ou first got to the p o s i t i o n h a l f w a y down? -
     A. We were f a i r l y all together.
Q.   We are all trying to picture that, y o u see, in our
     mind's eye, that y o u come on t o the terrace, that it is
     fairly p a c k e d w i t h people, but you are able w i t h your
     friends to gain a p o s i t i o n a b o u t h a l f w a y d o w n to the
     right o f the goal, p r e t t y g o o d spot and you are all
     t ogether in a group? - A. Yes, that is right.
Q.   If n o t h i n g else had h a p p e n e d w o u l d y ou have b e e n h a pp y
     to have stood in that p o s i t i o n and w a t c h e d the m atch
     from there? - A. The amount of p eople that were in
     there, I w a s n ' t r e a l l y h ap p y at all as soon as I got
     in the ground.
Q.   Did y ou think, therefore, of c o m i n g o ff that terrace
     and s e e i n g if you c o u l d find a n o t h e r spot? - A. It
     wasn't r e a l l y a case of c o m i n g off. Y ou d i d n' t have
     no c h o i c e b e c a u s e there were that m a n y people there at
     that time.
                                                                            37

                                                                    J.   THOMAS


 Q.    That cannot be right, can it? You had just made your
       way h a l f w a y d o w n a terrace that was fairly packed? -
       A. I kn o w what happened.
 Q.    It would have be e n p e r f e c t l y reaso n a b le at that time
       to have turned to your friends and said, "This is too
       packed for me, I'm going to go and find a n o t h e r s p o t ” ?
       - A. I did, but, as I said, there was n o t h i n g you
       could do. There were that m a n y people there.
 Q.    Y ou say you either did that, or you said it to one of
       your f r iends? - A. I said that.
 Q.   At what stage re l a ti v e to g a i n i n g that pos i t i o n
      half w a y down, did y o u say that to them? - A. This was
      not long after we had a r r i v e d at that p o s i t i o n halfway
      down the terrace.
Q.    So not long after? - A. No.
Q.    What did your f r i e nd s say to you in answ e r to the
      s ugges t io n fr o m yo u that you thought you should move?
      - A. I didn't s ay we s h o ul d move. I said, "It's
      packed".
Q.    Y ou just said, "It's packed". So did you at a n y time
      then think of a c t u a l l y m o v i n g somewhere e l se ? - A.
      Well, we thought of it, but we k n e w there was n o t h in g
      we could do. The s i t u a t i o n was on the t e rrace, as you
      know, it goes d o w n h i l l and g oi n g uphill is m u c h harder
      w i t h the crowd sway, and it is h a rder to m o v e up than
      down.
Q.    I a p p r e c ia t e we are l o o k i n g back and we are a s k i n g you
      n o w about m o m e n t s only, but we have got to try, as far
      as we can, to look at it and press it and see just
      what the result is. Y o u got w i t h some d i f f i c u l t y
      h a l f w a y d o w n and a s s e m b l e d a g r o u p without the
      m o v e m e n t at this stage of 13 of you in an area, or
      that sort of number, a g r o u p ? - A. It was a b o u t that,
      yes.
Q.    That ve ry soon af t e r that you felt u n c o m f o r t a b l e ? - A.
      I did.
Q.    That you said to yo u r friend, "It's fairly p a cked"? -
      A. Yes.
Q.    But you did not say to a nybody, "Do you think we
      s h ould look for a n o t h e r spot?" - A. I didn't say that
      b ecause I kn e w it was u s e l e s s to look for a n o t h e r
      spot. Y ou could not move.
                                                                            38

                                                                   J.   THOMAS


 Q.    How long a f t e r you had got there are you saying that
       you could not move? - A. It w a sn't long after, not
       long at all. Y ou c ouldn't move a w a y from that spot
       really. You were m o v i n g i n v o l u n t a r i l y wi t h the crowd
       force.
 Q.    Then there were some surges? - A. That is it, yes.
 Q.    At first those surges were the surg e s that you perhaps
       well recognise, in other w o r d s the o n es that go down
       and then come back up again? - A. I d i dn't recognise
       these. These were a lot s tr o n g e r t h a n . n o r m a l because
       of the amount of people in that area.
Q.    Did they go d o w n and come back up a g a i n ? - A. Yes.
Q.    Then there was a surge w h i c h took yo u d o w n but did not
       come back up a g ain? - A. Yes, that is right.
Q.    Did you look to see whet he r there might be some more
      room at the f r on t ? - A. It was e v e n w o r se at the
      front
Q.    You could see that, could you? - A. I could see that.
Q.    I/hen these s urges take place w hich you say on this
       particular o c c a s i o n was w o r s e than y o u n o r m a l l y
      expect, is that s o m e t h i n g w h i c h is all part of the
      crowd and c e r t a i n l y before k i c k - o f f w h e n you are
      standing on the terrace b e h i n d the goal? - A. To be
      part of that, w h i c h was too m a n y peop l e , was not part
      of it, no.
Q.    I think, Mr. Thomas, if you can try and c o n c e n t r a t e on
      what I am a s k i n g y o u in o r d i n a r y terras, I am just
      saying to you that those s ur g e s u p and dow n the steps
      are o r d i n a r i l y part of the scene? - A. We are not
      talking in o r d i n a r y terms in this s i t u a t i o n . We are
      talking about a terrace w h i c h was too packed.
Q.            T HE C ORONER: Mr. Thomas, that m a y well be so.
      What Mr. M a n n i n g is trying to find out is this. We
      know that a lot of people d i e d on that terrace, so you
      do not have to p e rs u a d e us about that. What we are
      trying to find out is the p o s i t i o n at v a r i o u s points
      in time on that terrace. If y o u h ad gone in at h a l f ­
      past 1, for ins t a n c e , or say h a l f - p a s t 12, y o u might
      well have said it v a s e m p t y then, I do not k now? - A.
      I d e f i n i t e l y w o u l d ha v e done.
Q.    What Mr. M a n n i n g is trying to find out is at points in
      time. N ob o d y is s a y i n g a n y t h i n g a b o u t what it
      de ve l o p e d into, but he is trying to f i n d out from you
      how it was and h o w v j *            things c o m p a r e at different
                                                           J.   THOMAS


     points in time with your experience. - A. Yes. To be
     honest, I can't u n d er s t a n d what he means by time. Do
     you mean the time that I got in the ground until I got
     out? Is that what you are trying to say?
Q.         MR. MANNING: I am going to try and ask it in an
     entirely different way. Forget this particular day
     and this particular match. If you were standing in a
     crowded terrace just to the right of the goal, it is
     right, is it not, that pre-match the crowd sways up
     and down, surges up and down and regains its place? -
     A. It does, yes, but not like this was doing.
Q.   I did ask you, Mr. Thomas, to try and forget this
     particular game on this particular day. - A. Yes, it
     does surge at a normal match.
Q.   Yes, that is right, and then it settles down, usua l l y
     just after k ick-off and finds its level? - A. Yes,
     that is right.
Q.   Then it may very well have another surge or svay if
     there is an exciting incident? - A. Maybe a goal, or
     something like that.
Q.   A goal or somebody hitting the cross-bar? - A. Yes.
Q.   Or a near escape? - A. That is right.
Q.   What you are saying about the crowd on the day we are
     talking about n ow at H i l l sb o r o u g h is that those things
     happened but there were more people when they were
     happening than you n o r m a l l y experience? - A. Yes, and
     this caused the surges to be stronger because there
     were more people.
Q.   When you said that you w o u l d n o rmally expect to stand
     still in that crowd, that cannot be right, can it, Mr.
     Thomas? - A. I think it can.
Q.   I have just taken y ou through it, and I will do it
     again. Forget Hillsborough, forget that day. A
     normal match, s t anding in a choice spot, just to the
     right of the goal, the surging up and do w n pre-match,
     you cannot stand still, can you, when that is
     happening around you? - A. Yes, but it does, as you
     said, settle down, and it didn't settle down.
Q.   So what you mea n is that you expect the crowd after
     the swaying and the s u r g i n g to settle down and on this
     particular d ay it did not settle down so that you
     could settle down and w a t c h the match? - A. Yes.
                                                                       J.   THOMAS



                   C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by MR. K I N G :
 Mr. Thomas, I may have m i s u n d e r s t o o d your evidence. I
 thought you were t e l l i n g us that the surges were n ever
 normal surges? - A. No, they weren't n ormal surges,
 no.
 That is what I thought you said. I am a bit puzzled
 by your answer. What was abn or m a l about the surges at
 the game in 1989, any of the surges? - A. T h e y were
 very strong, they were p u s h in g p e o p l e over. You could
 not stay w i t h people. I went with p e o p l e * t o the m a t c h
 and you could not stay together. At an o r d i n a r y m a tc h
 you can.
 So at no time, is this your evidence, did y o u regard
 what was h a p p e n i n g to you on the terrace as part of
 the normal e x p e r i e n c e w h i c h you e x p e c t e d ? - A. It was
 very abnormal.
 Can I just go back to 1988. I am i n t e r e s t e d in the
 steward who d i r e c t e d you. Did you tell us that he
 actually told you w h y he was d i r e c t i n g you? - A. The
 steward d i r e c t e d me to the other pen b e c a u s e this one
 was full at 2 o'clock.
Did he tell you that? - A. He said, "Not              this way,
lads, it's full" and p o i n t e d us in a n o t h e r direction.
That is what I thought yo u said. I w a n t e d to check I
got it right. Just to c l a r i f y matters, you were not
in 1988 w i t h Mr. D e v o n s i d e and his son, were you? - A.
No, I wasn't.
              C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by MR. C A T C H P O L E :
Mr. Thomas, I assu m e y o u w o u l d agree w i t h me that w h e n
you go to f o otball m a t c h e s just g e n e r a l l y y o u do not
remember e v e r y t h i n g that h a p p e n s on the field, you do
not remember e v e r y incident, do you? - A. No, it w ou l d
be impossible to do so.
Just as in e v e r y d a y life as you go t h r o u g h things you
do not r e m e m b e r e v e r y i n cident. Y ou see cert a i n bits
of incidents, you r e m e m b e r c e r t a i n angles, is that
right? - A. Yes.
Just the same as w h e n y o u go into af o o t b a l l ground,
unless there is s o m e t h i n g e x c e p t i o n a l l y n o t i c e a b l e y ou
do not take m u c h n o t i c e of what the t u r n s t i l e s are,
which t u r n stile y ou have gone through, b e c a u s e you are
just going in b e c a u se y ou want to go a n d see the
match, is that fair? - A. Yes.
                                                                   J.   THOMAS


 In 1988 did you go to the .-natch with A n t h o n y Owen? -
 A. I did, yes.
 Did he go round to this o t h e r pen as well w i t h you?
 Were you together the whole time? - A. Yes, we were
 together.
 You see, A n t h o n y Owen gave evi d e n c e y es t e r d a y . He was
 asked a n u mb e r of q u e s t i o n s about the 1988 match and
 he was asked s p e c i f i c a l l y w h e t h e r he went into the
 same pen in 1989 as he had done in 1988, and he said
 " Y e s ” , and the pen that he went into in 1989 was Pen
 3, that is the pen you went into this year, you see.
 Do you f o l l ow that? - A. I f o l l o w that.
I am not c r i t i c i s i n g you beca u s e we have just agreed
there can be m i s t a k e n r e c o l l e c t i o n s and as a lavyer
you o ften see people who v e r y h o n e s t l y t hi n k about
things and forget to say about it, but it is obvious
from that, you w o u l d agree, that one or o t h e r of you
is m i s t a k e n about it? - A. That is right.
If I also told you, just to be f ully fair, that there
is a c o n s i d er a b l e b o d y of e v i d e n c e fr o m all the
stewards at the c l u b - and there m ay be f u r t h e r
e v idence - that s t e w a r d s n e v e r d i r e c t e d p e o p l e on that
concourse, whether s e m i - f i n a l s or any other match,
would it be fair to say that you could p o s s i b l y be
mi st a k e n ? - A. No, the s t e w a r d d e f i n i t e l y told me to
go right.
Will you just bear me out. As far as y o u are
concerned, your h o n e s t r e c o l l e c t i o n is that you, in
1988, went round to Pens 1 and 2? - A. That is right.
That diff e r s from A n t h o n y O w e n ' s r e c o l l e c t i o n . He has
told us he went into Pen 3 in 1988. Yo u r other
r e c o l l e c t i o n is that this w a s at 2 o'clock, so it was
a full hour before k i c k - o f f that you were d i r e c t e d
round? - A. Yes.
Importantly, you t h in k that someone, a person,
d i r e c t e d you round, and that is your r e c o l l e c t i o n ? -
A. Yes.
All I am aski n g y o u is w h e t h e r it is p o s s i b l e that you
c ould be m i s t a k e n about the i d e n t i t y of that person,
i.e. you think now, two y e a r s on, that he was a
stew a r d and, in fact, he m a y not have been, he may
have been a Police O fficer, he m a y have b e e n someone
else? - A. No. He h a d a y e l l o w top on w h i c h said
"Steward".

Q.   You are pos i ti v e it said " S t e w a r d ” ? - A. I am positive
     it did.
Q.   Perhaps I c ould also tell you as a fact f r om the
     stewards that the stewards' jackets at Sh ef f i e l d
     W e d nesday do not have "Steward" w r i t t e n on the.u. Th ey
     have an adve rt i s i n g , Umbro. Take it from me that that
     is a fact. Is it still po s s i b l e that you are
     mistaken? - A. Why w o u l d he direct us?
Q.   I am not c h a l l e n g i n g for a moment that you were
     directed. All I am s a y i n g is is it pos s ib l e you are
     mistaken? H a v i n g h e a r d all those f a c t o r s , - i s it
     possible that you are m i s t a k e n ? - A. I am not m i s t a k e n
     in the fact that he told us where to go. I thought he
     was official.




                                 /Q.    You thought he
                                                                      J.   THOMAS


Q. You thought he was an official, but you could be
   mistaken?   You accept you could be mistaken?    You
   accept he was not an official steward? - A. I could be
   but it looked like it to me, that he was official.

              C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by MISS S I N C L A I R :
Q. You said earlier when you had reached your first position
   on the terrace, your half way position, at that point you
   remember the teams being announced and you saw both teams
   coming on to the pitch? - A. I don't remember the
   Nottingham team coming on the pitch.

Q. It was after you reached that point the surges began? -
   A. No, that was before that point.

Q. Before that point the surges began, but it was after then
   the major surge happened? - A. That's right.

Q. That is the one you referred to as the surge which went
   down but didn't go back up? - A. That's the one, yes.

Q. After that the crowd had stopped moving? - A. The crowd
   had stopped moving, yes.

Q. Then after that you, and you said about fifty other
   people on the same level as you, suddenly moved forward?
   -A. Yes.

). That is when you thought, correctly as it turned out,
   that the barrier against which you were standing had
   broken? - A. I thought that is what had happened, yes.

  You said, quite understandably, that you were concerned
  about your personal safety at that time? - A. I was very
  concerned, yes.

|. Of course you were and obviously you weren't looking at
   what was going on on the pitch? - A. Yes.

i. Again you said you were dazed.   Do you remember after
   you fell forward with these other people on your level,
   where you ended up?   Perhaps I can help.   How far were
   you from the perimeter fence at that point? - A. I wasn't
   very far at all - a metre maybe.

• A metre from the perimeter fence? - A. I was in line with
  gate 3 | I remember that.

• You said you were carried out? - A. Yes.

. Were you carried out through that gate? - A. I was.
                                                  J.   THOMAS


. I know it is difficult, but can you give us some indicate
  of how long it was after you fell forward that you were
  carried out through the gate?   Did you feel, for
  example, you had to wait a long time? - A. It seemed a
  long time, yes.

, It seemed a long time to you*   Did you see other people
  being carried out before you through the gate? - A. Yes.
  There were people in front of me who were in line with
  the gate, but they were in front of me so they got out
  before me.

 Yes, I see.   Any idea how many people there were?   Were
 there, for example, five or ten, or less? - A. Maybe
 five.

            Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

 Mr. Thomas, are you a regular football supporter? - A. I
 am.

 Where do you normally like to stand when you go to
 matches? -A. I like to stand behind the goal because it
 is the best view.

 You told us that you arrived early in 1988 at two
 o'clock? - A. Yes.

Would you have expected to find the position you would
wish to stand in?   Would you expect to go into the
centre area that year? - A. It was difficult to judge
because I had never been to that ground before 1988 so I
didn't know what to expect.

Were you surprised when you were told the centre was full
at two o'clock? - A. Yes, we were disappointed.

You have told us that a steward directed you around.
Did you notice dividing fences on the terrace?   When you
went round to pen 2 did you see radial fences? - A. I
did.

What was pen 2 like when you got into it at two o'clock
in 1988?   Was it quite quiet there? - A. It was quite
quiet.

You could clearly see the radial fence.   Could you see a
gate at the back? - A. I don't remember a gate, no.

You didn't see a gate? - A. Well, I don't remember it.
There might have been one there but I don't remember
seeing it.
                                                       J.   THOMAS


 Q. Did you leave that pen at all to go, for instance, to the
    toilet and pass the tunnel or did you remain in the
    terraces the whole of the game.

 Q. You were quite happy to stay in that position? - A. I
    was.

Q. Did you look at the centre pens to see if they were full
   at two o'clock? - A. I didn t really look because the
   position we were in was OK to see the game.   We were
   bothered at first when we saw it had been closed but
   afterwards it was OK in the other pen.

Q. Yes, you just accepted where you had been directed? - A.
   We knew there was nothing we could do so we just accepted
   it.

Q. When you came in through the turnstiles that year, did
   you notice the tunnel ahead of you? - A. I did, yes.

Q. Where exactly was it that the steward spoke to you? - A.
   He was in front of the tunnel.

Q. Right in front of the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q.    Was the tunnel open so you could see down the tunnel? -
     A. Yes, the tunnel was open.

Q. So you could see the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. So he just prevented you from going down? - A. Yes.

Q. I was just wondering when you had made your statement.
   A number of people nave been referred to their statements
   and I am just wondering when you made yours? - A. Which
   statement is this?

Q. It is an interesting point this one.   I am just
   wondering how soon after the incident...

           THE CORONER:  It is a fair question he has asked
     because he has made more than one statement.    One of
     them was made on the 6th of July, 1989.    I will tell you
     because he won't remember the dates.    Another one was
     made on the 4th of May, 1989 and another one was made on
     the 8th of August, 1989.   That one isn't terribly
     relevant, the one of the 8th of August.    The first one
     was the 4th of May and the second one is the 6th of July,
     1989.

         MRS. McBRIEN:   Thank you:

. With the statements, you didn't write them out yourself?
  - A. No.
                                                  J.    THOMAS


. The Police Officer writes what you are telling him? - A.
  Yes.
               Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

. At the beginning of your evidence you mentioned the
  Safeway supermarket? - A. The Gateway supermarket*

. What has that got to do with it?   What did you do there?
  - A. We bought a couple of cans of beer and we drank
  them.

 Who is we? - A. Myself and a few friends.

 Is that the thirteen friends or so who went to the ground
 with you? - A. No, that was three of us at first who came
 by Amberline Coach.

 Where were you when you drank the cans of be«r? - A. We
 were sitting on a grassy bank, not far from the
 supermarket.

                Further by THE CORONER:

 I have got two or three questions from the jury and I am
 now hopelessly confused with regard to the times, so I am
 going to try and take you over it once more in my mind.
 The other thing is, Sergeant Killoch, do you think we
 could see whether we can find the video on which he
 identifies himself at four minutes past?   We will show
 you a few videos and see whether you can find yourself.

     SERGEANT KILLOCH: Perhaps I could speak to the
witness afterwards and try and identify it.

     THE CORONER:   We will see if we can find it because
I would like to know whether that timing is a correct
recollection:

What I want to ask you is this:  in one of these things,
the one I showed you was the May one, but in the 2nd of
July statement you describe Beardsley hitting the
crossbar? - A. Yes.

Did you see that? - A. I didn't see it, but there was a
big roar in the crowd and I learned that was when he hit
the crossbar afterwards, which is before I made the
s tatement.

So you never saw that incident? - A. I didn't, no.

When you say that something happened at the time when
Beardsley hit the crossbar it is a reconstruction?    You
are trying to put the various bits together in the light
                                                  J.   THOMAS


of what happened to you plus what you were told? - A.
Yes.

I am not trying to catch you.    I am just trying to make
sure, we have got this right because... > A. There was a
big roar as if something happened, but I didn't really
care what happened.

Where were you when   that happened?   Were you still on
the terrace? - A. I   was on the terrace.

You were definitely on the terrace.    Was that the point
in time when the barrier appeared to give way?    Forget
about what you have seen on videos or was it earlier that
you saw these fifty people tumble forward? - A. I would
say it was earlier.

I will show you this statement as well.   Just have a
look and then we will let you have a quick look at the
video if we can.   If you start reading from here and if
you read about the first five lines on the next page. -
A. Yes, that's right.

Is that right? -A. Yes, that is before.     That is what I
said.

Does what you have just read fit in with your
recollection of what happened? - A. Yes.

I will read it. What it says in this statement - it is
quite important because we are trying to pinpoint this
barrier to a certain extent:

    "Soon after, after three to four minutes into the
    game Beardsley hit the ball over the bar and there
    was a further surge forward which was a lot worst
    than the first.    As a result I was forced away
    towards the field to a point where my chest was
    pinned against the crush barrier nearest to the
    pitch.    I was having difficulty breathing.    I was
    positioned as you look at the pitch on the left-hand
    third of the barrier and it was at this time I saw
    Gary Church standing up against the centra section
    of the same barrier about five or six feet away from
    me.    Gary was shouting for help saying h« couldn t
    breathe, but I could not help.    At about four
    minutes past three I felt the crush barrier bending.
    I could not move and my feet were not on the ground.
    Within seconds I felt the barrier give way and I was
    immediately carried forward to a point approximately
    three feet away from the perimeter fence gate.^ I
    looked around and I could not see the barrier."

                                                                                 48

                                                                           J. THOMAS

    - A. This time I gave as three or four minutes past is
    c learly a guess.   I wasn't really c o n c er n e d about the
    time.    On this statement that was a guess of the time.

B




                                    Q. That was a guess.   If we exclude
                                                                       J.   THOMAS


     0. That was a guess.            If we exclude the timings for
        minute, would the a c c o u n t of what h a p p e n e d be right in
        the sense that that is what happened, that there was a
        big surge which c a r r i e d you against the c r u s n barrier,
        whicn was a s s o c i a t e d wi t h a roar, w h a t e v e r that roar
        might nave been? - A. Yes.
 Q.     And it was at that p o i n t you were aga i n s t one bit of
        tne barrier, Gary was to one side of you. - A. lie was
        rurtner along, yes.
 Q.     He spoke to you and said, "Help", you c o u l dn ' t , tnen
       you felt tne b a r r i e r g i v e way and you fin i s h e d up. three
       feet from the p e r i m e t e r fence, with e v e r y b o d y tumbling
       forward. Forget the timing now, w h a t e v e r time it might
       nave been. Is that the s eq u e n c e ? - A. That is right.
Q. Subsequently you a s s o c i a t e d tnat big roar with
   Beardsley hitting the crossbar, but that is a bit of
   reconstruction? - A. Yes.
0. I am not c r i t i c i s i n g you for that because you were
   doing your best? - A. Yes.
0. But at the time you did not see the shot. Did you hear
   anybody in the pen say, " B e a r d s l ey has just hit the
   crossbar", or a n y t h i n g like that because that might
   help? - A. I do n ' t r e a l l y reme m b e r a n y o n e s ay i n g that.
   The main thing, wh a t m a d e me say that in the statement,
   was afterwards, w a t c h i n g things on telev i s i o n and it
   was a big roar, it was the loudest cheer of the day
   really.
D.    I see.     Anything else y ou want to ask out of that?
              HR. ISAACS:            Sir, I just wo n d er e d w h e t h e r in
      tnose c i r c u m s t a n c e s it would be right for you to ask
      tnis witness h ow m u c h m o r e of his e vidence is
      r e c onstruction based on what he has been told, or what
      he has seen a fter the event? It is i m p o r t a n t because
      it seems that a good de a l of what he said m a y well not
      be his impressions of the day but, as is so easy, as we
      all know, for s o m e t h i n g to happen, to be r e c o l l e c t i o n s
      after the event of s o m e t h i n g that he has seen since the
      event.
          T H E CORONER:         Y ou heard that but I w i l l ask you
     directly. You have told us q u i t e a lot a b o u t getting
     in and h ow you* felt, and h ow p a c k e d it was at various
     positions. What we are trying to find out is that what
     you felt, thought and said at the time, or w a s it
     something which you l a t e r on thought abou t ? - A. No,
     that was de f i n i t e l y at the time. There was no way I
                                                                                      50

                                                                           J.   THOMAS


              could r e co n s t r u c t that in my mind. That will stick
              with me forever.           I saw that, I was there.
    B              THE CORONER:   I d o n' t tnink, fir. Isaacs, we can
              really take it very much f u r t n e r tnan that.
                   MR. ISAACS:   Of c o u rs e not, sir. One can believe
              you are saying wnat you b e l i e v e is rignt and of course
              not be accurate, just like the steward's shirt.
                   THE COROWER:      That is right. I.'ell, he has told
             us what his r e c o llection is. whether he is right or
             not # • • •
                  MR. KING:   Sir, we have not lost track, have we,
             that we were going t.o have a look at nis video?
                  THE CORONER:   No, I h a v e n ' t lost track, b e c a u s e
             that mignt be the answer.

    D             MR. KING:   Absolutely, becau s e he did say tne
             video showed him out of the pen at 4 -minutes-past.
                  THE CORONER:   Yes, exa c t l y .     If that is correct
             then we know that roar ....
                 MR. KING:   We know when Be a r ds l e y hit the
            crossbar, absolutely, sir.
                 THE CORONER:          I was ju s t trying   to r e c o n s t ru c t it
            as far as one could on his evidence.             It is difficult.
            I find it d i f f i c ul t anyway.
        0. Mr. Thomas, you have done ve ry well and what I would
           like you to do now is one of my O f ficers will try and
           find the video where you can see yourself, and then we
           might just have quick g l an c e at it ourselves. There
           are a few q u e s t io n s from the Jury, Mr. Thomas, whicn I
           forgot. 1988 first of all. - A. Yes.
        Q. when you were dir e c t e d by w h o e v e r it was, steward or
           whatever, to go round the sides at the tunnel, can you
           remember w h e t h e r the gates of the tunnel were shut or
           were they open? - A. They were d e f i n i t e l y open.
        0. Definitely open, and can y o u r e m e m b e r in 1988, when you
           were walking towards the ground, w h e t h e r you were
           stopped at a dis t a n c e from the g r o u n d and had tickets
           and things like that checked? - A. We were stopped by a
           bridge. We came from the o p p o s i t e way than we did in
           '89. we came from that way, if you see what I mean,
           towards the ground, and we were stop p e d on a bridge by
           the Police, asked had we got tickets, and we had to
           show them and then we were d i r e c t e d to tne turnstiles.

              0. You, of course, had a ticket? - A. I did.
              0. Did you see anybo d y who did not have a ticket in 1989?
     B           - A. I didn't.
              Q. And back to the tunnel again, in '83, did anybody
                 object to being told they could not go dow n there, as
                 far as you remember? - A. No, no one o b j e c t e d because

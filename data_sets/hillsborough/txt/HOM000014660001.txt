    Dear Sir
                  On the 15th.        of April 1989 1 was present at the Hillsborough
    Stadium,      Sheffield.      1 have     loyally supported Liverpool                          F,C,    for many
#   years,    needless to say what occurred that afternoon had nothing to do
    with football. However, I was fortunate, hundreds of others were sot. In
    the aftermath many words have been spoken but since then,                                     I have firmly
    ■believed that the disaster was due to complacency and incompetence on
. the part of the senior Police officers of South Yorkshire.
                  The Taylor report gave me some satisfaction in that the true
    cause of the'tragedy was brought to light. However, the real importance
    of 'the report is surely to prevent such a disaster ever occurring again.
    Personally speaking I don't feel                  that any criminal charges should be
    aade    against      any    officer,     to have    the      death      of      95 people             on    their
    conscience is surely enough. •              ■
               . However,       I believe that Mr. Peter Vright, the Chief Constable
    should resign. 'As head of the South Yorkshire force he was ultimately
    responsible for the police operation and for the subsequent actions of
    his officers.        It was right and honourable that he should tender his
    resignation,      which is more than can be said about the                                actions of the
    South     Yorkshire         Police     authority.     Their          failure             to     accept       Ms
    resignation was. a betrayal of their duty and worse still a failure to
    learn the lessons of Hillsborough. They seem to believe that the Taylor




    when there is no change at the top.
                  The Taylor report helped to restore sty faith in justice, which
    is     more   than    can    be   said    about     the   Police           authority.            I    have    no
    confidence      in them and sadly none              in Hr.          Peter Vright.              I am unsure
whether you have any influence over their decision however,   I feel that

I must register my protest at their decision and voice my grave concern

over the actions of the authority.


                                       Yours sincerely

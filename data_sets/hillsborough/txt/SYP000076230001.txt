                 I am the above      person and from Friday,               the 9th of June,    1989 (090689)

                 I will   reside at the above address.

                 I am the Chief reporter for the Nottingi’                     Evening Post,       this company
                                                                       t
                 is based in Forman Street,             Nottingh                4       as a part of my

                 job over the last two football seasons I have been reporting on the

                 aspects of the policing of football matches                    in Nottingham.

                 On Saturday the 15th of April             1989 (150489)        I went to the the F.A. Cup

                Semi Final match a t ^Hi1 lsborough in Sheffield,                   I went as a reporter

                with three police officers from Nottingham,                     these police officers were
                                                                                             PAGE     2|
                                                                                             S2049

We arrived at the at the ground at about 9.30am <>Q93Q//|and I was

introduced to various senior police officers andytjpe She_ffjj

Football Liaison Officer,          the briefing took place at 10.00am,                     I wasn't

allowed into the briefing.

After the briefing the South Yorkshire Police   p^ubl i V) re lat i ons officer
                                                  A
spoke to me and introduced me to Chief Superirr^jeiyaent David

Duckenfield,      I had a short      interview with him.

I asked him three questions,              firstly why I wasn't allowed into the

briefing,     he explained that he wasn't              concerned over anything he may

have said but over the possibility of one of the officers asking a

"silly question".

I asked him if he was happy with the plan he had got ready to police

the game,     he said he was.

I then asked him about the allocation of tickets and stands                              in the

ground,     to this he explained that the system had worked the previous

year and that geog raphi cal ly it was da s ie// t o police.

Later we went to the railway stat^onfj^o se^/the Forest fans arrive f o r

y fy   game we returned to the grc<un^a/t afiout 1.30pm (1330) we stood in

Pe/nistone Road North a gain watching the fans as they got from the

bi.ses and made their way into the g r o u m

Aty about    1 .45 pm we went up rlerries Road ^<Sutl'| ^ W wcfr ds the coach park,

again to watch the fans

Whilst we were there a Yorkshire police officer,                        either a Chief

Inspector or a Superintendent              came over to us and started speaking to

Sergeant BRAZENER,        he told us then,          that there had been some trouble

and that the police had closed down a number of local                          pubs,    he said

that J f he trouble makers,        were, as far as he knew,              from Liverpool.

We /eturned to Penistone Road North an 4 sto/fl there until about 2.40pm

(1440)  when Sergeant BRAZENER
  1---------------------- ------ said that!

                                              / l had a message
                                                         ------- that the
km/ck off h a d   been   delayed    for    15 m i n u t e s V / w eN to l ^ / t h e fans th i s for
                                                                             PAGE          3
                                                                             S2049

4-5 minutes as by this time the Forest fans were running to the

ground,   just after this   I heard that the kick-off was to go ahead at

3.00pm    (1500) and that it wasn't to be delayed.        The fans were going

into this end of the ground in an orderly fashion.

The next thing I heard was Sergeant BRAZENER say that there was a

pitch invasion,    I couldn't hear the police radios myself,          the

officers had ear pieces     in.

Just   prior to this point I had heard the police say that there was

some trouble at the Leppings Lane end,       they decided going round but

Sergeant BRAZENER decided to stay at the Spion Kop end and watch the

Forest fans.

At the message of i g f pitch invasion w e made our way quickly into the

Spion Kop enjlXwX made our way through the crowd and to the front

fence.

A police office     let us through a gate onto the pitch,         by this time

play had just stopped and the players were by the players tunnel                   ready

to go off,    there was a line of police officers at the edge of the

penalty area at tl-$ L^pp:ing4 Lane end,     I could see Liverpool          fans

climbing over X\ynr fleWces onto the pitch and up into the seats above
--------
t/ie t e rr ac e, I couldMsee police officers attempting to push them b a c k .

 e went through the line of police officers Sergeant BRAZENER and PC

WALTON went straight up to the goal area PC HOAD and I made our way

there as we 11.

My initial    reaction was that there was a pitch ,invasion going on,

however by the time I had run the length of/the pitch it came clear to

me that something was wrong.      The e r r ^ r j j ^ r l T e was open a nd fans

shilling onto the pitch were ho 1dinq^/tne i r clfles^s A nd collapsing.

There appeared to be a state of confusion,         allot/o-   police officers

were assisting the people who were      injured.    V^stayeB^backoutof             the

way with PC HOAD,    the officers with me were all wearing full
                                                                                      PAGE    4
                                                                                      S2049

f lourescerit yellow jackets they were the only officers wearing them.

I saw Sergeant BRAZENER and PC WALTON go up to the area of the pen

gates and start pulling people away and assist them,                      I would estimate

that the two officers moved about               12 people from the pen area onto the

pitch and PC WALTON gave mouth to mouth resuscitation to about four-

people I also saw Sergeant BRAZENER                  performing heart m a s s a g e , I was

attmepting to stay with PC HOAD as I was                   in civilian clothing and the

police wanted me off the pitch.

I saw Sergeant BRAZENER and PC WALTON attempting to revive a young lad



the blue stripes were

        he had fair hair/, he/ws s a very thin lad, this was taking place

 in the Liverpool goalkeepers f r a / n .           right hand corner of the„i> yard

box,    they worked on him for at least 5 minutes he was carried off on a

stretcher by fans with a policeman,                  I don't know if he survived.

The officers worked on another man just outside the 6 yard box in

the centre of the goal,      the man wa              in fllis late 4 0 ’s or early 30"s

"he was s tripped    to the waist,        he        tad a/a receeding nair     line and

black lace up shoes,      he had a larg ; stAnlach li><e a "beer bel ly” they

worked on him for some time,          they < avaf upHrtte man was alive when the

others started to assist him he was\ jerking about, as if he was having

a fit, a St Johns ambulance man came over and had a look at the man

I can remember those                 ie/ clearly,        there

but    I cannot be specific,    I did not see anyone do anything that                  I

would classify as a criminal act.                   Forest fans at the other end of

the    pitch were booing and hissing.                They didn't know what was going

on,    some Liverpool   fans got up tight over this and the po3/| ce hati to

put up a cordon to prevent the Liverpool                   fans getting at tjlrie Fey est

         f a n s .By this time doctors and ambulance     crews were a rr i v i n g .   The

         three Nottingham police officers with me allowed them now to take

         over looking after the       injured, most of the dead and injured had gone

         and Liverpool   fans were wandering       round aimlessly in a daze.

         We all made our way out of the ground and into the sports hall that

         was being used as a mortuary,      we had a drink of coffee and returned to

         the stand for the debrief .

         Overall,    in my opinion there appeared fa      Jn a lack of direction,            co

         the officers worked vei       well, also thW/ambulance and fire service

         seemed to take a very jfong time to attend,        also I didn't see anyone

         who    I could identify at the game as a steward.

Dear sir,

                          The Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster

I have been approached by representatives of the families of the 96 football fans who lost their lives
in the above tragedy.

The fateful events have been the subject of a Judicial Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Justice
Taylor and most recently a Judicial Scrutiny conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. A coroner’s
court inquest also took place following the publication of the Taylor Report that recorded a verdict
of accidental death.

It is accepted by the Home Office that negligence by the South Yorkshire Police and in particular the
officer in charge, Superintendent Duckinfield, was the main contributor to the 96 deaths. However
from statements made by the Home Secretary there does not appear to be any avenue of redress
available to the families in English law.

There is clearly a duty of care on the Police services when policing sporting events. The Police
forces of the UK have special rights conferred on them by governments which are outside the body
of common law. The Police powers are therefore the powers of the State.

 If indeed it were possible to show that one or more Articles of the Convention have been breached
 would therefore the Government of the United Kingdom be indictable?

 Can the failure of the UK government to order a new inquiry be referred to the ECHR? Could the
 verdict of the coroner’s court be so referred?

 I can assure you there is widespread public interest in this matter therefore any advice you can give
 would be most welcome:

 yours sincerely




 Richard Corbett MEP

                                      cane on duty at ay nornal place of work
 Askern Section station I was actually on Weekly leave but had volunteered to
 work at Hillsborough. Fro* my section I travelled to Adwick Police Station fro*
 where I was transported to Doncaster Police Station and fron there to Hillsborough
 Football Ground,
 At the groung we were briefed and I was attached to serial 59 which had duties for the .             i
 Penistone Road Area prior to the football Batch which I patrolled with Pc 8 McDonnell
 Most of ay time prior to the natch starting tine was spent out side a bakers shop which
 was serving sandwiches and was therefore attracting quite large nunbers of supporters

 At this tine we were aainly involved with the Nottinghan forest supporters who were
 generally well behaved although it was quite apparent that nany had been drinking
 and nany were drinking from cans as they nade their way to the ground*
  The only incident prior to the natch that required use to leave the area we were patrolling
  was that a public house further along penistone Hoad in the direction of the city centre
  was having problems with supporters but we were cancelled prior to our arrival

    Shortly after 3 pm we were told to make our way to the ground as there was some problen
A e x a c t l y what is not clear but there was some talk of a gate collapsing and a pitch invasion
    so we nade our way with other nenbers of the serial back towards the ground and went into
    the ground through the gate which gives access to the Police Soon. There we awaited
    deployment stoodby the side of the Kop.

  After 5 or 10 ninutes we were deployed infront of the kop to contain the Nottinghan
  Forest Fans who were once again resonably well behaved considering they did not know what           J
  was happening although neither did we until I saw ikjured people being carried froai the            |
  other end of the ground in large numbers and Liverpool Fans cane to the Kop end to renove
  advertising homings to use as stretchers.
  I remained on this deployment throughout the incident and saw little or none of the events w!
  which had occurred at the other end of the ground*

   When it was announced that the natch had been abandoned I returned to the Penistone Road
   as the Nottingham Forest Fans departed. After the vast najority had left we were asked to
   return to the North Stand from where we were eventnally direct to go to Claywheels Lane
   where we were fed and then stood down and conveyed back to Doncaster and fron there
   I was transpoted to my own section from where I went off duty at 7 j b the sane day*

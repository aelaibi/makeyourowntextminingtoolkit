walked        down          the       tunnel          there        were         people       urinating                against          the       wall        in

the     tunnel,              There             were     no     problems           walking             along          the    tunnel,              Th e

time     no w was            a       couple          of m i n u t e s       after       15.00             hrs.

As     I got       to       the       end       of    the      tunnel           and was          about          to    go    into       the       pens        a

large        crowd          came          behind        me     and      I was         pushed          into       the       pens       and       was

squashed,               I s aw            a Police           Officer            walking          on       to    the    pitch          he    spoke           to

the     referee             and       the       game      was      stopped,             1 was             in P e n     4 and          I thought              as

the     game       had       been          stopped           the       pressure         would             ease       a n d we     would          all

being     pushed       to       the       left,           I looked            at    the       f r o nt    railings              and    I

thought        that    I could             never          get      over       those.            There          were        s om e     railings

to m y    left       which          were      a    lot       lower       and       I decided             to    tr y    and       get       to

these     arid get         out       o ve r       them.

As     I was    getting               near         to    the r a i l i n g s        i saw a m an              start        to fall.,

sa w   him     he was       holding               on    to        the    railings.             He     was      a white male                about

40-50     years       of    age       wearing             glasses.              He w a s        about         5*11"        tal 1,          he   wa s

plump     he    had a       light          green anorak                  which          was     torn      while        we       were       holding

him    up,      I was       then          helped          o v er    the       railings            into        P e n 5.          I then

helped        other    people             over         the    railings.                 Then      some        on e    said       to

me     I should       go    o n to        the      pitch.           I walked             onto       the       pitch        and      stood        in

the    goal     mouth       to       get      my       breath       back,.          I was         not     injured




There    was       a Police           Sergeant               by    the    g o al.            I said       to     him       that       there      are

people        crushed       in the            pen,           He    said       Yes       I know        and      he w a s         talking          into

h is   radio.

1 walked        over       to       the    South          Stand         and     sat      at     the      front        by    the       IS y a r d

line.         I saw 2       people            that        I. t h o u g h t      were         doctors          trying        to      revive       a

young     lad      there        was       a group            of y o u t h s        looking          on    to     see       if    he w a s

revived.           After        a    couple            of m i n u t e s       they       stopped          and        said       he was          dead.

I sat     there       'watching            people            being       carried             on s t r e t c h e r s        from       the

Leppings        Lane       end       to    the         other       end.         I eventually                  left     the       g r o u n d at

about     5    pm„

While     in    the    ground             1 did         not       see    anything             I consider              to    be      a Criminal

being     pushed          to      the       left.           I looked           at    the     front        railings             and    I

thought        th a t     I could            never          get     over       those.           There         were        s o me     railings

to m y    left       which were                  a    lot    lower and              I decided           to    try a n d         get       to

these     and       get      out       over          them.

As    I wa s    getting                n e ar        to   the r a i l i n g s        1 saw a man          start       to fall.

Myself        and about                three          other people             grabbed him and                 pulled          him     back

up.      We    held       him          up    until          we got       him    to     the r a i l i n g s .        The        last       time        I

saw    him     he w a s        holding               on to        the    railings.           He     was      a white           male       about

40-50     years         of age             wearing          glasses.            He    wa s      a b o u t •S'1 1 ” tall,                  he wa s

plump     he    ha d a         light         green          anorak       which        was       torn/while            we       were       holding

him    up.      I was          then         fyelped o v e r          the       railings          iiyio P e n 5.                I then

helped        other       people            over       the      railings.             Then       so/he one          said        to

me    I should          go     onto         the       pitch.         I walked          onto/the              p i t c h a nd         stood       in

the   goal      mouth          to      get m y         breath        back.           1 was/not           injured           but       for       a few

weeks    afterwards                   my    stomach          wa s    not       very    w e ll.

There    was        a Police               Sergeant          by the        goal.           I said        to/him           that       there       are

people        crushed          in the            pen.        He     s a i d Ye s      I k n o w arya he was                    talking          into

his    radio.                                                                                       /

I walked        over         to       the    South          Stand       a nd    sat    at       t^fe f r o n t      by     the       18 y a r d

line.         I saw 2          people            that       I thought          were        doctors           trying        to       revive       a

young     lad       there         was       a group          of     youths          looking        on    to     see       if    he w a s

revived.            After         a    couple         of m i n u t e s         they    stopped and               said          he    was       dead.

I sat     there         watching             people          being       carried           on    stretchers               from       the

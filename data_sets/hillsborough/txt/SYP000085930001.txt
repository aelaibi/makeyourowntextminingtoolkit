We were transported to Hillsborough for a briefing by a double decker

bus.    The briefing was held in the North Stand.

At 10.30 am after the briefing Serial S3 had a packed meal.                        At about

10.50 am we left the ground and walked towards the

Hillsborough Precinct.          The serial was to patrol the Precinct and

Middlewood Road to its ju ntftion with Bradfield Road.

         I had to physically move three persons from the road to clear a way

         through.       A number of the persons ho refused to move were obviously

         At about 1700 I was instructed by Inspector Humphries to resume our

         original      points at the Hillsborough Precinct.

         At about 1730 hours we made our way back to the football ground.                         We

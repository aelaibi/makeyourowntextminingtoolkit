            Thank you for your latter of the 12 January 1990. With
            reference to our telephone conversation today I confirm that
            the Director of Public Prosecutions informs you, under Section
            16(1)(b) of the Coroners Act 1988, that a person has been
            charged before examining justices with manslaughter alleged to
            have been committed in circumstances connected with the death
            of Sedershan Singhal not being the manslaughter of Sedershan
            Singhal. The Director requests you to adjourn the inquest
            until after the conclusion of the relevant criminal
            proceedings,

             Dear Stefan,




                     Thank you very much for your letter of the 14th May.

                  I hope all went well for you and that you do                           not
             have the unenviable task of resuming your Inquest.

                  You will remember I mentioned the other day the
             recent Court of         Appeal decision concerning our brother
             Coroner for Wolverhampton.          There was an interesting
             article in The Independent about it and also The Times.
             Were you able to get a transcript of the Judgement of the
             Court of Appeal decision, because I think it would be
             very interesting and useful for a number of cases I have
             coming up?          I   will, of course, be delighted to   pay
             copying c h a r g e s .

                                                     Yours sincerely

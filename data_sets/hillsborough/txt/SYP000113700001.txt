myself     and PC Ro yl e were           i n s t r u c t e d by the Serial S e r g e a n t             to make

our way     down       to Gate        *0" and   this we did. N u m erous                persons were

still     in the       Five Ar c h e s P u b l i c House and there were                  still        fans

walking     down       H e r r i e s Road towards        the ground.           Some     had    clearly had               a

drink.      Some       fans    e n q u i r e d how far     it was to the          ground and whe n told

On arrival       at Gate        " O ’ I could see         that     the general           area was        clear       of

fans,     although       there were       one or     two     hanging ar o u n d and as we                    got    to

the actual       gate we were           i nstructed       to go     inside        the    ground as           there

was f 'some sort         of    bother".      Numerous        officers         i n c l u d i n g :our    serial

   ile red the gr o u n d and made           our way along            the side          of    the    pitch near

 he N or th stand and. as              1 looked     into     the    pitch       I could see            the

players     being      lead     from the field.            I looked towards                  the Leppings

Lane    end and       near     the area of gate 2. on the                  diagram       I could see what

only a p p e a r e d to be a public             order    situation.            Persons were             on the

pitch arid persons             were    climbing     over     the    fence      onto      the    pitch.

1 looked       to an a rea d i r ectly          behind     the goal         and    could see           persons

being     lifted from          the terrace are a         into      the     stands above.               On arrival

at the L e p p i n g s    Lane    end    I took     up a position to the                     right     of the

goal and       in this are a          people were       scr e a m i n g    that    they w a n t e d      to get

out    because     people were          getting     crushed.         As      I looked         I could see a

body on the        floor a g a i n s t    the    concrete        in which         the    fence was

embedded.        Pers o n s     in the    crowd were         trying        to hold back             people     so

that    this    body     could be       lifted but       the     crowd kept         pushing          forward.            I

went    to the fence           and helped       people     over     the fence           onto    the     pitch and

forwards        i / order         to break          it,      I did not see             the fence         give way

be c a u s e / f was       instructed          by a S e r g e a n t       to help       persons       out    of the

terrjrcing via gate 4 m a r k e d on the diagram.                                     Otar brief was         to get them

-oifto the      pitch       in an orderly manner,                       I ddv not       recall      whe n this          gate

was     opened.        P e r s o n s .were-by this             time       climbing         over    the    dividing

t errace       fence       in order          to* get out       through          gate 4.       I he l p e d       people

onto     the    pitch a n d         the m a j o r i t y were           sweating and b r eathing                  heavily.

Some     just       fell    to the       floor       on the       pitch       to recover.           The m a j o r i t y

a f t e r a few seconds- sat                  up after        they      had got their             breath.         None

that     I saw a p p e a r e d       injured.             After       a short while          I became        aware       that

the     fence       that was        being      rocked too and                fro    had been broken and                 bent

back     such that          it a l l o w e d     persons       to      get off        the t e r racing       onto       the

pitch.         This a rea was            gr a d u a l l y    clearing arid I then became                     aware       of a

large      number      of o f f icers and             fans     to      the    left     of the      goal     in the area

of gate        3 on the          d i a g r a m and    1 then became                aware    of bodies        being

brought        onto    the       pitch.        Im m e d i a t e l y    I realised that             these were           dead

bodies and a l t h o u g h           officers and fans were                        carrying       out m o u t h    to

mouth      I knew      this       was    futile,,           I thought         about     going      over     to this

are a    but    I c o uld,see           that     it was a l r e a d y an o v e r c r o w d e d are a and                 I

deci d e d     to    concentrate             on the area          in front          of me this        being       the

broken       fence.         By    this       time    it a p p e a r e d      to be     clearing and          I saw a

man     on the t e r r a c i n g        obv i o u s l y     in a daze with some minor                     facial

injuries.            I shouted          for him to           corne onto         the    pitch but         he. kept

shaking        his head.           Eventually             the man       came       towards    me and        I helped

him     onto .the, pitch.               He    smelled s t r o n g l y of            intoxicants.            As    I walked

him on to the              pitch     two officers,,            one male and one female,                      took       him

off my hands and                 lead him away              for medical            treatment.         I could now

see     numerous       dead       bodies       on the        pitch and fans and offi cers( were

carrying them a w a y on a d v e r t i s i n g                  hoardings.             Everything         seemed to
slow    down and all             I did was         console        people aro u n d me,              tried      to assure

people      that     friends         they were          looking     for were alright.                   Noth i n g more

could be done.              People         w ere w a n d e r i n g a r o u n d the          pitch and         I was

approaching          them just           reassuring         them.         I was       then d e t a i l e d     to gd to

the half way          line.          I presume w ith ,a vie w               to stop L i verpool                fans,

going     towards         the Notts.          Forest      end.      Some ' o f        the L i v e r p o o l    fans were

clearly       insensed a n d angry and                   I had to         p hysically         restrain a few

fans    from going any               further.           At a bout 4 . 3 0 p m         {1630)     I was        detailed

The    fans        left in a n o r d e r l y manner.

off    duty at 7pm          (1900)          I think.                              <

In answer         to q u e s t i o n 6.          I DID NOT        handle       any bodies.

In response          to q u e s t i o n 7.         I had no feelings at the                      time.         I thought

that    the       only dead         persons were           the    ones on the pitch.                   I w ould

estim a t e       this to be          10.      I was a s t o u n d e d whe n          the    figure     during        the

evening       kept    rising.            In the      cold    light        of day my          personal         feelings

were    that      I aid not          do enough and              could h a ve/€one more.                 Reg a r d i n g

the    policing       of    the      event       I can only s a^/lhat                 I have w o r k e d other

Semi    Finals       before        and      I could not j^fderstanci what went wrong.                                 I can

only    reflect       that       I w o rk e d     the    s^fme event        last year           and    I was       on duty

sea r c h i n g   persons        before       the^r entered, the Leppings Lane                         turnstiles.

E v e r y t h i n g was    goodi h u m o u r e d and        fans a r r i v e d        g r adually      up to kick

off    time an d there             were     no    congr e g a t i o n s   at     the turnstiles.

At 3pm      (1500)        kick     off time        only a handful              of supporters            ente r e d the

year.       They were         the     same       teams     playing and Liverpool                    had been

            an o p i n i o n that       persons who were            trying         to get   into the L e p pings   Lane

            end had tickets             but   there must        have        been a fair      number   of fans who

            had t r a v e l l e d w i t h o u t   tickets.

            I. w o u l d ad d that       there was        no   chain of        command      on the    pitch during

            the      incident     but    on r e f l e c t i o n w o u l d    this    have made any difference.

            No    one will      know.

Summary

4.     Following up the meeting which you had with Merseyside MPs, Derek Twigg
asks further questions about the role of the DPP and the decision not to bring any
criminal charges after the disaster. The points which he raises are about the
decision-making of the DPP, and are therefore not matters about which we are in a
position to express a view, except insofar as these issues were addressed by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered in detail the
advice offered to the DPP at the time and found no reason to question it. He also
concluded that there was nothing in any of the material which had been put to him
which might cause the DPP to re-consider the decisions previously taken. When
you published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report you made clear that the Attorney
General and the DPP accepted his conclusions. A self-explanatory draft reply is
attached.

p C iV e ) * * -
I am writing to say thank you for the time you gave to myself and the Merseyside MPs last
Wednesday evening when we discussed the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Evidence
Report.

You will recall that I asked you specific questions about the role of the DPP and the lack of
prosecution of the Police Officers who have been found to be mainly responsible for the disaster
along with, of course, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

In view of the mass of evidence now available laying the main responsibility for the disaster at the
door of the Police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, I just cannot understand why no
charges were ever brought and I was still not clear in my own mind from the answers you gave
that those questions had been adequately answered. I would like to put them to you again as
follows:

1.     Why did the DPP at the lime, following the publication of the Taylor Report and the
       investigation by the Midlands Police, not decide to prosecute either individual Officers,
       South Yorkshire Police or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club?

2.     Given the knowledge that you now have, do you believe that the decision not to prosecute
       at that time was wrong?

3.     In view of the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Evidence Report which further
        confirms the Police were mainly responsible for the disaster along with further evidence
        about the responsibility of Sheffield Wednesday Football Cub would you support, as
        Home Secretary, a referral back to the DPP to consider prosecutions - if not could you say
        why?



                            THE CONSTITUENCY OF HALTON
                            WIDNES          RUNCORN            HALE

                   Constituency Office: Tel: 0151 424 7030 Fax: 0151 495 3800
You will be aware of the strength of local feeling. I am sure you realise that most people cannot
square the circle on the basis that there is so much evidence about the responsibility for this
disaster but no prosecutions ever took place. This again, as I have said to you previously, wholly
undermines the faith of the people in the justice system.

Finally, you will see from the attached article from my local paper that there is a lot of
misunderstanding about what is known about the disaster. Although we know what happened, a
lot of people have not grasped this message. It suggests to me that we, as the Government, have
to find a way of getting the message home.

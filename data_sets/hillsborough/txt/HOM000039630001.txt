                                       INTERIM REPORT OF INQUIRY


                                                 INTRODUCTION

   1. O n 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round o f the FA C up com petition was to be
played between the Liverpool an d Nottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium, Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result,
95 died and over 400 received hospital tre a tm e n t

  2. O n 17 April 19891 was appointed by you to carry out an Inquiry with the following terms o f reference:

      To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
      recom m endations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.

   3. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: M r Brian Johnson Q PM , C hief Constable o f Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard M aunder OBE, BSc, PhD , ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor o f Mechanical
Engineering at the University o f Newcastle upon Tyne. Their help has been invaluable and I am very grateful
for their expert advice and wise counsels. While the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am comforted
in th e knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

  4. M r Robert Whalley was appointed Secretary to the Inquiry. H e and his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give m e all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, M r Ernest Pott.

   5. T he policing arrangements for 15 April were in the hands o f the South Yorkshire Constabulary. The
 efficacy o f those arrangements an d their implementation was from an early stage called into question. It was
 therefore decided that the investigation o f the disaster and the gathering of evidence for this Inquiry should be
 conducted by an independent police force. M r Geoffrey Dear Q PM , Chief C onstable o f West Midlands
 Constabulary, undertook this task. H e was m ade responsible directly to me; he app o in ted Assistant Chief
 Constable Mervyn Jones to take full-time charge o f the investigation. I am deeply indebted to both of them.

   6. O n 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium. I inspected the scene o f the disaster on the terraces and all
 relevant parts o f the stadium a n d its approaches. My Assessors and I have m ade further visits during the
 Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool o n 21 an d 29 April.

    7. T he Lord Mayor and the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to make the accom m odation and facilities
 of Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing of oral evidence. This offer was gratefully accepted and I would
 like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to th e Inquiry by th e authorities
 in Sheffield.

    8. On 28 April 198 9,1 held a prelim inary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence wouldbegin,
 to give some directions as to the procedure I intended to follow and to hear applications from those wishing to
 be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
       (i)     Those bereaved o r injured as a result o f the disaster.
       (ii)    The Football Supporters’ Association.
       (iii) The Football A ssociation.
        (iv)  Sheffield City Council.
        (v)   Sheffield W ednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the Club’s casual staff and
              their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
        (vi) South Yorkshire Constabulary.
        (vii) South Yorkshire Fire an d Civil Defence Authority.
Subsequently, during the hearing, 1 further accorded representation to:
     (viii) T rent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire M etropolitan Ambulance Service
           (SYMAS).
and (ix)   D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

  9j Since the circumstances o f the disaster raised urgent questions of safety, especially at football grounds,
youindicated at the outset that you would welcome any recom m endations, even o f an interim nature, which 1
might be able to give in advance o f the new football season due to commence in mid-August 1989.1 therefore
announced at the prelim inary hearing on 28 April that I would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as the first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facts and causes o f the disaster and enable me to
make any im m ediate interim recommendations necessary in the short term.

   10. T h e West M idlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “Freephone" num ber was advertised io
enable m em bers o f the public, especially those who had attended the m atch, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this num ber was available for three days on 28 different lines. T he response from the public
was such th at the lines were continued for a further three days by the end o f which 2,666 calls had been
received. There were also many written offers o f help. Some 440 West M idlands officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in Birm ingham, Liverpool and
Sheffield a n d com puter technology was used to the full. In all some 3776 statem ents were taken. There were
also some 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry and to me personally all o f which 1 read. The police,
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club and the BBC had video cameras filming at th e ground on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours o f film covering the period before, during an d after the disaster. Thus
the m aterial gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enormous. From this
 mass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts and
 causes o f th e disaster.

   11. W here it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism might be m ade o f the conduct o f any person or
 party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
 setting o u t the likely'groiinds for complaint. This followed the practice established by th e Royal Commission
 on Tribunals o f Inquiry (the Salmon Commission).

    12. The hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding o n 29 June. In
 th at period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s submissions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
 on 14 July 1 heard their brief oral submissions supplementing the w ritten argument.

   13. W itnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departm ental inquiry, ihere was no power to adm inister the
 oath but there was no instance o f any witness giving evidence which I considered might have been different
 had he or she been sworn.

    14. T h e witnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from whom statem ents were or could have been
 taken. Nevertheless, 1 am satisfied that they were sufficient in num ber an d reliability to enable me to reach the
 necessary conclusions. To have called m ore would have prevented me from presenting a n interim report in the
 required tim e and would not have added significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
 take into account many written statements in addition to oral testimony.

    15. A part from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was draw n from statements taken by
 the West M idlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
 opportunity to p u t forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final submission was m ade by
 Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police th a t since the investigation by West M idlands Police is still continuing,
 all the evidence has not been assembled and it wouid be unsafe for m e to m ake findings o f fact. I should
 therefore m ake clear th a t the investigation continues principally to furnish as m uch detail a* possible to HM
 C oroner for the City o f Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at d eath.and the care and
  movement o f each o f the 95 victims individually. I am assured by Chief Constable D e a r and Assistant Chief
 Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter o r add to
 the history o f events which emerged at the hearing.

    16. I should like to thank all those who made it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
  event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account o f what
  happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West M idlands
  Police for their speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to ail those responsible for processing it.
     fnost eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness of the police investigation cam e from the Secretary
  jfie Football Supporters’ Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whe!h»r shai
 Rvestigation would be fair and objective. His Association iherefore collected 200 witness statements
themselves. Having heard the opening statem ent by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.                                                  j

   17. Before and during the Inquiry 1 derived great assistance o n a wide range o f technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services Division) where tests were conductcd and reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. This was done
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am most grateful to the Director, D r A Jones, and to the
Deputy Director, D r C E Nicholson, fortheirinvaluable help.                                           ____

  18. I wish to com m cnd Counsel to the inquiry, Mr Andrew Collins QC, M r Alan Coldsack and M r
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence: also.
Counsel for all those represented who tested that evidence fully but expeditiously. T his Interim Report could
not possibly have been prepared in so short a tim e had 1 not had the whole-hearted co-operation of all those
m entioned and m any others.

    19. T he second phase of the Inquiry will be directed to making final and long term recom mendations about
 crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth information, opinions and arguments
 from a wide range o f sources an d contributors both here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
 second phase could not be carried to completion before the next football season. However, at an early stage of
 the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it and specifically from many sporting,
 local authority, emergency service and police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that submissions
 should be in writing and should be made promptly so th at the second phase o f the Inquiry could
 follow immediately after th e first. 1 shall now proceed to consider the large body o f w ritten evidence which has
 been submitted. I shall want in som e instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction with
  my Assessors. We will also need tCLmake a num ber of visits and inspections.

   20. I now present my Interim Report and Recommendations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
 R ecom m endations as soon as reasonably possible.

  21. On 20 M arch 1989. ihe Football Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and N ottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between ihc same two teams had been held there in April IVS8, The arressem enis had been
successful in the view both o f the police and of the host club. Sheffield W ednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to accom m odate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it b ut only if
the ticketing arrangem ents were the same as those f o r ! 988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangem ents d id not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thoughi the ticket
allocation was u n fa ir for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirement was
accepted and th e m atch was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground
  22. T h e Hillsborough Stadium is some I'k miles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in the district o f
Owlerion. T he ground was opened in 1899 on what was th en a greenfield site by the river Don. The pilch lies
roughly east to west. A plan of the ground and its im m ediate environs is at A ppendix 1.

  23. T he west end, with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The '
east end abuts o n Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river Don an d to the north a residential street,
VereRoad, which runs between Lcppings Lane and Penistone Road N orth.

    24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
 entrances, and to th e administrative block under the stand. The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
 access between Pcnistonc Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut i; o ff at each end. There
 is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players an d employees of the Club. T he south
 stand dates from 1914 an d is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8,800. 5,500 o f those are
 roofed over an d 3,300 are uncovered.

   25. The north sta n d is also all seating and accommodates about 9,700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
 hall. T here are also a first aid room and police room close by.

   26. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986and
 now accom m odatcs som e 2 1,000 standing spectators. T here are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
 the goal line bu t n o dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

    27. At the west or Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
 stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World C up m atches, some of which were held
 at Hillsborough in 1966. T he covered stand accom m odates 4,456 seated spectators. The terracing in front o f it
 extends higher in th e corners between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At both the Kop
 end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perim eier fencing. T h e fencing is about eight feet high
 mounted upon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the top of the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
 angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to clim b over tow ards the pitch. There are gates at
 intervals along the perim eter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than 3
 meire wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
 They are m arked a n d num bered on the plan Appendix 1.

   28. Unlike the Kop end, the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radia
 fences at right angles to it, dividing the area into pens. T his division was begun after an FA Cup semi-fina! ii
 1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the fina
 arrangem ent being shown on the plan Appendix 1. The first section o f the west terracing moving south to nortl
 contains gates 1 an d 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only one pen. Next is pen
 with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5. which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area t
 divide pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate home and away fans o n occasions when both might b
 accom m odated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west comer. Pens 5,
 and 7 each have a perim eier gate. At the back of the pens, under the front o f the west stand, there is a gate i
           #■




 ach radiai fence. W hen those gates arc open, the back row of the tcrracing is intended to perm it access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible o r accessible. The present layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series of piecemeal changes. The nature and effect o f those changes must be considered later.

The Turnstiles                                                                    !
  29. Because o f the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the riorth side o f the ground. Along
Pcnistone Road N orth there are some 46 lurnsules which usually give access both to the1<.op and to the east
end of the north stand. They are m arked 4 3 to 158 inclusive on the plan. The 12 num bered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate s u p p o rte r o f the
two teams as appears later. Two o f them. 77 and 78, were however usee for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (num bered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
numbered 37 io 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

   31. In summary, the south and east sides of the ground accommodated some 29.800 whose access on the
 day was through 60 turnstiles.

   32. The o th e r two sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 24,256 were fed solely from the
 Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

 Travel to the Ground
   33. Most supporters were expected to come by road although rail transport was available. Nottingham
 supporters travelling by train would arrive at the main line Sheffield M idland Station whence they would be
 directed and escorted northw ards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
 Nottingham supporters travelling by coach, mini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south mainly
 on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would predominantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

     34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive a t Sheffield M idland Station just
  like their N ottingham co u nterp an s. The police aimed to segregate the rival fans and p u t them into separate
  coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special irain to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
  catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north of the ground. A police escort was available to
  conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. Those coming from Liverpool by road would approach
  Sheffield either via the M62 and down the M l from the north or across the Pennines from the north west. All
  such routes would bring them to the ground via one or other limb o f Leppings Lane as shown on Appendix !.
  Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west; arrivals from Nottingham
  would be from the south and east.

  Allocation of Places and Tickets
    35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
  of rival teams. T he need for this policy to be maintained was endorsed and emphasised by the Popplewell
  Report following the Bradford C ity disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
  that sections of the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation of
  Liverpool and N ottingham Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determ ined by the direction
  whence each predom inantly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides of the ground
  for which access was from Leppings Lane. Nottingham Forest were allotted the south an d east sides with access
  from Penistone Road.

     36. The effect o f the decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie, Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
  as against 29,800 for N ottingham Forest. This, although average attendance o f supporters at home matches
  was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
  £12, N ottingham Forest had 21,000 standing places compared with Liverpool’s 10,100. So, Liverpool’s
  allocation was m ore expensive as well as smaller. Understandably, Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
  of places and tickets. They sought with some support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
   1988, b u t the police were a d am an t. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
  crossing each other’s paths w hen approaching the ground thereby frustrating attem pts at segregation and
  creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989. when the same plan was proposed, Liverpool again challenged it. The
  police, however, m aintained th e ir view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 would be familiar with the
  arrangements and that any change would lead to confusion.


                                                             5
Access from Leppings Lane
   37. As the pian Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnsiiies is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
a bend in Leppings Lane where, coming from the north, it turns to the sbuth-west and crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west of the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs of Leppings Lane and would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f double gates. Inside
those perim eter gates is Ihc short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs Appendix 2. lhe
latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists of turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers 1 to
 10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9,700* w ith north stand seats. Their
tickets were m arked “ Entrance A" and were colour-coded brown. Tum stiies 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them an d brown boards on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to i 6 were for those with seats in the west stand. T hus 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.
T hey were the next block to the right o f those marked A. However, instead o f these turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being m arked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were m arked C. T heir colour-code on
tickets and boards was red.

    39. On the o th er side o f the dividing fence in lhe approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
 10,100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
 h ad originally been 58 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential num bering continued from 19 upwards
 on th e south side o f the ground. W hen the num ber at Leppings Lane was b rought up to 23 the present
 arrangem ents o f 1 to 1-6, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-num beringall round the ground.
 However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “ Entrance B" also appeared on tickets for the west
 terrace. Thus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
 left to right A, C, B. T h e colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
 To th e right o ftu rn stile G is a tubular steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
  south stand.

  Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
    40. T um stiies Plo 10 gave access to a passageway lead in g to th e north stand. T here isan exit gate (marked A
  on A ppendix I) betw een turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

    41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
  wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate home and away fans at a
  tim e w hen the C lub intended they should share the west terrace. T hat idea was not pursued but the wall
  rem ained. T here was, however, a gateway in the wall which did perm it access betw een the two areas. An exit
  gate (m arked B on A ppendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

     42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
  m entioned and on th e right by the wall o f the private roadway coming from the so u th stand to Leppings Lane.
  T here was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on Appendix 1) just inside turnstile G.

    43. All three exit gates. A, B and C, were o f concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
  an d were n ot in ten d ed for entry o f spectators into the ground.

     44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could b'
   m oving to the right go round the south end o f the west stand and gain entry into pens I and 2. They could g>
   through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the nort
   end o f the west stand into pens 6 o r 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either c
   those courses. T h e obvious way in was straight ahead o f ths turnstiles where a tunnel under the middle o f th
   west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was th e word “Standing” and a laq
   letter “ B” . T h u s B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

      45. T h e length o f the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels off but finally descen
   towards the terraces at a gradient o f I in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the rad
   fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 o n the left. A short spurofbrick wall projects forward from each si
   o f th e tunnel at its m outh. Those emerging are thus guided straight forward rath er than to either side. T
   photograph at A ppendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

     46. As with th e layout On the terraces, the configuration o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles and th eareasin s
   them was effected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary' to analyse their resultant effi
       Kg Arrangements
    7.       At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control o f Chief Superintendent Mole, then
C om m ander o f F Division w iihin whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over com m and o f F Division on 27 March to
Superintendent D uckenfield on !.he tatter's promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 M arch, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. U nder him weft
Sector Com m anders, all Superintendents with much experience of policing football m atches ai Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular. Superintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in com m and inside tlje ground, but this
included the area between ihe tumstiies and the perimeier fence. T hey thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. U n d e r M r Duckenfield’s overall command were some 801 officers and men on duty a! the
 ground plus traffic officers and others From D Division to deal with the influx o f supporters into the city centre.
 In all, therefore, some 1,122 poiice were deployed for this match am ounting to about 38 per cent o f tHFtotal
 South Yorkshire force. Included in lhe mounted section of 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
 assist respectively in m arshalling their home supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
 consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
 at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during an d after the match. All of this
 was provided for in an O perational Order which followed closely the O rder drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
 and took into account the force’s “Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football G rounds". The Order
 described the duties o f each serial at cach phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day o f
 the match.

 Sheffield Wednesday's Arrangements
   48. T he Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
 were briefed as to their duties on the morning of the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
 ground. They wore yellow labards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
 com municate by V H F rad io with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
 screens in iheir control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
 incorporated in the turnstiles. T his flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total of
 spectators passing through th e lu m s jile s section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
 separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (nonh stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
 (west terraces). W hen the to tal for any section was within 15 per cent o f its perm itted capacity a warning pulse
 showed on the screen. F or the west terracing that warning would occur when the num bers were within 1S per
 cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10,100. What the system could not do was m onitor the distribution o f fans
 on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

 Police Communications
    49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west corner o f the
 ground between the south stand and pen 1 of the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
 o f steps. It has windows com m anding views, across the pitch and straight along the line o f the west perimeier
 fence. T he box is very small an d has seats for only three officers. Superintendent M urray was in control o f it
 and was advisor to M r Duckenfield as he had been to M r Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
 G oddard who operated the radios. T he third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
 and public address systems. Al the back of the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control of the
 police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on a bench in front o f him and behind the
 three seated officers.

     50. There were five television screens showing views o f five roving cameras fixed a t high points on the
  stands and direcied b o th inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
  rotation from one cam era view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
  facility to close in on any p oint o r interest. Specifically, there were good camera views o f the wesi terracing, o f
  the Leppings Lane tu m stiies an d beyond them of Leppings Lane itself.

    51. T he Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
  ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box, to relay
  music before the m atch, b u t it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
  speakers o r i f appropriate to o n e area only.
   53.   Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a Wi FU portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator’s bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
Community Constables on duty would already have their own. O ther Constables had no radio.
Communication was on “talk through" i.e. any message from any source svould be heard by everyone tuned in
and if more than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
an attem pt to overcom e the loud crowd noise which made receipt o f signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant G oddard: VHF to police H eadquarters at -Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
Sub-divisional H eadquarters at H am m erton Road and channel 19 used by C1D. There was also a sct'tuned to
Sheffield W ednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                                   15th APRIL: T H E BUILD-UP TO 2.30pm

Early Arrivals
  54. 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match \}/as a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket hoiders
were expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire their, or even to gain^access otherwise.
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small num bers. Some brought cans o f beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage of the w eather and sat about on walls and open spaces. When the public houses opened?«i'any
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs comprise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house o r off-licence. M any were asking for tickets or “spares". There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, som e o f the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
wore on, num bers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
 mood was one o f carnival, good hum our and expectation.

Public Houses
  55. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did v isit them but the evidence did not suggest a great am ount o f alcoholic drink was
bought there.

   56. Opening tim e at public houses was in general 11 am. Some remained closed all day. O f the others, some
 72, mostly in th e city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over a
 hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
 many supporters drank enough to affect their mood. At first excitement: later frustration.

 The Gathering Crowd             _
   57. Towards the end o f the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
 entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
 as early as 11.30 am. Som e 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
 Lane area. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away;
 nevertheless, many returned m ore lhan once. Those who had tickets were guided in th e right direction. The
 police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
 each turnstile with the duty o f searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
 entrant was liable to be searched again by o n e o f a serial of officers positioned just inside.

    58. At about 12 noon C hief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray w hether the pens on the west
  terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
  the fans should find their own level.

    59. By 2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those m onitoring events in the police and Club
  control rooms that the num ber o f Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnum bered those from Liverpool.
  The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were h alf empty. It was
  noted about that tim e th a t the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
  time the previous year. O n the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 and 7 were
  nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward a n d make room for
  others.

    60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. T his time, there was only one. It arrived
  early, just before 2 pm , at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by b o th m ounted and foot
  police officers who escorted th em in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
  the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

    61. By this tim e the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority o f
  Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
  increasing rapidly. Between the perim eter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
  longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx fillingthe whole approach area. The foot officers
  outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.
                                                                                                                )
                                                                                                               I



M ounted officers in an d outside ihe turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd, j
T he police were beset by fans bemused by the tickct and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had ]
been drinking b u t up to an d just after 2.30 pm the mood rem ained good.                                         ]
                                                                                                                   1
   62.     S uperintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. H e became anxious about the num bers'
com ing down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17 i
pm he radioed to control to have m otor traffic in Leppings Lane slopped.iThis was eventually done at about;
2.30 pm. U p to this tim e, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the num bers still approaching, there!
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control room Mr Murray, who could-
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr:
Duckenfield reaffirm ed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordere^i'nly if there was some,
m ajor external factor such as fog on the Pcnnines or delay on the motorway; not if spectators merely turned u p :
late even in large numbers.

Rescue A ttem pts
   81. From 3 o clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans h a d walked or staggered out
winded an d faint. Bui the final surge at j.0 4 pm. and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
blockage o f bodies. T he d e a d , the dying and the desperate became interwoven in th e su m p at the front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clambered over others subm erged irrthe hum an heap and
tried to clim b o u t over the fence. T hey were now helped by poiice and o th er fans who h auled them up and over.
N um bers o f fans were clim b in g over the maiai fences into adjaccnt pens. At the back, m anv were hauled up
into the west sta n d to relieve the pressure.

       T h e steps from the su m p at gateways j and 4 were so congesjcd w ith bodies live an d d ead that each had
    e Pn s ed fro m the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took\effective charge. A n u m b e r o f individual
o icers and fans w orked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow th a t oniv two or three
couia get at th e en tw ined bodies Willing hands got in one a n other's way. More officers arrived from the
gym nasium a n d elsew here in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid out on the pitch, to
assist m getting others o v er the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But some stoo d in groups n ear the
perim eter fence n ot know ing w hat to do. They had been sum m oned in response to w hat was thought to be a
tnreat to p u b lic order. W h a t they found was a horrific scene o f carnage an d some young officers were shocked
into im p o ten ce by w hat th ey saw.

   83. It was tru ly g ruesom e. T he victim s were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their m o u th s open, vomiting; th e ir
ev^_s stann g . A pile o f d ead bodies lay an d grew outside gate 3. Extending further and fu rth e r on to the pitch, the
injured were la id down a n d attem p ts m ad e to revive them . More and m ore walking su rv iv o rs flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. T he scene was em otive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enorm ity o f the
disaster was realised, m a n y o f the fans milling about were bitter and hostiie to the police, blam ing them for
wnat had h a p p e n e d . O fficers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A sm all n u m b er o f
hysterical fans h a d to be su b d u e d .

  84. A d d in g to the chaos, a n u m b e r o f press photographers dodged about among rescue w orkers apparently
avid to secure p h o to g ra p h s at po in t blank range o f those dying through the wire m esh and those laid o n th e
pitcn. A ngry fa n s sought to assault them . Police had to intervene.

  • 85h‘ w afa° u l 3' 12 P m ’ C h ic f SuPerinlendent Nesbit. C o m m an d er o f the Traffic D ivision, arrived on the
pitch H e to o k charge a t gate 3 and organised a chain o f officers to sim plify and exp ed ite the extraction o f
casualties from th e pen. In th e absence o f any m echanical means, police and fans to g eth er pulled and w orked
at t e w ire m esh w ith th e ir bare han d s and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in a n d fans to be got out.

   86. By now, so m e o fiicers ot th e ir own initiative went round from the pitch to th e tu n n e l where they m e t
ot Si officers fro m th e tu rn stile s and th e west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans a t th e rear o f the pens
to go       th ro u g h th e tu n n e l. Some com plied, but many resisted, w ishing to stan d th e ir ground. Casualties
were b rought o u t th ro u gh th e tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
turt er in an d b rin g o ut m o re casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse o u tsid e
the tunnel an d a tte m p ts w ere m ad e to revive them .

 First Aid

    '-V - ’cw n ac c o rd w hen they saw the casualties and the ambulance a n d realised th e gravity o f the situation. Many
    'K » S a n s also w orked prodigiously in attem pts to revive the d e a d a n d the dying, in so m e cases th eir own relatives
          ■ a n d friends. A rtificial respiration, m outh to m outh respiration a n d cardiac massage were applied by the skilled
            a n d th e unskilled b u t usually in vain. Those capable of surv iv al mostly cam e ro u n d o f their own accord. The
            rest were m ostly d o o m e d before they couid be brought out a n d treated.

            90. There was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch and to hospital There were six stretchers in the
         first aid room and three in the St John’s ambulance. They were quickly brought into use. Then the fans
         improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge of the pitch and against the stands so that lengths of
         board could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way, panics of fans and police ran repeatedly the length
         of the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A number were dead on arrival there.

         In the Control Room
           91. M r Duckenfield stayed in the control room. Chiei Inspector McRobbie was there in civilian clothes as
         an observer. Mr Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to admit those
         displaced from the centre pens, Mr Duckentieid did not realise there were injuries until he saw someone laid
         on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature of the problem or its scale. - -

            92. Mr Murray returned from his attempt to stop the match and Mr Duckenildd sent him dow n asain to
          clear the pitch and assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was '■
          because Mr Duckenfield couid not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the milling and :-
          increasing numbers.                      ■■                                     ‘                       .      -r -

            93. The Assistant Chiet Constable (Operations), Mr Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as "
          a guest of the Club. He came from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. Mr Duckenfield was
          unable to say; he did not tell Mr Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. Mr Jackson went
          down to the pitch to discover the situation.

             94. At 3.06 pm Mr Duckenneld, still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
          to Headquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for ail available additional poiice resources to
          come to the ground to strengthen the poiice presence.

             95. Mr Jackson was told by Mr Greenwood that there were casualties and returned immediately to control
          to make sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile, Mr Murray had seen the plight ofthosebehind the '
          fence. He radioed to control that a fleet of ambulances was required. He also asked for a Tannov broadcast to
          those in the pens to move back but there is no dear evidence that it was made.    '

             96. Only when Mr Disckenfidd received the request fora fleet of ambulances did he realise the nature and
           gravity of the situation. Then, supported by Mr Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting Operation
           Support into calls for the Major Disaster Plan.                         ”                                 -

           No Information
              97. Apart from the message to dear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm, no
           information or advice was broadcast on the public address system. Mr Duckenfield feared that the crowd
           might turn hostile or might ail attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
           given information about what had happened. The result was that apart from those dose enough at the west end
           to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority of the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
           Nottingham supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by
           Liverpool fans. They continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infiiriated some Liverpool fans who
           were already distraught. A few began to ran towards the Kop “e nd. The police feared violence might result on
           top of the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number of officersj o form a line across the
           width o f the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line svwpingsmy. Liverpool fans back as they

the injured an d bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be p arted fro m th e dead and sought to revive them. There
were people looking fo r missing friends and relations: there w ere re crim in atio ns, th e re were scuffles. Some of
those involved were th e worse for drink. Doctors and nurses h a d followed th e casualties in from the pitch and
sought to atten d the in ju red as best they could in the adverse circum stances. T h o se in most urgent need of
hospital tre a tm e n t were taken to am bulances as they arrived, triage being em ployed to determ ine priorities.
 D octors were req uested by the poiice to examine each p erson th o u g h t to be deceased to confirm and certify

 W as D runkenness a M a jo r Factor in the Crisis at the Tum stiies?
     196.        O f those w h o arrived at 2.30 pm o r after, very m any h a d beer, drin k in g at public houses o r had
 brought d rin k fro m h o m e o r an off-licence. 1 am satisfied on th e evidence, however, th at the great m ajority
  were n ot d ru n k n o r even th e w orse for drink. The police w itnesses varied on this. Som e described a high
  prop o rtion as d ru n k , as “ lager-Iouts” or even as “anim als” . O th e rs describ ed a generally norm al crowd w ith an
  unco-operative m in o rity w ho h a d dru nk too much. In my view so m e officers, seeking to rationalise th e ir loss
  o f control, o v erestim ated th e d ru n k e n elem ent in the crowd. T h e re certain ly was such an elem ent. T h ere were
  youngsters in flu en ced b y d rin k a n d bravado pushing im patiently at th e rear o f the crow d thereby exacerbating
  th e crush. But th e m o re co n vincin g police witnesses, including especially D etective Superintendent McKay
  and C h ief In sp ecto r Crease'r as well as a num ber o f responsible civilian w itnesses, were in my view right in
  describing th is e le m e n t as a m inority. Those witnesses a ttrib u te d th e crush to th e sheer num bers o f fans ail
' anxious to gain entry. T h e re was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f th e witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
   o r even 2.35 p m . W h a t h a p p e n e d then was not a sudden d e te rio ra tio n in th e m o o d o r sobriety of those
   assem bled there. N o d o u b t th o se com ing behind would have h a d m o re to d rin k an d w ould have included the
   unruly m inority. B u t the crisis developed because this very large crowd becam e packed into a confined
   tu rn stile area a n d its very d e n sity ham pered its passage through th e tu m stiie s.

       197. S u p e rin te n d e n t M arsh all an d other officers criticised th e crow d as unco-operative because police
   exh o rtatio n s to stop p ush in g a n d to ease back were not heeded. H ow could they be? In th a t crush m ost people
   h a d no control over th e ir m ovem ents at all. Two incidents in v olving police horses illustrate the p o in t One
   horse was found afterw ard s to have cigarette burns on its ru m p . C learly th a t was th e despicable w ork o f a
   hooligan w h eth er in d rin k o r n o t. However, there were also eyew itness accounts o f a horse being physically
   lifted o ff its feet b y the crow d. T h a t occurred, as the police accepted^ w ith o u t m alice or intent b u t as an
   in vo lu n tary co n sequ en ce o f crow d pressure which those by th e h orse’s flanks could n o t resist any m o re th a n the
   horse itself.                                                                            ~

   Reduced Efficiency o f the T urnstiles
      198. T h e labelling o f th e turnstiles in the order A. C, B was confusing. A fan w ith a B-ticket who w ent by
   m istake to the w rong side o f the m etal fence would have had th e greatest difficulty in getting back an d ro u n d to
   the correct side. T h e c o lo u r coding was inefficient because th e c olou red w ooden panels were affixed to the
   tu rn stile walls so low th a t th ey w ere not easily visible through a crowd- T h e in fo rm atio n on the ticket p rin ted b \
   Sheffield W edn esd ay F ootball C lub was m isleading and its layout un h elp fu l, a s M r M ackrell frankly conceded.

        199. T h e result was th a t in th e early stages, poiice officers were pestered by fans for help as to w here they
    should go. Later, as the crow d becam e m ore dense, fans were p re se n tin g th e ir tickets a t the w rong t u n n i e s . '
    T n e re were also L iverpool su p p o rters who had acquired tickets fo r th e Kop en d b u t sought entry a t Leppmgs
    Lane. T ney cau sed delays in th e turnstile operation w hen en try w as refused a n d after a while th e police
    instructed th e o p e ra to rs to 1st th e m through. T h ere was fu rth er delay because the crush m ade it difficult for
    fans to get in to th e tu rn stile entrances. Once there, the pressure fro m b eh in d was such as, on occasions, to jam
    th em in th e doorw ay o r against th e paddle of the turnstile. Finally, th e re were fans w ith o ut tickets who sought
     to e n te r by offering p a y m e n t, by seeking to go over or u n d e r th e p a d d le or by sliding through w ith a
     holder. All o f these a c tiv ities slowed down the turnstiie rate w hich a t th e w orst p eriod was only ab o u t 600 per
     h o ur per turnstile. T h e w aitin g crowd therefore expanded a n d as th e m in u tes passed frustration grew. Visitors

   W        T h e O perational O r d e r for 15 April followed closely th a t laid down for th e 1988 semi-final. The
 em p h asis was on m a i n t a i n i n g law an d order. Side roads were to be blockec ofTio p rev en t dam age in residential
 areas. P airs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash ot rival supporters . O fficers were to watcn pub
 houses, shops an d sup erm arkets “w here looting could take place”. O utsid e tne tu rn stiles, ofneers were to ensure
 su p p o rte rs entering d id n o t have banners, weapons, missiles c r alcohol.

     211. A s long ago as 1924, th e D epartm ental C om m ittee on Crow ds stated:-

  229. T he decision to o r d e r the opening of the gates was not a c c o m p a n ie d o f followed b y a n y other o rd e r to

nor the C h ie f S tew ard a t th e Leppings Lane end was w arned. N o t even M r G re e n w o o d , the G round
C om m ander, was in fo rm e d . From 2.47 pm when Mr Marshall m ad e h is first request until                      pm when Mr
 D uckenfieid acced ed to it, th e re were five minutes in which orders c o u ld have b een given as to how tne iniiux
 was to be a b so rb e d . It w as n o t done. In evidence. M r D u ckenneic began by saying trial no o fticer m ade any
 wrong decision b u t he la te r co n ced ed he had erred in this regard. H e sa id he did n o t co n sid e r w here the people
 would go w hen th e gate o p e n e d . Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on th e television screen, nc
 order was given to ste e r th e fans to the wing pens. Mr D uckeriiieia said it d id n o t cross his m ine to detail
 officers on th e c o n c o u rse to sh u t off t ’n e tunnel. Those officers cckild n o t have know n iro m th e ir position how
 full pens 3 a n d 4 w ere. T h a t.w a s a m atter for the control room to m o n ito r from its own o b servation s and using
 intelligence fro m a r o u n d th e ground.

   230. Since pens 3 a n d 4 w ere full by 2.50 pm , the tunnel should h a v e b e e n closed off w h e th e r gate C was tc
 be opened o r no t. T h e exercise was a simple one and had been ca rrie d o u t in 1988. All th a t was necessary was
 for a few officers to act as a c o rd o n at the entrance to the tunnel an d d iv e rt fans elsew here. U nfortunately, the
 1988 closure seem s to h a v e b een unknown to the senior officers o n d u ty at th e tim e. I t d id n o t ngure m the
 debriefing notes. It th e re fo re h a d no influence on the pianning for 1989.

    231. P la n n in g a p a rt, how ever, it should have been clear in the c o n tro l ro o m w here th e re was a view o rjh e
  pens a n d o f th e crow d a t th e turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. I f o rd ers h a d b e e n given to th a t enect
  w hen gate C w as o p e n e d , th e fans could nave been directed to the e m p ty areas o f th e w ings a n d this disaster
  could still h av e b e e n a v o id e d . Failure to give that order was a b lu n d e r o f th e first m a g n itu d e .

     232. S ignificantly, w h e n p erm ission was given to open gate A, M r D u c k e n fie id d id o r d e r serials to go to th at
  p art o f th e c o n c o u rse to m o n ito r the influx towards the north stand . H e d id th is b ecau se he feared th a t if fans
  w ent to th e n o r th s ta n d w ith o u t tickets, they would not get seats a n d , th e re b ein g n c p e rim e te r rences at the
  north side, th e y m ig h t in v a d e the pitch. This illustrates again the p re o c c u p a tio n w ith av o id in g pitch invasion
  as against safety a n d th e risks o f overcrowding. Because those en terin g th ro ug h gate C could n o t get onto the
  pitch, it w as n o t th o u g h t n ecessary to aiert officers to m o n ito r th e m . T h e possibility o f overcrow ding simpiy
  was n o t c o n sid e re d .

  265. T h e im m ed iate cause o f th e gross overcrowding a n d hence th e d isaster was the failure, w hen gate C was
opened, to cut o f f access to the central pens which were alre a d y overfull.

  266. T hey were already overfull because no sate m a x im u m capacities h ad been laid dow n, n o a tte m p t was
m a d e to control entry to in d iv id u a l p en s num erically a n d th e re w as no effective visual m o n ito rin g o f crowd
density.

   267. W hen th e influx from gate C entered pen 3. the layout o f th e b arriers there afforded less protection
t han it should an d a b a rrie r coliapsed. Again, ihe lack o f vigilant m o n ito rin g caused a sluggish reaction an d
response w hen the crush occurred. T h e sm all size and n u m b e r ot' gates to th e track retard ed rescue efforts. So.
in ihe initial stages, d id lack o f leadership.

   268. T h e need to o pen gate C was d ue to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. T h a t o ccurred because, as
both Club an d police should have realised, m e turnstile area could noi easily co p e w ith th e large n um b ers
d em an d ed of it unless t hey a rriv ed ste a d ily o v er a iengtny period. T h e O p e ra tio n a l O rd e r a n d police tactics on
th e day failed to provide for con troiiin g a con cen trated arrival o f large n u m b ers should t ha t o ccu r in a short
period. T hat it m ight so o ccu r was foreseeable an d ii did. T h e presence o f an unruly m in o rity w ho had dru n k
to o m uch aggravated the problem . So d id the C lu b 's co n fu sed and in a d e q u a te signs an d ticketing.

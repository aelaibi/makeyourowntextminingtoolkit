BRUGES O L Y M P I A S T A D I U M I N MAY 1 9 8 8 ( BRUGES VERSUS W I N T E R S L A G )
WHERE THE A U T H O R I T I E S R E C O G N I S I N G THE ENORMOUS PRESSURE FROM
BRUGES FANS ( REGARDED AS THE MOST V I O L E N T I N B E L G I U M ) I N
TERRACES COULD END T R A G I C A L L Y , OPENED THE MOB I L E G R I L L S AND
LET THE FANS ON TO THE P I T C H .                        THE COST FOR THE P O L I C E AND THE

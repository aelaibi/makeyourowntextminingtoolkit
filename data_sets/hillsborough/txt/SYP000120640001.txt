PC    Smith       on a b a r r i e r .              Furthermore             Police        Sgt.      Wilson         was    the       o nl y

officer          within         our      serial          with     communications.

The    hours        from        1 1 . I 5 a m ( 1115)          onwards       were       relatively            quiet       with        only

minor     barrier            adjustments                 to    be m a d e    fo r    local        residents.              The       idea

being     that         Peni stone             Road North             would    be a s t e r i l e         area       where        rival

supporters             would         not      clash       in v a s t     numbers          due     to    the    separate

entries          into       th e     city.

During       the       course           of    the    afternoon,             several          supporters            asked       myself

where     they         were        to    go    if t h e y       had a       certain          coloured         ticket.            One

At    this       I directed              the       gentleman          towards        the L e p p i n g s       Lane       entrance.

At    which       he    said         "I'm      supporting             Forest,        t h a t *s the L i v e r p o o l            end".

I apologised                and      explained            that       that    was     the      only      entrance          he w o u l d

the    tickets          and which              entrance           the    various          supporters           had       to    go

At    around        1.30pm           (1330)         youths       were       walking          through         crowds       saying

supporters              and    on e    youth          paid        twenty       pounds          for    a standing              t ic k e t .

At     this    time       a    group         of m i d d l e        aged men          were       walking           up P e n i s t o n e

Road     towards          Leppings            Lane       and       one m o r e       was       so    drunk        that      he was

being        carried          by    two      friends.              This       group were             about        15 s t r o n g     a n d at

from     the       cans       that     they would                 not    be a b l e       to    enter          the    ground        in a

most     were       carrying           cans        of    intoxicants.

By    E.50     pm       (1450)        the      Penistone             Road       North     r oa d wa s          virtually         empty

quietened           down,          I ran       to     c a t c h PC 2 3 5 4        Plumridge          who        was     as    I thought

also     going          for    meal.           H o w e v e r , he w a s          from another              serial        returning

Arriving          there        at     around          3pm      (1500)       I entered           the m o b i l e         canteen.,

obtained          my meal,            sat      at     the      table       inside        the    garage          and     before

having        chance          to    eat     a m o u t hf u l , a Sergeant                   shouted            " W e ’ve all        to go

internal          gate        had     been       opened.             I observed           a fan     being         trampled             under­

foot     by a       police          horse        and       then      I made       my way        towards          th e    West       stand.

I ran       through           the     tunnel          to    the      terracing           a n d as    1 went           through          the

was      visibly          blue       and       obviously             appeared            de ad.          This      man was       carried

through         the       gate       and       laid       on the         pitch against                   the      goals    in f r o n t        of

sweatshirt              top.         She       was       white       with      brown          shoulder            length    hair.          She

was      not    blueing             and appeared                 unconscious                 not     dead.

The      girl       was    laid          on    the       grass       and      I then          g av e     mouth      to m o u t h

One      supporter             tied       up a          section         of    the       railings            with a     piece       of    rope

There        were       apparently                 10 m o r e     bodies           inside          the      pen,    and    t h e n my

attentions              were        then       diverted           to     removing             the      bodies       from    the     pitch

West       stand        where           th e    girl       who       I had        tried        to    revive          was    placed            on    the

hoarding           and       carried            back       towards           th e       gymnasium.

Police        Sgt.          Chiddey            took      charge         of       th e    female          delegating           an     officer

to     stay wit h            the        body.

I returned              to       the     pitch        to    find        a    cordon           had    b e e n set       up a c r o s s          the

At     one    point          one        supporter           was       he'll       bent        on    causing          trouble         and       k ep t

trying        to      provoke            an     officer          on the           cordon.            Friends          of    his      were

trying        to      calm        him        down.         An    unknown            Inspector             came       to m y s e l f        a n d PC

A    scuffle          broke         out        in the        lo wer         North        stand and             Policemen            wh o      were

shouted          at     a    genuinely                u n k n o w n S e r g e a n t "To              hold      the       li ne ".        He

held       the     cordon           and, the          situation              was        ca lm e d.

After        some       considerable                  time       the        only        communication                r e c eiv ed was              that

              Road North and                walked          back       towards        my    original          point,       as      1 walked          I

              was     watching         the       floor        and was         again        totally      oblivious             of my

              surroundings.                 1 looked           up      to    see    PC's     Jowi11      and Musk             on    the

              Fielding          Road       junction.

              PC    Jowitt       walked          in f r o n t        of me     and     deliberately               stopped          me    passing

              and     questioned            my welfare.                 I was       emotionally          upset          and     this      was

              obviously          apparent.              He     kept         asking     me    and     then a         lady who            I no w      know

              as                                       of                                     Sheffield                 took       me    into       her

              house      and made           me    a    cu p    of      tea.

              She     allowed         me    to    phone        my w i f e      and         this I did         but     was     u n a b l e to

              elaborate          on    th e      plume        j us t    explained           I was      safe       and    asked          her    to

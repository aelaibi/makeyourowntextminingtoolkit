j. cs.nT L say wi"iat r ou te our            coach took   to Sheffield, other   than    it was

ma i n l y motorways,       the    coach stopped once on the journey at a m o t o r w a y

service     area just        before Sheffield,        we weren't      subjected to any    travel

cle ia y s u u r i n g our j o u r n e y »



There    was    no alcohol        consumed on our         coach,   the only supporters    I saw

drinking alcohol           was when we were walking            from the   coach towards    the

g rouncl and I saw 1ads dr i nking               cans of beer.
                                                                                                       PAGE       3

Our    coach arrived          in S h e f f i e l d at some    time    between       1.30 p m (1330)        a nd

I.45    pm ( 1345) .      1 he    coach driver        stopiped close        to the ground            bus# the

Police    direc t e d us up a hill           to park,        we    parked on a main          road at      the

top of a hill        close       to a small Police Station.



The    coach finally          parked at about 2.00            pm    (1400),      myself and my

friends,      named above,         all    remained     in a group together and started

to walk     back down the hill            towards      the ground.          We     never   received

any Police       escort       down to     the ground,     we just foil owed            the crowds.

The r e wer e a f ew Pa 1 iceme n s tandi ng            ar ound o n t he r out e we w a 1ked

to the ground but             they didn't seem to be giving                directions.



During    our walk      down      to the ground        I never saw         any signs       of

disorder     or fighting,          although      i saw some         lads   dr 3.nniing cans ot

beer    I never     saw any       signs    of drunkeness.            The   mood amongst          the

su pporters was        happy      and good humoured.



We all    arr i ved t o g e t h er outside       the L e p p i ngs Ln entrance             to the

people ap p r o a c h i n g    the ground.



W hen we first       got to the          entrance we were          unsure which turnstiles

to go to,      we had to stand            and think f/or a short           time.       The signs

above    the turnstiles were              too clos*

I got     into     the ground        through a turnstile without             experiencing any

problems,         all    of our group entered through the same turnstile.                              When

we had got onto            the ground side         of the     turnstiles     our group was

stop p e d by two Police Officers,                 one male     officer and one female

a l l o w e d to go      into    the terraces.



1 handed my ticket               into the    turnstile       operator when      I entered the

ground.



A fter we had been searched                 I think a steward directed us towards                         the

tunnel      but    I c a n ’t be sure.          I did not see any signs            directing

s u pport ers      to the       terraces.       I just saw the tunnel         and we all          headed

3: saw a group of stewards                 standing      in the area by the entrance               to the

tunnel      but they just a p p e a r e d to be talking             to each other,             I never          saw

any    policemen         in this area.



I had not seen any gates                 open other      than the     turnstile gates.              1 did

        of the           tunnel.       We go#- onto        the back of the terraces at the                        end of

        the         tunnel,     the XJrr r a c e s     were quite      full and we all wanted to work                          our

        became aware              that    the      pressure around me was               increasing,          there was a

        lot of movement                in the        crowd and    I was     being m oved about               in all

        directions.               I was     having d if f i c u l t y keeping           on my feet.          At    this

        position             (number     1) we had       lost s i g h t of two members                of our

when we got to             position      "iA, I was       standing       towards        the    rear of our

      was,    had all       climbed over the dividing                   fence and were            now standing

                                         W hen    I looked across            into    pen number           two    (2)    I

couid        ae three       other      lads from our group              putting a banner                ups on the

fence and       I could see            that   there was         plenty of        room    in pen number            two




W here   I was standing             i n pe n n umb e r 3, at           position      1A,      it was      crowded

but    not    u n c o mfortable        and also        there was       not as mucn movement                in    Che

crowd as       I had       p reviously e xperienced at                 position      1 (one).            We decided

that we would          climb over         into     pen number          two   <2)    to meet       up with our

friends       so we    could all         keep together.            We    c 1 1rnbed over        into      pen

Once we       got    into    pen number          two    (2),    I looked across            into        pen number

three    (3)    but    I c a n ’t recall          seeing a n y thing         unusual       occurring apart

from seeing that tne                pen was very          crowded.

                    f a n trying to revive anot her fan, he was a white male about middle

                    a g e d , he was       fat,     he was wearing         dark blue    jeans and a red Liverpool

                    footbaiI         shi r t .    The   fan was     pumping this       fat m a n ’s chest,       I think

                     'ie was    trying      to revive      him       for about five minutes.             Isaw a P o l i c e m a n

                    run over and after               throwing        his he 1rnet on the      pitch     he helped the       fan

                    but after a time              they just stopped and             left the fat man after             pulling

                    I was      not    injured at        the qame.       I did      not assist any of the dead or

                    injured      people



                    we    ^.eft the ground just after A .30                  pm    (1630)   after a loud speaker

                    a n no u n c e m e n t was made      instructing        the fans    in the Leppings Ln end of

                    the g f o u n d     that     they   could    leave.

                               the m atch was stopped              is that    I thought       the Police and stewards

         P1 1 &    /ft, was wrong          for the Police          to have kept so          jaany men   lined up across

                   ~cfon’t think         that whe n the N o t t i n g h a m Forrest         fans knew what was         going

                    on that      there would have              been a pitch i n v a s i o n and       I think    the Police

                   yw ^ r e wasting        valuable manpower.              Al%ft not enough      information w as given

                  \ out    to the       crowd and when a n nouncements were made                   they were       very haro

                    to under s t a n d because           of/the     poo/ quality       of the    loud speaker          system.

             1 also thought that the perimeter fencing                   surrounding       the   pitch was

             too high,       there were      not enough gates        in the fences      to a l l o w escape      in

             cases      of emergency,        Also     I thought    that the Police      should have     been

             aware      early on that       the     centre of the terraces       was   o v e r c rowded and

             have     taken action        to niove people       into the side    pens which were       emptier

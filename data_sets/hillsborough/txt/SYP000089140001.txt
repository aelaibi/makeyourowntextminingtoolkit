On several         occasion whilst           stood   in P e n i s t o n e Rd a large   crowd of

suppo r t e r s a r r i v e d at       our turnstiles and on each of these occasions                    I

could smell          intoxicants         in the air w h i c h su g g e s t e d to me the

suppo r t e r s    had been drinking.              The m a j o r i t y of t^ese    people we

searched.



S h o r t l y before the kick off approx 2.45piy (1445)                      I noticed that PC

S U T C L I F F E was held         in conv e r s a t i o n wi£J* two men near to the turnstile.

On a p p r o a c h i n g    them    I could see that one of the men was under the

influence         of alcohol          showing the usual       signs     of a drunken m a n his eyes

were     glazed,      he was        u n s t e a d y on his feet a nd he was       having   difficulty

in speaking.               The ma n    in his    company had also        been drinking      but was

more     composed          in his actions.



     w o u l d describe       the drun k e n man as,        white male ap p r o x 40 yrs       old,    5'8

tall,     m e d i u m build wit h dark           collar    length hair a n d a dark moustache.

He was wearing a jumper an d jeans.                        His friend was a white male approx

35 yrs old wit h sandy coloured hair a n d moustache.



The    two men were a d v i s e d that they were               not about     to gain entry to the

gro u n d an d     if they made a t t empts to do so they w o u l d be arrested,                      both

m e n became a r g u m e n t a t i v e a n d abusive        towards     us and told us of their

intentions         to make a formal             complaint about        us.



I told the men              it was their        right to    complain     if they so w i s h e d and

f u r n i s h e d them with our          collar    numbers w h i c h    I wrote    down on a piece

of    paper.



B o t h men decided to stand at the side of us near to the t u rnstiles
                                                                                                    PAGE

where     they deba t e d on what to do.



At this time         I noticed a white male who               I w o u l d describe as 20 - 25

yrs old 5' 8 tall m e d i u m         build wearing        denim jeans a n d a brown              leather

jbomber jacket.           He had light        brown hair      cut    in a   'bob'     style an d was

wear i n g   black frames sunglasses.                  As he w a l k e d towards me along

fienistone R oad f rom the directions                   of the    city centre he a p p r o a c h e d a

large     crowd of suppoi/ters that had c o n g r e g a t e d nearby.                  He was

im m e d i a t e l y s u r r o u n d e d by these    people and     I saw pieces       of paper

change hands         including money.               I formed the opin i o n that this man was

selling t i c k e t ^ a nd this was           confirmed whe n        I heard one of the             group

shout     "Have yyju. got an y more           tickets."       The seller wa l k e d off           in

the same        d i rection he had come towards              the S o u t h Stands.         I saw

this man from a distance                on two further        occasions and each time he

was    s u r r o u n d e d by youths.



At 3. 0 0 p m    (1500)     I h eard a roar from the             crowd an d a s s u m e d that the

game had commenced.              I remained where          I was as     I had been made aware

that    the turnstiles         on Pen i s t o n e Rd were to be left open until                     ha/1 f

time so that         late   comers      could gain entry.           This     inform a t i o n Was

passed to me by the ticket                 collector      on the turnstile.                  /



Approximately 3.05pm             (1505)     I was stood near          t o PS J E^SOP        whe n      I

heard traffic         on his     personal       radio to suggest        t ^ a t / s o m e t h i n g was

ha p pening      in the ground.          I could not make           out what was said as               I was

not    in p o ssession of a radio myself.



Minu t e s   later    I heard a message              over the tannoy system           in the ground

requesting Liverpool             fans    to clear the        pitch.     At this       point we were

i nst r u c t e d by PS J ESSOP that we were              required     inside the ground PC

SUTCLIFFE      i mmediately     ran thro u g h the nearby        concertina g4te and                into        „

the ground,       on doing so      I shouted to the turnstile              operator       to close

the turnstile        doors.     This they did with o u t        question./



Once    in the ground we made          our way thro u g h various          passage ways            to

entrance     Z on the Hop.         F r o m there    I made my way along           the    front of

the Kop and through a gate w h i c h lead us onto the                     pitch.



As    I ran onto the        pitch I immediately noti c e d that theri were                    no

players     or official       present.      I looked down t owards/the L e p pings Ln

stand and      could see      numerous s p ectators         on the    pftch itself.           I could

see a commotion taking            place    including Police O f f icers and at this

point    though that there was a fight taking                  place between fans.



The m a j o r i t y of the    people on the        pitch were    near to/the goal m o u t h

and    I could see numerous         fans a c t u a l l y   climbing   ov^er the      p e r i m e t er

fence    from the stands.



1 ran the full           length of the     pitch and came face to face w i t h what                     I

can only describe as shear horror.                   I a p p r o a c h e d the l a p pings L n en4

s l i g h t l y to the   left of the goal m o u t h ^ e a r     to g a t / l u m b e r   3, on the

stands.      I ran up to the        perimeter      fence and froze wit h shock at what

I saw.      My first views were           that of a young       girl a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 yrs

old w ith    long dark       permed hai/r.      Her face and body were             pressed hard

against     the   perimeter     fenc^/C    Her eyes were        open and staring            into

space her mouth was opertv^nd she had a look of shear shock.



M y eyes made      their way along         the front of the fencing.               The    next

person I saw was a grey h a i r ed man              in his & Q ’s.      He was     blue     in th

                obv i o u s l y dead.       At the side of him was a young man a ppn/x 20 yrs                               old

               w i t h the    same a p p e a r a n c e   he was     covered     in vomit.        Bodies were

                e n t wined throughout           the     length of the fencing and piled on top of each .

                other some four or five high.                      My min d was      blocked out of hearing

               anything       I was not aware            of what was       being said or,s h o u t e d a r o u n d me.



               Pe o p l e were      climbing      over      bodies to get over / h e           fence others were

                st ruggl ing       to get free from the             crush.      The/e were       numerous young

                people     crushed a g a i n s t       the front of the fence and were ob v i o u s l y

                fighting      for breath.          I realised that           people were       dying    in front          of me

                but   I c o u l d n ’t do a n y t h i n g    for them,       I couldn't        get to them,       I

                couldn't move the fence.



               There was o b v iously utter                 chaos taking       place all ar o u n d me      but       I

               wasn't aware             of that at the time.            I remember         seeing my brother              in law

               •another serving Police Offi c e r                  Insp. H A R V E Y who     looked at me and said

               words      to the effect          'Their dying        in there."



               These      initial        sights and shocks           took a f e w ' s e c o n d s tc^sink    in and
m
               after hearing             Inspector H A R V E Y ' S statement my instincts               took over.            I

                climbed on to            the top of the         perimeter       fejpce/4nd began to         pull      people

               J^o s a f e t y .    I    carried them on to the              pitch and      placed them on the

                floor where         other O f f i c e r s were a d m i n i s t e r i n g   first aid.     I recall

                parrying two men to safety who were                       conscious        but fighting     for air.              I

            ^ X j s h o u t e d at them to breath deeply to get oxygen                      into their    lungs.



    ^   ^ ( ^ r w e n t    back to the fence and               it was at this          point    I became aware             of a

               man    in the middle          of the       crush.     He was a jstegro male approx 25 yrs                     old

                in a leather            bomber   jacket*       He was up to his waist             in bodies and

                people and literally taking                   hold of people an d t h r o w i n g / hem over the

fence w here myself and other Offic e r s               carried them to the safety of

the    pitch.



At one     point    I saw    him give one     person the         kiss of   life before           lifting

him to safety.         If    there were any heros            on that day he was

one.      He had total       d i s r e g a r d for his own safety and must have saved

numerous     lives on the day.



As    I helped to get        people over the fence the               pile of people and bodies

grew smaller.         I stood on the        perimeter        fence   leaning over          into the

compound.       I held on w ith my hips and             legs and       reached down to a youth

who was trapped at the waist.                I m a n a g e d to get hold of his finger

tips as did another Officer beside me.                  He      looked at us with

des pe rat ion on his        face.     I c o u l d n ’t get a    good enough grip           on him to „

pull     him to safety.         His   body was trapped.           I could see that he was

able to breath alri g h t a n d after a few seconds                    had to make         the

d e c i s i o n to leave him until       I was    in a position to get him out to

safety.      I knew    I c o u l d n ’t remain there holding his hand forever

w h i l s t other   people    needed assistance.             I still    d o n ’t know what

h a p p e n e d to this youth.



A fter    I had let go of his hand            I noticed that gate number 3 nearby was

open.      I could see numerous          bodies trap p e d       in the e n l / a n c e.     The

s i t u a t i o n was similar    to an egg timer that was              blocked.        There were

hundreds     of grains       of sand trying to get t h r o u g h a small               opening     but

due to the shear q u a n t i t y the exit was             blocked.                 /



There were numerous Police Officers in the v i c inity /f the gate

including Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t NESBIT. He was at trie entrance to the

gate and event u a l l y      people were dragged to safety thro u g h the gate.                         I

assisted        in this o p e r a t i o n a n d formed   part of two       lines of Offjreers at

the exit       gate that were       passing      people and bodies onto the           p/tch where

e m e r g e n c y services were waiting          to give   first aid.



I recall       dragging a man from the gate onto the                  pitch,   heiwas    heavily

.built a nd must have w e i g h e d       in excess      of 20 stone.        I / r a g g e d him onto

the    pitch with the a s s i s t a n c e   of another Officer anyr placed him on

the grass to the           left of the goal m o u t h near to 1/fie S o u t h Stand.               As

we    placed him on the ground            I felt objects       hit/ing my body.          At first

I c o u l d n ’t comprehend what was happening               but then      realised that       some

one from the Leppings Ln end                (stand) was throwing           coins at u s .J I

c o u l d n ’t believe    this but shrug g e d      it off and      returned to gat^e 3.



W h e n all    of the     people had been        removed from tM e        compound   I assist/sd

in carrying the dead and               injured to the gym ftrea. on the bill             boards

that    had been pulled down from the edge                 of the     pitch.



I returned to the L e p p i n g s Ln end by w h i c h time the disaster                  had     run

i t ’s course and         I there   joined fellow O f f icers and Liverpool

were     coming     round w i t h drinks    of water       for everyone      but no matter         how

m u c h you drank your m o u t h        remained dry.       W h e n the    incident was all

over     I recall     looking at my w a t c h and saw that the time w a s 4 . 4 5 p m

( 1 6 4 5 ),   ironically the time the match w ould have finished.



I made tracks to find the               rest of rny serial and e v e n t u a l l y we all

c o n g r eg ated on the half w a y      line.    I have    never seen so man y bobbies

crying or so deeply shoc k e d by what               had h a p pened that a f t e r n o o n and

hope that        I will    not have to experience           such an    incident a g a i n     in my
                                                                                                 PAGE 10
                                                                                                 S3340



My serial was e v e n t u a l l y d e p loyed            into P e n i s t o n e Rd to board the

remaining fans            on the buses./          I couldn't      help w ith these      duties,       it

didn't      seem     important anymore.             My mind was       full    of   pictures    of what     I

had experienced.               I just sat on the front of a car until we were

stood down by ground                control.       The    pictures will       be in my mind for a

long    time to come.             We were e v e n t u a l l y   conveyed back to Woo d s e a t s

Police S t a t i o n by bus and f i n ished duty at 6 . 4 5 pm (1845)                   that date.



My general         o b s e r vations      on the day      in relation to the fans and

policing       of the event are as follows!



I was ma i n l y      involved w i t h the         policing of the turnstiles               open to

N o t t i n g h a m Forest     fans      prior to the match.          I found them to be well

beha v e d on the whole and                in good spirits,         if anything,      I w o u l d say

that    they were quiet for such an occasion.                         It seemed to be a nice

fa m i l y day out for m any who attended.



There were         no problems at the P e nistone Roa d end of the ground and

e v e r y t h i n g a p p e a r e d to   run smoothly and a c c o r d i n g    to plan.



My obse rvations at the scene                   of the d i s a s t e r are    that   I found the        safe

L i verpool      fans to be tota l l y unc o — operatyve              throughout      the    incident.

O f f icers were        cont i n u o u s l y   requesting fans to move back from the

fencing       but were met wit h abuse and total                   dis r e g a r d for what was

happening.



Fans    that had made            their w a y onto the           pitch also hampered the         rescue

at t empts     by Offic e r s       trying     to get the dead and           injured onto the

pitch.        They also        refused to move out of the way when                   requested and
                                                                                                          PAGE 11
                                                                                                          S3340

            con t i n u o u s l y shouted abuse at the eme r g e n c y services            present.       As   I

            have also      outlined    I was    hit by coins        thrown from the L e p p i n g s Ln

            Stand.



            I found that       in spite     of the total        unexpected        incident and        impossible

            c i r c ums tances all    officers       present    carried out their duties              to the

            best    of their abilities.             Mr N E S B I T took    commapfll of the s i t u a t i o n at

            jgate number      three a n d officers w o r k e d together            to rescue the        people

            from the stand and a d m i n i s t e r       first aid.         The si t u a t i o n at the

            L e p p i n g s Ln end d i c t a t e d the number    of officers        that were able to

            a s s i s t at what t r a n s p i r e d to be a confined area.             Too man y officers at

            that    location w ould have        only h a m pered the situation.                   /



            I d i s c o v e r e d at the end of the        incident that the Negr/i in the S t a n d as

            outli n e d earlier was       in fact an off duty Police Officer                   from t h e

            M e t r o p o l i t a n Police Force,    and deserves         r e c o g ni/ion for his brave

               forts.

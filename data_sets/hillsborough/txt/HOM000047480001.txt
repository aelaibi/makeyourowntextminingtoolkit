 We spoke about the ‘body files’ which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith would like to see and which
 it would be helpful if you could arrange to send to us here as soon as possible. The full list
 (of 24) is attached. In each case we need to see both parts of the file - i.e. both the material
 which was presented to the Inquest and that which was not. We hope not to keep these for
 long and will return them as we found them.

 2.         We would also like to see copies of the following statements from your files -

              Paul Taylor (survivor, involved with Victoria Hicks) - one statement, dated 4 May
              1989.

             Tony Edwards (ambulance driver) - two statements, dated 7 May and 25 October
             1989.

              John Flack (ambulance driver) - any statements.

              Howes (ambulance man) - statement dated 15 September 1989.

 3.         Thanking you in anticipation

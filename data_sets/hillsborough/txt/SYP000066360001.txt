We    parked       the       car    somewhere             in the       area      of     Browning          Rd       off       the       A61       in

Sheffield          but       I'm    not       sure       about    that,.

The    four       of    us w a l k e d        down       the    A61    joining          the    steady          flow          of    fans.

stringent          and       did    far       more       to    prevent       opposing          fans       from m i n g li ng                    but

this    year       compared             to    last       it was       merely       a    police       presence                and       I di d

I never         saw any        f an s        drinking          alcoholic         drinks.            I saw          them       go       into

newsagents             and    other          shops       but    those       I saw       drinking          had          soft       drinks

like    coke       and       I neither             saw any       fight                                                             posing

there        were       definitely              a    lot m o r e             people.           It w a s         a huge          mass        of    people

trying          to    get     in.         The       police           here         this    year        had       no    chance          of

organising              the m a s s        into          queues.              I saw       no    stewards              this       side        of    the

t u r n s t i 1 e s .We       got       into        the       crowd and             I asked           a    number          of    people           where

the    turnstiles                for      the       terraces              were      but    no-one              knew.         I was          unable        to

ask    a     policeman             because           there           weren't         many       of        them about             and        the    one

I could          n o w see         I c o u l d n ’t get                 to    due    to    the        crush          of    the       cr o w d .        The

crush        increased and                 I was          literally                carried        to       the       West       Stand

about        it.        About        14    fj/^f r om          these          turnstiles              I saw a bout               f o u r y p o 1 i ce

supporters              in the          crowd        shouting,                "They       got     no       fuckin          t i c k e t s , 11 a n d

similar          other        statements                 to    the        same      effect.               At    the       time       I thought

they were             doing        this       either           to a s s i s t         people          into       the       ground           or

because          of     the      cr u s h ,     but       now        looking         back, on             it    I feel          that        they       were

trying          simply        to    get       as     many          in as          they    could           but    they were              higher          up

and    had       their        own       opinions              of     the      crowd       from        their          vantage          point        and

obviously             had     their        own       reasons              for      what    they           did.

I passed             the    turnstile               at    about           quarter         to    three.               (1445)           The        crowd

p u s h e d me        to    the     turnstile                 and       I wa s      pressed           hard against                   th e    actual

turnstile             and     the       pressure              of     the      crowd       was     making             it    cut       into        me.      I

said       to    th e      fellow         behind          the        turnstile,            " C a n we           get       through           here       with

about        the      crowd.

He    replied,             "IMo c h a n c e .            You       can't          come    through              here."           I sai d ,

"You're          fucking           joking           aren't           you.          There's        a       crowd       of a b o u t          7,000

Before          he    could        reply a           police             se/geant.,         th e       other          side       of    the

 urnstile,              said       to     him,       "Let          rt     go."       The       fellow           obviously             did        because

I just        shot       into        the    ground,             followed            by a      continuous           stream         of

supporters            including             rny t w o        brothers             and                    While     I was         waiting

for    them        I said          to     this       police        sergeant             (showing          him my       tickets)

"Where        do y o u        get       into     this        end,"           He     replied,           "Just     get       in a n y w h e r e ,

where        you    c a n."

I have        since        handed          my    ticket          back        to L i v e r p o o l        Football          Club and          had

my money           back.

Together           with my           two    brothers             and                    we    joined       a    continuous             chain

of    supporters              from        these       particular                 turnstiles            and went        through          an^

which        went     through             the    West       Stand.

The    crush        had       practically               gone       now,          it w a s     just       a flow       of    people       but

definite           surge.            I cannot           say      if t h e r e          were      any     gates     open         other    than

As    th e    flow       of     us      went     into       the        tunnel          it wa s      so    cj^Jwded a n d          because

of    the     surge        we      had     no    choice          but     to       go    to    t h e / r i g fvt of     the       barrier        at

the    end     of     the       tunnel.              The    surge        pushed          m$rlawn          the    pen       until       it was

impossible            to      go     any    further             due     to       the    crush       of    people       in       front    of

me.     They        were        compacted             and       I was        pressed          against          them    by       the

continuous            surge          of    people          s t i ll     corning         into      the     pen    behind          me.     Th e

of    those       bobbies            told       me       to    ’get     off      the p i t c h , ’ ^ m d       I went        over          by

the S o u t h S t a n d          trying             to    get       back    but       I c o u l d n ’t.       There     were        some

Notts       fans       in th e H o p            e nd      shouting,           "Die y o u       bastards,"              In      fact        as 1

had    been       going         between             the       South     Stand and            the    Hop       with    people          on    the

hoardings          some         of    the N o t t s            fans     spat      at    us.        They       must    have        known

what    was       going         on    because             they       would       have       seen    all       the    bodies         going

past    but       I remained               near          enough       near       the m i d d l e        of    the    South Stand                on

the    edge       of    the      pitch          until          it w a s     announced          that          the    match      had      been

abandoned.              At a b o u t           4.30       pm       (1630)     I then met            up w i t h m y       two        brothers

and               and walked               out       of       the    ground       by w a y     of       the N o r t h    West        Terrace

but    we    let       the      ground          empty          a    lot m o r e       before       we     attempted          to     leave.

I feel       if    not       for      the       fireman             and a     lot      of    the    supporters           a     lot      more

people       may       h av e    died,              The       Police       did    not       seem    to       know what         to     do    but

then    again          they may            not       have          realised       straight          away       what     w as      happening

and    what       did all            the       damage          was    the     dividing         fences          in the        pens       which

prevented          the       crowds            from       spreading           out a n d       contributed             towards           the

The    trip       also       involved             stopping                at     Sheffield             W e d n e s d a y ’s       ground             f or

approximately                twelve          vH4rty.After                      lunch       we     all       got    back          on    the          coaches

and    travelled             as    far       as    HalNi^ax               R d,      which       is     approximately                   fifteen

minutes       walk          from     the         ground,             we    all       went       down        to    the       ground             together.

Before       leaving             Sheffield             Wednesday's                   ground,           we    met       up    with          a

Sheffield          Wednesday             fan,          I d o n ’t k n o w             his       name,        he    wanted             to       go    to     the

match,       and       purchased             a    spare             ticket          from                                and       he       travelled

with    us    on       the       coach,          and       stayed          with       my     brother             and    myself             until          we

got    to    the       ground.
                                                                            C O
We    got    to    the       entrance             of       the       g r o u n d at        aboutNgu^rter                    past       two,

the    Sheff ield            Wednesday             fan          and       myself          all     had       £6.0tK terrace                     tickets,

for    Leppingi*            Lane     end.         The       organiser                                        had        a    sit       downticket,

so    left    us       with       the    SheffY^N^d^Wednesday                              fan       to     look       after          us.

At    the    entrance,             we    joined             a       large        mass      of     people,          there          were          no

organised          queues,          at       each          side       of       the    mass        of      people        was       a mounted

policeman,             we    j^ioned             the       huge       crowd          to    the       right        hand       side          and       were

pushed       along          with    t n K crowd,                    towards          the     turnstiles,                I would                say     there

were    about          five       thousand             people             in     this      crowd,           and    we       were       being

pushed       all       the       time,       from          the       back,          the    crowd          never        eased,          as       people

were    passing             through          the       turnstiles,                   more       and       more     people             were

arriving          at    the       ground,          causing                more       pressure             from     the       rear.             I managed

the    turnstiles,                I was          getting             crushed          so     much         that     I started                   crying,

and    asked       the       policeman             on       the       horse,          to     "Help          me",       he    attempted                 to

                  I suffer             w i t h ass t h m a        and       had     just         managed        to    get       my       inhaler       out    of

                  pocket,             I did       have       chance          to     use      it,       about      three         times,          before

                  c o l l a p ^ H g . I remember                       that       I d i d n ’t f a l l          over,          so    must       have    been

                  upright             all    the       time.

                   he    next          thing          I remember             was       being       in a        p olic e m o b i l e unit,               and    I was

                  sat     on      a    chair,          I was       alone          except          for     a    po1iceman_and                a     police      lady,

                  I was        aware         that       I was          actually             in    the     ground          at    this       time,       and    had
p0'J-^SccJo'

b °\l             come       round,          my       legs    were          still       shaking           though.

                  About        ten      minutes             later,                     and       the    Sheffield              Wednesday          fan       came
   'i J d   IX-
                  into       the       mobile          unit       so    see       if    I was          alright,           I had          recovered          enough

                  to    go     into         the       ground       with       them,          I could           say    the       time       was    about       ten       to

                  three        now.

                  We    walked          from          the    mobile          unit       which          is a p p r o x i m a t e l y        twenty       yards

                  from       the       tunnel,                     and       myself          were       going        to    go       into    the       tunnel       to

                  watch        the      match          behind          the    goal,          but       the     Sheffield             Wednesday          fan    told

                  us    not       to.       We    had       got    to       the        edge       of    the     tunnel          and       could       see    that       it

                  very       crowded             at    that       time

                  The    Sheffield                Wednesday             fan       because          he     knew       the       grsHind^so         we f o l l o w e d

                  him    upstairs,                around          the       back       of    the       Stand,        and       down       i n\p   P e n 7 , we

                  stood        about         half       way       up^jusl              adjacent           to    the       upper          seating       area    of

                  the    West          stand.

                  This       st^fd          was       fairly       empty          and'could             have      housed            at    least       another

                  thousand             peopSLe,         we    had       a    l ot      of    room.

                  We    stood          there          for    about          five       minutes          and     saw       the       players        come      out

                  onto       the       pitch.          The    match          started             and    shortly           after          I saw    a    policeman

                  come       onto       the        pitch      and       approach             the       referee.           I    looked       across          towards

the    Pens       behind       the      goal       and       saw    people             clambering                over    the       top       of

the    front        fence,        I saw       others          being          past       over,          everyone          looked

crushed,          and     even     1 could             see    that       there          were       too       many       people          in    the

P e n s . We      stayed       in P e n       7    just       watching,                I saw       a    lot       of    fans       come       onto

the    pitch,        either        over       the       fences          by    themselves                or       being       helped          over

by    police        and     other       fans.

I saw       one     fan     a man       being          given       mouth          to    mouth          by    an    ambulance             man,       he

was    laying        near      the      goal       and       wearing          casual           clothes,            I saw       other          fans

ripping        at    t he    fence       to       let    the       fans       out,       others             had ripped

down    th e      advertising            hoardings                and    I saw          them       run       past       with       people           on

the    hoardings,            being       carried             towards          ambulances,                   some       ambulances             were

on    the    pitch,         others       were          parked       at       the       far     end      of       the    North       stand.

This    was       when      I think       the          Nottingham             Forest           fans         were       aware       of    what

was    happening,            and     some         of    them       came       running             across          to    assist.              It    was

just    sheer        panic,        everything                going       on       at    once.

I was       aware       that      people          had    died,          because          I saw          them       lying       on       the

pitch       with     coats        over    there          heads,          and       a    l ot      of    people          crying,          but

there       was     nothing        we    could          do.

I    heard     an    announcement                 of    the       tanoy       saying           that         the    match       had       been

abandoned,           it     was    then       that       we       decided          to    go       out       of    the    ground.              Once

outside        we    waited        at    least          three       quarters             of       an    h o u r fo r

we    were     getting         worried,            but       then       saw       him,       he    was       crying          and    very

upset,       he     took                and       myself          back       to    the       coach          in H a l i f a x       Rd,       the

Sheffield           Wednesday           fan       left       us    at    the       ground          to       make       his    way       home.

At    the    coaches,          all      our       party       were       accounted                for       and    we    made       the

journey        home.

Everything           I have        stated          in    this       statement                is    true,          as    well       as    i can

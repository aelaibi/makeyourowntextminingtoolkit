ground        t he       turnstiles                 wasyt^ongested.                  There         were        no    queues,            people

were     j u st      as a mass.                     /

There        were        people           c<drriing f r o m        two        directions               and     because            of    the

location            points          of        the       turnstiles,             people       with           terrace          and       stand

tickets         had          to    cross         each         others        path,      causing              confusion.

We     joined        the          en d    of     t he m a s s      of       p eo p l e ,    just        inside         t he       open       blue

outer        gates.               It w a s       heavily          congested.                As     we w e r e         standing              there        the

crowd        built           up b e h i n d         us.        There        didn't         seem        to     be a n y m o v e m e n t            at     the

turnstiles.

I could         s ee         four        police          officers           stood against                   the     turnstile               walls,

b ut    they were                 not     controlling              th/crowd.                  They appeared                   to       be

squashed.                                                              (

At a b o u t        2.45pm           ( 1445)            I saw     two       p o l i c e m e n , one           I think         w a s a S gt .,

Sgt.     then        shouted,                 "Shut       t he    ga t e" .

This     order           was       carried              out.      The       gate     was      shut          and     the      officers             then

walked        back           the w a y         they       had     come.

              was     getting           very       heavily           crowded.

              With     my wife            I managed             to       g et    near      to       the w a l l ,        the     newsagent             side,

              where         the     crowd was             slightly              le ss    dense.            We     then m a n a g e d          to   get      out

              the     side        of L e p p i n g s       Ln       from        th e    ground.

              It w a s       now about             3pm     ( 1 5 Q Q)       and        I cjcrtj1 d see          the      crowd was            very       heavy

              and     there         was      no    police           control/^f             it.

                     this     stage          this        was    too       late a n d          did        not    prevent          the     problem.

              *      witnessed            bodies         climbing               over     the     turnstiles.                    I could        n ot      say how

              I was         talking          to m y w i f e          and        the     next        minute        the      crowd        had

            There       was     an       o b v i o u s / lack            of     escape           routes       for the p e o p l e    on    the

            more       like a n a c c e s s            gate            for    the      groundsman             rather     than an       escape

            There       seemed         to    be a              la ck    of    commt/ni c a t i o n a n d          the    police       did       not    seem

            seem       to    know what            was           going        on.

            I cannot          understand               why         someone           did     not       se e   that     the   centre        pens were

            full       and    close         them       off,            directing            to    the     side    terracing         where        there

            was    room.
                                                                                   /

            comparisons               between          the>(wo               d at es .

            I think          t h at    the     entrance                 turnstiles               are    indadequate          to     cope    with

            larger          crowds       and      it       becomes            a very         c o n g e s t e d area.

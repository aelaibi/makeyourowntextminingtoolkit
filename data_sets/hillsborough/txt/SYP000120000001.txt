                 I am          a    Police             Constable          in    the    South       Yorkshire          Police,          presently

                 stationed                   at    Rotherham.

                 At    9.00             a.m.       on       Saturday,          15th    Apri,       1989,       I was       on    weekly          leave       duty

                 but       due          to    the       football          match       duties       with    the    Liverpool             v Nottingham

                 Forest             semi-final                game       at    Hillsborough,             I attended             at    Main       Street

                 Police             Station.

                 On    arrival                at       Main       Street,       I along       with       several       other          officers,          was

                 conveyed                by       coach       to    the       Hillsborough          football          ground,          arriving          there

                 for       a       briefing             in    the    Hillsborough             ground       for    around             10.00       a.m.        The

                 briefing                took          place       and    I was       directly          under    the       command          of    Inspector

                 Ellis             on    Sector             14.     I was       on    serial       37    under    the       serial          Sergeant,

                 Sergeant                Kennedy             from    'C H ' .        The    duties       for    that       day       were    to    attend

                 at    the          Wadsley             railway          station       and    to    await       the    arrival          of       the    train

                 that          was       carrying             Liverpool          supporters.

                My     duties,                along          with    other       officers,          was    to    search          the    supporters             at

                 random             as       they       left       the    railway          station,       prior       to    them       being       escorted

                 to    the          ground             by    Sergeant          18H9    France       and    his    officers,             who       were       also

        train       and       which        I understood                   was       to    have       on    board       550       supporters,
    *
        came    as       a    surprise           as       only       one       train       arrived          and       in    total          I would

        estimate             about       200     supporters                in a l l        were       on    board.

        These       supporters              appeared             to       be    in       good       humour       and       very       friendly,

        none    appeared              to    have          been       drinking             and       they    consisted                of    ' f a m i l y 1'

        type    supporters.

        Prior       to       the    arrival           of       the    train          several          hundreds             of    supporters,              all

        of    whom       I believe              to    be       Liverpool             supporters,                were       making          their        way

        along       Halifax          Road,           past       the       railway          station          and       down       towards           the

        football             ground.            Many       of    these          supporters                were    seen          to    be    carrying

        not    only          six-packs           of       beer       and       lager,          but    12    packs          EACH.           They     were

        also    seen          drinking           beer/lager                from          large       two    litre          plastic          bottles

        and    they          appeared           to    be       in a       jovial,          happy          mood,       some       being          rather

        boisterous.                 liy a t t e n t i o n        was       drawn          to    a    group       of    six       to       eight     male

        supporters             across           the       opposite             side       from       the    Wadsley             railway

        station.              One     of    these          youths          aged          about       1<b t o     17    years,             was     totally

        drunk       and       I,    in     company             with       Police          Constable             14H9       Bashforth,              crossed

        the    road          and    spoke        to       the    unknown             youth.           He    was       very       unsteady           and

        worse       the       wear       for     drink.              He    was       sitting          on    a    small          wall       and

        appeared             unable        to    stand          unaided.                 Police       Constable             Bashforth              spoke

        to    the    older          member           of    the       group          and    told       him       that       the       younger        man

        would       not       be    let     in       the       ground          in    that       state.           The       older          man     was

        reasonable             and       understanding                    and       said       he    would       arrange             someone         to

        stay    wih          the    younger           man.           They       then       continued             on    their          way,

        assisting             the     young          man       along.           He       was    not       arrested,             firstly           because

        his    friends             were     helping             him       along          and    secondly,             due       to    the       amount

        of    passing          supporters                 in    comparison                to    Police          presence,             to     do    so     may

        have    resulted              in P o l i c e           injuries.

        The    day       itself          was     very          hot    and       I was          approached             many       times          whilst        in

        the    location             of     the       Wadsley          railway             bridge/station,                   asking          which
                                                                                           PAGE 3
                                                                                           R361


public    houses       were    open.        Although       public       houses     were     In that

Immediate       area,    many     had their         doors       and windows        boar d e d up.          I was

unable    to assist       in these          enquiries,          firstly       because     I do not         know       the

area and       secondly,       it a p p e a r e d   that       they    had drunk       enough       alcohol

without going          in search       of anymore.

I would    estimate       that we had been                at    the railway        station         for    three

hours when       the    train     arrived.          As p r e v i o u s l y    stated,     these         supporters

were    good n a tu re d and well            behaved and made                their way under Police

escort    to the       ground.        The    serial       I formed part of also e s c o r t e d                  the

supporters       from    the    train down          to the       football       grounds,          arriving       on

the    front    of Leppings          Lane.

I would estimate          that       the    time    was    just       gone    2.00 p.m.      that        day and

Leppings       Lane was       very busy with            suppo r t e r s      on foot.       I was        under       the

i mpression      that very        few s u pporters             made    any positive         attempt        to enter

the    ground    and several          unknown       (to me)          senior o f f icers       (i.e.       I n s pector

level)    came    to me       and other          officers       shouting       for us     to get         the

supporters       into the       ground.           In our       small    group    of officers             it was

almost    i m possible        to get       the    crowd to move           to the     turnstiles.               The

crowd w ould not         form any orderly                queues       and pushed       constantly          against

each other.        Several        supporters            went    up onto       the grass       banking          owned

by the    tyre    fitting       company          directly       opposite       to the     Leppings         Lane

entrance.        Officers       were       unable       to get       these    s u pporters        back    onto       the

roadway.        This    group     of p r o bably         40 to       50 supporters        were      drinking

heavily,       supping    from large             plastic       two litre       cann i s t e r s    and tin cans

of beer    and lager          etc.

I,    along with what          appe ared         only    a few Police          Officers,          made    hopeless

attempts       to get the       s upp orters        into       the    ground.      It was,         as    I at    the
                                                                                              PAGE 4
                                                                                              R361




time described,             'LIKE S T I RRING P O R R I D G E ' .           Everyone          went       w h e rever    they

pleased.        Many    s u pporters         would     approach          and ask me how to get                       into a

certain area within                the    ground but un f o r t u n a t e l y ,           I know nowhere

either     inside      or    outside        the ground.            The    coloured          tickets         did not

help as I was          unable       to see      the    colour        coded boards             on    the     turnstile

entranceways.           I feel        that      they   should        have      been s i t u a t e d well             above

head height,          so that       supporters         to the rear             of the      crowds         could have

seen     the correct         queue       that    they were          r e q u i r e d to get         into.        What    was

in fact happening,              was      that   s upporters          were      choosing what              they       thought

was    a queue.

At around       2.45 p.m.          the    crowding       became        intense         and shoul d e r          to

shoulder pushing             and    heaving was          taking place.                 Still,       no    one    appeared

to know where          they were          heading.         I saw at this               stage       supp o r t e r s    with

y oung    children      aged a p pr o x i m a t e l y      10 years         old,       now w a l k i n g       away    from

the    crowds    and one       man       c o mmented     to me       that      it was       'BLOODY         DISGUSTING'

and he said       that       the o rg an is at i o n       was     pathetic.            The    c r o wding       was    very

tight and it was             b e c oming     d if fi c u l t    to raise        my arms        from my sides.

To    be closely       compact        was    b e c oming       clost r o p h o b i c    and because             we were

so close,       the    smell       of stale       'ale'        on the     breath of the               suppo r t e r s    was

strong.       I had with me my personal                        radio     but    it was        difficult          to hear

transmiss i o n s .

Ar around 2.50 p.m.                I heard a voice              almost      p l e ading       with       the    control

to have      'the g a t e 1 opened.             By now suppo r t e r s           were      c l i mbing         over    the

entrance      wall     and I saw an officer                    trying     to prevent           this       happening.

The    Moun t e d Officers          at this       location         were     so tightly             packed       that    they

were     v i r tu al ly useless,          not    being     able      to move.           ( I npsector           Ellis    on

over     the radio           for    all     available      officers         to enter the ground.                    I

assumed        that a pitch           invasion        had o c c u r r e d    and I, with             other    officers

from serials               36 and 37, a tt em p t e d to enter the ground by the left

entrance           c on c e r t i n a gates.      I was     the    last      Police Offi c e r             to enter       the

ground       in company            with Police        Constable         1266 Adshead.                I began       to

follow the           other o f f icer s        when    I heard      a call         from behind me.                 It was

the    gateman         at    the    location      and he was        unable         to close          the    gate    after

us due       to the         crowd push i n g      the gates        open.          I r e t u r n e d with      Police

C on s t a b l e    Adshead        and f o r cibly     pushed      outside         the ground          the    invading

supporters           and by brute           strength,       pulled       the      conc e r t i n a    gates

together.            In     fact,    the    gateman      was   unable        to ef f i c i e n t l y       carry    out

his duties           and did not           appear     to be p h y s i c a l l y        strong     enough,         without

regard       to m e n tally         strong     enough,      to say       'NO'      to the        supporters         who

were     trying        to enter       by force.          I, with Police                Constable       Adshead,          then

made     an attempt           to catch up           with    serial       36/37         but due   to    the    crowd

inside      the         ground,       got    only as    far as      the rear of the              side

shouted       to        us    to get      in the ground        and help out.              He was very        annoyed

as well       as        emotional,          but   I did not reply.                We    could not get         any

Leppings           Lane.      (Our backs were           near      to the       bridge       and river).             I

public       houses          were       open.         Although            public          houses          were       in    that

immediate          area,          many    had       their       doors          and       windows          boarded          up.        I was

unable       to    assist          in    these        enquiries,               firstly          because          I do       not       know

the    area       and    secondly,             it     appeared            that       they       had       drunk       enough          alcohol

without       going          in    search       of       anymore.

I would       estimate             that    we       had     been         at    the       railway          station          for    three

hours       when       the    train       arrived.              As       previously             stated,          these          supporters

were    good       natured          and    well          behaved          and       made       their       way       under       Police

the    football          ground,          arriving             on    the       front       of       Leppings          Lane.

I would       estimate             that    the        time      was       just       gone       H.OO       p.m.       that       day       and

Leppings          Lane       was    very       busy       with       supporters                on    foot.           I was       under          the

impression             that       very    few       supporters                made       any    positive             attempt          to

enter       the    ground          and    several           unknown            (to       me)    senior          officers          (i . e .

Inspector          level)          came    to       me    and       other       officers             shouting             for    us    to       get

the    supporters             into       the    ground.              In       our    small          group       of    officers             it

was    almost          impossible          to       get     the      crowd          to    move       to    the       turnstiles.

The    crowd       would          not    form       any     orderly            queues          and       pushed       constantly

against       each       other.           Several           supporters               went       up       onto    the       grass

banking       owned          by    the    tyre        fitting            company          directly             opposite          to    the

Leppings          Lane       entrance.              Officers             were       unable          to    get    these          supporters

back    onto       the       roadway.           This        group         of    probably             40    to    50       supporters

were    drinking             heavily,          supping          from          large       plastic          two       litre

cannisters             and    tin       cans    of       beer       and       lager       etc.

I,    along       with       what       appeared          only       a    few       Police          Officers,             made    hopeless

attempts          to    get       the    supporters             into          the    ground.              It    was,       as    I at       t he

they    pleased.              Many       supporters             would          approach             and    ask       me    how    to       get

into    a    certain          area       within          the    ground          but       unfortunately,                   I know

         appeared           to    know         where        they        were          heading« for                 and      l i-t t l o y — i-f— a-fty

         supporters              with     young            children              aged        approximately                   10      years     old,       now

         walking           away     from        the        crowds           and       one         man     commented             to     me    that    it    was

         •BLOODY           DISGUSTING'               and        he    said           that         the    organisation                  was    pathetic.

         The      crowding          was        very        tight        and          it    was         becoming            difficult          to    raise       my

         arms      from      my     sides.             To       be    closely              compact            was         becoming          clostrophobic

         and      because         we     were         so    close,           the          smell         of    stale         'a l e '    on    the    breath

         of    the        supporters            was        strong.           I had           with        me    my         personal          radio    but

         At    around        S.50        p .m.        I heard           a    voice           almost           pleading            with       the    control

to    have         'the       gate'       opened.              By       now    supporters                   were       climbing         over       the

entrance            wall          and    I saw       an    officer             trying             to       prevent        this        happening.

The     Mounted              Officers          at    this          location          were             so    tightly           packed        that

they      were          virtually             useless,             not    being          able          to    move.            (Inspector

Ellis         on    car       spoke       to       crowd       on       tannoy).              A       short       while         later       I heard

a    call      over          the       radio       for    all       available              officers               to     enter        the    ground*,

that      a    pitch          invasion             had    occurred             and       I,       with       other        officers           from

serials            36    and       37,    attempted                to    enter       the          ground          by t h e       left       entrance

concertina               gates.           I was          the       last       Police          Officer             to     enter        the    ground

in    company            with          Police       Constable             1S66       Adshead.                    I began         to    follow          the

other         officers             when       I heard          a    call       from       behind             me.         It     was    the

gateman            at    the       location          and       he       was    unable             to       close       the      gate    after       us

due     to     the       crowd          pushing          the       gates       open.              I    returned           with        Police

Constable               Adshead          and       forcibly             pushed       outside                the     ground        the       invading

supporters               and       by    brute       strength,                pulled          the          concertina            gates

together.                In       fact,       the    gateman             was       unable             to    efficiently               carry       out

his     duties           and       did    not       appear          to    be       physically                strong           enough,        without

regard         to       mentally          strong          enough,             to    say       "NO"          to    the     supporters              who

were      trying             to    enter       by    force.              I,    with       Police             Constable            Adshead,

then      made          an    attempt          to    catch          up    with       serial                36/37       but      due    to    the

crowd         inside          the       ground,          got       only       as    far       as       the       rear     of     the    side

terraces/seating                        area       (left       side).              One    man          with       his     young        boy

shouted            to    us       to    get    in    the       ground          and       help          out.         He    was     very       annoyed

as    well         as    emotional,                but    I did          not       reply.              We    could        not     get       any

further            into       the       ground       and       eventually,                Police             Constable            Adshead          and

myself         returned                outside       the       ground          to    the          front,          right         side    of

Leppings            Lane.               (Our       backs       were       near       to       the          bridge        and     river).           I

was     still           not       aware       of    what       had       actually             taken          place        and     many       people

were      emerging                from    the       ground,             being       male          and       female        alike.            They

were    crying          and       annoyed          as    well       as    bitter       towards                the       Police.

Frustration             was       shown       by    the       supporters             and       a    bitterness                towards          the

Police.           Several          of    these          supporters          were       coughing                   and    choking             and

very    upset.           Some          came    out       without          shoes       on       their          feet       and       some       had

no    shirts       on.        I heard          a    radio       request          for       several                ambulances             to

attend       at    the       Leppings          Lane       end       of    the    ground             and       for       the    attendance

of    the    Fire       Service          with       cutting          equipment.                    My    impression                when       the

Fire    Service          were          called       upon       was       that    due       to       the       compactness                of    the

crowd       people       had       started          to    dehydrate,             although                I was          unable          to

understand          as       to    why       cutting          equipment          was       required.

Many    supporters                who    got       out    of    the       ground       said             it   was        terrifying

inside       and    that          several          had    been       injured.              The          fleet       of    ambulances

arrived       almost          at       the    same       time       as    did    the       fire          tenders.              A    senior

fire    officer          approached                me    to    establish             what          was       happening             and       where

did    the    Police          require          them       to    attend.              I was          unable          to    assist             and

directed          him    to       an    Inspector             standing          nearby.                 This       confusion             went

on    for    some       time       until       I made          my    way    down       the          right          side       of    the       ground

to    the    gates       where          the    injured          were       taken       from.                 I was       then       shocked

to    see    and    count          10    bodies          lying       on    the       ground,             some       tendered             to    by

Police       Officers             and    others          overseen          by    St.       J o h n ’s         first       aiders.              No

screens       were       at       this       time       around       the    bodies,                and       it    was    obvious             that

they    were       in    fact          dead.        I    recall          speaking          to       Police          Constable                Lipski

and    saying       that          I had       counted          10    dead       at    the          top       side       and    he       said

that    it    was       rumoured             that       about       60    were       feared             dead       at    this       time.           I

stayed       near       to    the       10    dead       bodies,          forming          a       human          chain       to    protect

the    bodies       from          the    supporters             leaving          the       ground.                 Several          male

supporters          were          distraught             and    began       visibly                fighting             with       their

friends       on    seeing             the    bodies          and    they       totally             lost          control          of

themselves.              Their          colleagues             held       onto       them          and       in    fact       received

punches       and       kicks          from    their          own    mates.           I heard                the    comment             from       one

spat       at    me       on    the       side       of       the       head.           Even          at    this        time          I was          unclear

as    to    what          had       occurred             or    gone          wrong.              In a n      attempt              to    clear          the

pushing          crowds             who       insisted             in    leaving             by       the    only          gate        available             for

use    by       the       emergency             services,                I,       with       another             group          of     officers,

none       from       my       serial,          went          just       inside          the          outer       gate          led     by       another

middle          aged       sergeant,                whom       I do          not    know.              We    tried           to       form       a    line       to

get    the       crowd          to       clear       the       area          to    leave          room       for        the       emergency

services,             but       we       were       met       by    abuse          and       offers          of       violence              whenever             we

tried       to       move       them          on.        We    tried          to    be       diplomatic                 and       caring             when

moving          the       crowd          on    but       they       had       become             hostile          towards              us.           However,

TWO    supporters                   were       excellent,                one       was       aged          about        55      years        and       he

appealed             to    the          crowd       to    leave          quickly             to       allow       the        emergency

services             access.              Another             young          man    aged          about          S3     years,          was          also

excellent             and       appealed             to       the       crowd       in       a    similar             manner.               This       young

man    was       attacked                by    another             man       and    I    intervened                   to     stop       the

attacker.                 In    fact,          the       crowd          were       now       taking          more          notice           of       the    two

supporters                than          the    Police          and       as       such,          we    left        it      to     them       to       appeal

to    the       crowd.              I    later       spoke          to       the    younger                man    and        thanked             him       for

his    assistance                   although             he    had       received                abuse       and        violence             towards

him.        I did          not          obtain       his       personal             details                but    believe              he    assisted

well       in m o v i n g           on    the       crowd.              It    was       in       fact,       on       speaking              to       this

young       man       that          I was       for       the       first          time          made       aware          of     what       had       gone

wrong.           < He      had          been    in       the       ground          and       had       managed             to     escape).

As    the       crowd          dispersed             more          thinly          we    returned                outside              the    gate          used

by    the       emergency                services             and       I saw       Police             Transit             vans        being          used       to

convey          the       dead          bodies       from          outside          the          ground.

Whilst          at    this          location,             after          some       unknown                amount          of     time       had

                                                                                                                                       R361

              passed,       Police          Sergeant          Kennedy          came    to   me    and     I,    with      other

              officers,          made       my    way    to       the    Wadsley       railway       station         on    foot      (as    p er

              plan).        The    moving          of    traffic          on    Halifax       Road      had     almost      come      to    a

              standstill          and       supporters             on    foot    made       their    way       up   the    road      away

              from    the    ground.             Many        of    the    supporters          were      dishevelled            and    clearly

              shaken,       as    were       many       Police          Officers.

              Several       supporters             asked          where    the    nearest         telephones            were    and    due      to

              not    being       local,          I was       unable       to    assist.       I feel       that     a     stunned

              silence       had    come          over    the       majority       of    the      supporters         who     made      their

              way    home.        I,    with       my    serial,          later       returned       to    Claywheels           Lane       prior

              to    returning          to    *C1*       by    coach       and    going      off     duty.

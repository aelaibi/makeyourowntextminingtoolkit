The Rght Hon John Major


Dear Sir,
Re: Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
I am writing to ask for the dismissal of Mr Duckinfield and mr
Murray, Senior Police Officers, who were responsible for the
death of 95 people.
Mr Duckinfield has been suspended from the South Yorkshire
Police Force on full pay since that dreadful day.      How long
must it go on. If I had been involved in a similar tragedy, I,
a normal person, would have been dismissed and faced a long
time in prison.   Do the Police have separate rules from the
rest of society they seem to make mistakes and get paid for it I
I have written to my own M.P., the Home Secretary, Mr Kinnock
and Mrs Thatcher in a vain attempt to have questions raised in
the House of Commons.
One very sad bereaved mother who has lost faith in British
Justice.
Yours sincerely,


PATRICIA JOYNES

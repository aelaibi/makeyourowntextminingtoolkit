Dear Sirs,
                                f
Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has o n l y limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
submit.

Yours faithfully.

Thank you for your letter of the 14th of March.   I note
what you say regarding Simon's parents.

We will endeavour to meet your wishes regarding the listing,
but I am sure you will appreciate that it is an exceedingly
difficult matter with so many people involved.

Yours faithfully,

               Simon Bell (deceased) No.52
               We note that the Hillsborough Inquests are to be re-opened, commencing on the 17th April
               1990.

               We would advise you that the late Mr. Bell's parents are most anxious to attend the Inquest,
               however, they have advised ourselves that they will be holidaying abroad from 21st April.
               This is, in fact, our Client's'first vacation since the tragedy.

               We would be grateful if you would kindly advise us of the date when Simon's Inquest will
               be heard. If it is due to be heard after the 21st, we would ask you to re-list it for an
               earlier date.

               We look forward to a favourable response from you.

               Yours faithfully,

      ^              Sirs,

      Re:            SUSS® m i&           (deceswsed) So.$2,
      As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
      Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
      be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
      on the 15th of January 1990*

      I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
      has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
      behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
      Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

      I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
      Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
      he may wish to undertake.

      I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
      or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
      matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
      a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
      on this matter further.

      I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
      is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
      fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).
  \
      Yours faithfully,

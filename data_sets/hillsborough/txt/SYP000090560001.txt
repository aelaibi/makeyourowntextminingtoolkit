             On Saturday 15 th April     1989 I wer?t >ro the FA Cup Semi Final at

             Hillsborough with my son             amd three other friends.

                       his friend        &, I had tickets for the North Stand and

             entered the Ground through the turnstiles at Lepping L a n e .

             I know about the incident that                 saw in respect of the policeman

             taking money at one of the gates but I did not see anything of this.

             After the disaster we talked about        it on the way home on the bus and

             know that           mentioned it when he filled his questionnaire       in with

             the policewoman.                       had left us earlier because he had a

             ticket for the Lepping Lane terraces and w a s n â€™t there as we went into

             the ground.                    was   in his seat in the North Stand when we

             got into the stand.

Dear Mr Croston

ADLINGTON - V - DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY, SCHEDULE OF STATEMENTS
DOCUMENTS, PLANS & PHOTOGRAPHS DISCLOSED & COPIED TO MS ADLINGTON

With reference to our telephone conversation of this morning, please find enclosed a copy of the
above schedule for your information.

I also enclose a copy of Ms Adlington’s letter of 15 November 1999, in which she requested the
schedule. I have not yet formally responded to the other points in her letter, but I will forward to
you a copy of my letter when I do so. I have, however spoken to Ms Adlington by telephone and
told her of my reasons for not disclosing the index of actions from HOLMES. She indicated that
she would contact yourself in relation to my refusal.

Yours sincerely


                                                                                      r

  15 November 1999

  Dear Mr Hepworth

  SYP-Archivs
  Solicitors for Mr Murray have asked me to provide an index of all material “uplifted” from the
  archive. In order to ensure that I have provided copies of all material to the defence, I should
  be grateful if you would forward a copy of your list. As discussod previously, I am unable to
  locate the statement of PC         , yet Tam almost certain that I have been provided with a     S' ?
  copy of his statement. If this is the ease, I should be grateful if you would send me a further
  copy.

  Leading Counsel has also advised me to obtain an index of “Actions”

  Finally, were you able to ascertain the whereabouts of the photographs which ought to have 'f r t f '
  been in the file marked “Hicks”? You will recall that I drew this to your attention on 78
  Octobcr.

  I thank you for your assistance


  Yours sincerely




  Ann Adlington

     Dear Sir

     HILLSBOROUGH PRIVATE PROSECUTION
     ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD                                                                                                                                                                    .

     We write with the benefit of Mr William Clegg QC’s advice, on behalf of David ,
     Duckenfield to invite you to enter a nolle prosequi in relation to two counts of an indictment *
     he faces at the Crown Court sitting at Leeds.

     The defendant was the senior police officer in charge of the Hillsborough Stadium at the ;
     time of the disaster in April 1989 when 95 supporters died as the result of crushing. He has i
     been committed for trial on three counts by the Magistrates Court, two COUIltS ot
     manslaughter and one of misfeasance in public office. Wc do not invite you to enter a nolle
     prosequi in relation to these counts.

     The remaining two counts of the indictment contain allegations of falsely telling persons
     inquiring into the causes of the disaster, that the crush had been caused by spectators who
     had broken down a gate, and of failure to correct the false belief relating to that cause,
     induced by the alleged statements. Two counts arc based on these allegations, firstly, a
     charge of making statements tending and intended to pervert the course of justice, and
     secondly, misconduct in public officc. It is the history of these allegations that prompt this                                                                                                 i
     invitation.
                                                                                                   j
     Originally the defendant was summoned on four charges, the three now represented by the 1
     first three counts of the indictment and a fourth charge alleging that Duckenfield did an act <
     which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice.                                        j

     On the 1st July 1998 we invited the Director of Public Prosecution to take over the conduct
     of the proceedings under Section 6 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and to
     discontinue them under Section 23. On the 18th December 1998 the Crown Prosecution I
     Service wrote indicating that they would not take over the proceedings and discontinue. W e
     sought further information in a letter of the 23rd Dccembcr and received a reply on me iM

    February 1999 which stated, in reference to the allegations that Duckcnfield had done an act
    attempting to pervert the course of justice:-

             “1 had formed the view that there was dearly no case to answer on that charge.”

    There followed an application for judicial review before the High Court, judgment being
    given on the 30lh March 1999. Mr Newell writing on behalf of the Director swore an
    affidavit that dealt with the position of partial intervention at paragraph 5 and 6. The Court      I
    having considered the matter quashed the decision of the Director so far as it related to the       !
    charge of attempting to pervert the coursc of justice,

    Thereafter the Director reconsidered the question of intervention and discontinuance of that I
    charge and by letter dated the 12,h April 1999 concluded:-                                   ]

             “1 have decided that the C.P.S. should take over that single charge in order to
             discontinue it... The reason is that there is clearly no case to answer on that charge”.

    The committal then proceeded on the three remaining charges and Duckenfield was
    committed for trial on the 20th July 1999. Thereafter an indictment was settled which
    included the original charge discontinued by the Director and a further charge relating to the
    same allegation.

    It is against this background that the request is made for a nolle prosequi in relation to those    |
    two counts.

    The decision to discontinue the proceedings was made by the Director in the context of the          I
    judicial review decision after hearing lengthy representations by both sides. It was not a          j
    decision that was subject to any further application for judicial review, by the prosecutor.        j

    If the only charge being faced by Duckenfield had been the charge discontinued by the
    Director then clearly there could be no question of any indictment embracing those                  j
    allegations and the effect of the decision to discontinue would be to end the proceedings in        I
    relation to that allegation. This, I anticipate, was the expectation of the Director.

    To permit the prosecutor to reinstate those charges in the form of counts four and five in the          ,
    indictment would be to permit the prosecutor to effectively negate the decision of the
    Director to discontinue. It is only the fact that in respect of other charges, not the subject of
    this application, Duckenfield happened to be committed for trial independently of the
    charges discontinued, that rendered tins course of action possible. Clearly the ability to
    indict a person ought not to be dependant upon circumstances such as those found in this
    case.

    We do not believe that there has ever been a case in the past where an indictment has been
    drawn including charges previously the subject of a decision by the Director to discontinue.
    [t is submitted that the situation is unique and ought to be remedied by the entering of a
    nolle prosequi in relation to counts 4 and 5 of the indictment. This would have the effect of
    preserving the decision of the Director in relation to the allegations that are reflected in the

charges that he discontinued while permitting a trial to proceed in relation to the three
remaining charges that were not discontinued by the Director.

Enclosed with this letter is a copy of the indictment, a copy of the representation made by
each of the parties to the Director, the first decision of the Director and his subsequent
reasoned decision, the Affidavit of Mr Newell, the judgment of the Divisional Couit and Ihe
subsequent decision of the Director pursuant to that ruling.

A copy o f this letter is being sent personally to M s A. Adlington the prosecutor. She has
not instructed solicitors in private practice to act for her but is herself an employed solicitor
with the Liverpool City Council.           Wc ask for an opportunity to respond to any
representations she ch o o ses to make as in the past representations by the prosecutor have
inadvertently contained factual inaccuracies.

Yours faithfully

    Termination o f Proceedings



                   infant) v Manchester City Recorder (1971) AC 481. This power is
                   discretionary and is usually instigated by defence application.

    9.46           There does not seem to be any reason why the prosecution should not invite the
                    court to amend the plea to not guilty with a view to offering no evidence. You
                    will need to explain to the court why it is not considered appropriate to let the
                    case take its usual course. If the defendant is not represented, you can ask the
                    court to use its powers of its own accord. The defendant should be told of the
                    court’s intention.

    9.47           Once the plea is changed, the prosecution can be terminated* If the magistrates
                    decline to reopen or to substitute a not guilty plea, or are unable to do so, ask the
                    court to treat the reasons put forward for terminating the case as being relevant
                    to sentence. It is possible to suggest a discharge may be appropriate, but to do
                    more may be interpreted as prosecution intervention in the sentencing process.

    9.48           There may also be rare occasions when it will be appropriate to terminate a
                    prosecution, after a guilty plea or conviction, on evidential grounds. The need
                    to do so will arise when it comes to light for the first time, after plea, that the
                    prosecution evidence is seriously flawed. Normally, no consideration of expense
                    or hardship applies, and the application to change the plea will be made with the
                    defendant present at court.

    9.49            If the original plea was not guilty and the defendant has been found guilty by the
                    magistrates, it may be possible to re-open the case under Section 142 Magistrates’
                    Courts Act 1980 if the magistrates believe it in the interests of justice that the case
                    be heard again by different justices. This applies especially to convictions in the
                    defendant’s absence. But there is a strict time limit of 28 days, and the
                    magistrates may decline to re-open the matter. Examples:

                     •      where the conviction was in the defendant’s absence and he cannot now
                            be traced;

                     •      where it is later discovered that the prosecution evidence is seriously
                            flawed;

                     •      following conviction in the defendant’s absence on motoring document
                             offences, if the documents are produced.

        9.50         If a change of plea to not guilty, or reopening under Section 142 is permitted, the
                     prosecution may be terminated by any of the usual methods. Offering no
                     evidence is generally the most convenient.

                        is most often used in cases where the defendant is physically or mentally unfit
                        be produced at court and the incapacity is likely to be permanent.

            9 52        Given the various methods already available to the prosecution to terminate
                        proceedings at all stages, it is unlikely that the CPS will need to apply for a nolle
                        prosequi, but if, exceptionally, such a situation does arise, or you become aware
                        that the defence have approached the Attorney General, or intend to do so, the
                        procedure to be followed is set out in the Procedure section below.

            9.53        If you are aware that the defence intend to make an application and they agree tc
                         defer it while you review the case, in reviewing where the public interest liej
                         have regard to relevant information which relates to the physical or menta
                         welfare of the defendant. Often, that information will be known only to thi
                         defence and may not have been available to the prosecution at the time of earliei
                         reviews. Where medical reports are known to exist, the defence should be invitee
                         to reveal them for consideration.

            9.54        If, having reviewed the public interest, you decide to terminate the proceedings!
                         notify the defence immediately and inform them of the method by which yoJ
                         intend to terminate the proceedings.


                         The Crown C o u rt: Offering no Evidence

            9.55        In the Crown Court the only method by which the prosecutor can terminal
                         proceedings altogether is to offer no evidence. This applies both to individus
                         counts and to the whole indictment.

            9.56        The judge has a discretion whether to accept the prosecution’s decision an
                        counsel may be reluctant to adopt a course not approved by the judge. But
                        practice, a court cannot compel the prosecution to proceed if the prosecutio
                        decide to offer no evidence.

            9.57         If no evidence is offered, the judge will order a verdict of not guilty. Where
                         jury is in charge, it will be asked to return a formal verdict of not guilty. If
                         jury has not been sworn, the judge will enter the verdict under section 1
                         Criminal Justice Act 1967. This effectively concludes the proceedings and fres
                         proceedings cannot be started.

             9.58        If proceedings are abandoned in the Crown Court on public interest grouni
                         following acceptable pleas to other counts or indictments, inform the police dk
                                                                                                            4
                         form DN2 within 2 days.                                                       *

             9.59        You should notify the police if an indictment or counts have been left on the
                         by sending form DN2 within two working days.                                            «

                        Discontinuance: Notifying Co-Defendants

              9.105     Discontinuance against one person may significantly affect the co-defendant’
                        position. Where you discontinue a case either wholly or in part against on
                        defendant involved, with others, you must inform all the other co-defendants <
                        that fact in writing. Notification should be at the same time as the discontmuarW
                        notice is sent.

              9.106     The letter should state which offences are to be terminated, and which are ■
                         continue. No reason for the decision should or need be given. If represented, tl
                         letter should be sent to the co-defendant’s solicitors.


                         Discontinuance log

              9.107     An additional copy of all notices and correspondence relating to discontinuance
                        should be retained in a discontinuance log maintained by each prosecution tea*.


                         Nolle Prosequi

              9.108      If the CPS considers asking the Attorney General to enter a nolle, the case she
                         be referred, via the ACCP(C) to HQ for the attention of the Head of Casewc
                         Standards Division, together with a note from the responsible Crown ProsecuAr
                         (and counsel’s advice if any) setting out the circumstances and indicating why j
                         approach to the Attorney General is thought necessary.

              9.109      It is more likely that a defendant will initiate an application for a nolle, norma
                          by making a direct approach to the Legal Secretariat (LSLO). If the defe
                          notifies the CPS of his or her intention to make an application, this will give
                          C re the chance to consider whether to terminate the proceedings on
                          interest grounds.

               9.110     If the application has not yet been made, notify your ACCP(C) and ask ftu
                          defence to defer approaching LSLO while the CPS reviews the case.      j

               9.111     If the defence notify the CPS that an application has been or will be made U
                          the defence are unwilling to defer it) the ACCP(C) must immediately notify ^
                          Head of Casework Standards Division. The prosecutor responsible for the c
                          should prepare a background note setting out the details of the case and assess
                          the relevant public interest criteria. This will be passed, via line management^
                          the Head of CSD.

               9.112     Where advance notice is not given, the CPS will probably first become aw;
                         the application through LSLO. In some cases, however, LSLO may contact
                         Areas directly. Where direct contact is made, the ACCP(C) should be noti
                         and ensure that the Head of CSD is aware of the case. CSD will liaise
                          LSLO.

     20"1August 1999

     Dear Mr Dames

     R v, Duvkenfteld and Murray

     Thank you for your letter dated 17th August, which we received by fax. We are encouraged
     that Mr Croston is to be involved in the process of disclosure. I earnestly hope that it can
     begin soon, so that a clearly defined procedure is established and operating in advance of the
     hearing before Mr Justice Hooper on 3rd September.

     I write on the basis that you have satisfied yourself that you are in a position, in law, to
     disclose material prepared and collected, not only by the South Yorkshire police for its own
     and external investigations, but also by the West Midlands police force, and any other outside
     police force that may have investigated the disaster, for the purposes o f;

             (a) the inquiry commissioned by the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire police on
             16® April 1989;
             (b) the Taylor Inquiry;
             (c) the inquiries of the Director of Public Prosecutions;
             (d) the Coroner’s inquest; and
             (e) the investigations of the Police Complaints Authority

     In view of the legal issues arising in this difficult and controversial case, I should be grateful
     for your confirmation in this respect..

     The material which we wish to review as relevant to the trial itself, and in part to the abuse of
     process/ oppression argument which Mr Duckenfield’s solicitors have told us is to be brought
     yet again, is as follows:

        (i)   The originals of all signed edited and unedited reports and statements made by officers
              of the South Yorkshire and any other police forces (eg Nottinghamshire and
              Merseyside) relating to the disaster and its surrounding circumstances. It is necessary
              for us to sec these because of the scale of the editing exercise, and because there is
              doubt surrounding the circumstances in which parts of some statements came to be
              written. The best example of this is, of course, the confusion surrounding the
              statements of Inspector Harry White. You will recall that another statement of his
              come to light after a letter from Dr Popper to Mr Croston in June of this year.

              For the avoidance of doubt, this category includes all statements made by officers as to
    /         the lies told hy David Duckenfield on 15* April 1989 about the circumstances in which
              the exit gates became open.

        (2)   All pocket-books of officers containing notes of the events of 15* April, whether made
              contemporaneously, or within days, or later, and all handwritten and typed “resumes”,
              or other similar notes, made by officers shortly after the incident. The
              Nottinghamshire officers, Brazener, who was called as a live witness at committal,
              Hoad, and Walton refer to them. ( See reports R 498, R 499, and R 450, where one of
              these resumes is apparently attached.)

              All original signed statements collected by the West Midlands police from those who
              had been present at or in the vicinity of the ground at the time of the disaster.

              All notes and tape recordings of meetings held by South Yorkshire police officers in
              the days and weeks after the disaster at which assertions of feet, admissible under
              section 24 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, were made about the disaster. (An
              example is the collection of three sets of briefing notes of meetings held by or under
              the auspices of the Chief Constable on 16* 17thand 19* April, which were produced
              by you to the Magistrates Court on 24* June. If the notes are a transcript of a tape
              recording, we wish to hear and have copies of those tape recordings also)

              All documents, photographs, plans, videotape and models, either prepared to show or
              demonstrate the lay-out of the ground, or which record events at Hillsborough
              between 1 and 6 pm on 15* April 1989, in addition to those produced by the witness
              statement, and whether such things were prepared by police, Sheffield Wednesday
              football club, City Council or emergency services.

        (6)   All tape recordings and transcripts of tape recordings showing the content of
              conversations taking place in or from the police control box between 1 pm and 6 pm
    y         on 15* April 1989, not being conversations recorded by the radio multi-channel
              system (which we have already examined after you produced the tape on 24* May),
              whether made or produced by policc officers or emergency services

        (7)   All tape and video recordings qf accounts given by police officers or other witnesses in
              interview, whether or notundaf t^ution, rehdfag to the disaster.

         the disaster.

(9)     All expert reports prepared for the South Yorkshire or West Midlands police forces,
         whether for any of the above inquiries, or for the contribution hearings of autumn
         1990, apart from the Phillips report of August 1990, a copy of which you produced to
         us in October 1997, If there are other versions of the Phillips report, we wish to see
         them.

 (10)   A copy of the West Midlands Police Report which was sent to the DPP and Coroner in
        1990, This cannot be considered sensitive (a) because a copy nf the Interim Report of
        that forcc of October 1989 is in the Public Record office, (b) because you have a copy,
        though the Report was prepared for the DPP, and (©) because the Coroner has a copy.

 (11)    A copy of the opinion signed by Gareth Williams QC ad Peter Birts QC which was sent
         to the DPP in 1990. This is no longer privileged because a copy has been sent to your
         force, although it was, of course, your force that was primarily under investigation.
         Any surviving privilege was waived when it was produced to Lord Justice Stuart-
         Smith, who quoted from it in the report of his “Scrutiny”.

 (12)    The electronically-recorded versions of the above, where they exist, stored on the
         Holmes computer system. We have ascertained that the material can be copied
         electronically from that system into a disc form that we can use. Such copying will
         relieve us of the need to photocopy vast numbers of documents, although we anticipate
         that there will remain a large number of documents that we shall need to copy after
         inspection.

 (13)    The charges, and list of witnesses statements prepared for, the disciplinary proceedings
         brought against the two defendants, hut abandoned after Mr Duckenfield retired from
         the force.

 We anticipate from your previous attitudes towards the prosecution that you will claim that
 the items in (10) and (11) are “sensitive”. If so, please indicate why you consider them to be
 sensitive, and what reason in law you offer to justify withholding them from the Crown.

 It may be that the list above includes the whole, or practically the whole, of the “archive”.
 We cannot be more specific, of course, because we do not know the identity of all the
 witnesses; a difficulty you will remember that hampered us in specifying material in the witness
 summons. We need to see this material not simply for our own purposes, but because we have
 to disclose all material that may possibly be relevant to the defence. Unfortunately, we do not
 know what the defence will be, and the question which factual issues will be contested at trial
 has not been made known.

 In order to make our task, and yours, more manageable, we have invited the defence to set out
 the nature of their defence, but they have not done so. They declined to do so for what
 appeared to be tactical reasons at the committal.



                                                          20/08   '99 FRI 11:36      [TI/RX NO 5128]

                You will appreciate that the committal changes the responsibilities of the prosecution. Given
                (a) the powerful rejection by the court of the allegations of the defence that we were abusing
                the process of the court, and (b) the strength of the prima facie case, it was not necessary for
              j us, consistent with the law, to do more in two days at the magistrates’ court than to call two
            /   live witnesses, read a few uncontroversial statements, show the compilation video, and read
                 the defendants' evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and Inquest.

          0      Our public duties now that we prosecute in the name of the Crown are greater. We wish to
                 have as complete and full access to your material as if we were the Crown Prosecution Service
                 having the conduct, on indictment, of a case in which your force had investigated and
          y      instituted the proceedings.


      C i A ^ y 1 should be grateful if you could indicate what exactly you mean by “supervised” access. We
C\l             shall wish to inspect and copy material in some privacy, not least because you have expressed
                public support for the defendants, and have procured the costs of their defence and expenses
                from public funds.

                 The above list of material is, I hope, complete so far as trial material is concerned. Other
                 material relevant simply to the abuse hearing may be requested later. I reserve the right to
                 seek other material for the trial, after discussions within the prosecution team. I consider it is
                 more important, however, to give you an early, and possibly incomplete list, than to delay. 1
                 shall send a copy of this to Mr Croston, and seek to arrange an early meeting with him and Mr
                 Hepworth as you suggest.

                 Yours sincerely,

                           REGINA -v- BERNARD MURRAY AND DAVID DUCKENFIELD

                                                                   3rd September 1999

                                          PRE-TRIAL HEARING

                        THE CLERK: Are you David Godfrey Duckenfield?

                        DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD:         I am.

        B               THE CLERK: And are you Bernard Dean Murray?

                        BERNARD DEAN MURRAY:    Yes, I am.

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones, Mr. Clegg and Mr. Harrison,
                 as I think you know, many years ago I gave some advice to the
                 Director of Public Prosecutions. That advice, although it
                 concerned Hillsborough, had absolutely nothing to do with any of
                 the matters with which this Court is concerned. Does any one
                 wish me not to conduct either this hearing or the trial itself,
                 as a result of that?

                      MR. JONES: My Lord, we were all of us given notice of this
                 matter by the Treasury Solicitor, who I think was consulted by
                 the Director of Public Prosecutions about this matter. We have
        D        all given full information about it last week. My Lord, it is
                 obvious that your Lordship's involvement in that was of such a
                 minor kind that cannot affect any issues in this case or from
                 the Prosecution's part, we are grateful for being notified about
                 that. We have no objections at all to your Lordship sitting.

                        MR. CLEGG: We have none.

        E               MR. HARRISON: None, my Lord.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Harrison. The indictment
                  has not been signed. It has been received by the court, as I
                  understand it, as being received within the time as extended,
                  namely 56 days. Is there any objection to the Associate signing
                  the indictment in the normal way?

                        MR. JONES:   Not from us, my Lord, no.

                        MR. CLEGG:   Not from us, no, my Lord.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:    Yes, the indictment may be signed.

                       MR. JONES:   My Lord, I appear for the Prosecution in this
                  case. My learned friends, Mr. Clegg and Mr. Isaacs for the
                  defendant, David Duckenfield, and my learned friends, Mr.
                  Harrisson and Mr. Myerson for the defendant, Mr. Murray. My
                  Lord, by way of preliminary, I do not have a junior with me
                  today. Would your Lordship allow my instructing solicitor to sit
                  behind me, my Lord, in case I need papers?

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.
        H
                        MR. JONES: I am obliged. My Lord this of course is a

                                                     -1-

preliminary hearing, and because there is a trial pending, my
Lord, I think we are all agreed, I have spoken to my learned
friendr Mr. Clegg, briefly about this, that it would therefore
obviously be appropriate to make an order under Section 4.2 of
Contempt of Court Act 1981, prohibiting publication of any
matters arising in this hearing, other than the normal, formal
matters permitted.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: What I normally do is to do this at the
end of the hearing so that we know and the Press can then make
any representations about what should or should not the be
published. Is every in the Press concerned with, a blanket order
until the end of this afternoon's hearing and we will look at it
again? Yes.

     MR. JONES: My Lord, I should   have said, I am sorry, that my
learned, Mr. Godsmark appears for   the Chief Constable of the
South Yorkshire Police.

     My Lord, this is I think a pleas and directions hearing,
and I think we are very much in your Lordship's hands as to how
to proceed. My Lord, we have raised in a note dated Tuesday of
this week, some matters, additionally, which we wish to raise,
in addition to the papers which I think your Lordship had
requested and was supplied by the court last week. My Lord ....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Can I say, the first thing I want to do
is to set the date of the trial, assuming that there is going to
be a trial, as I understand there will be an application that
the indictment should be stayed.

     MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: But assuming that were not to be
successful, I want now to set the date of the trial so that
everyone knows what date to work through. I am perhaps
suggested, I think, the date of June the 6th. Does anyone wish
to make any observations about that? Mr. Clegg?

     MR. CLEGG: My Lord, we have been told that is the first
available date in the court, and in those circumstances, we are
grateful to be able to take advantage of i t .

MR . JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes. The first available date, in the sense
that it is taking into account the huge amount of work that is
going to be needed in this case and the other commitments of the
court.

      MR. CLEGG: So be it.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: One would have liked to have   had it
 earlier, but also one has to have quite a long period   for this
 trial, and advantage of June is that if there were to   be an
 overrun, it would be over running in August, which is   much
 easier for everyone to cope with.

      MR. CLEGG: Well, I can see the advantage of the date, and
 we do not object to it.
k )
                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Right, June the 6th, will be the trial
             date. The length of the trial, you seem to have reached a least
             some agreement, about six to seven weeks, something like that?
             It is early days.

                  MR. JONES: It has to be very tentative because, my Lord,
             the question of the universe of documents that have to be
             examined, but, tentatively, we have suggested for the
             Prosecution case, three to four weeks.
      B
                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, well, will assume a trial of about
             that length, at the moment, anyway. Now, can the indictment be
             put, at this stage? Any objection, Mr. Clegg?

                  MR. CLEGG: No. So far as we are concerned, two Counts have
             been added to the indictment since commitment, Counts four and
             five. They were not charges upon which the defendant,
             Duckenfield, was committed on. One of them mirrors almost
             exactly a charge that was the subject matter of a hearing before
             the Divisional Court, which resulted in the Director of Public
             Prosecutions reconsidering an earlier decision not to exercise
             his powers to discontinue. Following the hearing in the
             Divisional Court, he did reconsider and did discontinue those
             proceedings.
      D             MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                   MR. CLEGG: Notwithstanding that, the charge has reappeared
              on the indictment and is reflected in Count five, the same
              allegation is dressed up, I do not use that word in any
              derogatory sense, but it is dressed up under a different
              heading, but it actually exactly the same allegation differently
      E       described. We intend to apply to Her Majesty's Attorney General
              for a nolle in relation to those two Counts.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                   MR. CLEGG: In relation to the first three Counts on the
              indictment, we will be making an application to stay those,
  0
              which will clearly involve a little time. Were the application
      F       for nolle to fail, in relation to Counts four and five, we will
              be making an application that the court quash those Counts
              because they are not based upon any evidence that was disclosed
              on the Committal papers. It is our submission that the added
              Counts must be reflected upon evidence that was before the
              magistrate. It cannot be supported by, for example, as yet
              unserved notice of further evidence.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, but that can be done by way of
               application for a voluntary bill.

                    MR. CLEGG: It could be, if one were made.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I do not want spend time examining one
               route if another route can cure any problem there may be.
      H             MR. CLEGG: Well,   I propose to close each route as it opens,

                                               -3-

if I am able. So I am dealing with the routes currently open and
I shall seek to close them, and if more open, I shall seek to
close

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: As a matter of law though, is there
anything to prevent the indictment from being put? It does not
in any way prevent you from making these arguments later?

     MR. CLEGG: In my experience, an indictment is not put until
an application to stay has been heard.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, that is not universal practice.

     MR. CLEGG: It is certainly the practice some little way
south of here.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Harrison, what do you think?

     MR. CLEGG: I can seen no advantage in putting it because
everybody knows the defendant will plead not guilty to all
charges, and I can give that very firm undertaking.

     MR. CLEGG: I adopt Mr. Clegg's argument, my Lord.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones?

     MR. JONES: My Lord, it seems to me to be a technical
matter, my Lord. I can see absolutely no reason why the
defendants could not be arraigned today and I do not know which
part of the south my learned friend is referring to, but my
Lord, in my submission, it is pretty general practice that an
abuse of process application now is fairly flexible and can be
made at any time convenient to the court, and it will be my
submission, my Lord, in due course, that the right time to hear
that, since the question of whether the trial should be stayed
concerns matters to be determined in the round, in a variety of
a large number of factors, I do suppose this application should
be determined as close to the date of the trial as possible, in
the light of all available material, and that there is no reason
why the formal arraignment should await that occasion, but it is
a master for the Cou rt.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I shall order the defendants to be
arraigned on Counts 1,2 and 3 which there can be, subject to an
abuse, there can be no other wider attack on the Counts. Would
you arraign the defendants on Counts 1,2 and 3.

THE CLERK: David Godfrey Duckenfield and Bernard Dean Murray,
you charged on this indictment, containing five counts.
On Count 1 you are both charge with manslaughter, and the
particulars of the offence are that on the 15th of April 198 9
you unlawfully killed John Alfred Anderson by gross negligence,
namely, by failing to prevent and relieve a crush in 10.4 of the
west terraces at Hillsborough football ground, Sheffield,
between 2:30pm and 3:06pm.  David Duckenfield, are you guilty or
not guilty?

      DAVID DUCKENFIELD: Not guilty.
     THE CLERK: Not guilty. Bernard Murray, are you guilty or
not guilty?

     DAVTn mTCKENFIELD:     Not guilty.

     THE CLERK: Not guilty. On count 2 you are both charge with
manslaughter, and the particulars of the offence are that on the
15th of April 1989 you unlawfully killed James Gary Aspinall by
gross negligence, namely, by failing to prevent and relieve a
crush in 10.3 of the west terraces at Hillsborough football
ground, Sheffield, between 2:30pm and 3:06pm.  David
Duckenfield, are you guilty or not guilty?

     DAVID DUCKENFIELD:      Not guilty.

THE CLERK: Not guilty. Bernard Murray, are you guilty or not
guilty?

     BERNARD MURRAY:      Not guilty.

     THE CLERK: Not guilty. On Count 3 you are both charged with
misconduct in public office, and the particulars of the offence,
that on the 15th of April 198 9 you wilfully neglected as senior
officers of the South Yorkshire Police Force to ensure the
safety of spectators entering the Hillsborough football ground,
Sheffield, by failing to take steps to prevent and relieve a
crush in pens three and four of the west terraces of the ground.
David Duckenfield, are you guilty or not guilty?

     DAVID DUCKENFIELD: Not guilty.

THE CLERK: Not guilty. Bernard Murray, are you guilty or not
guilty?

     BERNARD MURRAY:      Not guilty.

     THE CLERK: Not guilty.

           MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones, doesn't the statement
of offence usually identify contrary to common law or something
like that?

     MR. JONES: My Lord, I always thought was unnecessary,
myself, but if your Lordship thinks it ought to be added, it can
be, certainly. I think the precedence, as I recall, my Lord, the
rules do not require that .

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well* is any technical point going to
be taken absence of the words, contrary to common Law?

     MR. CLEGG: Not by me.

      MR. HARRISON: Nor me.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:    In which case you do not have to.

      MR. JONES: Thank you.
     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Can I deal with the Counts 4 and 5? How
long do you anticipate, Mr. Clegg, before you will be in
position to know whether there will be a live argument on Counts
4 and 5?

      MR. CLEGG: Th?t depends on the Attorney. For reasons that
evu'j :r.9 is aware of, on thi? jide at any rate, the Attorney
himself caimot consider the question of a nolle because he did
advise the Director in relation to the prosecution of
Duckenfield, a matter of public record. It will depend upon the
availability therefore of the solicitor. We would hope to write
to the solicitor, certainly within three weeks of today. It then
depends his workload, and of course he may wish to consult those
who made the original decision to discontinue the proceedings,
who was not in fact the Director because he too is unable to
advise in this case.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well,   I have four days free on December
the twentieth.

     MR. CLEGG: All will be resolved long before then.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So, should you not succeed in your
submissions to him, this matter of Count 4 and 5 will then be^
looked at on December the 20th.

     MR. CLEGG. That would be a convenient date for me.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Suit you, Mr. Jones?

     MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So that is that decision made. Insofar
as abuse of process is concerned, you said that you wanted it
very close to the trial.

     MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I have some reservation about that,
simply because defendants are entitled to know whether they are
going to be tried or n o t .

     MR. JONES: Yes.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The matter has been examined, I read
Mr. Cadby's decision on the matter, and for my part I would wish
to hear this, any abuse of process application on December the
20th.

     MR. JONES: My Lord, if I may so, I have no objection, in
principle, to that course. My Lord, the reason why I suggested
later was particularly in the light of arguments there had been
about publicity, and your Lordship will, I know, will be very
familiar with all those cases, talking about fate factors and so
on, but my Lord, for my part, if it is convenient to your
Lordship then, so be it.
     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: In any event, at that time, one can
anticipate that there will be no publicity between then and the
date of the trial, should any application fail, because to do so
would be a contempt of court.

     MR. JONES: Can   I just be build in this reservation, my
Lord, I understand that although a note was sent to the court on
Tussday? And I know that was later than it should be, for
reasons I will explain. My Lord, I do not know whether your
Lordship has appreciated the extent of the paperwork to which we
seek access.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes,   I appreciate that.

     MR. JONES: Now, my Lord, when and in what form those
documents are disclosed and made available is a matter of
controversy, and I only mention this reservation to your
Lordship, that if there is an enormous amount of documentation
and if we are still looking at it at Christmas, it is possible
that the outstanding examination still to be done might justify
an application by any party for the abuse of process application
to be postponed. I hope not. We earnestly hope that this
question of disclosure of documents is going to be resolved very
quickly, but I just   sound that note of warning.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Clegg, Mr. Harrison, December the
20th for those arguments, does it cause you professional
difficulties?

     MR. HARRISON:   It does for me, my   Lord,   I am afraid,     yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: When do they cease?

     MR. HARRISON: They do not, my Lord, that is the difficulty,
and I think that we are all in a certain problem. We had a view
at the Bar that if your Lordship were able to accommodate us,
that we could actually deal with this matter during the very,
very first week of January. In the week before term strictly
begins.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: During the vacation, you mean?

     MR. HARRISON:   Yes.

     MR. CLEGG: It did not sound quite so bad the        way Mr.
Harrison first put it.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: He put it very smoothly. So what date
would that be?

     MR. HARRISON: The 4th of January.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Is that because the week following you
 are already...?

      MR. HARRISON: I think we are all in difficulties, my Lord,
 and that was why at the Bar we came up with that suggestion.
      MR. CLEGG: Could I bring up something that literally-
occurred to me as Mr. Harrison has been addressing you? The
application in relation to the two counts, if it needs to be
made, could be made before Christmas, on the 20th and Mr. Jones
has alerted me, in his skeleton, to a possible argument on
admissibility that would only affect Duckenfield, and that also
could be dealt with - I know he is anxious for that to be dealt
with.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: This is what Mr. Duckenfield is said to
have said to what? To...?

     M R . C L E G G : Taylor.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Taylor.

     MR. CLEGG: So it is a possibility that we could use both
periods. I think it would be quite tight to deal with everything
on the 2 0th.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Sounds like it.

     MR. CLEGG: Even knowing my Lord's sitting hours.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: We will wait for the listing officer to
make sure - now, this ought to be heard here, I think. Although
two of you come from London, I think it is important that those
involved in this case hear this argument. It should be heard
here, I think.

     MR. CLEGG: Certainly. I am not opposing an application to
hear the preliminary argument   here. For different    reasons....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I mean, so often one     can move itto
London, but I think it would be inappropriate in this case.

     MR. CLEGG: So be i t . I am not going to complain.

     MR. JONES: My Lord, if it is just a question of Mr. Clegg's
argument on the 20th, then, my Lord, if there was any question
of a vote, I would be arguing that it could be, if it was
convenient to your Lordship.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, that will be here because I am
here. 4th of January then.

     MR. CLEGG: Yes, my Lord,      thank you.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes,   well, that will   be the date of the
substantive hearing on the abuse, on that day, lasting that
week.

     MR. CLEGG: Does my Lord want to hold the 20th for...?

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, I hold the 20th for two.days, for
odds and ends, two of which we have already mentioned. I would
like to do a timetable now for 4th of January hearing because I
think that is an important timetable. The burden of proof is on
            you, Mr. Clegg, Mr. Harrison. You to go first. I want any
            evidence upon which you propose to rely and skeleton arguments
            in by about the 1st of December? Mr. Jones?

                    M R . JnN E S : Yes, we are happy with that.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, perhaps a bit earlier,         if you are
             going to call evidence.

                  MR.     CLEGG: Well, if we are going to call evidence, which I
   B         think is     unlikely, we will give notice of that by an earlier
             date.

                    MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER:   I want the statements too.

                    MR.   CLEGG: Of course, yes.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, why don't we -just set a date of
             the 19th of November for statements of any witnesses who vou
             propose to either call or seek their admission bv some other
             route and your skeleton arguments by the 19th of November? With
             liberty to apply, i f ....

                  MR. CLEGG: I would ask for a little longer than the 19th
             because I a m . ..
   D                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: 26th?

                    MR. CLEGG: Yes.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I mean, if you said to me now, you are
             not calling in any evidence, then I would put it to the
             beginning of December, but....
   E
                   MR. CLEGG: I think it highly unlikely that I will be
              calling any.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:      I will give you two dates. It will be

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The third?

                     MR. CLEGG: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: 3rd of December, _if you are not calling,
              any evidence. Mr. Jones, are you content with those dates?

                   MR. JONES: My Lord, might I have an extra period, please,
              after the Defence....

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I have not given you it yet. I have not
               said that yet. You are content with date?

                     MR. JONES: I am, yes,    I an content with that, yes.

               MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER: Now, how long do you want for your
          reply tothat skeleton argument and the service of    any evidence
          from which you propose to rely.

               MR. JONES: My Lord, if it was Friday the 3rd, if I could
          have until then Monday the 13th, I would be grateful.

               H R . JUSTICE HOOPER: Well,   1 will give you a little longer
          than that. 17th of December.

 B               MR. JONES: Thank you.

               MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So it is just, initially, in effect,
          ready for our hearing on the 20th, but it will not affect that
          hearing. Yes. Now, who is going to make - can one of the juniors
          make a record of all these and type it out?

               MR.     ISAACS: That is being dealt with, my Lord, as you
          speak.

               MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And you will draw the order up, get
          everyone to agree it and then it can be distributed to everyone?

                 MR. ISAACS: Yes.

               MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Do we need any timetabling for the 20th
 D        of December? All I will simply say on that, that if any of the
          issues to be raised on the_20th of December skeleton arguments,
          to be in - you will be going first would be going first, would
          you not? If you were not succeed on a n o l l e . So two weeks
          before.

                 MR. CLEGG: Yes.
 E
                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And Mr. Jones,    five days before that
           hearing.

                 MR. JONES: Yes.

                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Perhaps that could be converted into
           dates by Mr. Isaacs.

                 MR. ISAACS: Was that five days, my Lord?

                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Five days. Well,    five days before the
           hearing.

                 MR. ISAACS: Yes.

                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am fairly flexible. Issues of
           admissibility, I want a skeleton argument, but I leave it to you
           both to resolve that at, a suitable timetable.

                 MR. CLEGG: Yes, we will keep to the same dates.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, right. Having set the timetable of
            the 6th of June for the trial, I want to deal with one or two
  H         matters relating to that. I appreciate things are in a state of

                                             -10-

flux and we will be dealing with some of those matters later,
but is anyone going to be calling any expert evidence, as
presently advised?

     MR. CLEGG: We want to know if the Crown were going to call
any before we answer that question.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones?

     MR. JONES: At present the intention is no, but we have not
ruled it out, no.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I should put you on a tight timetable
for any expert evidence, with liberty to apply to come back and
say something new has arisen, but essentially, that decision
must be made quickly.

     MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, I appreciate that. Again, the
Chief Constable has indicated the he is prepared to disclose any
expert reports in his possession, and that would be a critical
matter in our making decisions upon this point. My Lord, he
indicated that, I think two weeks ago, that he was prepared to
disclose any such expert reports in addition to the one they
have already disclosed to us in 1997 and the obtaining of that
is critical to a decision as to how we proceed in the matter of
getting expert evidence, if we do at all.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I am minded to put a date down
with liberty to come back to me, rather than the more fluid way
of letting it all float away, and I think the Prosecution are to
serve any expert evidence upon which they propose to rely . I
would have thought somewhere mid-November.

     MR. JONES: Very well.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: November the 19th.because that gives
you quite a lot of time still, doesn't it?

     MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And then when we, on December the 20th
we can see whether any order is necessary for the Defence, but
we do not need to do that at this stage. So Prosecution to
disclose any expert report upon which they propose to rely by
Friday November the 19th, liberty to apply. That applies to all
of these orders. Where do you want to go  next, Mr. Jones?

      MR. JONES: My Lord, the substantial   matter we raise
 concerns disclosure of documents.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: What about the admissions   point?
 Because I think we could deal with t h a t .

      MR. JONES: Certainly, we can deal with that, yes. Can I
 indicate what our concerns are upon the submissions matter? My
 learned friends before the committal proceedings made a number
 of admissions which I believe have been transmitted to the court
 by the Magistrate's Court.
        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:    If that is the case,   I have not seen
them.

        MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, there are several pages of them.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:      I do not need to read them for these
purposes'?

        MR. JONES: No.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No. That is what happened, and I do not
have a copy of Archbold, I am afraid.

     MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, the admissions that were made
were all of a background of technical character, they totalled
96.

        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

     MR. JONES: And our concern, my Lord, is this.  A lot of
those admissions deal with the authenticity of documents, which
is important because we have obtained by witness summons and
voluntarily from the Director of Public Prosecution, large
numbers of plans, photographs, video tape equipment and so on.
All of which we want to use in the course of the trial. Now, my
Lord, most of that material has been used without objection, at
the previous Inquest in the case, in Lord Justice Taylor's
inquiry, without objection from any party, and what we are most
anxious about is that we do not have to spend time getting
formal witness statements, producing those matters. We do not
want to spend time getting formal admissions on of the causes of
death when the pathological evidence has been served and never
been disputed before, and we do not....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: First of all, you raise a point         under
the67 Act, are you persisting  in that point?

     MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, as a technical matter, it appears
to us, your Lordship has to do it but, my Lord, there  is no
substance in the matter. My Lord, if my learned friends say, in
our submission, for good reason, that they are not prepared to
make those admissions for the future, then we have got to set
about incurring time in proving it.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Let us divide the statements, at this
 stage. The first stage is, a matter of law, are they permitted
 to withdraw their admissions....

         MR. JONES: They are, yes, they are.

         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:    ...with my leave?

         MR. JONES: Yes.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Do you oppose me granting that leave,
 given the history of the matter which I have seen in the
 correspondence, even allowing for the fact that there may be
            disagreements between you all?

                 MR. JONES: My Lord, we do not object, as a matter of law,
            no, but we do invite the Court to ask the defendants whether
            they seric” cly do maintain the position that appears at the
            present to be implicit in my learned friend Mr. Harrison's
            argument, if not Mr. Clegg's, in saying that they do not propose
            to make any admissions for the time being.

                  MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, first of all, then,   to the extent
   B         to which   I have to grant leave, I grant leave....

                    MR. JONES: Yes.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: ....for them to withdraw the
             admissions. Now we turn to stage I stage two. What do we now do
             about the situation we are in?

                   MR. JONES: My Lord, we wrote on the 22nd of July to
             solicitors for both parties, asking whether they would be
             prepared to make the same admissions again and if not, to be in
             a position to indicate today, why. My Lord, I hope I have
             sufficiently put forward the reasons to the Court to indicate
             why we are concerned about the matter. My Lord, surely, in our
             submission, we are not to be expected to have to get witness
             statements from forensic pathologists, producing documents which
   D
             they produced nine or ten years before, which have never been
             disputed to be authentic. We are very concerned that we do not
             have to get statements from shorthand writers, producing
             evidence of the defendants given to Lord Taylor and to the
             Inquest, and we are also concerned that we do not have
             unnecessarily to have to get evidence formally producing video
             tapes plans and the other documentary evidence which was before
    E        the Magistrates' Court, and I would invite my learned friends to
             indicate whether they have any substantial objections to making
             those admissions, which they made before a committal. If they
             have to indicate what they are so that at least we know where we
             are for preparation of a trial. My Lord, certainly, my learned
              friend, Mr. Clegg, has indicated he is not takin any technical
             points, but I have assumed from my learned friend, Mr.
             Harrison's argument, that he does not propose to offer any
              assistance in this matter at all, for the time being.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, let me just look at the
              admissions. Which volume would they be in, in here?

                      MR. JONES: My Lord, they were sent separately. I have them
              separately. My Lord, it is a document of about ten pages and I
              know that they were put into the box, I think by Mr. Cadbury,
              personally, on the last day of the committal in July. My Lord,
              we have got a spare copy. Can I hand those in? My Lord, your
              Lordship will see that two and three are simply background about
              t h e ....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, can I just try and read them to
              myself?
    H
                     MR. JONES: Certainly.

                                              -13-
J. L Harpham Ltd.
     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You now invite me to invite Mr. Clegg
and Mr. Harrison to tell me the position they take on this?

       MR. JONES: My Lord, yes, and they have - it is permitted to
say this - my Lord, most of the documents where there are
f igiires and capacities, are all drawn from the Taylor enquiry,
and tne compilation video is prepared by the West Midlands
Police under the auspices of the Treasury Solicitor, and all
those matters have always been accepted as uncontroversial at
all previous Inquiries.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes. Mr. Jones, when I asked the
questions of Mr. Clegg and Mr. Harrison, it is right to say that
if they were prepared to make an admission, it would not follow,
of course, it is from their own knowledge, that is what this....

     MR. JONES: Exactly.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And secondly, it would not prevent them
subsequently saying that these matters are inadmissible as being
irrelevant or some other reason, should not be introduced into
evidence.

     MR. JONES: I absolutely agree, my Lord, yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Against•that background, those two
things, Mr. Clegg, are you in a position or will you be in a
position, shortly, to be able to answer the question, whether
you are prepared to make these admissions?

     MR. CLEGG: Yes, I can do so now, in general form, n o t _
making any formal admission, but it would be put into writing in
due course. So far as, for example, the pathological evidence is
concerned, admissions will be made. So far as shorthand writers
are concerned, admissions will be made. So far as photographers,
those that produce the photographs, put them into the albums and
produce the indexes, admissions will be made. So far as plans
are concerned, likewise. So far as video footage is concerned,
well, we have no desire to see cameramen or the person who
produces the film give evidence, admissions will be made. All
that is in a spirit, I hope, co-operation and to assist, and it
has never been our intention to require any of that sort of
evidence to be called.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: How long do you want got this process?

      MR. CLEGG: A week, I would have thought. If anybody could
 provide with a copy of what I signed in the lower court, which I
 never took the precaution of taking at the time, I never have
 been able to get hold of since, maybe less, but can I make it
 quite clear what we are not agreeing to because it may at first
 glance to be surprising. Evidence, which you can see in front of
 you, setting out, for example, paragraphs four on to eighteen,
 and....
         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Let us take four. Why can you not admit
 four?
^*




                       MR. CLEGG: They are to be looked at cumulatively. Of
                  course, that is a fact that is not in dispute, but the effect of
                  making these to admissions in total is that there will be no
                  witness called whom we can cross-examine about other matters
                  that we wish to place before the Jury. So, if you read, for
                  example, the whole of these admissions from four down to and
                  including, well, really down to 48. None of that will be
                  actually be challenged and we do not require, necessarily, each
                  and every part of it to be proved, but we want to have a witness
        B         whom we are able cross-examine about why changes were made to
                  the ground, what happened as a consequence to it, the way in
                  which it was done and likewise, the effect of these is that, of
                  course it assists the Prosecution, one might say it assists the
                  Court, but it denies the defendants the opportunity to
                  cross-examining relevant witnesses about matters that, in our
                  submission, we should have the opportunity to do and
                  therefore...

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, in number four, for example, could
                  presumably be proved by - it is not a very good example.

                         MR. CLEGG: That is not a very good example.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: But who would you want the Prosecution
                  to call as a quid pro quo for making the admissions.
        D
                       MR. CLEGG: But my instincts are not to make the admissions,
                  but I am prepared to suggest who they could call to tender for
                  cross-examination. For example, the people that spring to mind
                  who might fit the bill would be the person in charge of the
                  ground, who is responsible for maintaining it, may be the....

         E              MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The appropriate official from the
                   ground.

                        MR. CLEGG: The appropriate official from the ground, to
                   talk about the changes, why they were made and in what
                   circumstances.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So they would just be tendered for
                   cross-examination?

                        MR. CLEGG:   Well, if that was to be guaranteed and we could
                   see a statement   from such a person.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, what would the statement be? All
                   you want to do is cross-examine.

                         MR. CLEGG: Yes, I want to know that he is able speak as to
                    these events. I do not want somebody being put up who when I
                    come to ask the first question had only started work in the last
                    five years and know nothing about any of this at all.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, well, that means that the person
                    has to be properly identified.
         H
                          MR. CLEGG: Yes.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Someone who was at Hillsborough
                  Stadium, working then as senior management capacity in 1985.

                       MR. CLEGG: Yes, but I would anticipate Mr. Jones being able
                  to lead the witness over these relatively short matters, and to
                  what extent it is necessary for him to do so, but at the moment,
                  I am noL minded to make admissions in relation to the ground
                  itself. I want to have the opportunity to cross-examining
                  whoever he chooses to call, and this is not only an adversarial
         B        system the we are in, but very much an adversarial trial, I
                  suspect, and I wish to cross-examine whoever it is he chooses to
                  call to prove what he wants to prove in these paragraphs, and I
                  have done something that I am not required to do by law, is to
                  indicate why, and I could have said, I hope with respect, my
                  Lord, I am not going to tell you why I want someone called, but
                  I am just not going to make the admissions, but I hope in the
                  spirit of co-operation, I have given you the thrust of why it is
                  not a desire just to be difficult for the sake of it, it is
                  because we have relevant questions that we want to put to
                  witnesses, and I know that if we make these admissions, we will
                  not have that opportunity.
                       Likewise, the policing arrangements. If we make those
                  admissions, there will not be people called whom we can
                  cross-examine about the policing arrangements. So that is why I
                  will not be making admissions, with respect, however much I am
         D
                  encouraged to, in relation to those aspects of the case. Of
                  course, if Mr. Jones is in genuine difficulty about one aspect
                  of it and says, look I am calling somebody from the ground and
                  he cannot say what the number of people were that were allocated
                  tickets then, them I will make that admission. So I go....

                        MR. JUSTICE   HOOPER: But you could sit down with Mr. Jones
         E         and identify the   kind of person who might not be able to answer
                   some of the points that are made here, but could deal with it
                   very generally.

                         MR. CLEGG: That is right.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You want a higher management person,
                   someone who is making the decision, the decisions that are
                   referred to h e r e .

                         MR. CLEGG: Yes, and   likewise, with the policing.

                         MR. JUSTICE   HOOPER: With the policing?

                         MR. CLEGG: Yes.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You would want a senior police officer?

                         MR. CLEGG: Yes.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: But I cannot see why that senior police
                    officer cannot just simply be tendered, if Mr. Jones agrees to
                    call X.
         H
                         MR. CLEGG: I can understand why my Lord says that, but I am

             afraid to say if it appears I am being difficult, then that
             appearance would have to subsist. I am not making the
             admissions. If when the witness is called, there is one part of
             these admissions he can not speak to, then my current
             inclination would be to make the admission then, that the
             witness can be called and if necessary, can put in a written
             document containing these facts, but I want the - I am not going
             admission until the witness is sworn - because sometimes in
             cases like this, we are told witnesses are going to be called
             and then, quite properly, views can change and one decides....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: If we are going to go down this route,
             and I have not heard from Mr. Jones yet, it would be obviously
             conditional on this happening. I mean, that would be - there
             would not be any question of it not then happening.

                  MR. CLEGG: Well, I would want to know who the witness is,
             but my current instincts I think are fairly firm, that insofar
             as those aspects are concerned, the ground and the policing, I
             want a senior person called that I can cross-examine and then
             the evidence can be placed before the Jury, after he is sworn,
             in a way that is most convenient for the Jury, and that may well
             be then, it can be put into written form. A statement is
             taken....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, take 27, there was no access for
              spectators from the north side of the ground. What do you want
              Mr. Jones to do about that?

                   MR. CLEGG: Well, of course, when looks at them
              individually, it is easy to, if you like, to pluck out examples
              that can not sensibly be the subject of any possible objection,
              and that is a classic....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, why therefore can you not say,
              provided you call Mr. X, Chief Superintendent Y, then I can see
              no reason why we will not make these admissions?

                   MR. CLEGG: Well, I do not think there is much between us,
              and I do not want to be difficult. What I am saying is, if that
              person is called, I will make that admission, when he is called.

              MR JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, but he does not need to take a huge
              statement from him.

                   MR. CLEGG: I do not want a huge statement to be taken.  I
              want a statement that merely identifies him, but after all this
              is all on disc. They have only got to say, that "I am the Chief
              Executive, I have read these admissions, 1 to 48 and confirm
              they are all true". That is a perfectly simple, short statement,
              and then....

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And he can do that from hearsay
               knowledge?

                    MR. CLEGG: Yes. I mean, I do not think I am going to taking
               any technical hearsay points on this. Obviously, I do not want
               somebody being tendered who was not there in 1989.

            MR JUSTICE HOOPER: But that is the agreement that would have to
            be reached, that Mr. Jones has to call X, but X's statement may
            simply be, I have looked at these and they are all true,
            although as far as number 42 is concerned, I do that from my
            knowledge of the history of the stadium.

                  MR. CLEGG: If that is done, then at that time, I would
             probably indicate that when the witness is called, these
             admissions will be made and he can be called and say, you are
   B         whoever you are, and we can give the Jury a list of the points
             but at the moment, that is where I am sticking.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: That is your position. How many
             witnesses would fit - meet your requirements - approximately?

                  MR. CLEGG: I would have thought, perhaps three. Somebody
             senior who was in a senior position at the club itself.

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: At the?

                      MR. CLEGG: At the club.

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                  MR. CLEGG: And a senior police officer, involved in the
   D         planning of the policing operation and probably a senior police
             officer involved in the policing of the outside of the ground.
             Maybe a senior police officer involved in the policing of the
             inside on the concourse or on the match, but that is the sort
             of . . . .
                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So, with your extensive knowledge of
    E         the case or your clients extensive knowledge over many years,
              You could presumably identify some people.

                   MR. CLEGG: Oh, yes, but Mr. Jones does not need          me to
              identify those witnesses, he knows them.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Now, Mr. Harrison, do you adopt the
              same position or...?

                   MR. HARRISON: Yes, I do, my Lord. I have tried to summarise
              my position on this issue of admission, shortly, at paragraphs
              11 to 13 of my note to your Lordship.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, but twelve is - essentially, you
              are agreeing with what Mr. Clegg is saying?
    G                     MR. HARRISON: Yes.

                          MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Subject to, perhaps,   some fine tuning.

                    MR. HARRISON: There is this about it, that at the moment, I
               am obviously troubled by the fact that M r . Jones makes   no bones
               about it.  He his not yet in a position to indicate     to the Court
    H          or to the Defence, who he intends to call. That we regard as a
               very important issue, and we have taken the view that it is not,

            on the face of it, responsible to be making admissions,
            piecemeal, not knowing how the Crown intends to put its case
            against the defendants. Therefore, we have taken the view that
            the usual approach should be adopted, the Crown indicates what
            issues and evidence it intends to adduce, that we will consider
            that. We will makes all our admissions, at that stage. I do not
            know how long Mr. Jones is asking the Court to give him, gross,
            in terms of time, before he indicates, definitively, who he
            proposes to call, but I would respectfully submit that one way
            to unlock this problem is for the Court to put a time limit on
    B       that so that, shall we say, by November, we know categorically,
            who the Crown intends to call, and just as importantly, from our
            point of view, whom they intend not to call because there is
            clearly an issue which I averted to in paragraph six. Some
            witnesses who are clearly relevant and material to the issues of
            the trial and which we would submit on the Defence side, the
            Prosecutor would normally regard it as his duty to call, are not
            being called.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So you need the list of who is not
             being called.

                    MR. HARRISON: As well.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, I can see that, but going to, for
             example, something like the - Mr. Clegg has taken the attitude
   D         on the pathological evidence, for example - that he does not
             require the Prosecution to find the pathologists who conducted
             the postmortems.

                    MR.   CLEGG: I am sure I shall be following him on that.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So could you, if I said, start with at
    E         least seven days to indicate which of these you are prepared to
              admit so as to save considerable funds, for example, and going
              to look for evidence as from pathologists.

                    MR. HARRISON: Yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: There is no problem with that?

                    MR. HARRISON: No.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Seven days for that?

                   MR. HARRISON: This trial is ten months away, my Lord, and I
              know that Mr. Jones and those behind him are not going to go
              immediately from this court this afternoon to start obtaining
              pathologists statements, I hope to try a n d . ...
    G
                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Seven days then, for that. So the first
               thing, Mr. Jones, as I have ordered, is that within seven days,
               they are to indicate which they do admi t.

                    MR. JONES: Yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Stage one. Stage two; what do you say
    H          about Mr. Clegg's principal submission, that they ought not to -

          they need someone to cross-examine about these matters.

               MR. uONES: My Lord, the first thing I would say is, I would
          like to have notice of this, my Lord, I have not, but I can give
          my Lordship my initial reaction. My Lord, I can say, positively,
          that there are no circumstances at all in which the Prosecution
          will be proposing call any of the senior officers from South
          Yorkshire Police who were on duty at the Hillsborough ground
          that day and who were concerned into the enquiry of these
          events, the next six weeks. We do not believe any of them are
 B        witnesses of truth. My Lord, as far as the Sheffield Wednesday
          Football Club is concerned, it is certainly a matter which I am
          certainly prepared to consider with those instructing me, and if
          there is some way we can do it and call some witness who can
          give some useful information or even further information, about
          the changes in the ground, then we would certainly be prepared
          to look at that.

               MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, now, let us deal with the police
          side of it. You are not prepared to call any police officers.
          That means Mr. Clegg is not prepared to make any admissions
          about the policing arrangements that day. As I understand it,
          apart from the threat of a wasted costs order, I have no other
          sanction, do I?

                MR. JONES: My Lord, no. The other option of course is to
 D         invite your Lordship to admit documents under Section 24 of the
           Criminal Justice Act 1988 which are admissible, unless to be
           excluded under Section 25, or to invoke the public record
           doctrine, by which a report such as Lord Taylor are public
           records for the purposes of proving the facts contained in them.
           Those are matters which we would want to look at, but my Lord,
           it may well be that things such the capacity of the terraces are
 E         not going to be critical to the case, I do not know. We would
           have look at it or consider it.

                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Do you agree with my proposition,
           subject to a wasted costs order, I have no other sanction under
           the law, as it now stands, to force Mr. Clegg to make
           admissions?

                MR. JONES: I respectfully agree, my Lord, yes. Under this
           legislation, that is correct, but my Lord, it does not matter,
           however, because of the existence of Section 24 or the public
           record doctrine, we would say.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, in which case, first of all, they
            have got seven days to come back to you.
  G              MR. JONES: Yes.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Then you are going to have to decide
            which you wish to prove by some other route and indicate what
            the argument i s .

                 MR. JONES: Yes.
  H
                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And that would be, I should have

                                          -20-

thought, a fruitful area for debate, on the 20th of December.

     MR. JONES: 23rd or 4th,   I should think.

     MR. -Tn.QTICE HOOPER: Yes, 23rd or 4th of January, anyway,
somewhere at that period. I think therefore you ought to be
under a timetable of, shall we say - and I am suggesting dates
now - four weeks, to come back to them as to whether or not you
propose to, well, we can make it a bit longer than that because
you have got a lot of work to do. Somewhere sort of mid-October?

MR JONES: Certainly, yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: 22nd of October. You are to come back
and tell the defence how you propose to prove these matters,
those that insist upon trying to prove.

     MR. JONES: Certainly.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And identifying the section or
identifying a witness who is going to give the evidence.

     MR. JONES: Certainly, my Lord, yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Bearing in mind that Mr. Clegg has
accepted that he may not object if someone is giving - senior
management is giving evidence, generally, saying, well the
records show that this work was done then.

     MR. JONES: My Lord, I know that the South Yorkshire Police
have very good relations with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
have had since 1989. My Lord, there is absolutely no reason of
course why the Defence can not all any of these witnesses
themselves.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You can make the point, but it does not
help me to decide the issues. So that is the 22nd of - let us
get this right - seven days for the Defence to indicate which
admissions they are now prepared to make and by the 22nd of
October, Prosecution tQ^indicate which of the other matters they
wish to prove and how they propose to go abput it.

     MR. CLEGG: In the spirit of co-operation, could I invite my
friend to consider calling Superintendent Mold, who was not one
of the officers who was at the ground on the fateful day, but
was in charge of writing the plan, the police plan, that he
seeks to produce, presumably under one of his various umbrellas
that he has just aired, and had previous experience of the
ground, when there is no complaint being made, as I understand
it, as to the police conduct.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, Mr. Jones, you can obviously
 consider that.

      MR. JONES: Well, I can tell you the answer is, no, my Lord,
 we do not propose to call Superintendent Mold, in any
 circumstances.
     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am not going to get involved at this
stage because at some later stage there may an application made
to me to call the witness.

    MR. JONES: Certainly.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Perhaps later, much later.

     MR. HARRISON: My Lord, does the date of the 22nd of October
extend also to the Crown's deadline for indicating precisely
which witnesses they will and will not call?

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I want to move on to that next,
yes. Now, can we move on to the next stage, which is really - so
I want to get admissions slightly out of the way. When are going
to complete the service of the statements upon which you propose
to rely? Now, I appreciate it is always going to be subject to a
proviso that your examination of any documents you are going to
see, presently with the South Yorkshire Police, may obviously
affect it, but nonetheless, I have to put down a timetable.

     MR. JONES: Yes, my Lord, it does depend and that very much.
Could I just indicate to your Lordship some of the areas of
problems are? My Lord, we do have at the moment, witness
statements from a large number of supporters, my guess is
something like 60 or 70 spectator witnesses who were at the
ground. Almost all of those were disclosed by the Home Office in
1997 and 1998. The greater proportion of those have never been
seen before by the Hillsborough Family Support Group. My Lord,
we know that the service of those statements was accidental in
this sense, that they came from what were known as body files
and they are the statements of spectators who could give
evidence about individual victims of the disaster.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am sorry to cut you short. I know
there are extreme difficulties, but I want you to give me a date
by which, always with liberty to apply, by which you are able to
serve on the Defence, the statements upon which, at this stage,
you are proposing to rely. It may be there will be further
evidence later on, and we will have to deal with that as it
comes along, but, at this stage, by what date?

     MR. JONES: My Lord, I could do that within three weeks, but
it is going depend, thereafter, upon what we see in the
remaining statements disclosed, and it could be, in the light of
that, that we would seek to replace some of the witnesses upon
whom we had indicated we were going rely, by others, but I
could, my Lord, the material we have got at present, I mean, I
could do it easily within three weeks, but it is subject to that
very considerable reservation that things are going to change.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, give me a date by which you say
 you will be in a position to tell the Defence what evidence you
 propose to rely on, subject to any fine tuning afterwards?

      MR. JONES: My Lord, the end of September, we could do that,
 but the fine tuning is likely to be a very complex exercise.
              MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, well, the end of September seems to
         be too early. I want to give you a more realistic timetable. We
         have now set the trial date, what about the end of November?

                 MR. JONES: Certainly, yes.

               MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: By the end of November, you must          have
          served on the Defence the evidence upon which you propose          to
          rely. Subject always of course to an application that you          are
          entitled to call this or that because you have discovered          it.

               MR. JONES: Yes, certainly, my Lord.       I am certainly prepared
          to do t h a t .

               MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And we will bear in mind when we turn
          and look at your arguments with the Chief Constable.

                 MR. JONES: Certainly.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: End of November?

                 MR. HARRISON: Thank you my Lord?

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Clegg?

                 MR. CLEGG: Yes
 D
               MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I will have to word this carefully. By
          the 30th of N o v e m b e r J : h e Prosecution is to serve _on the Defence
          all of the witness statementg^and exhibits, which they then^
          propose to rely upon for the^r ial . Is that wording, Mr.
          Harrison, sufficiently tight?

 E               MR. HARRISON: My Lord, yes,    I think so.

                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: By then you have got to say this what
           we now propose to do at the trial. It may be of course, after
           you come back and say, "Well, we want to fine tune this", but
           that is where the bulk of the work must be in by.

                MR. JONES: And of course the advantage of that, my Lord, is
           it fits in quite well with the abuse of process timetable.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, it does, yes. Where are we going
           next?

                MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, I think those are the matters
           which I wish to raise, subject to the question of access to
           papers in South Yorkshire Police.
  G
                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Have you got a P.D.H. form I can slip
            through? I am not asking you to fill one in, it is more just a
            blank, just to remind you if there is anything - it is just a
            bank one, to see if there is anything else I ought to be
            considering. Now, Mr. Jones, I normally, in cases of any
            complexity, require the Prosecution to do even more substantial

             anything more than you have already done?

                    MR.   JONES: I do not believe so, my Lord,   no.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: When you serve this by the end of
             November, will that be the bundle that we will all be using at
             the trial and we will have pagination, starting at 1 and ending
             at the last page? .

                    MR.   JONES: It sound as if it will be, my   Lord, yes.
    B
                    MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER: Also legible?

                   MR. JONES: Yes. My Lord, I think we have had problems with
              that in the past, but I think we have got by committal,
              sufficiently legible documents, yes.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Is the pagination now in use going to
             be used on or are you going to, in effect, start with a
             fresh...?

                   MR. JONES: No, I would hope that the documents we produced
              for committal are the basic core documents, plans, matters of
              that kind. There are a few in the category where my learned
              friend wants to start bargaining with us, but for the most part,
              I am sure that they are the core documents for the trial.
    D
                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You will maintain that pagination,     to
              help every one who has already worked on it?

                    MR. JONES: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Therefore, it means if a witnesses
    E         makes a second statement, please put that witness as 1.11 ABC,
              do not tuck it right at the end.

                    MR. JONES: Very well.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Insofar as you are able to do so.
              Anything more on pagination, so that we all work - Can we deal
              with the interviews? So far as you concerned, are there issues
              on interviews and all the similar, you know?

                    MR. HARRISON: Yes, I think Mr. Clegg and I are...

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Then as far as you are concerned then,
              Mr. Harrison, as far you are concerned, your client, is there
              any issue as to what the admissibility of anything that he may
              have said to Taylor o r . ..?
    G
                    MR. HARRISON: Yes, my Lord, there are issues which Mr.
               Clegg and I would argue about, the admissibility of what was
               said at the Inquiry, Inquest.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: What kind of ground would you be
               raising?
    H
                     MR. HARRISON: Well, so far as the Taylor Inquiry is

                                                 -24-
J. L Harpham Ltd.
concerned, certainly we would invite the Court to consider that
no appropriate warning was given to the witnesses, who were
there speaking, which might affect admissibility.

     MR. .....iTtt.
                  q t i c E HOOPER: Well, what is the best way to take this
forward from here?

     MR. HARRISON: My Lord,      I think Mr. Clegg is leading on this
issue.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Clegg, what is the next step on
this now?

     MR. CLEGG: A mouth full of skeleton. At the....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Not this one?

     MR. CLEGG: No, not that one. You can throw that away,           I
suspect. Mr. Jones wants to keep it.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I think we can hand back those
admissions so that you at least, Mr. Clegg, have a copy if no
one else does.

     MR. CLEGG: Yes. They will need to comply with the seven day
order. At the same time as some time in the November date, I
think there is one in mid-November, that you have set before.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Do you know what the Prosecution now
propose now to rely on, insofar as what you have said or said to
have said, through Lord Taylor and others.

     MR. CLEGG: In part. I mean, I know they say they want to
rely on it. They have not as yet indicated what part, but I
cannot believe that they are saying that every solitary answer
is relevant and probative to every solitary question so there
would be no filleting exercise, but....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, but have you been given - is that
right, Mr Jones? They have got everything?

      MR. JONES: Yes.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: From which, at the moment...?

      MR. JONES: Yes, I have a....

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Once you have got everything, I
 normally put it upon the Defence to start then the task of
 saying, well, only this should be called or this should not be
 called.

      MR. CLEGG: Well, there is really a two stage approach to
 it, the first is, whether any of it is admissible.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, stage one is for them to tell you
 what they wish to rely upon.
                 MR. CLEGG: Yes, well, they have done that.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: They have done that?

                 MR. CLEGG: They have done that.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So, stage two is yours.

               MR. CLEGG: Unless there is anything I do not know about, it
          is what Duckenfield said to Taylor, what Duckenfield said to the
          Coroner....

                 MR. JONES: And the statement to the....

                 MR. CLEGG: I am grateful. And the statement he made.

                 MR. JONES: To the Lord Taylor's Inquiry.

               MR. CLEGG: Right, well, there are three areas. Well, I will
          indicate and prepare a skeleton, if I wish to object to any of
          those three classes of document.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Or to any parts of them.

                 MR. CLEGG: Or to any part of them.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: What about a deadline for that?

                 MR. CLEGG: Well, certainly the November deadline.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: End of November?

                 MR. CLEGG: Yes.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones? Yes, he is content with
           that .

                MR. CLEGG: My only hesitation is, I would have no
           difficulty in dealing with, if you like, the fundamental
           questions of the civilian, but I would have thought, when we get
           to relevance, it really would be too time consuming to go
           through huge - I am sure we can agree relevance, and if that
           could be left one side.

                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well,  I am more interested inthe     broad
           position, which  you want me to rule on.

                 MR. CLEGG:And I will have skeletons    available for that,
            the appropriate   authorities by the end of November.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: By the end of November?

                  MR. CLEGG: Yes.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                 MR. CLEGG: And, likewise, any evidence we are going to call
            will be disclosed then, with statements.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: On?

                    MR. CLEGG: Admissibility.

                  MR. JONES: My Lord, there is one complication, that M r .
             Duckenfield was interviewed by the West Midlands Police in the
             summer of 1990 and under caution, and said nothing. However, Mr.
             Murray was interviewed at the same time, under caution, and did
             reply, and we are seeking to rely upon those interviews and I do
    B        not know whether my learned friend, Mr. Harrison, is objecting
             to those.

                    MR. JONES: No, not yours, no.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: This is the West Midlands interview
             where apparently your client replied - you haven't got those
             though - the Prosecution haven't got those yet?

                    MR. JONES: Yes, we have got them and they have been served.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Oh, I see, and are you going to object
             to those?

                    MR. HARRISON: I think not.
   D              MR. JONES: Well, I wonder if I can be clear, are my learned
             friends objecting to the statements made early in May and signed
             by Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray?

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, what they are going to tell you is
              by November the 30th they will tell you, which, if anything,
              they argue is inadmissible?"
    E
                    MR. JONES: Very well.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Now, has anything else...?

                    MR. CLEGG: There is one other.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Can I just finish my form? We will need
              equipment, video equipment?

                    MR. HARRISON: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Could that be noted in the court file.
              Will you need tape playback equipment.

                     MR. CLEGG: I do not think so. Possibly, Mr. Jones says.

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, for the moment, video equipment.
              What we have not got, so we have got your date for the end of
              November to serve the witnesses, what we have not given them, is
              us a date upon which they must indicate whether they wish those
              witnesses to be called in person or n o t . We ought to have that
              da t e .

we are going to be given five lever arch files or that much.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: 20th of December?

     MR. HARRISON: Perhaps that could be done at the end of the
January session?

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, the only thing about that, that
is the kind of thing that I am definitely going to need know,
for the abuse hearing, which witnesses are and are not being
called.

     MR. HARRISON: Yes, but that we shall know, that is to say,
being called by the Crown.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, the Crown are going to serve you a
list of witnesses?

     MR. HARRISON: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You have got indicate which witnesses
you require to be called in person and which can be read.

     MR. HARRISON: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And what date do you want that for?

     MR. HARRISON: Well, I would submit that could be done at
the end of the January hearing, but I submit it is not relevant
to the abuse to know which witnesses we are going to require, to
give o r a l .

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, I do not think that is right, Mr.
Harrison.

     MR. HARRISON: Very well, then we will try and do it by the
December d a t e .

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I think I would like it done by
December the 20th or the Friday before. .Perhaps we can make all^
 the deadlines, except for December the 20th, we can make them
 the Friday before, wliich is the 17th. Has Mr. Isaacs got that
'change?

      MR. ISAACS: The interesting part, my Lord, was in the first
 instance, you prepared to give the parties the opportunity to
 agree between themselves as to when the skeletons were going to
 be exchanged, but I understand the date, but I think it has
 changed now.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I think it has changed,   looks like it
 has changed now, taken over.

      MR. ISAACS: 17th of December, my Lord.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes. We will need a - assuming that the
 applications to stay do not succeed, we will need a further
 directions hearing, but we will do that at the conclusion of the
            hearing in January. Is there anything else wanted,      at this
            stage? What are the bail terms?

            MR: CLEGG: Unconditional.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No objection to that? No. Do you want
             to stay here for this next argument? If you do not want to, if
             your clients do not want to?

                  MR. CLEGG: My instincts are not to. Can I just raise one
   B         matter that I do not think have ....

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: We have got to do contempt. Two at the
             moment.

                  MR. CLEGG: Yes. There is the compilation video. My concern
             is, I do not know how representative that is, of the video
             material that was available to those, whoever they were, who
             compiled it. Now, I fully recognise that Mr. Jones and his
             solicitors did not compile that video, but we are anxious to
             ensure that we have access to the original footage, in order to
             confirm to ourselves that the compilation video is truly
             representative of what it shows because it is perfectly possible
             for it to have been created and demonstrate one particular
             matter that was of interest to the people who commissioned its
   n         compilation, and that may not be the same that we are enquiring
   1/
             into in this trial.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Who has the original footage, Mr.
              Jones?

                   MR. JONES: My Lord, the South Yorkshire Police have their
              original footage. However, copies I think are available at the
    E         Magistrates' Court and have been sent here. So there should be
              complete copies of the police videos.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Of the unedited ones?

                   MR. JONES: Of the unedited videos. Similarly, Sheffield
              Wednesday tapes were, complete copies, I am told, were at the
              Magistrates Court and available for inspection, and have been
              transmitted to this court. Outstanding are BBC tapes, which we
              have got a collection of, and I think, I know the defendants
              solicitor had the opportunity of seeing them in Liverpool, but I
              think those the only ones that are not as freely available to
              them as they are to u s .

                      MR. CLEGG: Well, I am perfectly content with copies. I
              mean,    I do not want the actual....

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, it looks like they are available.

                    MR. CLEGG: Well, in that case, really we can arrange with
               the court here, for them to be copied on to some sort of....

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   I think your asking too much.

           into the custody of a partner of those instructing me or those
           instructing Mr. Harrison, for them to remain in the custody of
           that firm of solicitors, for the purpose of copying, and to be
           returned, thereafter, to the custody of the court?

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones?

                    MR. JONES: Of course not.

   B                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: On that undertaking, that can be done.

                 MR. CLEGG: Likewise, could we invite Mr. Jones to agree to
            us taking custody of the copy of BBC tapes that he has, in the
            same way.
                 MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, we know that the copy of the BBC
            tapes, there is also a copy, South Yorkshire Police. So they
            have a copy, South Yorkshire Police, and we have got a copy. My
            Lord, South Yorkshire Police's charging and time rates a r e ---

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, we are going to come to that. I
             am just going to say this is an order, is that any video
             evidence which is now in the possession of the court may be
             released by the court upon an undertaking from a partner, that
             he/she will keep it properly and return it to the court, when
   u         asked to do so. Are you content with that?

                  MR. JONES: My Lord, similarly, Miss Addington is not a
             partner, but she is a solicitor, on the same terms.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, certainly. Mr. Isaacs, have you
             got that one?
   E              MR. HARRISON: Yes, my Lord, I have the point at paragraph
             one to four of my submission, concerning further particulars of
             the allegations in the indictment. My Lord, I would invite my
             learned friend to indicate, as soon as possible, either that he
             declines to give particulars, in which case we shall return the
             matter to your Lordship or to leave them.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, let us look at the indictment.
              Well, now, Mr. Jones, at the moment you have got the words
              "failing to prevent and relieve".

                     MR. JONES: Yes.
                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Your setting out to prove both of them?

                     MR. JONES: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Plus, you have deliberately used the
              word "and"?

                     MR. JONES: Yes.
                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So you would have to prove both sides,
    H          unless there was any amendment made in the indictment?

                 contempt matters? Who is going to speak for the Press? Who is
                 here today? Some familiar faces. What has been said today, that
                 anyone would be anxious was not reported? Putting the burden the
                 other way. What has been said today, that you would be anxious
        E        is not reported?

                       MR. CLEGG: What Mr. Jones has said   about the witnesses   he
                  is going to call and not going to call.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones, on...?

                        MR. CLEGG: On witnesses.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: What witnesses - Mr. Jones on his
                  attacks on the South Yorkshire Police.

                       MR. CLEGG: The trouble is I have not - I mean, I am clear
                  in my mind as we went through, and now I am trying to put it
                  into reverse.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You may have to go in reverse.

                         MR. CLEGG: The existence of Counts 4 and 5.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Should not be revealed.

                        MR. CLEGG: I would prefer to do it the other way round.
                   There would be no objection....

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Let us start listing. If I start to
            list, then you can make representations and discuss them amongst
            yourselves. First of all, Counts 1, 2 and 3.

                    MR. CLEGG: Yes.

                 MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You say no publicity about the proposed
            Counts 4 and 5?
                 MR. CLEGG: Yes, with the pleas tendered, the date of the
   B        trial, identity of Judge and Counsel. For my part, I do not
            think anything else ought to be reported.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Place and date of trial?

                    MR. CLEGG: Place and date of trial, yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Which will be at Leeds.

                  MR. HARRISON: Maybe bail conditions.      I think they are the
             subject - reported to Magistrates Court.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: All ready.

                    MR. CLEGG: Yes, so that would be....

   u              MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And there are some matters which have
             not been mentioned in court about which the Press are always
             concerned, namely, addresses, but they have not been mentioned,
             and if the Press wish to do it from some earlier proceedings,
             that is a matter for them.

                    MR. CLEGG: Yes.
   E
                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: We are only concerned with what has
             been said in this Court, today.

                   MR. CLEGG: Yes, and could I invite the order to remain in
              force until verdict or further order, and to include all
              proceedings in the absence of the Jury, unless otherwise
              indicated.
                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones, do you want to add to that
              list?

                      MR. JONES: No,   I do not think so, my Lord.

                   MR. CLEGG: We would also ask for the order to embrace what
              is going to happen when we are not here, in relation to the
              application, in relation to the archive, because there may well
              be things said about the police....

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                      MR. CLEGG:   ....generally.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am minded, first of all, if I outline
    H          it for you, minded to make a general order, which one always

J, L Haroham Ltd.
             makes in this kind of case, that nothing is to be reported until
             verdict or further order, of anything said in the absence of a
             Jury. A normal order, and that is subject these exceptions;
             first of all, the contents of Counts 1, 2 and 3, which you have
             not probably seen   yet, have you? But the court will   give you a
             copy to help you,   but there is    to be no publicity, in
             particular, about Counts 4 and 5 because obviously I have got to
             rule or may have to rule as to      whether those Counts are good
             Counts. Secondly,   the pleas of    not guilty to Counts 1, 2and 3
             that can be reported. The place and date of trial, the identity
    B        of Judge and Counsel, and the fact that the defendants have been
             released on bail.

                   Now, do you want to have a word amongst yourselves,
              anything else you would like to do, perhaps?

                   MEMBER OF THE PRESS: Peter Corthwell(?) on behalf of the
              media. Thank you for hearing us. I think there is just one item
              of concern to us that we would seek your view upon. That is the
              need to report upon the fact of the abuse of process hearing,
              simply as a date and a time and a place, in general.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The problem with that is that if it is
              unsuccessful, then the avid reader of your newspaper or the
              listener to your television programme will know that it has been
              unsuccessful, if we say that there is going to be such a hearing
    D         and then it does not succeed, and i cnxriK is a proDlem with
              abuse hearings, unless anyone, do you share that view. That is
              the normal view we take on that.

              MEMBER OF THE PRESS: I would only say    that it is the discussion
              about the issue, the abuse of process    has been so well rehearsed
              publicly now, over the last few years    and more recently, a court
    E         in July, when there was a Stipendiary    Court decision.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Did you report the decision in the
              Magistrates Court?

                   MEMBER OF THE PRESS: I did not, and some of us here did, my
              Lord, yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: There was no ban on that?

                    MEMBER OF THE PRESS: Indeed not.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Does it really matter? Was it reported
               in the Press?

                    MR. CLEGG: We thought that the order did cover it, but by
               the time we had realised that it had been reported, it was too
               late to clarify, but it was certainly my belief and intention
               that it should not have been reported so we would say that some
               damage was done, but we do not want to add to it. It is bad
               enough knowing the potential Jury, that the Stipendiary
               Magistrate made the ruling that he did. We do not want them to
               know that you take the same view, if you do.
    H
                    MEMBER OF THE PRESS: My Lord will know that that hearing

                                              -33-

J. L Harpham Ltd.
divided, effectively, into two part, and the first P^ rt dealt
with the issue of abuse of process, and we in the spirit^of that
hearing, simply noted that result and awaited clarification upon
the ending of the hearing a week or two later. I would also
remind you, my Lord, that of course this matter was well
rehearsed before, I think in the High Court,, some time, I think
last year.

        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The problem is we are getting closer to
a trial now, aren't we? You will be reporting this January
t h e ....

     MEMBER OF THE PRESS: Six months before a trial.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Six months before a trial. You do not
want it?

     MR. CLEGG: No, I will come up front, if it is reported in
any detail, we will renew our application in relation to abuse
of process and rely upon the reporting. So I can not make our
position much clearer than that.

     MEMBER OF THE PRESS: I think the distinction that I would
want to make, my Lord, is that you would anticipate in any
event, the Court would probably make a ruling that we would not
go into any detail about the arguments, which is what we did do
during the committal hearing. It is simply to report the
outcome, the result of the abuse of process argument, and in
this even t ....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I think at this stage, all I am
concerned is whether you are allowed to report that there is
going to be a hearing. We would have to consider that second bit
later?

     MEMBER OF THE PRESS: Yes, yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The fact that there is going to be a
hearing in January, reported now, would that really - what is
the test I have to apply?

     MR. JONES: Substantial risk of prejudice to the
administration of justice in same or any subsequent proceedings.

     MR. CLEGG: The difficulty is I really do not want to occupy
too much time on it. It is the accumulative build up of
publicity, and it is a constant bringing to the public's
attention, this disaster, which has now been going on for ten
years solidly, and every anniversary, every event then, it is
all brought up again and revives all of the painful memories
that everyone has of that fateful day, and, of course, looked in
isolation, no harm will come of just that one fact being
reported, but it is the accumulation of this constant reference
to the disaster which remains, I think, the worst football
disaster, outside Peru, in the world.

      MR. HARRISON: My Lord, can I add to that because if the
 Press report today that there is going to be an abuse hearing in
                  January, it is inevitable that they will say now, our readers
                  have been told that there is going to be an abuse application in
                  January, surely we can tell them what the outcome was. So it is
                  not possible to divide off publicity and the outcome from
                  publicity of the future eve nt .

                       MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, if I may make this observation.
                  My Lord, it has been publicised in the Press, in the last year,
                  that there was an application to the Director of Public
                  Prosecutions to take over and discontinue this. Then there was
     B            the matter in Divisional Court which was reported in the Press,
                  television and continuing law reports. The outcome of the
                  application was reported in July. My Lord, for the life of me,
                  applying the statutory test, it is my submission....

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Paragraph?

                       MR. JONES: I do not think - a contempt is listed in
                  paragraph 28.30 and it is Section 4.2. I will have to look it up
                  in the index, I am sorry.

                         MR. CLEGG: Page 2276, 22.77.

                         MR. JONES: 2276.

     J)                MR. JONES: Well, it appears to be necessary for avoiding a
                  substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice
                  in those proceedings. Now, my Lord, I would argue that there are
                  three similar types of application have been reported in the
                  press, and nobody could possibly argue that the brief report of
                  similar pending proceedings could amount to a substantial risk
                  of prejudice in those proceedings.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Do you want to add anything further?

                        MEMBER OF THE PRESS: My Lord, I do not think so, on that
                   particular point. I am grateful t o . ...

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Any other point you want before I make
                   a ruling?

                        MEMBER OF THE PRESS: My Lord, one or two of my colleagues
                   are just a little concerned, it is of course a matter of record
                   in any event that the two defendants were both match commander
                   and deputy on the day of this tragic incident in Hillsborough,
                   and they are a little concerned that although that has not been
                   made clear here, that we are free to go on reporting that fact,
                   (Inaudible) the Defence did hold those responsibilities, at the
                   time of this offence.

                         MR. CLEGG: Well, for my part, I would have no objection to
                    that being reported because that has been so widely reported
                    already.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So the position of the defendants on
                    the day or - how would you like to word it?
      H
                         MR. CLEGG: May I reflect on it? Because,   I mean,   it is

                  difficult to read on the,

                       MR HARRISON: It is something the Jury would know, in any
                  event, and therefore I think the statutory test would not cover
                  it.

                         MR. CLEGG: I agree w i t h . ...

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: How would I word that?

      B                MR. CLEGG: The rank and role, on the day of the disaster of
                  each defendant may be reported. I hope that - I can see that
                  seems to satisfy their concern.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: On April the....

                       MR. HARRISON: My Lord, I do not have any difficulty about
                  the reporting the rank or that the two defendants were in a
                  position of responsibility at the match. Since I do not know
                  quite what form of words is likely to be adopted to try and
                  elaborate or put a gloss on that responsibility, I am concerned
                  about how that might be reported.

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: How do you wish to describe them?

                       MEMBER OF THE PRESS: We would (Inaudible) barest minimum
     D
                  details, my Lord, simply to refer to the statements of the two
                  defendants, at the time. This is not to elaborate upon anything
                  other than that fact.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I would have thought that would - the
                   rank and role would meet it. It is what Section that I am
                   actually making the order, it is under Section....

                         MR. CLEGG: 4.2.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: 4.2, yes. Under Section 4.2 of the
                   Contempt of Court Act 1981, I make the following order, which is
                   to continue in force until verdict or further order.
                   There shall be no reporting of any proceedings in the absence of
                   the Jury, with the following exceptions. The contents of Counts
                   1, 2 and 3 may be reported, and the fact that the defendants
                   have pleaded not guilty. There shall be no publicity about
                   proposed Counts 4 and 5. The place and date of trial may be
                   reported. The identity of the Judge and Counsel, the fact that
                   defendants are on bail, and the rank and role of the defendants,
                   of the two defendants, on the - I am sure everyone is so

                         MR. JONES: 15th of April 1989.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes. There is only one issue about
                   which I am asked to make a ruling. The Press wish to publish the
                   fact that there will be on January the 4th, a hearing, during
                   which the defendants will be making an application that the
                   indictment should be stayed as an abuse of process. The Press
      H            point out that the fact that such an application was made before
                   the Magistrates' Court has already been published. Mr. Harrison,

                                                        • 36-

J. L H a rp h a m Ltd.
              particularly makes the point that if that date is published and
              if the defendants were not to succeed in that application, that
              might be something which an astute reader of the newspaper or
              watcher of television or listen to the radio, would realise. Mr.
              Jones, and again, a helpful representative of the Press has made
              the point, well, still that will be six months before the trial.
              I take the view that if that application were to fail, there
              would be - and if a Jury were to know that - then there is a
              substantial risk of prejudice to these two defendants. Mr. Clegg
              makes the point, forcibly, that if that were to be published,
    B         then that would add further weight to the submissions that he
              wishes to make. On balance, I take the view the test is
              satisfied in 4.2 and there is to be no publication of the fact
              that there will be an abuse hearing or the date of such hearing
              is to take place. I stress, of course, and that ruling applies
              until verdict or until further order. Anything else on that?
              Anything else on that subject, at all? Yes, thank you very much.
                   Now the defendants may go. You are released on bail. You
              are to - they should be here on the 20th of December?
              Admissibility arguments?

                     MR. CLEGG: Are they? Yes, I think they probably should be,
              yes.

              MR HARRISON: I think the 20th of December is Mr. Clegg and Mr.
              Duckenfield only.
    D
                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I think there may be - you do not
              think you are going to be involved, at all?

                   MR. HARRISON: I can not be involved, on that date. That was
              the problem. That is why we are coming back in January.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, we will have to bear that in mind,
              Mr. Jones, when we do the agenda for the 2 0th, that Mr. Harrison
              will not be here. Well, Mr. Murray, you need not be here on the
              20th of December, but you must be here on the 4th of January.

                          MR. MURRAY:   Yes, my Lord.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And Mr. Duckenfield, you must be here
              on the 20th of December?

                          MR. DUCKENFIELD:   Yes, my Lord.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And you both understand that should you
               fail to appear, you commit an offence punishable by
               imprisonment. Yes, thank you very much, both of you. You are
               released on unconditional bail. Now....

                    MR. CLEGG: (Inaudible) the orders that you have made by
               Monday of next week.

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: To Counsel, once you have all agreed
               i t , then....

    jj              MR. ISAACS: I trust the Court will have copies towards the
               end of next week.

              Courts of Justice. Now, where are we?

                   MR. JONES: My Lord, this is a complicated matter. My Lord,
              I understand, I hope I am right in understanding, that your
              Lordship did not receive the note we sent about this, with its
              en.lisures, until today?

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, I have read the opening
    B         correspondence. I have not gone into the whole history of the
              matter, but can I first of all look at what we are actually
              doing? By one route or another, this is a witness summons, in
              effect or could be turned into a witness summons.

                    MR. JONES: It is that type of debate, my Lord, yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: To the Chief Constable?

                    MR. JONES: Yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, does the new law apply?

                   MR. JONES: No, it does not, my Lord, it does not. This is
              an old style case because there was a police investigation in
    D         1989 to 1990.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, no, no, under witnesses, there is
              the new law where they have amended - I would have thought that
              applies? I do not think that is a transitional - Section....

                   MR. JONES: No, my Lord, I do not think this is really a
              witness summons case, my Lord, it is a question about disclosure
              more generally. My Lord, I wonder if I could outline what the
              problem is and where we are because there have been discussions
              about this, and in correspondence now for a period of a year,
              and there is an urgent problem about access to documents.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I understood all of that. So, before we
              start on that, can we just look at the legal basis for any order
              I make? As I understand it, it is the new orders regarding
              witness summons which came into force about two or three months
              ago.

                    MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, if there is, but we are not in
               that area, my Lord, because the context in which we are here is
               the context of the management of a voluntary disclosure process,
               and it has been indicated on behalf of the Chief Constable that
               he will comply with any guidance the court may give about this.
               My Lord, the reason why the witness summons procedure does not
               apply is because the w^dth and volume of the documentation we
               seek is unknown to us. There will be large numbers of
               statements, reports admissible under Section 24 and other
               documentary material, in the possession of the South Yorkshire
               Police, which is directly relevant to the matters on the
               indictment, and my Lord, the problem historically arises in the
    jj         following way; my Lord, your Lordship may know that there have
               been four inquiries into this matter before 1997, and if I just

              outline them, the first of them was Lord Justice Taylor, my Lord
              the second was the Director of Public Prosecutions, the third
              was the Inquest, and the fourth, the Police Complaints
              Authority.

                   Now, the documents all the evidential documents in the
              case, witness statements and exhibits were collected by the West
              Midlands Police, reporting to each of those statutory bodies.
              Now, my Lord, that happened in succession. Last year, when these
              private prosecutions commenced, we sought all available
    B         documentation of all those bodies, and to our considerable
              surprise, my Lord, it was reported that all the documents
              collected by the West Midlands Police, for all those different
              bodies, had found their way back to South Yorkshire Police, of
              course which had been one of the bodies under investigation, and
              therefore, we have not been able get more than a handful of
              documents from the Coroner. We have been able to get from the
              Director of Public Prosecutions only the documentation he has
              retained since 1990. My Lord, nothing from the Police Complaints
              Authority, and there is one party I have missed out, and Lord
              Justice Taylor's documents, my Lord, some of them were put into
              the Public Record Office, but the West Midlands Police have
              handed over the documents they collected for Lord Taylor to the
              South Yorkshire Police. So, my Lord, the South Yorkshire Police
              have all those documents.
    D
                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                    MR. JONES: The problem, my Lord, has been this, unless one
               can identify with precision an individual document under the
               witness summons procedure, whether it is old or new, Magistrates
               Court or Crown Court, unless one can identify particular
               documents, by description, then you cannot get those documents
               produced by force of law.

                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am not sure of that proposition.

                     MR. JONES: Well, my Lord....

                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Where do I find that?

                    MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, what we have looked at is the
               witness summons procedure under Section 9 7 (a) of the Magistrates
               Courts procedure...1

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: We are not, we are looking at Section 4
               of the - aren't we? - of the Criminal Procedure Attendance of
               Witnesses Act of 1965?

                    MR. JONES: Yes. My Lord, I wonder if I could trouble your
               Lordship for a page reference?

                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: As amended by the 1996 Act.

                  is further.

                        MR.. JONES: Yes.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   It is the - what is it?

                        MR. JONES:   It is 986.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: 986, yes, that is right. Criminal
                  Procedure Attendance of Witness Act 1965.

                       MR. JONES: Yes. A summons directive, requiring a person to
                  whom it is directed to attend before the trial and give evidence
                  or produce any document or things specified in the summons may
                  be issued out of the Crown Court or out of the High Court, and
                  then there is the provision for setting it aside, and schedule
                  1, the procedure for doing this, and then underneath there are
                  authorities, my Lord, which I think are effectively the same,
                  whether the witness summons applied for in relation to the Crown
                  Court or to the Magistrates Cou r t. What is not permitted by the
                  authorities, as your Lordship knows well, and my learned friend
                  has cited I believe the appropriate authorities, is a trawling
                  or fishing expedition, and my Lord, that however does not answer
                  the problems posed in this case.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, just before you get there, I
                  mean, just look at the authorities on which he relies for that
                  proposition because over and over again, one is used to wide
                  ranging applications to local authorities to produce all their
                  files.

                        MR. JONES: Yes.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And what they are required to do is to
                  produce the file and then they are supposed to look it and
                  identify any document that is relevant therein.

                       MR. JONES: My Lord, that would normally, in my respectful
                  submission, that would normally be an application under schedule
                  1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which application is
                  made by a Constable.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, Mr. Jones, we do them all the time.

                        MR. JONES: Yes.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Requiring local authorities to attend,
                   bring their files with them, and the whole file is brought, the
                   whole file is read by the judge or for that matter, can be
                   delegated to Counsel for the local authority.

                        MR. JONES: Yes. Well, my Lord,     if....

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am quite used to general, very
                   general orders.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Are similar authorities being relied on
                  to suggest the contrary? It is a circular argument.

                       MR. JONES: My Lord, paragraph seven onwards. Does my Lord
                  have a red file?

                         MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   I do. It is the red one, is it?

                         MR. JONES: Yes.

      B                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, it is here. The problem with all
                  the authorities in 8(b), as I recollect, is that they completely
                  overlook Section 23 and 24.

                       MR. JONES: Yes, well, my Lord, my learned friend does refer
                  to that and also Barlow Clowes, but I respectfully agree that
                  Section 24 certainly does widen the traditional historical
                  scope.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: That is why I have never found Derby
                  Magistrates particularly helpful, since it overlooks that line.
                  Yes, well, there is the legal background.

                       MR. JONES: Yes, and my Lord, we would be very content to
                  apply for a witness summons, directed to the Chief Constable, to
                  produce all witness statements taken - and the matter could be
     D
                  described generally - all witnesses statements taken by the West
                  Midlands Police or other police forces, in connection with - and
                  one could list those four Inquiries - into the Hillsborough
                  disaster, any documents or any reports containing evidence of
                  those. In fact, my Lord, we have, in the correspondence, set out
                  the categories of documents.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Let us do it bit by bit. Witnesses
                   statements, first of all.

                         MR. JONES: Yes. Every statement made by a police officer or
                   - well, by anybody - about the events occurring inside or
                   immediately outside Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th of April
                   1989 .

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Let us see what the objection to that.
                   What is your objection to that? It could well be admissible in
                   evidence in their own right.

                        MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, my learned friend has said today, he
                   is not going to call any police officer because they are not
                   witnesses of the truth.

                         MR. JONES: No,    I have not,    I said senior police officers.

                         MR. GODSMARK: Then I misheard.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, he has not seen the witnesses. The
                   ones he seen, so far he does not like.

      jj                 MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, the objection in law is that this is
                    a trawling and fishing exercise.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Why? It is identifying witness
               statements, taken in the course of an Inquiry. Let us reverse
               this and imagine Mr. Jones had all these documents and you were
               prosecuting someone else. You would be looking for all of those
               things. As a Constable, you would be going in and seizing it,
               you would not even be asking for - you would just take them.

                    MR. CCDSMARK: My Lord, the difference is I am not the
               Prosecutor.
      B
                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, you are a third party.

                    MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

                    MR   JUSTICE HOOPER: Upon whom a witnesses could be served.

                    MR. GODSMARK: Yes, and different considerations apply, in
               my submission. My Lord, can I move from the law to the
               practicalities? Because you say, what is the objection? There
               are objections in law, but in fact access to this material has
               been offered.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Is?

     D              MR. GODSMARK: Has been offered.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, well, now, let us not deal with
               the law then. What terms do you offer that?

                    MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, an appropriate undertaking as to
               conventions, which shall be implied in any event, that I do not
               believe is a controversial matter. Supervision so far as access
               to the archive is concerned, and payment of our costs.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Where in the rules is there anything
               about payment of your costs?

                    MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, there isn't. If your Lordship were
               to order the production, as a matter of law, then we would of
               course have to comply, but my Lord, my submission is that, with
               the greatest respect, your Lordship should not and cannot order
               as a matter of law - what the Chief Constable is offering a
               voluntary facility.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, let us look at the law first
               then. Why cannot I (?) as a matter of law?

                    MR. GODSMARK: Can I take you to 8(a)? To which we have
               referred to previously briefly all ready, or perhaps if I start
               slightly earlier than that, the 7th Hallas(?) and my Lord, can I
               say that I would hope tabbed in the red folder, there are the
               authorities to which I refer.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: We will just look at Hallas.

               my submission.

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Why?

                    MR. GODSMARK: Because it would not matter whether
               proceedings had started or not, to govern a general principle,
               that an individual private prosecutor is not entitled to demand
               documents as of right, if he has no other entitlement to them.

               Or is it that you are in some special position? What is your
               special position that puts you outside for example a local
               authority, bank?

     D              MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, there are particular criteria that
               apply to banks, in terms of banker's books evidence, etcetera.

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Local authorities.

                    MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, the position there is that a witness
               summons is served, and that is the appropriate procedure in this
               case.

                    MR. JUSTICE    HOOPER: Yes, well, that is what we are
               assuming, we are    assuming that a witness summons is going to be
               served on them.

                    MR. JONES: My learned friend seems to suggest that that is
               not correct procedure, it is my submission it is.

                    MR. JUSTICE    HOOPER: Well, tentatively, I think I agree with
               you. I am looking   at this as a witness summons case. Now, why
               can you refuse to   produce a document on the basis of Hallas, if
               a witness summons   is served upon you? I do not understand that
               at all.

                    MR. GODSMARK: No, no, Hallas is simply the authority for
               the proposition that other than through the witness summons
               procedure.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, in which case we just ignore
               Hallas?

                      MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

     H                MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: For the moment. Now, what is your next
               one?

                    MR. GODSMARK: McMillan, behind tab two.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: This is the liquidator one?

                   MR. GODSMARK: Yes, many of them are of .that description. If
              I can ask your Lordship to read the head note, I will then take
              you to the relevant part of the judgment.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes. Yes, show me the passage.
    B
                   MR. GODSMARK: Page 841, my Lord. It is part of the judgment
              of Mr. Justice Millet. Can I invite you to the bottom of page
              841, just below the H? And ask your Lordship to read that
              paragraph and its conclusion over the page.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am obviously looking at Mr. Justice
              Millet's decision in Clowes?

                    MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: He upheld the witness summons.

                    MR. GODSMARK: On Section 24,

    D              MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: On the grounds that the evidence was
              material and admissible.

                    MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well this evidence would be admissible
              and would seem to be material. Otherwise, there is no point in
              taking the statement in the first place.

                    MR. GODSMARK: My Lord,   I query the admissibility.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Why?

                   MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, well, at the moment I do'not
              understand what issue it will go. There may be a large number of
              witness statements. They may deal with a variety of matters, but
              on my limited knowledge of the case, I have not seen the
              depositions in the case papers and from listening to submissions
              this afternoon, it appears that the case will revolve around
              essentially, the events between a fairly strict time period on
              15th of April, and probably what the defendants said to others,
              in a period thereafter. Now, my Lord, there may be witness
              statements that deal with that.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: But I could deal with that by ordering
              you to produce all relevant witness statements, but that
              involves you then looking at everything, and then I would be
              entitled to look at the balance and decide whether or not they
              should be produced all of which is a considerable burden

                    MR. GODSMARK:   I would like to spare your Lordship that.
    H
                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                         MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, can I say...?

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I mean, all we are talking about is
                   whether or not you should be paid £30 an hour to do this, that
                   is what il is all about.

                        MR. GODSMARK: The practicality is very much that because as
                   I say, the reality is that access has been offered to this
                   documentation, and my Lord, I have made the point in the
         B         skeleton argument, there is potentially a vast amount of
                   documentation to be considered.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, forgetting documents which may be
                  privileged and or in a different category, we can perhaps deal
                  with those later, if we need to.

                         MR. GODSMARK: But in my submission....

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: If I have the power to order you to
                   produce any relevant document, and we have obviously have to
                   define relevant.

                         MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

         D              MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You would have to go through them all.
                   Which would cast you £3 0 an hour.

                         MR. GODSMARK: Well, somebody would have to.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Whereas if you do it the other way and
                   just make it available to the Defence, subject to querying any
                   particular document as to having some particular status which
                   means it ought not to be produced.

                        MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, what is objected to, in essence,   is
                   the unfettered trawl through the entire archive.

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, then, you must do the trawl then.
                   Who would you rather do it? And show me the ones you say that
                   are not relevant and then let me look at them? History tells us
                   the easiest way is to allow the Defence, if it is in the case of
                   a defendant, when the defendant is making his application here -
                   it is usually the Prosecution - let them in, and under
                   supervision, look at it all.

                        MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, in my respectful submission, no.
                   That is a fishing and a trawling exercise. In relation to
                   statements, your Lordship has picked upon a particular category
                   of documents. That is not the only category of documents....

                        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No, I am dealing with witness
                   statements any way. All of which seem to me to be both
                   admissible and could be relevant, but without looking at them,
                   no one is going to know.

         H              MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, if we are confining ourselves to
                   witness statements, and as I say, they have been offered

                                                   -45-

             voluntarily. If my Lord orders that they be produced, that will
             be done, obviously, and the costs would have to fall upon us to
    A        comply with the order. I make no bones about that. The concern,
             in terms o f ....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I can only order you to produce
              relevant documents.

                    MR. CODSMARK: Yes, relevant material a n d . ...

    B               MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: We have to define what relevant means.

                    MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So that would be a huge undertaking, on
              your part, to comply with my order. A huge undertaking.

                    MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

                       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: It is being offered to be done for you,
              and you are saying, supervised, that is agreed. So I do not see
              why, given that, you just do not get on and do it because I have
              the power, I would have thought, to order you to produce
              relevant documents, but then you have got to then trawl through
              them, find the relevant ones, which would not really be very
              m u c h . ...

                    MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, can I try and cut the Gordian knot?

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                   MR. GODSMARK: And take you to two documents. Does your
             Lordship have the bundle prepared by my learned friend for the
    E        Prosecution. Mine is more substantial.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The    blue    one?

                    MR. GODSMARK: The green    one, I think.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Which one is it, Mr. Jones?

    F              MR. JONES: It is a green file. It has got on the back,
              Leeds Crown Court 3rd of September. It is has not come in that
              box, my Lord. It came separately to this court, last week.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: This is the correspondence one.

                   MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, can I take you to the latest
    „        position?
    (j

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Which tab?

               firstly,   please, to page 16. Note of the 20th ofAugust. If     your

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, witness statements is top of the
list, as I say, but that is by no means all of the
documentation.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well,   let us just deal with witness
statements.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, if you order their production as
being material and admissible.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I will order the production of relevant
ones, but it is   then foryou, with a huge task, towork out what
is relevant. So   it seems more sensible that you let them look at
the documents.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, we have offered that,   in relation to
the witness statements.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   But at 30     an hour.

     MR. JONES:   My Lord, (?) 1 and 9 are agreed by the South
Yorkshire Police, but as your Lordship has rightly identified,
the question is, should we pay 30 an hour, and should we pay
3 0 an hour, further, for them to be copied to the Defence.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, someone has got to pay for it, and
in my submission, the burden should not fall upon the Chief
Constable. The 30 an hour, I am instructed, an estimate of the
cost of having an officer supervise and deal with these matters.
It may not be an officer, it may be civilian, but an individual,
and that may be the only matter between my learned friend and
myself.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: If I make an order that you produce all
relevant documents, which involves you in a huge amount of work,
are you entitled to be paid for that by the person demanding it,
under the rules?

     MR. GODSMARK: No, my Lord.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Unless, obviously, there may be a gap
 (Inaudible) but that is i t .

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, I cannot seek to say that we will
comply with any order of the court, on condition of payment.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: No. It does not look like you are
winning this one.

     MR. GODSMARK: Well, my Lord, witness statements being in a
particular obvious category in any event.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So, you have got the choice, either I
 order all relevant witness statements or you come more gently
 and let them in to look at these things. Copying is a different
 matter. I would have thought they would pay for copies, but I do
 not think they will object to anything like that. Which route do

                                  -47-
you want me to go?

     MR; CODSMARK: My Lord, whilst we look at other matters, can
I take instructions on that?

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   Yes.

     MR. JONES: My Lord, can Isay we have proposed to take our
own photocopier with us. My Lord the Crown Prosecution Service
have offered, without charge, I may say, to supervise this
process, and we, for out part, welcome that because it is a
neutral person. My Lord, may Ijust say that categories one to
nine are all agreed, by Mr. Danes, subject to those matters of
undertakings.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, the preferred route, as I understand
it, is that we will give access to all of them.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: That is for one to nine, in this
letter?

     MR. GODSMARK: No, my Lord, for one.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: One only. Right,   let us go to the next
one then. Two?

     MR. GODSMARK: Copy books of officers, my Lord, admissible?

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, why not? Section 24, business
records - straight forward. I do not have any difficulty with
that one. If log books in hotels are admissible - if the guest,
what is it called - the book you sign in, the drug dealer signs
in, when he goes to Spain to buy his drugs is admissible, one
would have thought that the log book of police officer is
permissible.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, it is being suggested then that the
pocket book entry of a police officer be put before a Jury
without warnings.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: It is admissible in evidence.       It is
something that is admissible. You could put it in.

     MR. GODSMARK: And material?

      MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER: There might be objections.

      MR.  GODSMARK: I can see that, under Section 35, yes. My
 Lord, materiality, again....

      MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER: That is the same issue, again.    Either
 you do the work yourself or you let them look at it and      let them
 decide it

      MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, I am beginning to get the direction
 of the wind. Can we move to three?

                                  -48-
    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Three.

     MR. GODSMARK: No problem with that. "4. All notes and tape
recordings of meetings". My Lord, we are now moving on to
different ground, in my submission.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes. Let me just look at them more
carefully.

     MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am not really quite certain what they
are, though. I mean, the test is whether they are admissible
under Section 24.

     MR. GODSMARK: As a start point, yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Some might be. For example, there might
be there, a Mr. Duckenfield or Mr. Murray saying something, and
that would be clearly admissible. So how are we going to work
out whether it is there or not? The hard route or the easy
route?

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, my learned friend, Mr. Jones,
presumably knows the facts that he seeks to prove in this case.
To that, he is more privy than I. If he wishes to trawl, and it
would be a trawl of that documentation, to seek to decide what
is admissible and what is not, I leave to one side for a minute
whether a trawling exercise is permissible, but if that is an
exercise that he wishes to undertake, then in my submission, he
should not throw the burden of him undertaking that exercise,
financially upon the Chief Constable.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, that is the same point you have
made. In this case, the order is for you to do the trawl, to
find out anything that is admissible under Section 24,
particularly in relation to these two defendants.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, my only difficulty with at that, as
I say, is that I am not privy to the depositions, I am not privy
to the way in which the Crown puts its case.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And what were these produced to the
Magistrates Court? What was produced?

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, there was a fairly large quantity of
documentation. I have got, actually, copies of the summonses and
the schedules, briefing notes, turning now ground log, audio
tapes, plans, layout. All of that has been produced already.
Photographs.

       MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: So, what are we short of? What is
 missing, as far as the Prosecution is concerned, what do they
 want?

      MR. GODSMARK: Well, my Lord, if my learned friend can
 specify - can I seek to try and turn this round, slightly?

                                 -49-
S ’




      Because it certainly is, in my submission, the law that it is
      for the person seeking the production of the documents, properly
      to specify what he wants, adequately to particularise the
      documentation which is sought.

           Now, my Lord, if my learned friend had tightened his
      definitions of what he is looking for so, for example, if he
      see   to say in relation to T.o. 4, any notes or records of
      utterances ul Mr. Duckenfield or Mr. Murray, then that is a
      matter with which we can deal, but in my submission, as
      Prosecutor, he needs to know what it is he is seeking to prove
      and how he is seeking to prove it.

           MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well,   I am not sure that actually
      states the law. Mr. Jones?

           MR. JONES: Well, I think I can help on that. My Lord, those
      briefing notes that were referred to, where disclosed in a
      statement of a witnesses called Detective Sergeant Carr, who was
      one of the statements   whose statements was put by request to the
      Home Secretary in the   House of Commons Library. He listed,
      briefing notes of meetings of the 16th, 17th and 19th of April.
      We believe and have grounds to believe from other statements
      that there were other such meetings at which further assertions
      of fact, admissible under Section 24, were made.

           MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Made by.whom?

           MR. JONES: By a group of officers, including Mr.
      Duckenfield and Mr. Murray, in a series of meetings, and my
      Lord, Mr. Danes, fortunately, at page twelve, does not raise any
      problem about this, other than the question of cost and
      undertakings. So, Mr. Danes has not raised, my Lord, at page
      twelve, any difficulty about this item, under paragraph 4.

           My Lord, it would inevitably include anything at which a
      lawyer was present or at which legal advice was tendered.

           MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   Why would he include that?

           MR. JONES: It would exclude it.

           MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Exclude.

           MR. JONES: I am so sorry, yes, under ordinary principles.
      My Lord, Mr. Danes has not identified any problem or difficulty
      about that category, and, my Lord, also we believe that those
      notes on which we have had, they appear to be a transcript of a
      tape recording.

           MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Would you be entitled to two officers
      discussing what happened that day? Neither of whom were Mr.
      Duckenfield or Mr. Murray?

            MR. JONES: We would, in my submission, if they were
       recorded and taken down by a person acting in the course of a
       duty, yes.


                                       -50-
    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:   In Section 24?

    MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: How many of these are there, Mr.
Godsmark? What is the bulk of these?

     MR. GODSMARK: Of category four?

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, that I do not know. Would your
Lordship excuse me a moment? My Lord, I have been told there
maybe none.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Nine.

     MR. GODSMARK: None. I think that is unlikely, given the
particularity that my learned friend has been able to give me on
four, but my Lord, he is certainly able from the submissions
that he as just made to you, to particularise what he wants, in
more detail, and my Lord, can I pass one matter here? The
particularity point is in essence the cost protection of the
third party. The proposition that a prosecutor in this case can
not simply insist on a fishing exercise or a trawl is part of
the cost protection of a third party, and certainly the Chief
Constable volunteered access to all of these matters, but is
conscious of the cost to the public purse of so doing.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Jones, on four, I am minded to say
that to the extent to which any of those contain admissions or
statements made of either of the two defendants.

     MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: They must be relevant and must
therefore be disclosed, and as to the balance, that there is
some doubt, and I would be minded to make you pay your 30.

     MR. JONES: For those?

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

     MR. JONES: Very well, my Lord, but I if I can just haggle a
little bit, I hope not 3 0 for them also to be copied to the
Defence, because we can copy them at a fraction of the cost
levied by the South Yorkshire Police.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: A reasonable cost for supervising.

     MR. JONES: Those documents, certainly, yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: And we will come back and do the order
later.

     MR. JONES: Yes. Now, my Lord, No. 5, then there may be no
others in that category, there may be, I know not. My Lord, the
ones we have been able to identify in the witness summonses from

                                 -51-
last May, were those where they were referred to by the Crown
Prosecution Service schedules or in some cases, were we had
copies from the Crown Prosecution Service because they, my Lord,
as I have just indicated, opened their doors completely and
utterly, to allow us to see anything of evidential value for
them. We ask for the same, in respect of the South Yorkshire
Police because there may be models or other plans or other
tapes,   her than those that we have been able to identify, and
it can not be a difficult task, in our submission, to identify
whether some such exist and to produce them.

     My Lord, similarly with six. All tape recordings and
transcripts of conversations from the police control box, other
than those we have already seen, and there cannot be any
practical difficulty about those.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, you would certainly be entitled
to those, I would have thought, at the times with which are
concerned. You say 1pm to 6pm would be about right

     MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: As far as five - well, going back to
five for a moment. Some of those would be, one would have
thought would come clearly within Section 24, but I am not
certain about some of the others. Models produced after the
event, for the purposes of an Inquest.

     MR. JONES: Well, they would certainly be capable of being
real evidence, in my submission.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I think - they are not
contemporaneous, they are made subsequently, after the time.

     MR. JONES: My Lord, I do not know whether there are any
models, my Lord, but we would not go to the stake for models,
but documents, photographs, plans and video tape of the day in
question, certainly we would.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I do not think you could object to the
photographs and video tapes of the complaint, made on the day,
could you?

     MR. GODSMARK: No, not   (Inaudible).

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: As far as photographs and video tapes
then, I would otherwise be making an order that they are
relevant and are to be produced. As far as the balance, I think
it is the 3 0 you are going to have to pay, Mr. Jones.

     MR. JONES: Yes.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: We will try and put this all together
 later, but six, you cannot object to that, can you?

      MR. GODSMARK: I have to say, I detect the thrust of your
 Lordship's views.


                                -52-
     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Seven, Mr. Jones, is I think is more
difficult unless it is one of the two defendants.

    M R . GODSMARK: Y e s .

     MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, except that there are instances
we know where the West Midlands police officers interviewed
people, under caution, in 1991, and they are particularly
controversial witnesses who were around the perimeter. People
like Police Constable Illingworth and Police Constable Smith.

MR JUSTICE HOOPER. Well, you have told me you are not calling
those witnesses?

     MR. JONES: No, my Lord, with respect to the people we are
not proposing to call are the senior officers of rank of
Inspector or, my Lord, Chief Inspector or above. There are one
or two exceptions who we may still, and there are other
officers, my Lord, in respect of whose statements we might wish
to apply for that evidence to be admitted under Section 24. That
is extracts from original statements made.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, seven really is, I suppose, you
would say, really the same as one?

     MR. JONES: A statement, yes, and      it is a matter, my Lord,
to which we attach importance because      it was important witnesses
who were interviewed on video, people      concerned with round the
perimeter and with the opening of the      gate, and they really do
go the heart of the c a s e .

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:      I am minded to order seven under the
none £3 0.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, would you excuse me a moment? Two
things that occur to me about that. Presumably, that is officers
below the rank of Chief Inspector, in the light of what my
learned friend has said?

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

     MR. GODSMARK: The second thing is, I simple do not know,
but realise there may be an issue on is public interest
immunity.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, that you just bring back to me.

     MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: There is no problem - this all subject
to P.I.I. and legal professional privilege, which you just bring
back as a separate issue.

     MR. GODSMARK: Yes,       I am obliged, my Lord.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Eight, Mr. Jones,      I think is a £3 0 one.

      MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, we have been asking for those for

                                    -53-
a year, my Lord.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, you may have been, but it is
still £30.

     MR. JONES: Well....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: That really is much more difficult for
me to order‘ that one.

     MR. JONES: Indexes. Very well, my Lord.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: £30.

     MR. JONES: And, my Lord, nine must be....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Nine must be none £3 0, I would have
thought.

     MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Do you wish to address me on that?
Subject to P.I.I. subject to the (Inaudible) clearly an expert
report must be relevant?

     MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

     MR. GODSMARK: I am not going argue with that in the light
of your Lordship's rulings and observations. My Lord, we then
enter in ten and eleven.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Ten....

     MR. GODSMARK: Privilege.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: ....and eleven is privilege. I am not
going to do those today, it is now already twenty-past-four,
those can be argued at some separate time. I think you would
have an uphill task, Mr. Jones, but there it is. We will come
back to those. And twelve?

     MR. GODSMARK: They want it copied on disk.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Do you object to that?

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, we can do it, it is just costs.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: You must pay for the copy.

     MR. JONES: Well, we can do it, my Lord, we have made
enquiries about this and there is relatively simple though
technically obscure procedure, by which homes computers can be
transferred to the people who are advising us upon scanning
documents.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, will you pay for that?

                                -54-
    MR. JONES: Certainly, my Lord, yes.

    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The first part of the copy.

     MR. JONES: But, my Lord, I am sure this is a matter which
we can deal with by correspondence.

    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:    I will leave twelve then.

    MR. JONES: Yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: But I would expect you to be paying for
copies, and if the copying of the homes needs some software to
do it, then you are going to have to pay for it.

     MR. JONES: Oh, yes, my Lord, but we would propose to
undertake that cost ourselves, in our respectful submission,
but, my Lord, one of the problems is that Mr. Dames at page
twelve, and this is one of the reasons why we wanted to deal
with this today, Mr. Danes at page twelve, said he wanted to
check with the Home Office first. My Lord, in our respectful
submission, there can be no reason why we can not copy any of
the documents within the categories mentioned in items one to
nine, on to disk. We are not taking anything else, and we are
converting it into....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I do not know, it may be a software
programme that would which is not designed to do this, for
reasons of security.

     MR. JONES: Well, my Lord, no, we have been told by out
expert, my Lord, that it can be done by simply copying files and
converting them into a more modern format so that we can use
them on our own computer system, and we would certainly be
prepared to pay, under our own arrangements, which would be a
lot, lot cheaper than would be imposed upon us by the South
Yorkshire Police, for an expert to come in, under the
supervision, again, of Mr. Crosston, and to copy documents from
the computers, and then we will be troubling the South Yorkshire
Police and be a nuisance to them for a lot shorter time than
would otherwise be the case.

        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Mr. Godsmark, what do you say about
that?

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, can I invite you to leave twelve for
two reasons.  Firstly, the problems that we have already
identified, and secondly, the Home Office may have some say
about this, and if they want to instruct somebody or indeed
instruct me, if we can not resolve it, then so be it.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I want it done quickly so I will
 do it on the beginning of next term, in London. If you cannot
 agree.

        MR. GODSMARK: My Lord.


                                  -55-
    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Content?

    MR. JONES: Yes.

    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Arranging it through my Clerk.

    MR. JONES: Certainly.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Because obviously it is vital to get
this sorted out, otherwise there is going to be a lot of paper
coming into existence which can be saved. So, if it is not
resolved, then you are to get, through my Clerk, arrange a date
in London where both of you attend and argue the poi n t.

     MR. JONES: I am very grateful. Possibly, my Lord, a little
flexibility with hours I hope might be possible, but I....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: With?

     MR. JONES: A little flexibility over hours might be
possible.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Oh, yes. Where are you in October?

     MR. JONES: My Lord,     I am in London, the Old Bailey.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, certainly. We will do it at 9:30.

     M R . JONES: Thank y o u .

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, that leaves 13. At the moment, it
escapes me how that might be admissible evidence, in this trial.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I am leaving 13 for the moment.

     MR. GODSMARK: Right.

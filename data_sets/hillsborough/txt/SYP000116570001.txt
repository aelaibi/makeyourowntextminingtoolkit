and     looking        f or w a r d     to the game.

It was       noticed that               from about         1.30pm a growing           number     of the

suppo r t e r s w i t h 4 packs were                  seated on walls            on L e p pings      Lane        close

the area.

The a t t i t ud e       of the         suppo r t e r s    towards    us was      very jovial,             in fact

several       comments         were        passed     to the effect           that    they were       not used

to seeing Police               O f fi ce rs       smiling and        talking      to them.

2 . 3 0 pm (approx)          - At    time s hown        I became aware            that 2 officers-             along

problems at the L e p p i n g s Lane entrance                        to the ground and that                 due to

the      large     volume      of spec t a t o r s    in L e p p i n g s Lane,          no v e h icles     could

get      thr ough at all.            Serv i c e    buses were a d v i s e d of the s i t u a t i o n and

took a l t er na ti ve         routes.         To the      best     of my knowledge            the supporters

who      had been sat          on the walls wit h their                  *4 p a c k s ’ must have          set off

the West S t a nd via               ’C ’ Gate where          I immedi a t e l y saw medical                    staff

giving a t t e n t i o n       to a y ou th         in the     rear      of an a m b u l a n c e .        There were

P ol i c e O f f i c e r s    and      civilians a d m i n i s t e r i n g      first aid.              The are a was

i ns t r u c t e d to    clear a w ay         for the a m b u l a n c e s       to get     into         the ground.

A lo n g w ith other           o f f icers      the    centre      part of this a rea was                  cleared to

s u pporters        from      this area.            In this area          I saw many s u p p o r t e r s who

were     very upset and a ng r y                towards      us.      I saw one y o u t h face                 to face

his    finger       in her       face.        The P o l i c e w o m a n was getting            v i s i b l y upset

and    so   1 went acr o s s            and   remo n s t r a t e d wit h       the y outh who was               eventually

coming out of the                tunnels and           I was ask i n g         them to leave             the ground

as soon as          possible.            The hatred        in the        faces     of the fans who were

are a on the         first     floor     of the West Stand.                 We were       to try and

persuade        s u p p o rt er s who were       there      to    leave     the ground and to go back

to their        respe c t i v e    transport       and to        conduct    our    head    count    to

ascertain         if any of their           party were missing.

The m a j or it y     of   people were         visi b l y s ho c k e d and        readily a g r e e d     to do

this.        I r e m ained w i t h PC 233 B l a c k h a m unt i 1 it was a n n o u n c e d               that

the game        had been a b a n d o n e d an d w ou l d         they     leave the       stand.     The

m a j o r i t y of the     people      filed out          in silence,       some    thanked     us for-

being      there and for           e ve r y t h i n g we had done,         whilst    one or two were

a b u s iv e t ow a rd s u s .

As    soon as      the s tand was         cleared,         along with PC B l a c k h a m      I went       into

the    seating a r ea and wit h other                    officers    conducted a se a r c h for

            These    two    people    stated    they had been    in the   seated a r e a above      the

            terra c e s and     had seen what     had happened.

            I then went       back    outside   along w ith PC S33 B 1a c k h a m where we met up

            w ith the      remainder      of our serial.     We were   then d i r e c t e d   into the

            m a i n stand for       debrief.

            Wh i l s t wait i n g   for   the debrief   I heard an     Inspector     be h i n d me say

            that    he had been kicked whilst           trying   to give a casualty m o u t h to

            m o u t h and that      he had seen anot h e r   officer   have   his hand kicked away

            whilst     checking      for a pulse.

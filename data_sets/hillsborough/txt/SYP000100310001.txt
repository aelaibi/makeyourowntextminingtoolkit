what       was          happening             at        that          stage        and       was      telling             the     fans      to    get       off

While      on    the        pitch        at      this       time     I was         becoming           wo r r i ed as /o ne           fan. h a d      i./


already         run     rewards             the N o t t s       Forest            en d a n d     if m o r e     were        to     follow,

I felt      there           would        have       been a         full       scale        riot.

It w a s    some        minutes             later,          after       I had       seen        someone        being         carried          on '

a stretcher             and       a    number          of L i v e r p o o l        fans     had a p p r o a c h e d         shouting,

" T h e r e ’s p e o p l e        dying          in t h e r e      w h y a r e n ’t y o u         helping?"                Most     of       these

people      appeared              under          the    influence             of    alcohol.             I then         decided          that

I ,was" s e r v i n g        no       useful        purpose          where         I was        and    together            with. P o l i c e

Constable            Edwards,           moved          towards          the       g oal.        I remember             talking          to

about      six       persons           who       were       lying       on    the       ground,        but     these        were        not

injured,         just        shocked.               I^.then s a w a y o u t h               aged       about       20 years,

laying      on t h e         floor          who     wa s     panting          strongly           and    c o u l d n * t ge t

breath.          I talked              to     him,      tried        to      calm       him,     whilst        doing        so    I;                yC;

signalled            fo r    a St.          J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e          lady     to    come     to    h i m as         we l i . ' -;r

The    y ou t h was          still          having          difficulty             breathing           but     was      still       .

panting,         a    stretcher               then      arrived,             he w a s      put    onto       the       stretcher             and

was    taken away.                    It w a s      then      that        I became          aware       that       a    large       number.                '

of    persons         had        gone       by on m a k e s h i f t           stretchers,              some     with        coats        o ve r

their      faces.            Although             I knew        people            had    been     injured          I was         Still

unaware         of    th e       true       scale       of    th e      incident.                                      :     -

Myself     and Police                  Constable             Edwards          continued           to    help the            walking

wounded.             There        were       a    large       number          of    wooden        advertising               boards

strewn across                the       penalty          a r e a.        The       fans     with       these     were        told        to    put

them    into         on e    pile       and       to w a i t       for       us    to    call     for     them,         thanking             them

for    their         work     done          already.            By      this       timemost,            if     not     all       of:the

bodies      had       been        removed.              Even       at     t h i s .time         I did     not      now wh a t           had

occurred         or    the        enormity             of    it.        I had       seen        persons        being        carried           on    •

makeshift            stretchers               but      thought          that       these        were    injured            persons           not

dead    ones.           I did          not       come       into     contact            with     any    corpses'myself. -

Superintendent               Nesbit,             who    t o l d me    to    t e ll    the       fans    on    the    pitch         t ha t

the    game      was    off       and       to    start       leaving       the      pitch.        This       I di d      until

about      half       the    number          on    the       pitch    had    left,         I then       joined       other

colleagues            who    had       formed          a cordon       across         the    pitch       at    the    halfway

line.

I was      then       told       by    Police          Sergeant       Taylor         to    go    back    to       Rawson     Spring

Road     to     assist       in       getting          the    Notts    Forest         fans       away    from       the

g r o u nd .     It    was       only       at    this       late    stage     while        talking          to    Police

Constables            from       the    serial          that       I learned         of    the    enormity          of    the

disaster         and    the       number          of    deaths       involved,            which    at    that       stage       was

about      70.

After      the    traffic             was    cleared          we    made    ou r     way    to C l a y w h e e l s       L a ne,

where      after       grabbing             a bite       to    eat,    were        transported           to       Rawmarsh         and

went     of f    duty       at    7.30       p.m.        I did w o r k       at      the    semi-final             the    previous

year,      our    serial          worked          at    the    Hillsborough               Shopping       Centre          some      mile

to    a mile      and       a half          from       the    ground.

Dear Sir

I am writing to give information for your inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster.

When I approached the ground at approximtely 1.15.pm, I did not
see any signs directing the Liverpool supporters to their area of
the ground.

I was in the north stand at 1 „3 0 «pm, my seat was just past the 20
yard line.  At 2.00.pm the section were the accident happened was
swaying and *as full, there were people climbing over the barriers
into the half full section to my right.

At 2.25.pm when the Liverpool players came out on to the pitch for
the warm up there were to many people in that part of the ground.
The players left the pitch at 2.35.pm, there were people being pulled
out of the Leppings Lane end to the seats above at that time. Why
did’nt the police investigate why people were being pulled up.iiito
the stand above, when in my opionion it was;obvious, that part of
the ground was full to capacity at 2.30.pm.  If I could see what
was happening from the time I arrived at the ground, why couldfnt
the police see into the enclosure from their vantage point in the
police bax.

Why w a s fnt there an announcement from the tannoy system to tell
supporters there had been an accicdent, it seemed the stewards,
officials and police did not know what was happening in that section.

Even after kick off time in the other section there was still plenty
of room, people were trying to get over the barrier at that time into
that area , but they were uable to do so because of the crush.

As the game kicked off people were comming into the north stand and
sitting on the steps of the passageways in large numbers. How did thev
get into the stand?
Yours faithfully

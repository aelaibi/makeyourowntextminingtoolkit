a    lot    of       shoving        and       pushing          tyjar'ng on,

All    of       our     group       except           for                                 had       ground        tickets              for    the

Leppings             Lane     t e r r a c e s as         far as            I know and          I    think        we     all       joined       onto

this       mass       of     people          to    try a n d       get       to    the     terrace          turnstile                 block.

I r^n n n l y           remember             seeing        one     p o l i c e m a n ^ r f * * h o r s e b a c k he wa s               in

were       all       t ry i ng     to    get       to    t h ^ i f e r r ace       turnstiles,              it       looked           like    this

P o l i c e m a n was         t r y ing       t g y f ii r e ct    people           into      queues        but       he w a s n ' t         having

any    success,              t h e i c e             horse        was      getting         squashed and moved                          around

just       like ^ e r y o n s            else.

When       we    got       into     this          mass,     there          was     a definate            crush,             people          were

beginning             to     panic       because           it w a s        getting         close       to    kick           off       time,

people          were       shouting           at     the P o l i c e         to    open       up the        gates           to    let       them

Although             it wa s       very       tight        inside           this       mass    of    people           it d i d         not    c a use

I had       frs^passage                 along       the       tunnel,          a l t h o u g h my        feet     were      not

I    had    not    had any          opportunity                to       hand     in m y m a t c h         ticket.

or     stewards         by    the       entrance          to     the      tunnel,         although             1 probably

w o u l d n ’t have          seen       them anyway              because           of    all    the       people       around          me.

When       I got     to      the    end       of    the       tunnel       I was         carried          out     onto      the

I can       only     say      that       I believe             the       game      kicked       off       a    couple       of m i n u t e s

I looked           over my         left     shoulder               and       I could          see    that       a gap         had a p p e a r e d

In this          ga p    that      had a p p e a r e d         I         c o u l d see a s u p p o r t e r t r y i n g              to       pick

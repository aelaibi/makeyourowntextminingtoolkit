        Dear Mr Bettison

        Re:           HILLSBOROUGH

        Further to our telephone conversation on the 18th September, I
        am now enclosing one copy of each of the following

        1. Mr. Phillips' Video.

        2.        The BBC Compilation Video.

        3. The West Midlands 1989                                Compilation Video.

        4. The West Midlands 1988                                Compilation Video.

        5. South Yorkshire Police                                photographs documents 1 and                              10.

         6. South Yorkshire Police                               Photographs Composite Albums
             1 and 2.

        7.        West Midlands Police Photographs Composite Albums
                  1 and 2.

        You will note that the BBC Compilation Video and West Midlands
        1989 Video are marked effectively as Inquiry documents with a
        reference also to the Appendix letters to Mr. Phillips' Report.
        This is because these two videos are "Trial1* videos as well as
        being part of our Expert's Report.


                                                                                                        Continued

        Continuation .....

        I spoke to Inspector Cleverley on the 18th September in relation
        to obtaining further sets of the five still photographs taken
        from Map 7.    He said he would send these through to me as
        quickly as possible and agreed to send one set direct to you.

        I am also enclosing the Consolidated List of Issues.

    The only further item still outstanding with Inspector Cleverley
    is the information I have requested in respect of witnesses
    Connelly and Mayhew.       It will be most helpful if this
    information could be with us by 4 p.m.

        Yours sincerely      jj     _

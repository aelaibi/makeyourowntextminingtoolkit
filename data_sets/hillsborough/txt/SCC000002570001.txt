NOTE FOR FILE - 26.3.90

I have had a conversation with Mr. Gregory of Keeble Hawson’s.

I informed him of the conversation with Sergeant Craig relating to the
information Hfe requested by West Midlands Police.

Mr. Gregory con^trnied that we have not yet been made party to the proceedings
and in fact South Yorkshire Police are appealing against the recent decision
not to allow them to withdraw the proceedings and commence fresh proceedings
later on in the year.

I also confirmed that Mr. Gregory was aware of the start date for the
Coroner’s Court.   He has not yet decided what representation to have at that
hearing, but he is going to attend the opening.

NOTE FOR THE FILE

28th February, 1990

Tony Gregory from Keeble Hawson rang to inform me that he has been
instructed to attend a pre-inguest review on the 6th March, 1990.   He
has been instructed to attend by the Coroner.  This will be to discuss
how the inquest will be run etc.    He is to inform me of the outcome
in due course.

He also informed me that he was in London on the 27th February, 1990
in relation to the civil claims.      Apparently the Chief Constable was
was trying to discontinue the third party actions as he was having
difficulties with the co-operation of his men.        Although a decision
has not been given, Tony Gregory feels that the Court will say that
the cases must go ahead, probably by the end of 1990.

Sheffield City Council, as yet, is not involved in the third party
actions.   The Police have served third party notices on Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club and Eastwood & Partners.

The problem is, if any of those parties joined us at a later date, we
would be at a distinct disadvantage in terms of preparation for the
case.

Tony Gregory is getting to the stage where he is going to be saying
to the other parties either join Sheffield City Council or confirm in
writing that you are not proceeding against Sheffield City Council.

He will keep me updated on progress.

              STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL


              HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - LIABILITY ISSUES

              I thought it appropriate that I write at this stage and inform you of
              certain information in the form of rumours which are being picked up
              regarding the conduct of the litigation and the issues of liability.
              However,  I must ask, that at this stage this information is treated purely
              as a rumour and as being strictly confidential as I am not yet in a
              position to verify the same.

              Basically, it would appear that initially the City Council was not added as
              a party to the writs issued by the Plaintiffs’ Solicitorsas they did     rot
              appear to feel that there was any particular liability on the part    of the
              authority, and that the writs were re-issued at the suggestion/insistence
              of Sheffield Wednesday, or rather its Insurers, Sun Alliance, who required
              that the City Council be added to the parties to be sued.

              Moreover, it was apparent at the recent pre-trial review on this issue that
              the plaintiffs are still not particularly interested in pushing claims
              against the City Council and see their real targets as being elsewhere.

              Moreover, I am given to understand that the real problem in the way of any
              sort of negotiated settlement on this matter of Sun Alliance, Sheffield
              Wednesday’s Insurers, who are apparently not at this stage minded to
              cooperate in negotiated settlements.       It is hoped that they will change
              their mind thereby obviating the need for a trial.

              Moving on there has also been a suggestion made that the Police Authority
              would rather like the retention of        theCity Council in the list of
              defendants for several reasons, including the one that they are at the
              moment as you know under-insured, and therefore, any additional party upon
              whom to spread liability would be welcome.

              Clearly at some stage or other there may need to be a policy consideration
              of this topic as if the Council remained party to the litigation which
              currently appears probable, and if it was say found at maximum responsible
              for 102 of     the damages this would have a corresponding reduction on the
              amount which the Police Authority had to pay and therefore would reduce the
              amount that might have to be found by the four District Councils, -with
              Sheffield’s insurance contribution being limited to the £50,000 excess on
              its policy and with no      real prospect of additional surcharges on its
              premiums. Against that, of course, there is the issue of the poorimage
              that would arise once again of the authority should it be found, even to a
              small extent, liable in damages for negligence.

              Clearly, as I stressed at the beginning these are merely    "legal Chinese
              rumours" which I shall do my best to verify, but which I thought, you ought
              to know in confidence at this stage as they may well require certain action
              to be taken at some future date assuming there is some substance in them
              regarding our relationship wtith the Police Authority.

                                    CIVIL CLAIMS - HILLSBOROUGH

            I refer to your memorandum of the 12th October, 1989, regarding the above.

            Mycomments on sections of the Interim Report of the Hillsborough Inquiry
            prepared by the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Taylor are as follows

            Para.   28 Regarding the gateways between the pens of the West Terrace, it
                        is agreed that when substantial numbers are present, those
                        gateways are not readily visible or accessible. It is however
                        considered that this is a misleading statement, deliberately
                        included to indicate the danger of the radial fences.

                       In any standing terrace, and particularly in peak viewing areas
                       it is difficult for the majority of spectators to see all the
                       available exits, and even if seen, they would be mainly
                       inaccessible. The gate positions should however have been
                       identifiable by the positioning of police constables, since in
                       the minutes of the working party meeting of the 7th August,
                       1985, it was stated that the gates at the top of the Terrace
                       would be under the control of the police.

            Para.   63 According to para. 59 of the report, at approximately 2.15 it
                        was noted that pens 3 and 4 were filling and that the wing pens
                        1, 2, 6 & 7 were nearly empty, and therefore a tannoy message
                        asking fans in pens 3 & 4 to move forward to make room for
                        others, was broadcast. Had action been taken to monitor this
                        situation, and if police had actually controlled the gates at
                        the top of the terrace, action could have been taken to have
                        avoided the situation stated in para. 63, where by 2.50 the
                        pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
                        discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces.

                       The statement includes the phrase, "The numbers at the time
                       were clearly in excess of the maximinum density stated in the
                       Heme Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 edition)”.

                       Para. 222 of the Green Guide refers to the figure of 54/10M2 as
                       being extreme allowance for packing density.

                       Para. 225 states that the capacity of the terrace is calculated
                       by multiplying the area available for standing by the
                       appropriate packing density.

                       The Green Guide recognises that there are both peak and non
                       peak viewing areas, and in para. 117 describes a peak viewing
                       area as the most popular parts of the terrace where there is a
                       tendancy for spectators to crowd together and become so
                       emotionally involved on the occasion that their reactions can
                       cause additional pressures to be set up in those sections of
                       the ground.

           It must therefore be concluded from the Green Guide that the
           figure of 54/10m 2 was a notional figure for capacity
           calculation purposes, and not a maximum density figure for all
           terraced areas. The packing density was clearly an average,
           and accepted that the density in peak viewing areas such as
           pens 3 & 4 would be in excess of the notional figure, since it
           would also be expected that less popular areas (non peak
           viewing) would have an actual density less than the notional
           packing density.

Para. 71   This para, refers to the momentum of the crowd of spectators
           passing through the tunnel after the opening of gate C, and
           states that the 1 in 6 gradient accelerated their progress.

           It is agreed that this would be the outcome of allowing
           spectators to pass unrestricted into the ground, and then
           unhindered into the tunnel.

           It was never contemplated by the Working Party, or the
           subsequent Advisory Group, that the external gates to the
           ground would be opened to allow fans to enter.

           The normal entry rate through the tunnel was governed by the
           rate of access of fans through the turnstiles and therefore the
           normal speed of spectators through the tunnel would be normal
           walking pace under low density conditions. The effects of an
           increased gradient would under normal circumstances be of no
           consequence.

           Conversely, at the end of the match, the mass evacuation of
           spectators would be made safer by the increase in this
           gradient.

           It is considered that the gradient within the tunnel was
           satisfactory for meeting its normally accepted design criteria.
           Similar to a modern domestic kettle, it is meant to be filled
           slower than it empties. If it is attempted to fill it faster,
           water usually spills. Many things are designed to be filled
           slower than they are emptied, and do not function correctly
           when the converse is applied.

Para. 72   The pitch perimeter gate opening devices had been recently
           installed, were of very heavy duty construction, spring loaded
           into place, and yet very easily opened from the pitch side of
           the fence (even under intense pressure). The gate latches have
           been tried since the disaster, and it cannot be accepted that
           they could spring open, even under the considerable pressure
           from within the pens.

Para. 82   It is understood from a search of the records of the County
           Council Working Party, that the width of the pitch perimeter
           gates was agreed in that forum. Prom past members of that
           Working Party, I am advised that the Police required the
           gates to be reasonably small so as to achieve crowd control
           access without causing pitch invasions at the same time.

            On the 12th February, 1979, the Working Party minuted:-

            "In view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer
            to reduce the spectator limit to 7,200 and the discharge time
            of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party AGREED that it would be
            unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional exits would
            be provided."

            All the pitch perimeter gates were installed before or whilst             _
            the County Council were the Certifying Authority.       V g itaeSU.W'*-   f
                                                                    wacu pvv+ u/v
Para. 116   Overcrowding of the West Terrace before 2.52 p.m. must clearly
            be attributed, in the main, to the lack of effective monitoring
            of the terraces. Without this the considerations of the layout
            and the lack of fixed capacities are inmaterial.

            The agreement of having the gates in the radial fences under
            police control was to create effective monitoring of the
            terraces and to recognise the potential shortcomings of the
            layout of the West Terracing.

Para. 117   It is noted that the list of matters in this paragraph are
            under the heading of considerations. The individual items will
            be discussed and canmented on at a later stage in this
            memorandum

Para. 124   Comment (c) in this paragraph says that after the 1981 incident
            the Police view was that the capacity figure of 10,100 in the
            Safety Certificate was too high. This information appears
            never to have been communicated to the County Council/Working
            Party.

Para. 126   There is no evidence that any capacity figure was ever agreed
            by the Working Party for any of the three areas created by the
            installation of radial barriers in 1981.

Para. 131   This section dealing with the agreement to cease the use of the
            Leppings Lane entrance to hone supporters, fails to mention the
            fact that the gates in the wall could be left open, even though
            the function of the brick wall between the turnstiles was
            redundant.

Para. 133   Lord Justice Taylor makes the cartnent that the Officer Working
            Party approved the proposal for the removal of barrier 144 on
            site on the 7th August, 1986, and that Authority was given then
            and there by Mr. Bownes on behalf of the Sheffield City
            Council.

            It is understood from staff present at that meeting, that after
            the matter was discussed, comment was made that there would be
            no objection to its removal. My Surveyor, however, fully
            anticipated that the matter would be the subject of written
            request and agreement (even in retrospect).

            The reason for reaching the decision to allow parts of barrier
            144 to be removed can be seen in the commentary to para. 233.
                                       - 4 -


Para. 137    The report critisises the fact that no reduction in capacity
             was made due to pen 5 being carved out of pen 4. It states
             that "this action was bound to have reducing effect on
             capacity."

             In 1985, it was not considered necessary to reduce the figure
             for capacity, since this small reduction in areas was seen to
             be fully compensated by the introduction of the radial
             barriers, which was seen to be a safety factor. Additionally,
             it was recognised that the existing barriers were at closer
             spacing than required by the Green Guide. The sub-division of
             terraces is advocated in paragraphs 16 and 206 of the Green
             Guide, as being advantageous for crowd safety.

             When studying the scheme for additional radial barriers, it was
             considered that professional judgement and camion sense should
             be used (as stated in para. 11 of the Green Guide).

Para. 138    The meticulous use of hindsight in this paragraph can only be
             considered with cynicism. The City Council requested the
             Health and Safety Executive to be a part of their Advisory
             Group but they refused. In hindsight, using very detailed
             drawings and the benefit of a consultant engineers report on
             the small area of terracing known as pens 3 & 4, they calculate
             to an accuracy more appropriate to the science of meteorology
             rather than practicality.

             The Hone Office recommendation of 2 men days per year per
             ground, and the Green Guide reference in clause 12 to plans at
             1/200 appear to have been forgotten in the heat of the Inquiry.

Para. 140    Although the report states that Dr. Eastwood conceded that the
             removal of barrier 144 was bound to affect the capacities of
             pens 3 & 4, the Council should not, since the decision was
             taken to improve safety not to reduce it. - See commentary on
             para. 233.

Para. 141    The height of the barriers is included in this paragraph as
             being a consideration for the reduction of capacity of the
             terrace. It will be remembered that considerable discussion
             took place at the Inquiry on the interpretation of paragraph
             110 of the Green Guide and it was agreed by Lord Justice Taylor
             that this was an area which would need further consideration.

             Paragraph 109 of the Interim Report states that in virtually
             every case the cause of death was crush asphyxia due to
             compression of the chest wall against other bodies or fixed
             structures. Although it is accepted that fans had suffered
             pain by being bent over barriers, it must be accepted that no
             deaths could be directly attributable to the height of the
             barrier rails, and therefore the criticism of barrier heights
             requires to be reconsidered.

Para   142   The calculations   of capacities for   pens 3 & 4, done by Dr.
             Nicholson of the   Health and Safety   Executive, do not appear in
             his report dated   13th June, 1989.    The basis of these
             calculations are   therefore unknown   and should be challenged.
                                     - 5 -



Para. 143   Despite the lack of individual capacities, this paragraph
            deliberately misses the point that the Club (together with the
            police who they hire by agreement) have a duty of care to
            provide a safe place for the spectators they admit to their
            premises.

Para. 146   Lord Justice Taylor states that Sheffield Wednesday complied
            with the requirements under the Act, to give notice of intended
            alterations. In the case of the removal of barrier 144 they
            failed to give notice.

            In regard to the non amendment of the certificate, the
            responsible authority at the time would have been the County
            Council.

Para. 149   Please see comments to paragraphs 137 and 146 above.

Para. 153   The debate of a decision/consent to remove barrier 144 is dealt
            with in the commentary to paragraph 133.

            Being that the matter was expected to be covered by
            correspondence at a later date, it is wrong for Lord Taylor to
            state that Mr. Bownes assented to this matter on behalf of the
            City Council.

            As to whether Mr. Bownes needed to have a detailed knowledge of
            football grounds in order to carry out his function as Chief
            Licensing Officer - I think not. His function was to
            administrate and co-ordinate the roles of representatives of
            the professional disciplines on the Advisory Group. The fact
            that he was ill-equipped with knowledge of football grounds
            does not reduce the potential ability to carry out the role of
            his post.

Para. 156   The due process of the capacity increase of the kop was
            undertaken by the professional disciplines. Apparently the
            subsequent administration after the agreement by the General
            Purposes Panel was the only ommission.

Para. 158   The attention given to the Safety of Sports Grounds
            legislation, by the Council as a corporate body, up to the time
            of the disaster accounted for a considerable amount of officer
            time, and resulted in the figures in the Hone Office
            publication being insignificant. Being that this was woefully
            inadequate, the Hone Office ought to have issued revised
            publications.

Para. 159   Although there may not have been a sanction upon the Club based
            on the limits to the pens by numbers, there was clearly a
            sanction based upon not providing a safe place for spectators.
            This latter approach would have been favoured in any event,
            since it would have been very difficult to have counted each
            person in such an area.

Para. 172   This whole paragraph is based on a wrong assumption. It was
            never anticipated that the fans would move freely from one pen
            to another. The minuted agreement of the Officer Working Party
            in August 1985 regarding the gates being under police control
            was specifically engineered to achieve control of this
            movement.
                                    - 6 -


Para. 173    Being that police control of the radial fence    gates hadbeen
            achieved and that those officers had summoned help to encourage
            fans to move from one pen to another, the suggestion that the
            terrace was one area would have held true.

Para. 177    The argument that the maximum capacity set by   the GreenGuide
            was 54 persons per 10 square metres has been refuted in the
            carmentry to paragraph 63 above.

Para. 211    The fact that the Leppings Lane entrance area    was smalland
            awkwardly laid out had been recognised by the Officer Working
            Party and the results of their deliberations are minuted frcm a
            meeting dated 13 November, 1985. This read:-

            "Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

            The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the
            merging of spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the
            Leppings Lane End.

            It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the
            physical restraints to achieve this could conceivably be more
            of a danger than allowing the present position to continue."

            Eastwood and Partners also commented on the 29 November, 1985
            that - "The Club is aware of the difficulties which the Police
            have to contend with at the Leppings Lane End and has of course
            been very pleased to help the problem by the major works which
            were undertaken during the last close season. We find it very
            difficult to envisage anything more which could be done at
            reasonable expense."

Para. 224   In the carments to paragraph 211 above, it is seen that the
            police were aware of the difficulties at the Leppings Lane End.
            The Council, however, were not party to the Police operational
            plans for matches and were unaware that there were no
            contingency plans.

Para. 228   Similar to the comments of paragraph 224 above, the Council
            were unaware of operational orders or contingency plans for the
            movement of fans inside the ground. As stated before, the
            Officer Working Party/Advisory Group were never advised that
            there could be cases where the external gates were to be opened
            to freely admit fans.

Para. 233   At the annual inspection on the 7 August 1986, the Police
            raised the request to remove barrier 144. Feins were stopping
            and leaning on barrier 144, when caning out of the tunnel,
            instead of travelling further down the terracing. This was
            therefore restricting the flow of other spectators out of the
            tunnel into both pens 3 and 4.

            Dr Eastwood, in his statement to the Inquiry corroborated these
            facts by stating:- "Spectators tend to congregate at the top of
            the West Terrace rather than at the bottom by the perimeter
            fence because their view will not be obscured by the small mesh
            of the perimeter fence."
                                      - 7 -


            My representative agreed to the removal of parts of the
            barrier 144 for the following reasons

            1.   It was understood that the terrace would be manned by
                 police.

            2.   Means of escape, using the tunnel, were excellent from both
                 pens at that point.

            3.   It would alleviate spectators backing up within the tunnel.

            4.   The police control box was relatively near, and it was
                 assumed that any problems on the terrace could be seen from
                 that position.

            5.   The tunnel mouth was understood to be kept clear,
                 throughout the duration of the game, by police.

            6.   It was assumed that spectators would be entering that area
                 at turnstile speed only. It was never envisaged that the
                 external gates would be opened to allow mass entry of
                 spectators.

            7.   The number of spectators in the pens would be monitored by
                 the police.

            8.   Any incoming crush would be seen on the terrace, rather
                 than be hidden inside the tunnel.

            The Fire Authority was also represented at the time and agreed
            to the proposed removal of the sections of this barrier,
            however, their own reasons for the decision are not known.

            The area to be kept clear in front of the tunnel mouth was
            subsequently painted with yellow hatch markings.

            According to the above, had the agreed police presence been on
            the West Terrace pressure would never have built up to create
            the diagonal force from the tunnel mouth directly onto barrier
            124a .

            The gap created by the works of 1985 would have put pressure
            straight down the terrace on barrier 125, not 124A .

Para. 235   I agree with the later argument of Dr Eastwood, that if barrier
            144 had stayed in place, tragedy would have occured in the
            tunnel. This could conceivably have caused death in greater
            numbers than occured on the terracing.

            Although the remaining part of barrier 144 in pen 4 may have
            avoided similar carnage as pen 3, it is thought that the
            comnents of Dr David Uzzell of the Department of Psychology,
            University of Surrey, regarding the natural tendency for people
            to travel to the right rather that the left may have been an
            important factor.

Para. 239   Lord Justice   Taylor states that the testing methods used had
            seme support   from the British Standards tests on steel
            structures.    My opinion is that the test methods used had full
            support from   this and other structural codes.
                                    - 8 -



            The use of the word "tenable" regarding the method used by
            Dr Eastwood needs to be challenged since it infers a reluctance
            to accept a procedure which is completely viable and in
            accordance with all current information and practice.

Para. 243   STRENGTH

            It is agreed that the effective cause of the collapse of
            barrier 124A was the excessive and unanticipated pressure to
            which it was exposed. However, I do not agree that the barrier
            was only capable of withstanding a load which did not exceed
            the test load. This needs challenging, since calculations and
            tests show that the barrier would have been able to support a
            force well in excess of the test load. It should be noted that
            the Green Guide only requires the barriers to pass the test
            load (which is an overload) without enhancement.

            TESTING

            The Certifying Authority in the Safety Certificate required
            that at least 20% of barriers be tested each year and that all
            barriers be tested every 5 years.

            Although criticism was raised of this statement in the Inquiry,
            it must be noted that a literal interpretation of the "Guide"
            allows a representative sample of barriers of all types from
            all areas of the ground to be tested initially and thereafter
            testing of barriers to take place every 4 years (clause 38).
            This could infer that a representative sample be tested every 4
            years, since the clause does not specifically state how may
            barriers should be tested.

            The condition in the Safety Certificate requires a fifth of the
            barriers to be tested each year and all barriers to be tested
            in a 5 year period. This could be taken as being in excess of
            the "Guide" requirements by a considerable margin.

            The theory of this argument is further supported by the wording
            of item 7 of Annex C of the "Guide", where it states that a
            record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails tested
            - Not all barriers and handrails when tested.

Para. 262   My understanding is that both the police and Fire Authorities
            accepted the size of the pitch perimeter gates and that the
            matter was not left to the discretion of the Club.

Para. 264   The consideration only of protecting the sanctity of the pitch
            is an unjustified criticism. As far back as February 1979, the
            existance of the perimeter gates were discussed in the minutes
            of the Officer Working Party and found to be satisfactory.

Paras.      The matters raised in these paragraphs have been covered in
266 & 267   other parts of this memorandum.

Para. 286   The conments regarding the effects of the 1981 and 1985
            alterations and their effect on the Safety Certificate have
            been conmented on previously in this memorandum.

Para. 287   These so called breaches of the Green Guide are not accepted
            and should be refuted - particularly the gradient of the
            tunnel.
                                   - 9 -



Para. 288   The criticism here is unjustified. The carments regarding the
            removal of barrier 144 are considered incorrect.

Para. 291   It is argued that the alterations on the terraces did not
            clearly effect capacities.

Para. 293   The Club failed to make any written request to remove barrier
            144, and did not receive any written consent to do so.

Para. 313   Although hindsight has allowed many to make a detailed
            appraisal of this area of the Stadium, it is contended that the
            Green Guide and particularly the rules for assessment of
            capacities have been applied in Sheffield in a professional
            manner.


                       CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS

Items 3,5,12,19,22 & 25    Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield should be
                           substituted for the many versions of his name in
                           these items.

Item 17                    It has not been proven that the barrier 124A
                           collapsed at this time. - See paragraph 75 of
                           the Interim Report.

Civil Claims - Hillsborough

The Solicitors acting for our Insurers on the above matter have asked that we
identify all observations in the interim Taylor Report with which we
particularly disagree.

I enclose a copy of the Report in which I have already marked the passages
with which I presume we would disagree.  I should be grateful if you could
confirm whether they are any other passages you would disagree with or if
there are any I have marked with which you would not disagree.

The Solicitors have also requested our detailed observations upon the findings
of the Report and I should therefore be grateful to receive any comments you
have as soon as possible.

The Plaintiffs have also prepared a chronology of events, copy enclosed, on
which our observations are sought. The only comment I have is that paragraph
17 does not accord with our view nor with the view expressed with Lord Justice
Tavlor in paragraph 75 of his Report. JLf vou have any comments, please let: me
know but as far as I am aware, in all other respects, the Local Authority has
to relv on evidence given at the oral hearing and not. from our own knowledge.

I l o o k f o r wa rd t o h e a r i n g from you a s s oo n a s p o s s i b l e .

Dear Sirs,

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

As you are aware, there is litigation now in progress arising out of death
and injury caused to people who were in pens 3 and 4. Further litigation
is anticipated involving other principles to be tested.

It is proposed that there will be an early hearing of a number of test cases.
The dates anticipated for the hearing will be in April 1990.  Naturally,
this means that there is a very tight time-table to be adhered to.

Shortly, there will be a pre-trial review before Mr. Justice Rose in Manchester.
At that hearing consideration will be given to the status of the Report of
the Taylor Inquiry and of the Inquiry Transcript.

The Judge who heard the initial interlocutory applications has indicated that
he hopes the parties would agree

(a)   that the Report of the Taylor Inquiry be put before the Trial Judge as
part of the evidence to which he might have regard in relation to the Inquiry's
findings of the primary facts, with liberty to each party to lead contrary
evidence at trial on any disputed fact and

(b)   that the transcript of the proceedings of the Inquiry be admitted at
Trial as a true record of what was said at the Inquiry;   the parties should be
prepared to agree to submit before Trial a list of those findings of       fact
contained in the Inquiry Report which were to be contested at Trial.

We would be most grateful therefore if you could carefully re-consider the Taylor
Report and let us have your detailed observations upon its findings,
particularly identifying all observations with which you particularly disagree.

The Judge also required that a Chronology of Events be prepared by the
Plaintiff's Solicitors with comments in the righ-hand margin by the Defendants.
A Chronology has been prepared and a copy of it is enclosed.   It would help us
if you could let us have your observations on each of those matters in the right-hand
column.

response.

                         driven by PC Buxton, fitted with a
                         loadspeaker to be sent to the scene.

1445 hrs           Crowd outside had reached over 5000
                   people.  PC Buxton requested kick off be

                   ticket.  About 150 people entered.

1452 hrs           Murray asked Duckinsfield if he was going
                   to open the gate and gate C was opened
                   wide, on Duckinfield's order.

                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - LEGAL ACTION

                 As  you may    or  may  not  recall,   it  has been agreed between the
                 representatives for the various Defendants and the Claimants in this
                 matter that there be two "test" actions and, in this regard, I enclose
                 for your information and attention a copy Writ and Statement of Claim
                 which has been passed to me by the Solicitors acting on behalf of
                 Municipal Mutual which, of course, will be the subject of detailed
                 meetings between ourselves and the Insurers.

                 Accordingly, my purpose at this stage in copying the document to you
                 is first of all to ensure that you are fully aware of this matter and
                 secondly to draw your attention to pages 16 and 17 which sets out the
                 particulars of alleged negligence, so far as the Authority is concerned
                 and in particular to draw your attention to the extent of those areas
                 of alleged negligence by the Authority in comparison with those alleged
                 first of all against the Police, (quite obviously), secondly the Club
                 and,  equally importantly,  the Club's Advisers,   namely Eastwood and
                 Partners.

                 Whilst the Authority has quite clearly to deal with the criticisms made
                 of it,and proposals in this regard are already well underway in the
                 form of detailed reports, I believe the enclosed document does, in effect,
                 underline the points made previously by both myself and Liz Bashforth
                 that it is important in all these matters not to lose sight of the issue
                 of causation, in that whilst in no way seeking to minimise the criticisms
                 made against the Authority, the point will have to be made in due course,
                 that although they are regretable and require action they did not
                 contribute substantially to the disaster which occurred.
                                                                  L   ___

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY
FINANCE AND GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE - 24 AUGUST 1990
CHARGES FOR POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES AND OTHER SPECIAL EVENTS
Joint report of the Clerk and Financial Officer and Chief
Constable

1.    Matter for Consideration
      The Authority’s policy on charging for the policing of
      special events, with specific reference to the policing o f
      Football Matches.
      (This report replaces the one submitted to the meeting of the
      Authority on 3 August. It provides a fuller explanation of
      the current basis of charging and generally updates the
      information previously supplied).
2.    Current Policy
2.1   The present contract with the Football Clubs in South
      Yorkshire for the payment for Police services is based on
      official crowd size figures calculated by each Club, and
      published after individual matches. The number of officers
      for which charges are levied bears no resemblance to the
      actual number of officers on duty at the match, or those on
      duty inside the ground. Appendix A shows the table used to
      calculate charges to the Clubs.
2.2 Many situations could be identified to show why this system
    is unrealistic, but one example is given below:-
           On 30th September 1989 Sheffield Wed. played
           Coventry City - not a contentious game with only
           a small "away" following present. The official
           gate was 15,054.
           Using the scale of charges, the Club were invoiced
           for 1. Inspector, 4. Sergeants and 29. Constables
           at a total charge of £2,688.30. The actual number
           of Officers inside the ground totalled 185. At
           Special Service rates the total charge would have
           been approximately £14,652. The actual cost of the
           Officers on duty was £6,780.
2.3 The estimated total value of Policing all league matches in
    South Yorkshire at the Special Services rate of £19.12p per
    hour (for a Constable) for the 1989/90 season totalled £1.5m,
    of which £1.2m is for Officers on duty inside the ground.
   Actual charges made for the same period totalled
   approximately £0.25m. Appendix B to this report summarizes
   the position for each Club.
4 From Appendix B it can be seen that charges made to the Clubs
  during 1989/90 represented approximately 20% of the
  recommended ACPO rates. As indicated above this "discount"
  arose from the difference between the number of officers
  charges for and those on duty.
   Recent Recommendations
1 Home Office Circular
   A Draft Home Office Circular on the subject of Charges for
   Policing Football Matches (Appendix E), states that realistic
   charges should be made in order to "recover the full costs of
   all Police Officers deployed to duties solely within the
   ground at football matches." The Circular adds that a "more
   businesslike approach" should be made to such charges.
2 Audit Commission Report
  A recent District Auditors draft report on football charges
  (Appendix F) advises that:-
   a)   Charges to Clubs should be adequate to cover the cost
         of providing Police services inside football grounds.
  b)    The full cost of providing services at special events,
         including football matches, should be recovered by the
         Forces charge out rates.
3 Lord Justice Taylors Report
  The report by Lord Justice Taylor, following his inquiry into
  the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, includes a recommendation
  that Police Authorities should review charges made to Clubs
  for Policing inside football grounds "so as to ensure that
  realistic charges are made" (Appendix G).
4 ACPO Sub-Committee Report
  An ACPO Sub-Committee has carried out a review of charging
  policies, and their report will recommend that charges for
  Policing football matches are calculated with a view to
  recovering the full cost of the operation as so far as the
  law allows. The proposed national rate is £20.41 per hour
  for a constable.
Applying the ACPO recommendations to the new deployment
patterns would produce the following increases in charges for
1990/91.
Club                  Charges 1989/90 ACPO - 1990/91      %
                           (£000)         (£000)       Increase
Sheffield   Utd.             74              379        367
Sheffield   Wed.             74              389        380
Barnsley                     49              211        298
Rotherham   Utd.             34              170        359
Doncaster   Rov.             22               92        283
                            253             1,241        350

Football Clubs can reclaim a proportion of their charges for
Police services from the Football Trust. Appendix H provides
brief details of the scheme. The figures also show (based on
1988/89 data) the charges paid by the five South Yorkshire
Clubs relative to those paid by other Clubs.
Proposals For Deployment - Season 1990/91
From the beginning of the football season all matches will be
categorised into three groups, according to the Policing
requirements. Each Club in South Yorkshire will have its
fixtures categorised either A, B, or C matches in line with
the practice adopted nationwide. Matches grouped under
category A will be those of a more contentious nature and
where larger attendances are anticipated, eg. local derbies,
matches against top clubs or matches against Clubs with a
history of crowd trouble. Category B and C matches represent
lower risks.
The number of Officers to be deployed for each category match
has been determined separately for each Club using the vast
operational experience of Divisional Commanders, and Senior
Uniformed Officers within each Division, in consultation with
football ground officials. The numbers of Officers required,
inside and outside the ground, has been established with
consideration given to:-
a)     The Taylor Report (and the additional reserve to be
       deployed inside the ground).
b)     Officers working on the perimeter track (bearing in mind
       the removal of some perimeter fences).
c)     Officers working within the ground and on the turnstiles
       immediately outside the ground.
d)     Local conditions.
It should be pointed out that the number of Officers   to be
deployed (as outlined in Appendix C) does not differ   greatly
from the number deployed in previous years. However,   the
number of Officers for which Clubs are to be charged   should
greatly increase.

Benefits of Hatch Categorisation
The manpower requirements for all football matches can be
calculated at the beginning of the season. Certain matches,
however, may require upgrading or downgrading as the season
progresses depending upon factors at the time, eg. contender
for promotion.
Charges to the Clubs can be more accurately calculated, and
more closely related to the actual number of Officers on duty
inside the ground.
Football Clubs will be able to budget more accurately for
Policing costs (once a charging policy has been established).
Should the situation arise where a "special" match (such as a
semi-final) is to be played in South Yorkshire, an individual
contract can be drawn up based on similar criteria as the A,B
and C categorisation system.
Future Charging Policy
Charges have been calculated for the 1990/91 season based on
the manpower proposals for officers inside the ground as
outlined in Appendix C, and on charge rates as recommended by
ACPO (£20.41 per hour per constable). Details of the charges
for each Club are shown in Appendix D.
In view of the size of the increase implied over the charges
actually levied in the 1989/90 season additional columns show
the charges which would result from applying discounts of 25%
and 50%. The overall charge with a 50% discount is close to
the estimated wages cost as shown in Appendix B. The actual
charges shown for 1989/90 represented a discount of almost
80%.
7.   Recommendations
     Members are recommended:
     (a) To note the introduction of the new deployment patterns
         based on the categorisation of matches.
     (b)   To adopt a future charging policy based on the full
           recovery of the costs of all officers chargeable in
           accordance with Section 15 of the Police Act 1964.
     (c) To approve an interim charging policy based on a move
         towards recovering costs at full ACPO rates over a 3-5
         year period.
     (d)   To indicate the level of charges to be sought for
           policing football matches in the 1990/91 season by
           reference to the national rates proposed by ACPO but
           having regard to the charges levied in 1989/90.
     (e) To authorise the Clerk and Financial Officer in
         conjunction with the Chief Constable to conclude
         agreements with the football clubs forthwith for the
         charges to be made during the forthcoming season and for
          the phased introduction of the full recovery of costs.

Dear Sir

H0K2 CTriCZ CIRCULAR NO         /1990

CHARG2S TOR POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES


1.   Lord Justice      Taylor's      report    on    his   inquiry into the
**   s-c.-wrr. stadium disaster .recommended (Recommendation 52 )
that:

         ■rc“-ce Auwhcriuies should review the charges they make to
        c.urs for the costs of policing inside grounds sc as to
        ensure tnat realistic charges are aade.               The Home Office
        sr.culd take   steps    to    ensure    consistency        of practice,
        subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to
        local circumstances."


2.   The reasoning behind this           recommendation was given in
paragraph 210 of the report:



     "The temptation to the clubs to leave it all to the police
     is stronger if they are not recuired to sake realistic
     payment    for    police   services.           No   charge    is aade       for
     officers outside the ground since maintaining law and order
     ir. the streets is a ncraai p-rlir rur.cticr. cf the polios.
     At the present tiae, the practice as to recovering costs cf
     policing Inside the grounds from ciufcs varies greatly from
     place to place, different formulae being used.            In scae
     areas, the charge aade is the actual cost of the officers
     attending in the ground.               At others, it is aade cn a
     sliding scale, dependent on whether the match is category
     A (high risk), 3 or C.          At others, it is dependent cn the
     size of the crowd attending.             At soae, it appears to be
     entirely arbitrary and at one grour.c it is said to be nil.
     Tn •aiv view a more consistent ar.d businesslike approach
     should be made to such charges. If clubs were to find it
     acre    econoaical        to recruit    efficient stewards than to
     delegate duties to the police, there could be a significant
      reduction in the nuaier of police deployed at football
      grounds, to the benefit of the coaaunity at large.”


The statutory p os i t i o n
3.    Section 15(1)      of the Police Act 1S64 provides that "the
chief officer of police of any police force Bay provide, at the
request of any person, special police services at any preaises
or in any locality in the police area for which the force is
maintained, subject to the payment to the police authority of
charges on such scales as aay be determined by that authority".


4.     The expression "special police services” is not defined in
section 15 and must be given its natural meaning.           This is that
 scecial services are services which would not, in the absence of
 V.




arrangements under section 15, be provided in pursuance of the
general cuzies of the police to preserve law and order.


5.         Safety certificates are required for stadia designated by
the Secretary of Stats under section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975.           They are issued by local authorities and
contain such rules and conditions as the local authority consider
necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety at the ground.
Where        certificates   require   the   holder   to   arrange   for 'the
atter.dar.es of an adequate nuaber of police officers within the
crour.c, the extent cf the provision of police services must,
under section 2 of the 1975 Act asaaended, be reserved for the
determination of the chief of'ficer of police of the force in

question.


 The view cf central Government

 6.         It has been the view of successive Governments since 1963
 ■that the costs of special services should be paid in full by
 those using the service and that no part of these costs should
 be allowed to add to the general level of police expenditure and
 thus to the burdens of taxpayers or ratepayers.             Charges should
 be reviewed and adjusted as necessary - at least annually.              The
  aim in principle should be to recover the full cost of those
  police officers who are deployed at football matches solely

  within the ground.


                ar.d deployment policies

      7.    If the full ccst is to be recovered, there must be a direct
the acre the club should have to pay.          Under present cha-„ing

policies this is net always the case.


8.         Ore reason for this may te that a force charges only for the
number cf officers mentioned in an agreement aade with the club.
However, if the chief officer of police considers it necessary,
because cf the nature of the match or the reputation of the
visiting supporters, to deploy inside the ground mere officers
than such an agreement provides for, no extra charge is made.
This practice should be reviewed viand any agreements snoulc
specifically provide for special circumstances calling for the

derloymer.z cf more officers than usual.


 9.        Other forces determine charges on the basis of a fixed
 formula.        Where the same formula is used for both charging and
 deployment,       the   economic cost is recovered.     But where the
 charging formula bears no relation to deployment (e.g. because
 deployment is based on the chief officer’s assessment of the
 need whereas charges are based on 2 constables - with supervising
 officers t>tp rata - per 1000 of actual attendance), charges are
 likely to fall some way short of recovering the full economic

 costs.


 l^cal cony*derations
     10.    As Lord Justice Taylor acknowledged, local circumstances
     canr.cz be ignored and charging policies must leave score for
      a.        The nature and location of the ground and the standaro
                cf     physical    aids     to    crowd     control   are    major
                considerations in determining the number cf officers
                to be deployed inside the ground. Facilities are.often
                poorest at the grounds of clubs who are least able to

                 pay the full economic cost.of policing.


      b.         The financial plight of many clubs cannot be lightly
                 dismissed.       Asking clubs to pay unrealistically high
                 charges    for policing         could lead to problems with
                 recovering dept and even to bankruptcy.


11.    There are, however, steps'which the poorer clubs could take
to help themselves.               In particular, more, and better trainee,
stewards would help to reduce the policing requirement.                      Manning
gates,          directing    spectators     to    the     correct   areas,   keeping
gangways clear and monitoring the density of packing in pens and
enclosures are all mentioned by Lord Justice Taylor as examples
of duties which could be carried out by suitable, properly

trained stewards.


pftgonmer.dation
12.        Police      authorities    and    chief      officers    of police    ere

therefore advised that:
           a.     The aim in principle should be to recover the full
                     costs of all police officers deployed to duties solely

                     within the ground at football matches.
           there is a direct link between deployment and charges.


   c.   In cases where it      would clearly be unrealistic to
           xequire a club to   meet the full costs of policing
           Inside the ground, local discretion aav be exercised
           to reduce the scale of charges.


   d.   it should, however,     be aade.clear in such cases that
           the club will be expected to take active steps (eg the
           provision cf acre effective stewarding arrangements)
           to reduce the levels, of policing needed inside the
           ground.


. An additional copy of this circular is enclosed for the
easurer.

     EXTRACTS FROM LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S FINAL REPORT ON THE

                  HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


Costs of Police and Stewards
Paragraph 210. The temptation to the clubs to leave it all to the
police is stronger if they are not required to make realistic
payment for police services. No charge is made for officers
outside the ground since maintaining law and order in the streets
is a normal public function of the police. At the present time,
the practice as to recovering costs of policing inside the grounds
from clubs varies greatly from place to place, different formulae
being used. In some areas, the charge made is the actual cost of
the officers attending in the ground. At others, it is made on a
sliding scale dependent on whether the match is category A (high-
risk) B or C. At others it is dependent on the size of the crowd
attending. At some, it appears to be entirely arbitrary and at
one ground it is said to be nil. In my view a more consistent and
businesslike approach should be made to such charges. If clubs
were to find it more economical to recruit efficient stewards than
to delegate duties to the police, there could be a significant
reduction in the number of police deployed at football grounds to
the benefit of the community at large. If this is to happen,
stewards must be fit, active and robust. I would suggest they
should be between the ages of 18 and 55. They must also be fully
trained. Some clubs presently have efficient stewards whom they
recruit individually and train fully with the assistance of the
police. Others hire security firms to bring in a well-trained
team of stewards.

Final Recommendations
Paragraph 53. Police authorities should review the charges they
make to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so as tp
ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home Office should
take steps to ensure consistency of practice, subject to local
discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE FINANCE AND GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE REGARDING CHARGES
FOR POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES AND OTHER SPECIAL EVENTS

RESOLVED - That it be recommended to the Police Authority that:
1    The introduction of new deployment patterns based on the categorization of
     matches be noted.
2    The future charging policy be based on the full recovery of the costs of all
     officers chargeable in accordance with Section 15 of the Police Act 1964.
3    The Chief Constable be asked to consult each club on the numbers of officers
     to be deployed inside the ground for each match category.
4    The charge for each officer so deployed for the forthcoming season be based
     on 50% of the rate recommended by ACPO - a charge which approximates to the
     estimated wages cost.
5    The Clerk and Financial Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Constable be
     authorised to conclude agreements with the Football Clubs forthwith for the
     changes to be made during the forthcoming season and for the phased
     introduction of the full recovery of costs.

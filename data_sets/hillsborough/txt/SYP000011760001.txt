Dear Sir,
     Following a telephone conversation with Superintendent Ian Shaw of
Keighley Police Station, West Yorkshire, it was suggested that we should
contact you to see if you can use our services.
     We are experienced in both stress and bereavement councelling and
have worked with victims of the Bradford City Fire. We are acutely aware
of the long term needs of such people and also have experience of
establishing support for counsellors coping with long term clients.
     Should you feel that we could be of assistance to you please do not
hesitate to contact either             at the above address or
on Leeds
     Yours fa~i thfallv.

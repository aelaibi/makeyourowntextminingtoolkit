             I am a Police Sergeant               in the South Yorkshire Poli ce at present

            At 10.00am          (1000)     on Saturday,        15 April,       1989 (150489)       I attended at

             the H i11sbo r ou g h F o o t ball St a d ium wh & re a s up ervis o ry bri ef ing

             subsequently took place               in the North stand in respect of the above

             named football match.                1 later briefed serial               12 (ten Police

            Constables)          for which I was          responsible        for their particular duties,

            viz; Patrol          the    lower    concourse of the North stand.

            P e n is t o n e R oa d .

            At phase three the              instructions were to prevent fans from leaving the

            North stand via Penistone Road and direct them to leave by way of

            L.e p p i n g s L.a n e „

            From the above time until the kick off time at 3.00pm                                (1500)     1 kept

            within the boundary of the North stand and did not prior to that time

            have occasion to observe the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

            Shortly after kick off time,                   a matter       of a few minutes,         I found it

            necessary to move from the lower concourse of the^North stand,                                     down a

            ramp which separates                the North stand from the Spion Hop,                  and which

ultimately         gives access              to the football               pitch.         Upon      looking out onto

the    playing a r e a           I saw that          the m a t c h was        in progress.

However,       looking           over    to the L a p p i n g s         Lane end of the ground                  it was

clear     that     some      sort       of    incident was             taking      place.        A number of fans

were    running          on the     playing area                behind and at           the    side    of the goal

mouth.        Al m o s t    immediately             I n o t i c e d a senior Police                 officer     running
                            A
onto    the    playing area,                 trying       to attract        the a t t e n t i o n of the         referee.

The m a t ch was           ha l t e d almost         immediately,           an d after         some    co n f u s i o n the

players were             e s co rt ed from the             pitch.         My first        i mpression was            that

large     scale      f i g hting was           taking       place amon g s t           the L i verpool         fans.           I

immediately          left        the a r e a of the N o r t h stand and                    ran across          the

playing a r e a to the L e p p i n g s Lane                      end of the         ground.          Whe n    X reached

that    se ct i o n of the          ground          it became          apparent        that a public           order

incident        of a di f f e r e n t         nature was           taking     place.          The L e p p i n g s Lane

terrace,        in the          area behind the goal                   m o u t h was    extremely        congested

and    panic     had set          in amongst          the       crowd,     p a r t i c u l a r l y at the      front

where     a large          number were o b vi ou sl y               in distress.              The    crowd was so

packed that          it was        impossible             for the       persons at the              front     of the

terrace,-      and       behind the wire mesh,                    to move.         A number          of Police

o f f icers were a c t u a l l y standing                   on the top of the wire                    fencing,

pulling       fans       over and onto              the    playing        area and        perimeter          track.        A

number      of fans were            lying          on the       pitch s e r i o u s l y    injured.           Same    of

them were        u n c o n scious.            As    I looked onto            the    terrace         from the     pitch             1

r ealised that             it was       desperate          to    remove as many fans as                  possible

from the front              of    the    terrace.           To the        right of the           c o ngested area

was a narrow             'sterile*           corridor.           The    narrow section had a door at

the    front a l l ow in g access                  onto    the     playing area.              This    sterile area

was    s ep ar a t e d     from the          right    of the        congested a rea by a metal                   fence.

I went      into     this are a and began to                       pull    persons        from the       crowd       into

the sterile          a r e a a n d then direct                  them thro u g h the           door at the front

                                                                                                                   R4S5

and onto        the    playing area.                It was     e x t r e m e l y d i fficult         to    pull

persons       over     the    fence       because      they were           so tightly          packed;,

p ar t i c ul ar ly at       the front,             I remember       one man saying              to me as          I

pulled him over              the    top    "There's         people        dead    in there".              It was

impossible        to see          into the     crowd,        c ommunicate with an y o n e                  or get          into

the    con g e s t e d a r e a     behind the goal.               I had been issued wit h a radio

a nd   earpiece        but    the     noise was        so    loud that           I c o u l d n ’t hear anything

over    the     radio,       or    be h e a r d .     I con t i n u e d       to get     people out          by the

s ideways       route.        I have       no concept          of time.           Numb e r s were          still       being

p ulled over          the fence at the front                   of the         terrace     by Police          officers

standing        on the wire.              After a time           I noti c e d the body of a man                        lying

on the floor at              the extreme            front    of the        terrace,       over       to the       right

hand side as           one    observes       from the          pitch.         The     conge s t i o n slowly

began to subside,                 a l t ho ug h the    feeling M/as still                one    of    panic.           1

managed       to j ump over           the dividing           fence and find my way to this man.

Tire person was          h e a v i l y built and            lying        parallel      to the steps.               His

face was        blue an d his          eyes were         open.           I i mmediately         formed       the

i m pression that            he was dead.             I gave      him m o u t h to m o u t h          resus c i t a t i o n

wi thout      success ,           I I ooked t o my          r ig h t .     Pa 1 ;ice and f arts a 1 i k e were

pulling       down the wire            fencing        i m m e d i a t e l y behind       the goal          in order          to

get    people     out.        As    I looked along             the wall          at   the front           of the

terrace       I was     shocked        to see        large     numbers         of bodies        lying on top of

each other,           two and       three deep.             It was        i m m e d iately     n oticeable         that

none    of them was moving.                  They were all               at    the foot        of the wire

fence.        I saw anot h e r         male,    a younger           person        lying on the             terrace a

few feet away.               I made my way to him.                   He a p p e a r e d      to be        in his

thirties.         Again       his     face was        blue and eyes              open.       1 a p p l i e d mouth to

m o u t h but    there was          no doubt        that     he was        dead.       It was my opinion

that    these     people          had been dead for             some       considerable          time,       taken         in

context w i t h the           incident.         The wire          fence at the front                  had been
                                                                                                                        PAGE         4

  *    *    partly     torn down.            Fans were        tearing        down the a d v e r t i s i n g     hoarding        to

            be used as         stretchers.              I m o v e d further along the terrace to the

            right and saw             bodies placed further up the terracing,                          away      from    the

            b o u n d a r y wall      at     the front.        One     of them had a coat           placed over          his

            head.      T o g e th er w i th        another     officer        I attempted        r e s u s c i t a t i o n on a

           young      boy.      I     called for oxygen but none was                      readily available.

           After      a time we m an a g e d            to get him onto           the    pitch w here a Doctor was

            present.         O x y g e n was a pp l i ed but          the Doctor         p r onounced him dead.               As

            I have     stated,        I have       no    concept      of t i m e .      It a p p e a r e d that oxygen

  _        was a Iona time arriving.                       H o w e v e r , I am      certain that       the     boy was

            dead    prior      to the arrival             of the Police.

            Wh i l s t all     this was         going on a great             deal     of abuse was         being    hurled

            at t i'ie Po 1 i ce f r om Liver poo 1 f ans , both on the te r race but                              i n t he

            onto     the    pitch.         This was done         quic k l y     once access        could* be gained

            t hro u g h the wire           fencing and s u f f i c i e n t        numbers     had been          removed from

            the     terracing.         A    large amount         of    personal         property was        littered all

            terracing        behind        the goal.        This      had been broken at             the    base and

            lying     flat     on the       steps.        Whilst      the    paint was       rela t i v e l y   new,    the

            metal     was    rusted and          corroded t h e        whole way through,               I remained at

            the Leppi n g s Lane            end of the ground until                   such times as         the whole

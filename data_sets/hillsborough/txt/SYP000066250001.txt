                of the F.A. Cup between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on the 15th

               April   1989.

                    go to the toilet.      We got   into Sheffield at about     lunch time.        We

                    parked the cars near to the ground in a side street.              I d o n ’t remember

                    the name of it.      We ate our sandwiches sitting       on the   car and when we

                    finished them we went to look for a pub for a drink.              We^-erventual ly
    A - - ~^
       ey ^ ni      found one open on top of a hill       called the Whi ta I^k5rs e .    It was about

                    quarter of a mile away from the ground,          Gary had two pint s h a n d y ’s
^      o       o
                    and I had 3 pints of lager.       We had our drink and we then went to the

                    ground.     We got into the ground at about 2>^5pnvand Gary,          me and

                              walked down the tunnel 1 to p\(         We all stood together near

                    to the rear of yne terrace.       We took our position in the stand at

                    about £T5u0fri     It was very packed but no more than at any other game                    I

                    have attended.      We had only been there a matter of minutes when I

                    started to get crushed and pushed forward towards the goals.               We got

                    separated after the crush started and be ing pushed forwarded.                 Dut'f'i ng

                    the time    I was being pushed forward I suddenly felt a sh^r j^/sur ge

                    which lasted about 20 seconds.       I nearly tripped up when this happened,.

                    I got   pushed right to the front.      I had lost contact with Gary^smd

                                 this time.   When the surge had subsided and I got some                room

                    I climbed over the fence onto the pitch.          I walked around looking for

           . aSX.   people who I k n e w , when I saw Gary.      He was   lying to the left of          the

               i    goals     in f ront of pen 4 on the floor.    There was two poli cewomen            with

            ^       I pulled it off and saw it was Gary and the two policewomen said                    they

                    had been trying to revive him for 20 minutes.            I told the two

                    policewomen to go and help someone who could be helped and I would

                    stay with Gary.      1 stayed with Gary and after a while a policeman and

                    a gang of supporters      put Gary onto a piece of hoarding and carried him

                    to the gym inside the ground.       I waited there for a few minutes and I

                    then helped to carry Gary into the g y m .J I later identified Gary to

             Further to my previous statement dated 5th May 1989                               (050589).

             On 29th July 1989 (290789),                    I was shown two Photographic Prints by

             Sergeants Killoch and

                      (Ref           k1/16)      (Exh           )

                      (Ref     '     /1/34)
                                     '           (Exh           )

             The man shown lying on a yellow coloured ^Qvertising hoarding and

             indicated by a coloured dot marked                       ”4 8 ’ /is Gary C o l l i n s .   I am not

             shown on the photograph but would h a v y been nearby when the                               photograph

             was taken.

             The two policewomen that are showt/ in the photographs are the same two

             that      I refer to in my original ^statement.

             I have      indicated on a sketch plan of Leppings Lane Terraces                             the

             approximate           position in Pen 3 where I last, saw Gary alive.                       At thi.■

     ?                                                            S 1051A

             point we would have been standing together.             I then lost sight

             of Gary following a sharp surge.

             I have      indicated Gary's    position with a red dot and have signed this

             sketch plan (Ref HJC/1)         (Exh      ).

             I    have also indicated on       a sketch plan of   the pitch,   the   approximate

             position      at which Gary was    lying when I found him    on the      pitch.   This

             would be the same position at which the two photographs                 previously

             mentioned were t a k e n .

             I have      indicated G a r y ’s position with a blue dot and have signed the

             sketch plan <Ref HJC/2)         (Exh      )

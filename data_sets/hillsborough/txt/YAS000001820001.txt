___________________states :

1.   I was born on 24th April, 1935.       I live at _____________

                1 Sheffield

2.   I hold the position of Leading Ambulanceman.      I am based at

     Batemoor Station in Sheffield.        I joined the Ambulance

     Service in December,     1958 as a Driver Attendant, and was
     based at Corporation Street, Sheffield.

3.   Batemoor Station was the first Station to be built      and owned

     away from the main Depot in Corporation Street.            I was

     based at Batemoor from the opening of the Station,which I

     believe was approximately 17 or 18 years ago.       I became a

     Leading Ambulanceman whilst based at Batemoor, approximately
     10 years ago.        Following   my appointment    as   Leading

     Ambulanceman, I attended at the Regional Training School at
     Ratby Lane in Leicester,    and also at Fairfield Training

     School at Rotherham.     These were both supervisory courses

     for Leading Ambulancemen.    I have no paramedic training.
4.   On Saturday 15th April, 1989, my shift for the day was 1400

     hours to 2200 hours.      I travelled from home to Batemoor

     Station,   leaving home at approximately 1. 15 p.m.           On

     arrival at Batemoor Station,     I established what vehicles

     would be available for the afternoon shift.       My call sign
     for that day was Sierra 306.        I would prepare for the

     afternoon shift by completing all paperwork necessary prior

     to commencement of duties, and would also establish what

     vehicles would be used on the nightshift.     I was driver for
     this particular day and was also responsible for all booking
out times.

Sometime after 2 p.m., I put my own first aid kit into the

ambulance, which included some protective clothing.      I also

checked all equipment inside the ambulance vehicle, which

was all working properly.      I then carried on with my normal

Leading Ambulanceman duties in the office.
Sometime after 2 p.m., we received a call from Control to

take an admission patient into Netheridge Hospital           in

Sheffield.        While transferring the patient on to the

Cavendish Ward at Netheridge Hospital, at approximately

3.   10 p.m., one of the patients was watching television at

the side of his bed.        Upon glancing at the television
screen, I noticed a football stadium with a large number of
supporters spilling on to the pitch.      I asked the gentleman

who was watching television what was happening.            The

gentleman did not know where the trouble was occurring, but

asked me if I was aware of any football match being played

in Sheffield.      I said that a semi-final was taking place at
Hillsborough, although at this point in time I was still not

certain that the incident of crowds spilling on to the pitch

was taking place at Hillsborough.         My attendant, ______

                ', and I returned to our ambulance vehicle,
together with cot which was loaded onto the vehicle.        At

this moment, we heard on the vehicle radio that ambulances
were being directed to Hillsborough and that there was a
Major Incident taking place.       We established contact with

Control as quickly as possible,       there being some initial
difficulties presumably because of the number of crews
transmitting at the same time.            Upon making contact with

Control,      we   informed    them    of our    location    and were

immediately despatched to Penistone Road,             where I drove

directly to.       I recall proceeding along Infirmary Road with
a police car behind me with its emergency lights flashing.

I carried on along Middlewood Road with the intention of
turning into Park View Road in order               to link up with

Penistone Road.       However, at the junction of Park View Road

and Leppings Lane,          I noticed a large volume of police

officers at that point, who directed me on to Leppings Lane.
At this point in time, neither myself or                    were aware

of what had happened.         On travelling down Leppings Lane, I

came    across a large mass of people,            including police,
directing us into the grounds through the entrance at point
A marked on the plan.           After driving through a mass of

people, I immediately saw numerous casualties on both sides
of perimeter road which is within the boundary of the

football stadium.        I drive slowly through two lines of

casualties and then stopped the ambulance at a point marked

B on the attached plan.         Both            and I got out of the

vehicle immediately.           As I walked to the rear of the

vehicle I immediately started to assess an unconscious

casualty on the ground.                The police were present in
numbers.      My attendant began treating another casualty at

the    same   time,   and    it was quite       apparent    that both

casualties required immediately hospital treatment.             I also
     specifically recall one hysterical supporter shouting that

     "they are all dead in there".        I pulled out the nearside

     cot from its securing brackets and placed it in a position
     to allow the casualty being treated by my attendant to be

     put onto the cot.      The casualty was placed immediately on

     to the vehicle.     I recall asking an uninjured person,        I

     believe a supporter, to keep an eye on the patient in the

     ambulance.   My attendant and I then took out the other cot

     over to the casualty I had initially treated.       Assisted by

     police,             and   I placed   the   casualty,    who   was
     unconscious but breathing, on to the cot.         As we turned

     preparing to place this casualty on to the ambulance,

     another casualty had been put into the ambulance by a group
     of supporters.      I believe that this person was semiÂ­

     conscious.   I told the group who had placed the casualty on

     to the ambulance to place him on the floor between the two

     cot positions.    They did so, and I slipped a blanket under
     this patient's head.      The other patient on the second cot

     was lifted over my head by                 and the police,    and

     secured in position.

8.   The ambulance was virtually full.      We immediately operated

     a resuscitator in order to inflate the lungs of a casualty,

     and          began to alternate between one of the patients
     on the cot and the casualty on the floor.              The third

     casualty was placed on a freeflow oxygen unit.          As I got

     out of the ambulance to close the rear doors, someone began

     pulling at my clothes, asking me to look at a casualty on



                                 362.
      the opposite side of a nearby wall.       I went over to this

      injured person, whose face was pressed into the ground.       I

      quickly put him in to the "coma position", and established

      that he was breathing, and told his friend or relative to
      keep him in the coma position, and informed him that help

      would be coming shortly.        It was a dreadful feeling to
      leave this fourth casualty,      but there were already three

      severely injured casualties on board my ambulance.
9.    When I got back to the ambulance, I noticed another group of

      supporters around an injured person who was holding his
      shoulder,   or possibly covering up chest injuries.        They

      were obviously trying to get him onto my ambulance.      A lot

      of shouting was taking place, and the group were appealing

      for help for this casualty.      I spoke to the injured person
      and asked him if he would be able to sit in the attendant's

      seat in the cab of the ambulance (as           |was in the back

      of the ambulance), and he assured me that he would be able

      to sit in the ambulance.        Although I realise that this

      casualty was in deep shock, he was helped into the cab and I

      attached a seat belt around him.

10.   At this point in time I still had no idea how the injuries

      had been caused to the Liverpool supporters.     I also recall
      that the same supporter who had been shouting hysterically

      when we had arrived at the ground was still in hysterics,
      shouting things like "does the world know what happening".

11.   I then got into the driver's seat and started to move off
      along the perimeter road in the direction arrowed in red.



                                 M3
     At the same time I tried to contact Control on probably four

     or five occasions on the vehicle radio,      but was unsure

    whether I had got through to Control as I received no

     acknowledgment.    I was able to gain access inside the

    ground behind the South Stand relatively easily despite the

    presence of large numbers of supporters.    I am sure at this
    point in time that I saw another ambulance vehicle at point

    C.    I turned left on to Penistone Road at point D and was

    then ushered by lines of police officers up to point E,

    where I saw two ambulances turning left on to Herries Road
    South with a police escort in front.       I turned right and

    become the third vehicle in the line of ambulances.      I took

    the ambulance immediately to the Casualty Department at

    Northern General Hospital.    As I arrived at casualty,       I

    noticed a number of ambulances leaving the casualty area,
    presumably going straight back to Hillsborough.      As soon as

    we had come to a stop outside casualty, and got out of the

    ambulance to open the rear doors, there were already present

    teams of medical staff waiting to receive the casualties.

    I helped to life all three patients in the back of the

    ambulance on to hospital trolleys, and            and I took in
    one of the casualties and handed them over to medical staff.
12 . We then returned to the ambulance and we placed on board

    both cots and I got back into the driver's seat.      I believe

             radioed Control, and we were requested to proceed
    immediately back to Hillsborough.    Whilst travelling back

    towards Hillsborough, a message came over the vehicle radio
      requesting     all vehicles      to report    back to Gate o on

      Penistone Road, which is marked F on the attached plan.         I

      proceeded back directly along Herries Road South turning

      right on to Penistone Road.       At this point we were directed
      on to the side of Penistone Road and I was guided through in

      to the ground just passed Gate 0.        Once inside the ground,

      I stopped the ambulance and            H and I got out, opened up

      the rear doors and took out one cot and placed it next to an

      injured person.      Another ambulanceman then came over to our

      vehicle and asked if the other cot on board could be taken

      over to gymnasium.      I said yes and            helped take the
      second over to the gymnasium as requested.         I continued to

      assist with the first casualty and with the assistance of

      Ambulanceman             |, I was able to put an oxygen mask on

      to the patient.      Ambulanceman            then returned to his
      own vehicle whilst I continued to stay with my casualty

      until the return of                 with another casualty on the

      second cot.       This casualty had obviously been treated by

      the medical staff inside the gymnasium because he was on a
      drip.

13.   Both cots were then loaded on to the ambulance.        I reversed

      out of the ground at point F with the assistance of police

      officers and ambulancemen.          I proceeded directly back to

      the Casualty Department at Northern General Hospital via

      Penistone Road and Herries Road South.         On arrival at the

      hospital Casualty Department again there were medical teams

      waiting to receive the casualties on board, and I considered



                                 3G5
      their assistance to be very professional indeed.              Both
            and I assisted with the loading of the two casualties

      on   to    hospital   trolleys,    and   they   were   then    taken
      immediately in to Casualty.
14 . I proceeded to drive straight back to the Hillsborough

      Stadium along the same route as before.         On arrival at the
      junction of Herries Road South and Penistone Road I noted a

      large, number of emergency vehicles waiting to gain access to

      the ground at point F.        I joined a line of ambulance
      vehicles.     When I drive in the ambulance at point F, I
      reversed the vehicle and stopped the vehicle at point G,

      with its front facing the gate.          Other ambulances which

      were entering the ground at point F were being directed in

      to the area near the gymnasium.
15.   Upon parking my ambulance I remained with the vehicle.

      Shortly afterwards, a message came over the vehicle radio
      from Control,    requesting all vehicles to move to Herries
      Road Bus Station.      No other patients were on board the

      vehicle at this point in time.       I proceeded straight to the

      Bus Depot, and when I arrived I noticed that Station Officer

      Eason was in charge of directing all ambulances into a
      position at the side of the Depot.       I was likewise directed

      and parked the vehicle, awaiting further instructions.
16 . At some time later,      I was instructed to move off back to

      Hillsborough to Gate 0.           I did so and upon arrival I

      entered the ground at point F and parked the vehicle near to
      point G.      At point F, I had been met by Assistant Chief
     A mbulance Officer      David    Jones,   who was directing all
     vehicles into the football stadium.          Superintendent Trevor
     Dale asked            and I to leave the vehicle and walk up to

     an area just outside the gymnasium.          After chatting for a

     short while with fellow ambulancemen,         I then became aware

     for the first of the enormity of the incident, and the large

     number of fatalities.       Shortly afterwards, Mr Jones came

     over to the area just outside the gymnasium,            gathered

     together all crews and then began to establish who were on

     afternoon shifts and the like.        Both            and I were
     informed by Mr Jones that we were being stood down off the

     incident and were told to return to normal duties.        Both __

             and I proceeded back to our vehicle, radioed Control

     who directed us back to Batemoor Station.         I drove directly

     to Batemoor Station where I continued with my normal duties.

     I have no idea of my time of arrival at Batemoor Station.

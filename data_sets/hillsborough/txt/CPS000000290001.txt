 Adlington -v- David Duckenfield & Murray

 Thank you very much for your letter of 6th July.

 Since receiving that letter, we have received the enclosed letter from Watts Leather Solicitors
 dated 9th July. We have advised the Court that we consent to the Informations being
 withdrawn, subject to the appropriate costs order, and await advice as to the formalities.

 I anticipate that Watts Leather will take steps to lay the Informations elsewhere, as indicated
 in their letter, and in that event, the request for the Director of Prosecutions to take over the
 conduct of the matter will be reiterated. At the moment however, it may be appropriate to
 await further developments and as necessary I will respond to the matters set out in your letter
 at that time.

 If you would like to discuss any matters arising from the correspondence, please do not
 hesitate to contact me or my colleague, Simon Eastwood, at your convenience.

 Yours sincerely,



 N A F OWSTON

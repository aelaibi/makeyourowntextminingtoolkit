TO:   ALL MATCH DAY PERSONNEL       FROM:   SHARON L. LANE        DATE:   7 . 5 .8 7



One again I am writing to you all to thank you for your assistance during the
past season, in particular all those who made the semi-final the success it
was.

T h e ^ a s o n has not gone by without any "casualties" - persons dismissed for
varil^Treasons - and Club policy for next season will continue to be strictly
upheld.

It is intended to make a few alterations with regards to various aspects of
the ground and to fully explain them and to do the usual briefing of match day
staff, the following nights have been arranged:-

Gatemen                         )
Turnstile operators             )           6th August at 7.30 p.m.
Commiss ionai res               )
"sundry area" stewards          )
                                and

All other Stewards                          13th August at 7.30 p.m.

As before the briefing will be followed by a pie and pea supper and we would
like everyone to attend.

Hie stewards/gatemen passes for next season will be the same as last year but,
in addition, everyone will be issued with a security badge with a photo, which
must be worn at all times when on duty. An extra 50p is being paid to
everyone at next Saturday's game - would you please bring 2 photo's (from a
photo booth) with you to the briefing meeting.




                                                                                       a, ft

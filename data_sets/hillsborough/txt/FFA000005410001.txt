He wanted to know when he could see the Phase 1 draft. I
explained the gist of our meeting yesterday and that JGW and
JD were producing these and they had to be served next
Friday.

I was only inclined to instruct them to make oral
presentations on 14 July if other people made allegations
against the FA in their written submissions. So far I
thought that the FA ought to adopt the low profile it had
successfully run.         agreed and thought it had all gone
pretty well. The only point was the unfairness of
Hillsborough.  It was difficult to know tactically how to
present the submissions. We must not be seen to be
protesting too much. It was in a sense easier for the
parties on the receiving end to deal with the point.
However we would be discussing this in detail with Dyson and
there was a meeting pencilled in for Tuesday at 2.30.

I said we were waiting for precise instructions on those
interim recommendations we would be attaching to our Phase 1
submission. He would see an early draft of the Phase l
submissions covering both points.

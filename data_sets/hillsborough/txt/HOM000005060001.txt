 m u ® IWOKT : POLICE ISSU E


 lord Ferrers indicated in April that he wished to have a meeting with Mr Anderton
 so that he could receive a report on ACPO's progress in responding to the final
 Taylor report.       My letter of 10 April commissioned a progress report for this
 purpose.      I attach a ropy of ACPO's written response and Bfc Anderton's covering
 letter.


 2.      A meeting with Lord Ferrers has now been arranged to take place afc 11.00 am
 €aB2:!0 "July.    The purposes of this minute are:-


         (i)      to ask for your contributions to the briefing for Lord Ferrers' meeting;
         and


         (ii) to ask whether you or someone else from your Division would wish to
         attend.     A full attendance from Divisions concerned might be necessary for
         any oral briefing Lord Ferrers might require.


 3.      As to (i), I suggest that you should provide a short line to take on each
 topic covering the likely adequacy of the ACPO response and its likely timing, if
 not already in place and the timing and content of any Borne Office response already
made or still outstanding.     A short background note may also be needed.


4.       May I look to the lead Division identified below for contributions on the
following topics set out in the ACPO response:-


                  TOPIC                                            T.F-AT) DTVTSTCW

                                                         contributions to, a draft
                                                         submission. It may be that
                                                         no further briefing is
                                                         required for Lord Ferrers'
                                                         meeting: if so, please let me
                                                         know.

                                                                       F5

and on the following topics not covered in ACPO's response but which arise from
Taylor's recommendaticns-




12.      Communications.                                               F7

13.      Co-ordination of the emergency services.                      G2



If I have mis-allocated any of these responsibilities please let me and whoever is
correctly concerned knew straight away.
5.   Lord Ferrers1 meeting with Mr Anderton could, I suggest, be regarded as
overtaking the arrangement, signalled in Mr Boys Smith's letter of 16 February,
officials to meet ACPO with a view to reporting later to Ministers on ACPO's
response to the final Taylor report.


6.   May I ask for your response to this note

Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH : ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for providing copies of items o f correspondence which indeed we had not
previously seen.

We shall be considering with Counsel whether there is any further submission that we
want to make to you although we are bound to say that for the most part this
correspondence seems to be repetitive.

We note that in the letter of 24 August to you there was enclosed “a file of
questionnaires, statements and letters”. It is really impossible to make any sense of
the content of the letter without the copy papers. Please could we have those
provided to us.

Yours faithfully




IV   JJ

 Dear

 COMPLAINT          TREVOR HICKS

 I refer to your letter dated 23 November 1989 in respect of the statement
 made by the above named on 22 November 1989.

 The allegation of collusion between Mr Duckenfield and Mr Jackson has been
 recorded under the above reference against the Chief Superintendent for whom
 I am the appropriate authority.

 I have asked Mr E N Taylor of the Police Complaints Authority to supervise
 the investigation which I would be grateful if Mr Dear would undertake.

 Yours sincerely




                                                                             Â£

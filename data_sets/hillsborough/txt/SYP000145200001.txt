      No,    except    that    1 t'esi that the whole m a t c h was    badly organised.

      Liverpool       have mors S u pporters     than Notts Forest and they should

      have    had more    tickets.      I also   think   that   it would have    been

      better    for the Police       to divert   fans    to opposite   sides    of the

      ground to wnat          tney were on that day..      I think that having      the

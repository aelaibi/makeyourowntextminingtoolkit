 I ^ p V E BEEN TO THE GROUND 3 OR 4 TINES AND ON EACH OCCASION THERE HAVE BEEN

 NO ORDERLY QUEUES,

 WHY WHEN COMPILING REPORTS SUCH AS THE POPPLEWELL REPORT D O N ’T THEY

 ASK US WHAT WE WANT,   WE ARE THE ONES WHO REGULARLY ATTEND & KNOW THE

 PROBLEMS.

 ON WAY TO GROUND WE WERE APPROACHED SY PEOPLE WANTING TICKETS.

 LOOKING AT SCENES ON TV AN KNOWING THE PR03LEMS AT MATCHES WITH CRUSHING

 NO


Q14

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ON THE WAY OUT WE SAW A NUMBER OF BODIES WITH RELATIVES AND

 F®hslDS BY THEM,     WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY VERY DISTRESSED, THE POLICE

 WHO WERE AROUND THEM WERE BEING VERY CALLOUS AND" MAYING NO

 EFFORT TO CONSOLE THEM

 THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF ORGANISATION



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT     YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE COACHES WERE BEING STOPPED BEFORE GETTING TO THE GROUND, BY

 THE POLICE, TO CHECK FOR ALCOHOL, THE COACHES WHICH WERE ALREADY

 DEjjj|iYED WERE DELAYED EVEN FURTHER WHICH WAS PANICING THE PASSENGERS

 INTO RUSHING TO GET INTO THE MATCH.

 WE WERE ALLOCATED THE SMALLER END OF THE GROUND WITH A LARGER


Q15

 FOLLOWING OF FANS, THE EXCUSE THAT IT WAS DONE TO KEEP THE TWO SETS

 OF FANS SEGREGATED IS POOR, BESIDES WHICH, NOTTS FOREST FANS AND

 OUR FANS WERE MIXING QUITE HAPPILY IN THE PUBS. FURTHER, THE SIGNING

 TO TAKE YOU TO THE LEPPINGS LANE END WAS BEING GENERALLY IGNORED ANYWAY

 AS IT WOULD HAVE MEANT     A DETOUR ROUND   THE CITY TO GET TO THEGROUND.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF INFORMATION     GIVEN   TO THE    GENERAL SPECTATORS ADVISING
                                                                           PAGE    9
                                                                           GSL2187

 THEM OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE SITUATION.    IF THEY HAD BEEN BETTER

 INFORMED PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GOT OUT A LOT QUICKER,

 IN MY OPINION IT WAS THE OPENING OF THE OUTER GATES ALLOWING £-SURGE

 OF PEOPLE INTO THE GROUND WHICH WAS THE MAlKKCAUSE/o/ TH^DISASTEjR.

 Q55                                                 ~

  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

  JUDICIAL INQUIR^f

  I WENT LAST >^AR THERE WERE MORE TICKETS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

  THIS Y E A R V H E R E WERE FAR MORE PEOPLE OUTSIDE WITHOUT TICKETS.   THE MAP ON

  THE BACK OF THE TICKET GIVES THE WRONG IMPRESSION,       IT’S TOTALLY MISLEADING.

  TOO MANY PEOPLE ENTERING THE GROUND THROUGH TOO SMALL A SPACE.

  NO POLICE CONTROL OUTSIDE THE GROUND AS SUCH, ONLY g OR 3 MOUNTED OFFICERS,

  WHO I BELIEVE WERE FROM LIVERPOOL.

  THE POLICING OUTSIDE THE GROUND WAS TOTALLY DISORGANISED.

  ]£) LIKE TO ADD THAT I WAS ENCOURAGED AND EVEN HELPED TO ENTER THROUGH

  THE SIDE GATE BY A POLICE OFFICER PUSHING MY HEAD UNDER THE BARRIER

  OUTSIDE BY THE GATE.

  ONCE INSIDE THERE WAS A LINE OF POLICE AND YOU COULD TELL THAT THEY

  WERE OBVIOUSLY UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE.

  THERE WAS NO POLICE CONTROL AWAY FROM THE GROUND, PREVENTING PEOPLE WITH

  NO TICKETS GETTING TO THE TURNSTILES.

  THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE OF THE GROUND

  IN GENERAL.

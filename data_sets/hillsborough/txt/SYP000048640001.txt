Dear Sir


REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

I refer to your letter of                  22nd October 1990, in which you request a copy of the
statement of your c li e n t |~

The policy on the release of information is as follows

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West Midlands Police
back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
were acting as the agents   of South Yorkshire Police.

The policy on the release   of information has variously been determined by Lord
Justice Taylor, later the   Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
Police Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.   I now have to look to South
Yorkshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in responding
to your request.

At the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
release any information to any party.  This is based on legal advice that has been
given which indicates that information should only be released on the order of a
Court which could include that of the Coroner.

I am sorry I cannot                 be any more helpful at the moment and asexplained at        the
present time I must                 decline your request.

Yours faithfully




J M JONES
Deputy Chief Constable.

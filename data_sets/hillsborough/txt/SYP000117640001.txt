                CHIEF       INSPECTOR M C R O B B I E



                 I t r a n s f e r r ed to         ’F * D iv is i on on M o n d ay 3 April            1989 as the Chief

                 Inspector           (Admin),



                 The O p er at io na l         O rder     for the F.A.         C u p semi-final          was    drafte d and          I

                was       not     included on the order.



                As a new me mb er              of the d iv ision           I made a request             to the Chief

                Superintendent                to    be able      to a tt e nd the event            iri order      to observe          the

                P o l i c e operation.



                As a p r e l im i na r y to the event                  I r ec ei ve d an overv ie w of the                planning

                and       r a t ionale      from     Inspector Sewell            at S . 30 p.m.        on W e d n e s d a y    12

                April       1989.



                 I did not a t t e nd              the C o mm an de r' s    brief     on Fr id ay       14 April        1989.



                On S a t u rd a y       15 April         1989,    I a t t e n d e d S h e f f i el d W e d n e s da y   football

                g ro un d at 9 .45 a.m.                  I was    off duty a tt e nd i ng         in my own time,              in
civilian       clothing        in order        to watch,       listen and       learn.



I took      up a place at the               rear of the N o r t h S ta nd behind CI D Officers

but    in front        of the Special           Constables.



It a p p e a r e d    to me    that a t t e n t i o n to detail was evident                 in the way

serials were           ordered,         officers     wore     h ea dgear a nd     p r of e ss io na li sm

prevailed.



C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   Duck enf i e 1d imparted a factual               briefing

identi fy in g        the vari ou s S e ct i o n S en io r C om ma n de r s        by name and         in

person.        He     i mp r es s ed that      officers must act            in a professional              manner

w h i c h w o ul d    reflect        credit    on S ou th Y or k sh i re Police.



This    brief was         clear,        concise and audi bl e at the              rear    by use of a

m i c ro p h o n e and amplifier.



This     part was        f ol lo we d    by S u p e r i nt e nd e nt Murray.



I was a g ai n        i m pr es se d w ith the s ta nd ar d of briefing,                 a g ai n a tt e nt i on

to detail        such as the            e va cu at io n    p rocedures and officers            being aware

of their       individual            requirement          in the    event of such e v e n t u a 1 i t y .



I p ar ti c u la r ly     recall        him saying         "We have     fully tried the e vacuation

procedures           twice    this      season,     the     first    time was     good,     the second

time was       e xcellence?           if we are       r eq uired to      impliment       e va cu at io n

today,      it must       be e xc el lent."



This    briefing was           f ol lo we d by an up to date               intelligence        report       from

Det ec t i v e S er ge a nt C h a r 1e s w o r t h .
                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                  R 125



Finally,        Inspector Sewell             gave general       inform at io n about     radios,

issue an d m ea l in g a r r a n g e m e n t s .



It was     s t re s se d     that all       officers must       be on their      respective       points

by 11.13 a.m.



A fter    the    b r iefing        it was    evident    that    little     of value w ou ld be

g ained until          later       into   the o pe r at i on so    I left    the s t ad iu m to    return

to my     pr ivate vehicle.



I was    approached           on three       separate    oc ca si on s    in P e ni st on e Roa d and

asked     if I had any tickets                to sell.



T here were a          lot    of    people ar ou nd     first     sitting    on walls    in groups.



I went     to my vehicle and drove                  to H a m m e r t o n Road Police    s t at io n where

I carried        out    some       o ut st anding   clerical      work.



I began to walk              back    to the stadium,        leaving my car at H am m e r t on Road

P o l i c e S t a t i o n w he n a police       car offe re d me a lift to the ground.

This     I accepted.



I saw P o l i c e w o m a n S m it h and anot he r        officer        outside Thr es he rs     near

Holme Lane and was                 pleased to see       officers     doing what was       expected of

them.



I a sked to be d r op pe d a little a way from the                        stadium as    I w an te d to

o bserve    officers          on their       respective areas and see how they were

performing.

                                                                                                        R 125


                                                                                              CUU+J
I was     really a n o ny m ou s        to them or man y of them,              as    I was    nj^r     to the

D i v i s i o n a nd not       in uniform.



All P ol i ce O f f i ce r s were acting             properly,        but    I was a little

s u r p r is e d that at        1.00 p.m.      there were       so few       cars and p edestrians              in

the area.



B y H i l l s b o r o u g h Park      I saw a group of        people        sitting a r o u n d , there was

a white      plastic          carrier    bag w it h them and          the outline        of   cans     could be

seen.      The    visible        caps    were of Hei neken           lager    in the green        can.

There were        six me n and they were               joking about          having to drink           the    lot

as they w o ul d not            be a l lo w e d to take      them     into the ground.



Appro x 1.15           p.m.

By Leppi ngs Lane              gates were      few supporters,          road clear         plenty of

Police     offic e rs         evident.



I went      to the       barrier at Leppi ngs Larie/Vere Road where                        I spoke to

*A * D i v i s i o n    officers,       Police C o ns t a b l e s    Pa rk in a nd Drury.         A few

people      passing and we             spoke about      running and          ’A* Divisional           work,



I then w a lk e d        past L ep pi ng s Lane        gates an d      came to barriers and

Pol ic e O ff ic e rs         - P o li c e S er ge a nt No rburn and others             I do not know.

There were        no other         people     near   this area.         X knew from my

p re l i m i n ar y d is c us s io n s w ith Inspector Sewell                the    ne ce ss it y to

provide a sterile a re a to keep opposing                           fans separate.



I c on tinued along             the    road being      the S o ut h S tand         past the T .V . unit

vans where        I was met wit h anot he r             barrier       of metal       barriers     and
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     R 125

Police Officers.                 I produced my warr a nt         card,    but    I was    known      to one

officer who         I did not k n o w .



I went     down a n d along P e ni st on e R oad w h i ch was               busy.



1 w al k e d t o wa rd s P a r k si d e Road a nd         I was against         the flow of       people,

it was     very     busy.



I s t op pe d a n d spoke          to Police C o n s t a b l e V a l la n ce    from    ’A ’ D iv is io n

and Police C o n s t a b l e H a lt m a n from A D i v i s i o n at separate                points     but

due   to enq ui ri es        and    sheer    numbers      of persons       it was      prudent    to move

on,   as    they needed all            their a t t e n t i o n to deal      wit h the volume          of

people.



I returned         to   rear      of S o u th Stand.



About      1.45 p.m.        the Liverpool        team     coach arrived.



There was a m otor eye 1e lead a nd Police                      horses     controlling a         large

crowd a w a it i ng        the    trains arrival.



I noticed         the horse        near me was        d is pl a yi n g a M e rs e y s i d e Police    badge

on the     saddle.



There were        no    incidents.



S er ge an t S o r s b y    of S ou th Yor ks hi re Police M o un te d said to the other

officers - “E x a c t l y          the same     for    the N otts Forest C o a c h ” .



About      1.55    p.m.     the N o t t i n g h a m Forest    team coach arrived.
                                                                                                    PAGE.
                                                                                                    R125



The    procedure was as for Liverpool,                      no    problems,      crowd good humoured.



I left this a r e a a n d             returned to P e n i s t o n e R oad as        I intended to use

the    entrance       to the ground by the P ol ic e                  room.



P e n i s t o n e R oa d was    quite       busy but     there was       no queuing at       the

t u rnstiles as         I w o u ld have         expected.        At   that time about       one hour    to

kick    off.



I knew the re was a L iverpool                     train due at Wads 1ey Bridge a r o u n d 2,05

p.m.    but    d ec i de d to go         into    the ground.



I went     to the mai n         sliding         gate and    p ro duced my warrant          card and a

special       card    issued         to me by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray.     B ot h were    fully

checked and          e x a mi n ed    by the s te wards w hi ch          I thought was      excellent.



1 was a s su r ed       no u n a u t h o ri s ed    person w o ul d gain entry at that              gate.



I went     down onto         the      perimeter      track and was           immedi at el y s urprised by

how full       the S p io n Hop was.               I turned an d saw the N o rt h S ta nd was           not

very full.



1 made     my way to the Police Control                     box.



Inspector Sewell             had a l er te d me       to the      fact   that    inside   there was

only    limited space.                I intended to visit,             see    it o pe ra te d and   leave

if I was       in the way.



1 wan te d to see          the Control           point as    I was at Don ca st er Rovers when
                                                                                                                   PAGE      7

the    camera e qu i pm e nt was                 first    ins ta ll ed and        o pe rated at        the

beg in n i n g    of the          present        season.      The   engineer         was always          quoting       the

Sheffield Wednesday                  s ys t em as being          e xcellent and holding                  the     system

as    the way all            g r o u nd should o p e r a t e .



O n entering          the P o l i c e      box there was S e r g e a n t Goddard,                   P o l i ce

C o n s t a b l e R ya n at        the    front and Police C on s ta b le B ic h ar d at                     the    rear

by the       camera o pe r at i ng          controls.



I was      informed by Po li ce S er geant G o d d a r d that S u pe r i n t e n d e n t M ur r ay

had gone to speak                  to the        referee so      I sat on his           seat and was             offered

a hot      drink.            It didn't appear             p a rt ic ul ar ly    busy and quite             clearly

e ve ry t h i ng was         under       control.



A ss i st a nt     Chief      C o n s t a bl e    (Operations)        Mr.      J a ck so n   came     to the

control        point,        he was       in civilian         clothing.



I saw      thro ug h the           control        room w i n d ow S u p e r i nt e nd e nt M u r r ay and

S u pe r i n t e n d e n t   D u c k e n f i e l d , in uniform,       walking along            the      track.

T h e y came       t h ro ug h the        un co ve re d    seats    in the S outh S ta nd and                    entered

the    control         room.        I went        to the    far end of the             room and stood by the

camera       control         area.



I was      prepared          to    leave,        but did not appear             to be h indering anyone

this     point.



On    looking        into      the ground          the L iverpool        areas       had a lot of space,

the Notts Fo re st                parts    I could see on the S o ut h Stand and the Spion

Kop were quite               full.

I recall C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t          Duckenfi e 1d commenting about              the re

being        no e n te r ta i n m e n t    being    provi de d to encourage        the s uppo rters            to

come early.



I remember w he n             I was a child the re alw ay s            being a band playing               by

the    players        tunnel        at every game at Hi 1 Isborough.



W h i ls t    I d i d n ’t see       it, A ss is ta nt Chief C on s ta b le O pe ra ti on s

c om mented that a person just                      below the Po li ce      control       had just

dr o pp e d his        trousers.           W hen   I looked the      person was      jigging around.

X remember           t hi nk in g    how empty the a rea a ro un d          this y ou th w a s .      Police

C o n s t a bl e 8 i chard o p e ra t ed the          camera a nd     I w at c he d him be able to

zoom onto          him whi ch I thought was a super                   f a c i 1 ity for    spotting

trouble makers               in the       crowd.



I was aware            the are a       in L ep pi n gs Lane       beh in d the goal was          filling       up

but this was            to    be expected.



J. was       then aware         that      both teams     came onto the         pitch for a pre-match

war m up. As there was                    nothing    special      h appening   on the      scree n or      in

the ground           I looked        onto    the    playing area.



j. was aware           that A lan H an s on of Liv er po ol           was   on the    pitch and was

sur pr is ed as         I didn't          think    he w ou ld be    playing.     The Liv er po ol         fans

were     s ho uting       his    name and he a c k n o w l e d g e d them by raising             his hand.

All was         good humoured.



The are a behind the goal at L ep pings                        Lane was     getting       full   but there

was    space            the     front.       People    see me d    reluctant    to move      forward,
                                                                                                           PAGE

probably all          w a nt in g    to m ai nt a in    their    best      view of the         playing area.



A p pr o x £.3 0     p.m.

I looked on the             left moni to r and was aware                there       see me d a build up of

support© rs .



I remember         asking S u pe r in t e n d e n t M ur r ay about          this,      he e xp l ai n ed that

due    to nec es sa ry      s e gr e ga ti on of fans,          ac ce ss    to the N o r th Stand,

w h ic h had been a l l o c a t e d to Liverpool                supporters,          could only be done

by Leppings Lane            entrances,         this meant        that      the en tr an ce s      on

P e n i s t on e R oad    to the      stand w h ic h w ould        n or mally be used were

unavailable.



This    exp la in ed at       that     time    in my m i n d the        crowds       on the screen.



1 recall      a s u gg e s t i o n    that    the    loud h a il e r/ t a n n o y    s ho ul d be use d to

request     fans      to move        forw ar d to      create    room at       the    rear     to prevent

crowding.



Pe op le   began a dv is in g         control       that   radio     rec ep ti on was        poor.



An engineer          came   into      the    room to try and          improve        t r a n s m i s s i o n and

reception.



1 remember         him    in blue      under    the     control      room bench,          I thought        it was

crowded as Pol ic e S er ge a nt G o dd a r d was w a lk i ng                  r ound/over        him.



1 thought       of    leaving        but was    unable       to get     past an d was          better

staying where            I was.

I was aware S u pe r in t e n d e n t           Marshall     req ue st ed the     closure       of L ep pings

Lane    to traffic.



1 looked to the             sc re en and whilst           there    seemed a lot of            people      this

was    to be e x p ec t ed and this               had been the       s i tu at io n for quite a time.

It was     not e x t r a o r d i n a r y .       I recall    seeing a cream double              decker        bus

t rave l l i ng    slowly      t h ro ug h the      crowd w h ic h    indicated         the   road was        not

b loc k e d and free m ov em e nt was               possible.



The    sit u at io n     remai ne d       like this,      poor    reception,      the g ro un d slowly

filling     up and e v e ry t hi n g            p rogressing as      one w ould   expect       for     such an

occasion.          The    crowd          seemed good h um ou r ed         in the ground.



A p p r o x 2.45    p.m.

The    crowd outside a p pe ar s             denser     on the     camera but      I can see a Police

horse    on the        screen.           Having    seen them at       close hand         control     the

crowd w hen the team               coaches arrived,            I sensed     they were well           in

control.



O f f i c e r s were     d e p lo y ed    to assist,      including a land          rover w i t h P.A.

equipment         to as si st      officer        outside.



A r o u n d this    time a radio m e ss ag e was               rela ye d   r equesting        the   gates      to

be opened as           persons           were    trap pe d up a g ai ns t the g a t e s .



I remember         thinking, y ou          c a n ’t open the      gates    or     you    lose c o n t r o 1

over who      is admitted,               you are unable       to se ar ch or      check       persons

a d m i t t e d for w ea po ns and may             create a dif fi cu lt        public order

sit u a t i o n for P ol i ce        inside the ground.
                                                                                                             PAGE    1
                                                                                                             R125

The gates were              not a u t ho r is e d to be opened           by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

D u c k e n f i e l d at    this    time.



I am aware          that     the teams are          no    longer     on the      pitch so the          start

could not          be far off an d there was                 still   a lot of space             on the

terrace          under     the Police Control.



It o c c urred that           some L iv erpool           s up po r te r s were     leaving      it late but

people      often enter after               the start at many games.



About     this time          I can see       people       climbing     over      the wall       a nd point

this     out to the          controllers.           I then saw the          gates d i s p l a ye d on the

camera w hich            I believe are        the    c on ce r ti n a gates on the            service        road to

the    rear of the           S o u th S ta nd open and a surge              of     people     rush     into the

ground.           I said     "The gates have             been forced".



It was difficult              to estimate        how m a n y ente re d the gr ou nd              but the

gates were          q u ic k ly    closed agai n .         It seemed      control       was     rega i ne d with

help of a m o u n t e d           officer who       put    his horse across            the    gap    in the gate



People      however are            still    being able        to   climb over        the wall        into the

ground.



S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M ar sh al l   a g a in requests       the gates        to be opened.             This

is a general             request.



It    is getting           close to kick off             time.



I can see          by the     players t u n n e 1 a semi           circle     of    p h o t og r ap h er s

a wa i t i n g    the arrival        of the two t e a m s .
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                R-125



It seems        the S u p e r i n t e n d e n t will         have      to try and        prevent       the    start     of

the    game as        the    fans will           not all       get     in but       I thought       there     is no

way anyone          can get        to the        referee       or team m an agers           to do this at this

late stage.            As    1 was        thinking        this       the crowd e rr up te d as a             team    ran

on.      I've no        idea w h ic h team as the                    sound inside        the    ground

tr an s mi t te d     itself       outside and            from what          I saw      on the moni to r

control       was     d ifficult          outside       now.



At this       point S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M ar shall             req ue st ed the gates           to be

opened as there was going                        to be serious           injury or someone              killed

outside       in the        crush        if   they were        not opened.



There was         still      room on          the    terrace         under    the    control.        The S outh

S t an d was m uch          fuller        but    not full.



S u pe r i n t e n d e n t M ur r ay was stand in g wit h a                     personal       radio   in his hand

asking Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            Duck.enfie 1 d for a decision.



It was      evident         there        exis te d a treme nd ou s           problem for o ff icers

outside       the L ep pi n gs           Lane    entrance.



Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t        D u c k e n f i e I d was   dee pl y    co ns id er in g    the sit ua ti on



I recall        him t hi nk in g a lo ud words                 to the        effect -      If there's         likely

to    be serious         injury or            death outs id e          I have       no o pt io n    than to     open

the gates ~ He told S u pe r i n t e n d e n t M u r r ay                     "Open the G a t e s " .



S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r ay    gave      the general         i n st ru ct io n over       the     radio    to

open the gates.
                                                                                                        PAGE

On the monitor           I saw the         conce rt in a gates            open an d fans     come flooding

in -



The game had s ta rt ed w he n               I looked back           onto     the playing area.          The

play was at          the P en i st o ne      Road end.



I became aware           of a perimeter             track    gate     being    opened and       people

being    let onto        the    track      out of the        pen be hi nd the goal           and ushered

and    pointed       in the     d i re ct io n of the        part where        there was       still    plenty

of space.



The m o v e m en t    seemed orde rl y but             the numbers          were    building    up.



Fans were       going     onto       the   track       s ta rting to move          in the d i r e c ti o n as

di re c te d   but    then stopping and                s ta nding w at ch i ng the game.



A po li ce wo ma n was         in control         of the gate         into the a re a where there

was    space    but did        not    open    it.



I thought       she    p ro ba b ly d i d n ’t have a          radio       or h a d n ’t sensed that      she

must    open    it to     let fans         into     the    open areas       behind her.



I began to sense y ou th s w o u ld                 run    onto the       playing a re a so ran         out of

the    control       point,     thro ug h the        u nc o ve r ed seats onto the           perimeter

track and got the              gate by the P o l i c e w o m a n o pe n and began d irecting

fans    to the area.            More and more were               coming      onto    the track,       I was

u sh ering     them to the open gate and the P o l i c e w o m a n assisted.



I went     behind the a d v e r ti s in g           h o ar di ng s   to    prevent    persons
                                                                                                            PAGE

encroaching         onto    the    playing area.



I could see         people    pushed up against              the fence        but not a ware            of any

particular         problems       or   injuries as         there    is a steady s tr ea m of                people

onto    the      perimeter    track.



More and more            people    on the track            and beg in ni ng      to move       onto     the

grass     by the goal        line.



1' see S u pe r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n wo o d on      top of the fence,            having      climbed up

and he      is g esturing         by waving     his     arms and asking           for the        game      to be

sto p p e d .



It seems         by his    frantic waves Control              are    not     u n de r st an di ng     his

re q u e s t .



I run to         control    but    by the u n co ve re d seats            I meet S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Murray with his hat on running the o pp osite w a y .                              We    run tog ether           to

a   linesman to get          his a t t e n t i o n to stop the game.



The    linesman      ran strai gh t       past S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray.



I chase the         linesman shouting           him to get          the    r e f e r e e ’s a t t e n t i o n   to

stop the game.



I then see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d    running       towards       the    referee.



There are         lots    of fans      in the Liv er po ol         goal m ou th       in front        of

Le pp in gs Lane terrace.
                                                                                                           PAGE

I think      it is a public             order    situation.



As they are L iv erpool                supporters,        I run onto       the    playing      a rea and

protect Nigel           C l o u gh    in case any L i ve rp oo l         s upporters        try to attack

h irn.



Whe n    I am s at i sf i ed         there   is no danger         to    players      I look and       see

hundreds      of      people     spilling       onto    the     playing area.         There        is quite

clearly      in my m i n d a major            public     order s i tu at io n w h ic h will           need a

large     uniform       presence        to   control.



I am     in the       centre     of the      playing area,         in plain       clothes.



There     is nothing          I can u se fully do             in a public    order     context        so    I

decide     to return          to the P olice Control              point.



En   route    I am      passed by uniforined r e in fo rc em en ts as                 I pass t h ro ug h

the unc ov er ed        seating.



On   re-entering            control     room I learn that              persons are      s us p ec t ed     of

being     injured.



An a m bu la nc e      is    called for an q u ic kl y a rr iv es           behind the Leppi ngs

Lane     goal.



A message        is    relayed to Police             control      that many       people are         injured.

As   they are         not    local     people,     Chief S u pe r in t e n d e n t   Duckenfield

decides      to call         out C a s u a l t y B u r e au    staff.

I make     the    request       toy telephone          to F orce O pe ra ti on s       Roo m as     instructed.



I've    no a cc ur at e a ss es s me n t        of time,       but    this     call   should be       recorded

on tape       in Force Control.                Coins    or other          items are    being    thrown at

Police Control             in large numbers.             In view of the s it u at i on

I leave the gr ou nd            by L ep pi ng s Lane and am able to stop Chief

Inspector Sha w            in a m ar ke d      police    car.        He    conveys me     to H a m m e r t o n

I change       into u n if or m and act at this                 location as           Incident Commander.

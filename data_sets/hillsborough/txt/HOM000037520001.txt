                       HOME SECRETARY’S STATEMENT ON

                              HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

                          WEDNESDAY, 18 FEBRUARY 1998




With permission Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


2      Few events in recent years have touched the lives of so many people. The families
and friends of the 96 Liverpool fans who died on 15 April 1989 have suffered
immeasurably. The whole nation was profoundly disturbed by what occurred that day.
Although it is now almost nine years since that fateful day, many of the families and others
felt that new evidence was available which would cast new light on these events. As Home
Secretary, I was determined to do all I could to establish if that was indeed the case.


3      On coming into office in May I gave this question intense and urgent consideration,
and on 30 June 1997, I announced to the House that the Attorney General and I had
decided to appoint Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal
to conduct an independent scrutiny of this matter. His terms of reference were:


       To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
       Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


       (a)     to the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


       (b)     to the Director of Public Prosecutions or Attorney General for the purpose
               of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
           (c)     to the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire police in relation to police
                   disciplinary matters;


                   and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
                   is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for
                   the Home Department of a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b)
                   and (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by
                   them which may be relevant to their respective               duties;and toadvise
                   whether there is any other action which should               be takenin thepublic
                   interest.


4        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has now submitted his report, which I am publishing
today.


5        Hisscrutiny is the latest in a series of lengthy and detailed examinations of the
evidence in this case. The public inquiry led by the late Lord Justice Taylor considered
fully the causes of the disaster and made wide-ranging recommendations about crowd
control and safety at sports events. These have had a profound effect on both crowd safety
at football grounds and on the policing of football matches.


6         The deaths which occurred were also the subject of inquests which were conducted
by the Coroner for the Western District of South Yorkshire in two parts in April and May
1990 and between November 1990 and March 1991. They involved over 80 days of public
hearing. A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands police, supervised
by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any grounds for
criminal or disciplinary proceedings. That investigation involved               the taking of more than
5000 statements. At a later stage in November 1993, there wasa judicial review of the
coroner’s proceedings, which upheld the inquest verdict of accidental death and the
conduct of those proceedings. We have now had this further detailed scrutiny by a senior
Lord Justice of Appeal.

7          The main causes of the disaster have long been clear. They were identified by
Lord Taylor in his interim report in August 1989. He did not attribute all the blame to a
single cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made it clear that “the main reason for the
disaster was the failure of police control”. Both Lord Taylor, and now Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith were damning in their condemnation of senior officers in charge that afternoon,
Chief Superintendent Duckfield.           Lord Justice Stuart-Smith refers in terms to a
“Mr Duckfield’s disgraceful lie” about one of the gates at Hillsborough, Gate C being
forced open by fans”. The South Yorkshire police have in turn accepted the main share of
responsibility for the disaster.        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Local
Authority were also criticised by Lord Taylor.


8          With any major disaster, it is almost inevitable that over the course of time some
new information may become available. But that does not necessarily mean that the
outcome of any previous inquiries would have been different had this information been
available. What is crucial is not just whether the information is new, but also whether it is
of such significance - to use the phrase in the terms of reference - as to justify a new
inquiry.


9          Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered in great detail all the evidence which has been
put to him. This included all the relevant evidence presented to the earlier inquiries and
inquest. He has looked equally rigorously at all the information presented to him, by
individuals and official bodies including those representing the families of those who died,
and others who have acted in support of them.                He has produced a thorough and
comprehensive report and goes into immense detail to analyse and reach conclusions on
                                           U £ .(/ M j L
each of the submissions made to him.                g^e~briefly summarierwhat he says on the key
allegations relating to the video evidence, the cut off time of 3.15 pm for the inquest, and
of interference with witnesses.


Video evidence


10         Tljese sets of allegations were made about video evidence.

11         First, that two video tapes were stolen from the Club’s control roorr^ There is no v v
dispute that this theft took place. The tapes were pictures from the Club’s CCTV cameras
and not those of the police. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith savs that the tapes in any event ..                               ,
                                                     , (jjs f &    ia/U * jU 4 .   Jk.
would not have shown anything significant. (One of the tapes was known to be entirely
blank, since the camera concerned had been misplace^prixjted at a wall. The other showed *^ ^
turnstiles 9 to 16 at the                         ^ ^ en d of the g r o u n d L o r d Justice Stuart-Smith says     talaC/Tt^
that the police did not try to blame their failure to spot overcrowding on the terraces with ^~X
faulty CCTV equipment. The police controllers had a good view over the terraces from
.the control box and did not pretend otherwise.


12         Second, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith deals at considerable length with allegations made
principally by Mr Roger Houldsworth, a video technician at Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club that the police had blamed their failure to see overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 on
camera 5{when it was not; that evidence of the video tapes taken by camera 5^deliberately
suppressed and concealed; that two police officers gave deliberately false evidence that
camera 5 was not working c o rre c d y ^ ^


13         Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concluded that “the importance of Mr Houldsworth’s
evidence has been exaggerated out of all proportion”, and that Mr Houldsworth’s
and evidence were known to the Taylor inquiry and to the Coroner. He concluded that
tjiafthe allegation that the police hid video tapes evidence of the terraces is “impounded”.


The cut-off time of 3.15 pm


14         One of the issue which has unquestionably caused most distress to those bereaved at
Hillsborough was the decision of the Coroner to rule that he considered that all those who
had died had received the injuries which caused their deaths by 3.15 pm on the day of the
disaster. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that the Coroner didjsay that all those who died
did so before 3.15 pm, nor that all those who became unconscious subsequently djfd. It was
only in relation to the question of how,                                 by what means the deceased came to their
deaths that the cut-off time was imposed. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that the cut-off

did not limit the inquiry of the inquest?, and that he does not consider the inquest) flawed.

 Interference with witnesses


 15        The main allegations were that some specific witnesses had had pressure put on
 them by the West Midlands police, and that the way in which the South Yorkshire police

| collected evidence from its own officers jkas unacceptable.


 16        On the first allegation, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concludes that there was no
 improper attempt to alter the evidence of these witnesses.


 17    On the second, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith records that a ipaefnber of the initial
                                                                                  os*.         fy1'
statements made by South Yorkshire police officers were subsequently amended
solicitors to the force before being submitted to the Taylor Inquiry. He says that in a very
few cases - referred to in Appendix 7 - what was excluded was either factual^comment in
                               Vv*.
which factual matters were jegplicit. He says that “it would have been preferable” for these
matters not to have been excluded, but that he is satisfied that Lord Taylor’s enquiry was
not in any way inhibited or impeded by what happened.
       o-JfrU—

 18         The overall conclusion which pkg'Lord Justice Stuart-Smith reaches, however, is
that there is no basis on which there should be a further public inquiry. He also finds no
basis for a renewed application to quash the verdict of the inquest, or any material which
should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the (disciplinary authorities
which might cause them to re-consider the decisions they have already taken.             He
concludes that none of the evidence which he was asked to consider added anything
significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Taylor’s inquiry or to the inquests.


 19        I, the Attorney General and the DPP have considered Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
report very carefully. |We have no reason to believe that his conclusions are wrong. This
will, I know, be deeply disappointing for the families of those who died at Hillsborough
and many who have campaigned on their behalffj

                                               5
20        I fully understand that those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough feel betrayed by
those responsible for policing the Hillsborough football ground and for the state of the
ground on that day. I hope and believe that the changes which resulted from the Taylor
Inquiry should mean that such a disaster will never he-fepeated".


21        But there is another sense in which the system has failed the Hillsborough families.
As Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says in chapter 7 of his report,


            “I understand the dismay that they have that no individual has personally been held
           to account either in a criminal court, disciplinary proceedings, or even to the extent
            of losing their job”.

                                   ° \ V—v.
22          There arc serious shortcomings in the police disciplinary system.         The Home
Affairs Committee produced a report earlier this year which makes recommendations for
change.         I will be responding fully to that report soon.      But what happened after
Hillsborough is a prime example of why we have to improve the current arrangements.


23        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also comments on whether coroners proceedings/err'a '                           ^
major disaster, which have been subject to a public inquiry^c appl'upriafe af&lf. He
endorses the recommendation of a Home Office Working Group on Disasters and
Inquests, published in March 1997, that the role of the coroner after such a public inquiry
should be limited.


24        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith highlights in his report the exceptionally difficult task
which the coroner had in conducting the main inquest. It placed an unreasonable and, I
                                     •Kx>
think, unnecessary burden on jjkrt/when the Taylor Report had covered substantially the
same ground. Certainly I am clear that Hillsborough proved that the {system in its present
form is unsuitable as a means of dealing with disasters of this kind. v          ^                 ^       ^—
                         *JX   /W                             *T\                     ,„Jt        1 ^1     f,
                                                                                     ior-w
                                                                                         i i nl   /L . I

25        I therefore agree in principle with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s recommendations
that there should rarely be the need for an inquest following a judicial inquiry into a major                   v
disaster.

26        When I established the scrutiny I said that I would do my best to ensure that the
evidence considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was published.             Most of the    m a in

material which he has considered is contained in the Appendices to his report. Much of
the other evidence which he considered is already in the public domain, consisting of
transcripts of public hearings or material considered by the Taylor Inquiry. I am arra n g in g
for other material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to be placed in the Library of
the House save that where there are overriding reasons for doing otherwise.                         c*vXtp


the material to be published will include all the original statement made by South
Yorkshire officers^] f-v-^ ur                               .


27        All Honourable Members will have the most profound sympathy with the families
and friends of those who died at Hillsborough. We can scarcely begin to comprehend
what they have suffered. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says in his report:


              I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to them,
           especially since they have had their hopes raised that something more could be
           done. But I cannot allow compassion to cloud my judgement. I have had to look
           dispassionately and objectively at what is said to be fresh evidence, in the light of
           the evidence which had previously been considered”.


28        Ij, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions have had to
consider Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report in the same light. I recognise that it will be
difficult and painful for the families of those who died to accept the conclusions of this
report. But having established this rigorous judicial scrutiny I accept its conclusions.

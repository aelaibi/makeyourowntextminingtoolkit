             LORD DORMAND OF EASINGTON'S PRIVATE PEER’S BILL ON
                 SPORTING EVENTS (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL ETC)


        Lord Dormand's Bill is down for Second Reading on Tuesday, 10 March and 1
am writing to seek your concurrence, and th at of colleagues, to its receiving the
Government's support.

          Under the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol Etc) Act 1985, football clubs
wishing to sell alcohol must obtain an order from a magistrates' court. The maximum
period for which such an order may be granted is five months. The Bill seeks to extend
this period to 12 months.

         The Football League and others have been lobbying hard for such an
amendment and I understand that the Bill has the support of the Minister for Sport. I
too am anxious not to place an unnecessary burden upon football clubs, and indeed on
the magistrates' courts. The police tell us th at there have been few difficulties in
respect of the renewal of these orders. It therefore seems reasonable for the interval
to be extended.

         I realise that the Bill is unlikely to proceed very far because of pressure on
Parliamentary time. Nevertheless I believe th at the Government should support these
practical measures if there is a division on Second Reading.

        I am copying this letter to members of LG Committee, the Secretary of State
for Education and Science, the Minister for Sport, First Parliamentary Counsel, to Sir
Robin Butler and the Secretaries to LG.

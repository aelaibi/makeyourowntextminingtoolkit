Dear Sirs

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of 13 January 1999.

Your request for full and detailed reasons as to the CPS decision not to intervene in
this private prosecution is actively being considered in London. A similar request has
been made by Walker Morris.

I regret that I am not able to give you an exact date when a substantive reply may be
available, however I have been informed that a response should be made this month.

I shall contact you again when I know more.

Yours faithfully




George R Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

     ?A/HILLSBOROUGH/INSURANCE

 i spoke to*             at the officas at the FA on his request
 for a masting.

 We discussed the wording of the Public Liability Policy and
 agreed that the Inquiry may be interpreted as a fatal
 accident Xnquiry in which case legal costs were on the face
 of it recoverable • Jardines had written to the FA saying they
 xrould not be covered.   I thought the FA ought to correct the
 position and that they had not obtained prior consent from
 the insurers to instructing Freshfields because Jardines had
 told them they were not covered? However, having read the
 clause it seemed to me that they should now give their
 consent.

 In addition|    |
                 was going to draft a letter dealing with the
 notes of a meeting that Jardines had sent him which were
 inaccurate in various places especially with regard to
 whether or not the FA had received any claims from third
 parties. He was dealing with a i"     '    land a
   took a copy of the letter and^    |said he would send me
 his draft response for us to review,

 I said that our response would set out vary clearly that now
 a channel of communication had developed between solicitors
 to the insurers and ourselves information should continue on
 this basis. Jardines did not need to be copied in.

          was of the opinion that fche insurers were beginning
  o wriggle.  He was a little bit concerned at the extent of
 the FA's cover ie £2.5 million with the Commercial Union and
 £2.5 million with the Roval Insurance.

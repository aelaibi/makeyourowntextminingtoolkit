Mr Bolton

HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP
I took this morning a telephone call from Mr Robert G Hughes MP.
He had received Lord Ferrers' reply of 6 March to his letter of
13 February to Mr Brandon-Bravo MP.
Mr Hughes was very annoyed that a copy of Lord Ferrers' reply had
been sent to Mr David Alton. He made the point that he was
writing on behalf of his own constituent, and that this was no
concern of Mr Alton. He said that the matter was particularly
irritating as he had, in addressing his letter to
Mr Brandon-Bravo, been using specifically party channels.
I undertook to advise you of Mr Hughes' concerns, which should be
borne in mind in future dealings with him and the Hillsborough
Family Support Group.

            At      10.00am    (1000)     on Saturday   15 April   1989 (150489)   I was on duty at

            L iverpool supporters arrested at or near the Sheffield ypfins<;.iay

            Football       club.



            I was assigned the duty of verification of arrested persons with the

            Police Forces             in whose area that   person resides and from a time around

            2.00pm      <1400)        for a period lasting a ppr ox imate ly 1 and half hours.,

            several      persons were        processed for varying offences and their details

            were verified by m e .            At no time did I deal with,      personally, any of

            the arrested persons.



            At 7.30pm         (1930)     that day,   I completed my tour of duty.

*    THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUIRY.

     Following our telephone conversation on 19 April, I am writing to
     offer Lord Justice Taylor the assistance of the HSE's Research and
     Laboratory Services Division in the forensic work which will
     presumably precede or form part of the Inquiry.

      Our Research Division, which operates in support of the Executive's
      Inspection and Policy function* has three major laboratories, -
      occupational medicine and hygiene at Cricklewood, the Explosive and
      Flame Laboratory (which assisted with the Kings Cross Inquiry) and
      Piper Alpha) at Buxton and the Safety Engineering Laboratory at^*
      Sheffield. The Safety Engineering L a b oratory,whi ch is situated
      oniy~a5&tf£ a mile from Hillsborough not only has extensive
    1“ficI'lTeies-but“also considerable' experience of forensic
    \investigation, including that in connection with danger to the
     'public.

     As a matter of fact we had already offered our support to the Local
     Authority immediately after the disaster and scientists from the
     laboratory have already visited the site to assess what assistance
     they might give, although they would not of course do anything to
     disturb the evidence without the assent of the Coronerfe Officer.

     You told me that Lord Justice Taylor had it in mind to appoint an
     engineering assessor and it may be that he will wish, in due
     course, to indicate particular areas of concern to him.

      Meanwhile if you wish to discuss this offer of assistance or make
      any practicaJfl-e arrangements may I suggest that you get in touch
      direct with j3r.A E. Jones^ Director of     safp-hy ^ g i n p p r i n a
      laboratoryr Health.and Safety Executive. Broad Lane. Sheffie l d .

     The HSE is both willing and anxious to be of assistance to Lord
     Justice Taylor in whatever way he wishes.




     Yours sincerely

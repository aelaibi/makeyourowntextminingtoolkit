                  On Saturday 15th April            1969 (150489)              I went to the FA Cup Semi Final

                  Football Match between Liverpool and Notts Forest at Hillsborough?

                  Sheffield.

                   I am a Liverpool supporter-

                  1 had a £6 standing ticket, £or Leppings Lane^and I purchased it

                                         and                      who      lives at

                  We all travelled in                     dads car to Sheffield and we arrived there

                  at about       12.30 pm (1230?.         We parked in a side road about 3 minutes

                  walk from the ground.

                  We had something to eat in the car and then mafie our way to the

                   ground.       We arrived at the ground at about                    U.15   hrs    (1315).
                                                                             PAlaE

   There were no queues at the ground so we went straight in .           I was

   searched twice outside the ground and once when we were inside.

  Once inside the ground we did not see any signs telling us where to

   go.     All we could see was the tunnel and we presumes we had to go that

  way,

  At this time             [Dad and his sister had/1 ef 15/us to go to the W6rth

  Stand.      The three of us walked down theVtunnel and into Pen 3.           U&/

   stayed there for a c<yuple of rrlnutes then went in to pen 4 to see if
                          /          /                        '         ‘
  we had a better vj/ew t he re/         We did not like it there so we moved

   back into pen 3 where w ^ stayed until we were eventually pulled up

   into the West Stand

  The pen gradually filled up and we started to get pushed about >a bit.

   There was a barrier just in front of us.           As the pen got e v m/ more

   full    I made sure I did not get pushed up against       it.   As yeven more

   people came in we were getting a bit crushed.           The vgamjr kicked off

  and we were getting          pushed about and we became separated

   from        ,   At this time I could see that people were getting over the

   f ence at the f r o n t .   I did not realise at this time that people were

   being injured I knew that things were p r f t as they should be and we

  wanted to get out.

          and I were becoming separated /and he grabbed me and pulled me back

   to where he was.       The game had\ yxopped by this time and the players

   had gone off.      We tried to make our way to the rear of the pen.           We

   could see people being pul1ed up into the West S t a n d .       It took us

  about 3 minutes to get to/the back.            As soon as we got to the back we

   were pulled up into tl?e Stand.    We moved back a few rows.  We could
    ‘
    *'r .?
    i e e that there were people on the pitch ly ing down. Some were being

)^LJ|ijiven mouth to mouth and heart massage.        We then saw people with their

   heads covered over and we realised that people had died.            We moved

   around the stand and when we moved forward again we looked down into
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S371S

         the pen we had been in.           We saw a crush barrier that had been pushed

         over      it was all out of shape and it had come out of the ground-          Theref

         were some people collecting clothes and shoes together and putting

         them in a pile in the corner-              I could see on the concrete floor of

         the pen what seemed to be blood-

         We decided we had seen enough and                 said lets go to where his dad

         was and we went and met him in the North Stand-              As we had come down

         out of West Stand we had seen ambulances and people crying and

         shouting-      After we met up with              Dad and sister-   We did not know

         whe r e        was,   so we went back to the car to see if he was th e r e .

         Just before we got to the car we saw                 walkinq towards us-    He had

         his scarf wrapped around his hand because someone

         On the way back to the car a woman had^ invited us

         we could phone home

         We eventually left Sheffield

                I arn a L X v ^ p ^ J l   supporter and have                    been for the        last fifteen years              I

                have a season ticket               for the Kop at Liverpool                   and    I also     travel       to

                a 11 the i r away mat c he s .

                About a week before              the Semi            Final    of the FA Cup my father               bought me a

                ticket    for the match between Liverpool                            FC and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

                The    ticket       cost £6.00 and waiK^for standing at the Leppings Ln end of

                the ground.           I have     been to this              pi^ace before       for a Semi       Final.

                At about       1140 hours        on Saturday the                1\f,h of April       1989    (130489)        I left

                A n f i e l d on a coach to att e n d the FA Cup Semi                        Final    at H i l l s b o r o u g h

                Stadium.           I was travelling            by myself a l t h o u g h all         the other         persons      on
                                                                                                                       PAG E         2
                                                                                                                       5940

              the coach were Liverpool fans,
                       e - T T  t c a ^ ic
               e were held up on the M62 for a while                           but    it w a s n ’t too bad.           The

              journey then            continued alright,             then just       before we got       into S h e f f i e l d
                     cat          cohort-                                <3y <°oviol
              the    coach was         stopped by the Police.                 I think we had just            come off          the

              motorway.           Two P o l i c e me n got onto the           coach and a sked us          if we had

              tickets       for    the game.          We all     just held our         tickets      up and they just

              had a look at them,                We then       continued our journey towards                  the ground.

              E v e n tu a l l y we    parked about          half a mile      from the ground on the                 road.

              We had to drive            past the ground to do this                  but there were          no    problems.

              We have       parked there         before       on previous m a t c h days.            I then got         off

              the    coach and began walking                  towards    the ground with a few of the

              I could see quite a few people                        queuing up to get         in.    There        d i d n ’t

She was all          di s c o l o u r e d    I think   perhaps     dead.

I c a n ’t really say any more about                      the    people ar o u n d me as      I was         in

shock myself.                 I ’d injured         my neck and     I nearly fainted.

S o m e b o d y then dragged me out and sat ms up by the fence                             out the way,

I don't        know who.

E v e n t u a l l y a P ol ic e m a n       picked me up and took me           out through the tunnel

and     laid me down o^tl^ft^n.oor to recover.                           I d o n ’t know what     time              it

was     by now and            I had also       lost my watch.

I. recovered e v entually and saw my two mates                            so   I went   out the      ground

w ith    them.       Then       I made my way to the             coach    phoning my       parents      on the

way     to it.       My two mates                   and            and anot h e r    lad             s ai■i ct’ i

that     they had got            in whe n the gate was            opened after       the kick     off,              but

I d o n ’t know their             surnames         or where they       live.    If I see      them      I ’ll

tell     them to      phone       the Police.

The     only    reason         I can think         of for the    crush was that too           many      people

came     into our Pen after                 the    gate was opened outside.             It seemed

alri g h t     before     then.

I think        the Stewards and Police were                     just   panicked by what        happened

and at       first    they d i d n ’t know what              to do.      I think    they thought           there

w ou ld be a pitch              invasion,         not that    people were      being    crushed.

This     isx^really all           I can remember afc^s^it what             happened.

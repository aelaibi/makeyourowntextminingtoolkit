car    in a side         road near         to the S Stand,             There were           no    pubs open by

the    ground       so we went           to the opposite          side      of the      town to find a pub

that was          open and have a drink.                  We    t r a v e l l e d a couple of miles away

f r orn t Ine g r o and.



We    came       back to the g r o u nd at about                14,25 hours          ( 1 4 2 5 ) ■■    All    the way

corners.           There was        no tr ouble at all            on the way to the ground.                          I did

not    see anyone          d r i nking     in the street.            On our arrival               at the       ground

there were          no queues as           such just a mass            of    people,        thousands.            At

this       time all      five of us were               together.       We    joined       in the        crowd and

after a few minu t e s we ail                    got    separated.          1 was     getting          crushed so              I

got    out of the          crowd w al k e d a r o un d the          handrail        by the        river and

w a lk ed       down to the gate.               While    1 was > £ o o d     there      I could see            one     or

two    fans       climbing        over    the    tur^st iyH?s.       I could see the                  crush from

w he r e    1 was     standing and          it looked very bad.                I was glad              1 was     mrt       in

it.        As    I was   stood by the            gate w ith other           people the g a                     u e n I.y

asked       for    it.     I stood about           for a few mint u e s         until about                 14.50 hours

could get around the                 end of the W SHfand and on to the terraces                                 in P^fss

was    full       in there        but you/^could still            move about          if you wanted to.                        I

could see          into Pen 3 ysfhd it            looked v ery full           but     I did not             realise

It w o u ld be about              14.55 hours       < 1 4 5 5 )v w h e n    I took up my m a t c h viewing

position.            T here was      no-one     drinking         inside          the ground.              There were

no fights         or any drunks.



The m a t c h kick e d - o f f       and    I had no idea that                   there were any              problems       in

Pens 3 and 4.               The   first    that    I knew was              that    the m a t c h was          stopped.

S om e o n e    near to me had a radio and they said that                                    there were        people -

injured and that was why                    it had b e e p ^ s t o p p e d .           I then saw people              being

p assed over          the    front    of Perk 3/o n t o        the Pitch.               They       looked     injured.

I saw some of them g iven mouth~-to-mouth and then being                                             covertfti up.

There        were also       people    climbing        over      the       fence       from P enVs         into the Pen

where        1 was.



At a bout        this    time     15.10 hours         <1510)       1 saw J o hn                    IS he was        in

the same Pen as me taut a bit further                            down.           He a sked me         if I had

seen any of the o t h e r s .               I said     I hadn't.             He    said he had been

se pa ra te d from them and                not seen any of them.



We    stood there           for about       fifteen rp£riutes, during                       this   time      people were

still        being    passed out       of Pe\y>5 onto            the       pitc h .         Then Mark R I C H A R D S

came     from the        pitch through Pen 2. a n d saw us.                            He    ca m e o v e r a n d s a i d

he had been with A n d r e w 3 RQ Q K E S              in Pen 4 .            They had been s e p a r a t e d a nd

he did not know where                 he was.



J ohn H A R RI S      then went       back     to the      car    to see          if                          was    there

Mark R IC H A R D S and myself w a i t e d to see                   if we         could see               d rew .   We

w a i t ed     for about anot h e r        ten minutes           then d e c i d e d          to go back        to the

car          I have     no idea what         the   time was.               But    there were no more                 people

being       helped out    o f Pe n 3.            When we got     back     to the       car

was    there with J o h n .



We all       wa i t e d by the       car     for about     thirty minutes          then Joh n and

went       to the hospital           to see      if A n d r e w was    there.      They came      back after

ab o u t    an hour.     They said he was not on the                     list of       injured,        We

de ci de d to go back          to the hospital             and wait.          We all    phoned home and

we    phoned A n d r ew 's     parents        to see     if he had been          in touch.         He had not

so we w a i te d at the hospital.



At    the    hospital, we      spoke       to a Social W o r k e r who          look a d e s c r i p t i o n of

Andrew.        They had a special                room set aside         for    this.     We were       given

tea and       coffee.     We just wa i t e d again.              Descriptions           of the dead, were

being       given by a doctor           to see      if anyone         could    identify them.



At about       9 pm ( £ 1 0 0 )      we were told that          there     was a bus laid          on to      go

to a Scout        hut where          we cou 1 d find out mo re i nf o rrnation,                When we       got

there all        they did was          take another         d es c r i p t i o n off us,      a gain   it was a

Social       Worker    that    did     it.       They told us to wait and if there was any

i n f o rrna.t i o n we wo u 1 d be t a 1 d ,



 is heard that all            the    bodies were at          the Gymnast urn

ground and that          e v e n t u a l l y they w o u l d take        us all    there.



We deci d e d     to go and get            the    car from the         hospital.       As we walked

outs i d e    the Scout       hut a taxi          driver    stopped us and said he w ould                   take

us a n y w h e re we w a nt ed       to go without          charge.



He    drop p e d myself       and John at the ground and the other                           two he took to

the    hospital       to get     the    car.

    At the       gr o u n d by the Gy m there was a bus                    For everyone        to wait       on,

    Whi 1 e we we r e wa.i t i ng                    and Mark    came       back.                 came onto        the

    bus w i t h us and Mark           stayed         in the   car.         He   did not want         to    come wit h

    us,



    A f t e r a while we were           taken        into a small          room by the Gym w h i c h had

    boards w i th all          the   p h o t o graphs    of the dead on them.                  All      numbered.

    We were a sk e d to          look at      them to see        if we          could    identify anyone,           if

    we did to say w h i c h          number         it was.     We    looked and we saw A n d r e w ”s

    p icture        on the first       b o a r d.



    We were J m e n taken            into   the mai n     part       of the G ^ ^ and. tj>ey brought

    A n d n g / in on a t ro l l e y and            1 was able       to    ident^fry h i m .       We     then made a

    s ta te m e n t    of   identification.            We were       told that          if we w a n t e d to stay

    the night we            could and a c c o m m o d a t i o n w o u l d be found for us.                  Or we

    could       have a lift       home.       We decided we w o u l d all                go home     together       in

    the    car.



    Wh i ls t    I was      in the    ground        I did not see any tiling I consider                     to be a

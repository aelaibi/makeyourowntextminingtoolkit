        I have recently received a letter and report about the
        Hillsborough Disaster, prepared by Irvine Patnick MP. I enclose
        copies of these documents for your attention.

        You will see that Mr Patnick has offered to supply further
        details to the criminal investigation, expanding upon those
        matters mentioned in his report.     It may well be that your
        investigation team has already considered this information, as
        I understand Mr Patnick supplied a copy of his report to the
        public enquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor.

         I have passed copies of this correspondence to Colin Cleugh, who
         is the Head of my Police Complaints Division and is dealing with
         this file.  A copy of my reply to Mr Patnick is attached.

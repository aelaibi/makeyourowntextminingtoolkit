     Dear Jonathan,
     HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
     As I think you know David Brummell and I visited the Police HQ in Birmingham on
     Friday. We were impressed with their organisation and they seemed to have
     covered every aspect of inquiry. I enclose a copy of their presently intended
     programme.
     On Administrative matters for the Inquiry may I set out out present thoughts?
     At the Inquiry Counsel and our team will need the following
     1.         A typist (who will need a machine compatible to Counsel's or our
                machine here).
     2.         Access to your photocopier.
     3.         Two rooms. One private and one general office. For the latter we will
                need four desks, sufficient chairs, lockable filing cabinets, general
                HMSO stationery etc.
     4.         Two telephones and a fax (or the usethereof).
     5.         Lunch for six.
     6.         Car parking facilities for one vehicle.
     We may also need T.V. and video viewing facilities.
     I take it that the Secretariat will also arrange for shorthand writers for the
     Preliminary meeting and throughout the Inquiry.
     We have warned the Police that we will need a HOLMES terminal and an operator
     at the Inquiry.
     If any further copies of past reports etc are required please let me know.                       I
     enclose our latest list of relevant documents.
     Yours sincerely,.         .

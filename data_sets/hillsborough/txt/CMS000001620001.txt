     You copied to me Mr. Anderton•s letter of 24th November with
a request for advice.


     I am not sure that I can usefully add to what I have already
said on the subject. As your letter of 2nd October explained, we
think that chief constables ought to be very wary of placing
fetters on their operational independence and of making the
policing of football matches a matter of contractual obligation
different from the provision of special services under section 15
of the Police Act 1964.       I would have thought that the insurers
too would wish to avoid any agreements which might make police
forces liable not only in negligence but also for breach of
contract.   On the other hand, if it is possible to have a standard
form of statement of intent on the lines we have suggested, there
seems nothing wrong with that.      I am not in a position to judge
whether standardization is really possible given what I presume to
be a range of different circumstances at different football clubs.

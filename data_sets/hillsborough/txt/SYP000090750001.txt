              We travel led straight to Sheffield we/were delayed by heavy traffic

remember seeing any Police Officers on the way tra the ground.

I did not see anyone fighting or any drunkena%s on the way to the

ground.        When we arrived at the ground at yjfbout 14.10 hrs             (1410)    there

were no queues just          mass of people     pusj^ing and s h o vi ng.     We just

joined in the crowd.          It took us atfoiUt 15 minutes to get to the

turnstiles.         It was quite crushed byt no worse t t y f n     I have experienced

bef o r e .

I remember seeing Police Officers on the Jtfcrnsti1es but I did not see

any ste wa rds.       Iy<id not see anyone cL^rnbing over the walls to get in

and I did notyiee any gates open oitpr than the turnstiles.                      I went

through a tji^nstile and handed my ticket in.

Once    k'nsyfe the ground I knew where I was going to go,             I have been to

Hi 11 sbtfrough 4 times before,       I d id ^ w t   see any signs directing people

where to go I knew I was going Jso go down the tunnel.

There were no Police Officer;? or Stewards at the entrance to the
           A.
tunnel        I went down the tuj&el and had no problems going through it.

Once I got to the end V n e       pens were quite fuy,.

I made my way into PenJjLand with                    wey'got to the middle of the

pen.     It would be sdjfiehwe/e about       14,      (1430) - 1440 hrs       <1440).     We

were getting quite sqtlashed and pushed around so we decided to move

down to the front because         it looked to be quieter down there.

We had quite a bit of difficulty getting down to the front.                      It took

us a few minutes to get where we wanted to ba<f               We eventually stood

about 2 people back from the front f e n c e ?/and near to the centre fence

We were not getting shoved about thera<               At about 14.55        (1455)   there

was a big surge from behind and I j^as squashed against the fence.                        I

was separated from              a^d dic^iot see him until        I was on the pitch

late r .

Usually at matches when there is a surge               like this after a minute or

two the pressure eases off.           This time it did not the pressure kept
                                                                                 PAGE        3
                                                                                 S3501

increasing.       I was against the fence and could not move I was squashed

up against two g i r l s .    I think they were about 17-18 yrs of age.                One

had brown or black h a i r .      Both were wearing blue je a n s , the one with

the dark hair had a Liverpool scarf on.

As I was squashed against them they were screaming for a while then

they just stopped.        I do not know whether ^hey had just passed out or

had died.

I ended up in a heap of people and wad» stuck the re for about              10

minutes.     I could not move from m V w a i s t     down to my feet was just

trapped by other people.          Host p f f the people by me were unconscious.

I looked around and saw               pbout 6 feet away from me.        He was lying

on the floor and there were/other           people lying on top of his legs he

was not moving.       Thei\ I myst have passed out because the ne^<t thing I

remember is waking up W          the pitch.     There were two St >fohns Ambulance

men with me.      One had been pumping on my chest aslI^i?oke up.            The

other one was holding rny nose and I presumed I had been given mouth to

mouth.

They asked me if I was feeling alright             1 said I was and they helped me

walk towards the centre circle and sat me down and put my head between

my legs and      told me to take deep breaths.

I was there      for a couple of m i n u t e s . 7 I felt a   bit better and got       up

and went to look for                 I was / o o k i n g all over the pitch for    him.

After about      15 minutes I found h/m.       He was by      the left hand goal

post.    He was lying on the f 1o p r with a tube sticking out of his

mouth.     There were about A airpulance men by him.            They were trying to

revive h i m .   I went over -^o /urn and tried to speak to him.

Someone said to me,       if youl/are feeling alright please g o / a w a y .      It

could have been an Ambulance man or a Policeman I do >fot know.

I walked around the pitch for a bit and there was r n              announcement over

the tannoy system that the game was being abandcyned.

I went back through the tunnel and out of the ground back to the

coach.        I thought at that time that

 hen I  got home I told my dad what had happened and my mum and me went
 >      ;                            f
over to   _    parents to tell them what J m d happened.

 t about midnight          I went with            d§fd his mum,   his brother and a

friend of            dad back to Sheffie'

We went first to the Northern Gerygral H o s p ita l and found                    He was

in the intensive      care unit.         H^   mum and dad went to see him and

came back.      They stayed in Sheffield and myself,                  brother and his

 dads friend came home.

                                                                      offence.

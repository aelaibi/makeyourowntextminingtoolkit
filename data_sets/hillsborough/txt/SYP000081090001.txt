            We e v e n t u a ll y arri ve d                in S he f fi e ld at about 2.00pm.             (1400 hrs).         We

            e x p er i e n c ed no travel                  delays,     nor did we stop on route.                1 parked the

            car,    in Penistone Rd,                       on an exhaust       firms     forecourt.          We all    started

      ^     walking      for a matter                   of   15 yards awjy^ from our             c a r , when on the way,

< ^ s
            us were      ordered onto a                      Qs by the Police          who said we were             not allowed

            to walk      to the             grounau          Several     fans were       getting        onto the buses as

            My   remaining 3 f r i e n d s                            t r a velled all     the way to the ground by

            bus.       My ticket was                   for   the S pion Hop entrance where,                  I saw a lot of

            L iver■poof^f^ifns
                   poo         drinking and a ttempting                             to buy tickets.            I a r r i v e d at

            this    point          just      before 2.30          pm.    (1430 hrs).          There were       no

            d irections            given that              I can remember either            by Police        or stewards

            a l t h o u g h access           and entry turnstiles                to the ground were            easily

            recognisable.                   I entered          the ground and handed my ticket                  in.        Iwo of

            my friends                           and            were    taiden away      just    before      by the Police

            for singing                                         angi I don't      think     people       bel ieved him and

            thought      he was being                   unri



            Once    inside            the ground,            there was a l re ad y a         large gathering          of Forest

            supporters.                   Some    time afterwards,            I was    told by someone that                some

                        had forced open some gatej/oy                                    the S pi on Kop end.              Another

          Notts,    stated that S Liverpool              f jrfCwith a      " g r a p p l i n g ’ hook were

also     trying    to g e t   ,




As    I stood     in the S pion Kop,          the    crowd^qu/ckly        became more denser a nd

I Felt     being    crushed to such an extent                 that    I started to panic,         Some

of the N o t t in g ha m fans were           figpn, i n g amongst      themselves.      The   crushing

effect     became worse and           peoplss began to fall.             I became    d is tr e ss e d and

f r i g h t e n e d and felt      pain.     I even tu al ly got out of the          crush after

about     13 minutes,      there were         too many       people    in that stand area,        who,

because       of the    crushing      situation were          losing    tempers and     probably

caused them to fight.



It became       known that         due to    crowd   problems,        the game was abandoned.            I

left     the ground,      together with                                at about 3.45     pm   (1545

hrs) .


At about 4.00          pm (£000 hrs),         whilst    outside       the ground    I saw some      fans

fighting      between each other.              I thought       it better    to leave     it all

behind and head towards               the    car.    However,        a short distance      on along

the    road    I saw a N o t t i ng h a m Forest       fan    punch a Liverpool       fan to the

ground.       He was    kicked       several    times    before       some other fans w av ed down

a passing Police m o t or cy cl is t and             p resumably told him what was

happening.         S h o r t l y a ft er wa rd s a police      car    came along and took        one of

those     responsible      for fighting away.



I continued my way back               to the    car before       returning     home without any

more     serious    problems.

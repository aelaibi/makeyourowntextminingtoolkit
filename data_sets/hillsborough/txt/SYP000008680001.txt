               Hillsborough,                 Sheffield.




               I was         in    c-qmpany w i t h           several            other    people           including        the w i t n e s s

               About         1.30       pm   (1330       hrs)        the     same       d a y we     entered        the P e n i s t o n e        Rd

               Spion         Hop    terrace.            We      were       standing           to    th e    right     of    the S p i o n H o p as

               area      that       had      been      allocated             to L i v e r p o o l      supporters.




               On my         arrival         inside          th e    ground         I saw       that       Liverpool        supporters            were

               already            in the        Leppings            Ln    terrace        area.         There    appeared            to     be    three

               sections,            one      central          section            in w h i c h      I could     se e    an    entrance            / e xi t

               at     th e    rear       and     two    wing         sections.            The       wing     sections        were        la r ge r .

               The     right        wing,        as    I looked was                 rising         steeply     at     the    same        angle        with

               the     seating           above        th e    centre         section.

               The     centre           section M             this        time     was    full,        probably        not     to     capacity          but

                 ^over ^bt^owded a nd               this       caused       me    such      concern^that              I passed         comment,

(i-AOj/(i,       unless        something            was    done       to    remedy        th is,      which        could    have       been    to

                 transfer          supporters             to    either       th e     left      or    right        wings,     people        would        be

                 seriously             injured       in th e         centre       section.




                 The    left       wing       was    now       confortably            filled         but     not    near    capacity.           The

                 right       wing       was    comfortably             filled         in,    the      area alongside              the    seating.

                 However,          the       area    adjacent          to    the      centre         stand was         still      mostly       emp t y .

                 In a       small       area    around          the    gate       previously             mentioned         between       the

                 sections          there       was    a    crowd       comfortably              packed.            This    was    about       one

                 third       of    the       area    available,             the     rest     of      th e    se ct i o n was      virtually

                 empty.           There       was    no    obvious          explanation              fo r    this.




                 At    no    stage       could       I see       Police          or S t e w a r d s      inside       the L e p p i n g s     Lane

                 sections.

                    then    very        quickly           onto       the    pitch.



                     (It w a s     not       u n t il     several          hours       after        the        event       t h at     I was       aware         that

                    there        had    been a            'surge*          t il l     the       rear      of    the       centre s e c t i o n         of      the

                    Lappings           Ln    end).




                    What        I saw       then       I believed           to      be as        a direct            result         of    the

                    overcrowding              in the           Centre       section          on     the        terrace.




                    After        the    players           and    officials             had       l ef t    the       field       the      first        injured

                    began        arriving           in    front       of    the       Penistone            Rd       and South Stands.                      It w a s

    ^               obvious       to me        they were             suffering             the     effects           of    being         c ru s h e d .

                    Very        shortly       the        first       b ody was         taken        out        of    the    ground          near     to w h e r e      I

                    stood.         I was          in     no w a y     suprised             having         regard          for    the      amount          of

                    people        in the          centre        section          to    see       these         injured          and      fatally          injured

                    people.            I would           estimate          that       about       fifteen            bodies         were      removed          from

                    the    pitch        ne a r      to m y      p o s i t i o n an d an           uncountable               number          of    injured.




                    Whilst        shocked           I was       in    no w a y        suprised            at    what       I saw.




        ^           On   th e    pitch       I saw        people       di e      due       to    th e     fact       there       were       people          about

                    who    did     not       know        how    to    give       artificial               respiration.



                    Although           I tried            I was       unable          to    find        a gate        l e a d ing f r o m        the

                    Penistone           Rd    terrace           onto       the      pitch.          All        exits       led      out    of    the       ground

                    were        there       any     gates       I can       state       that        they        were       in no w a y m a r k e d .

                f a were       dogs         lined     up     virtually            the w i d t h      of    the     pitch.          This       was

    T M     r        another           tactic       by the P o l i c e            which      I could         not      understand.                 There        was

M       fyjQ fl I    never       anything           to     suggest            that    Forest      supporters             would         invade          the

                     pitch.            There       were     no w       officers        lined      up      in f r o n t      of    the K o p        and       the

                     or    instructing              them       in a n y        way.      The    tannoy          announcement                that       the     game

                     was      finally         a b a n d o n e d was           very    poor,     in so m u c h          t ha t     it g a ve        po e p l e

                     didn't        leave       the       ground          to    prevent       congestion            outside         the       ground.              The

                    announcement               should         have          been much        more      positive          and      either          told

             this    was     bringing        the      extra      PSU's        into    the       ground.         By      doing    this*   the

             been     dismay and        shock         on   the    terraces.            The       senior       officers          should

             have     realised        that     the     crowd were             behind       them again,           and      they

             obviously        had     their     reasons          for    doing        what       they    did.

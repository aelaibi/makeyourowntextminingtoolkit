                                                                                   25th A p r i l , 1989


 The Right Honourable Lord J u s t i c e Taylor,
 c / o H i ll sb o r o u g h Enquiry,
 The Chi ef S u pe ri n t en d en t ,
 E c c le s fie ld Police Station,
 The Common,
 Ecclesfield,
 S h e f f i e l d , Yorkshire


 My Lord,

 As a Liverpool f o o t b a l l support er who has had some y e a r s i nvo l ved in crowd
 c on t r o l w i t h i n U.K. and o v e r s e a s p o l i c e and armed f o r c e s . May I make the
 following observation.

     In so f a r as alcohol may have played some p a r t in the d i s a s t e r at Hi ll sb o ro u gh .
     Should we not take s t e p s to l i m i t the amount o f alcohol consumed p r i o r to
     a t t endanc e at the match.

 The F.A. have stopped alcohol being consumed w i t h in the ground but t h i s w i l l
 have on l y marginal e f f e c t i f l a r g e p o r t i o n s o f the crowd have been drinking
 o f t e n from midday t o 2 . 3 0 or 3 . 0 0 , k i c k - o f f t ime, in pubs around the ground.

 Res chedul ing the k i c k - o f f time at major matches where l a r g e crowds are expected
 would undoubtedly help.

     I would s u g g e s t a k i c k - o f f time o f 11. 30 a.m.   This would have the e f f e c t o f : -

     1.         Pr even t in g l a r g e crowds a r r i v i n g a t the ground wit h t h e i r judgement
                impaired in whatever way by v a r i a b l e amounts o f alcohol making crowd
                behaviour more s t a b l e .

 2.             Fo l lowi ng the match somewhat more sober crowds would d i s p e r s e to
                s m a l l e r groups in t h e i r l o c a l pubs t o commence t h e i r drinking i f
                d e s i r e d and, indeeed d i s e c t the game a l s o .

 I cannot , o f c o u r s e , pre-empt the f i n d i n g s o f the enquiry but i t may well f in d
                 t h a t alcohol played some p a rt in the crowd cont ro l proplems at
 H i l l s bo r o u g h .

The Right Honourable Lord J u s t i c e Taylor,




Liverpool and Everton a l r e a dy r e - s c h e d u l e morning k i c k - o f f s on the
Saturday o f the Grand National t o a s s i s t in crowd c o n t r o l , so t h i s i s
not such a r ad ic al s u g g e s t i o n .

I h o n e s t l y b e l i e v e the long s t a ndi ng t r a d i t i o n o f k i c k - o f f taking p l ac e
a t pub c l o s i n g time must now be changed, a f t e r a l l i s not the atmosphere
o f a f o o t b a l l stadium h i g h l y charged enough w i t h o u t the added s t i m u l a t i o n
t h a t al c ohol undoubtedly p r o v i d e s .

                                                           26th April, L



Dear Sir,

I would like to take this opportunity to highlight one of the problems which I
believe contributed to the Hillsborough D isaster.

As one of the Liverpool Supporters arriving la te due to the hold-ups on the
roads leading into Sheffield, 1 along with my m other and friend took our
positions a t 2.40 p.m. a t th e Leppings Lane End expecting to enter the ground
through the turnstiles and, as we all now know, the decision was taken by the
Police to open the g a te and, as holders of tic k e ts for the North Stand, my
m other and I e n tered through th a t gate. Our friend had le ft us to en te r the
West Stand.

Once through the g a te we approached a Police O fficer for directions to our
Stand. He was a t the tim e closing the inner gates, th e access to th e West
Stand and te rra c e s, th e tim e would be approxim ately 3.00 p.m.

I was fam iliar with th a t a re a as we had been to the Semi Final the previous
year and had been seated in the West Stand. I did not a tta c h too much
im portance to the incident a t the tim e. We then proceeded to our seats. By
this tim e the m atch had been in play for 5 minutes. We all know what
happended next.

At tJ-AO p.m. we w ere told the m atch had been abandoned and asked not to
leave the ground im m ediately as clear access was needed for the ambulances.
This instruction we respected.

Eventually my m other and I m et up with our friend and on exchanging
conversation discovered th a t as she had tried to e n te r the g a te a t the opposite
end to Leppings Lane, this too was closed. She insisted th a t it be opened and
on producting her tic k e t she had been allowed through. She believes she was
the last person to be allowed through th a t gate.

That draws me to one conclusion, w here could our Supporters go. Their
only option was the middle tunnel. Question - Why w ere the two gates
closed? In my opinion, it was because the m atch had kicked off and
instructions must have been given to close the gates. A wrong decision when
so many Supporters w ere still outside th e ground.

One final point, both my m other and I still have our com plete m atch tic k e t.

I tru s t this information will be of some help in your a tte m p t to investigate
the tragic and unnecessary disaster a t Hillsborough April, 1989.

Yours faithfully,

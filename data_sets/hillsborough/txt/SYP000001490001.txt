I d i d n ’I XtLiy/e to find              my way, I was           just     carried along with                the

crowd,,        I don't       think        my   feet even          touched        the    floor t h r o u g h the

tunnel        behind    the     goal.          11 was wail            to wa 13. s o lid w 11 h p e o p 1 e               we

were m o v i n g , not at a               running pace            because        the     crowd w o u l d n ' t     allow

that     but    it was       quite        a quick pace            with       short      steps, you      c o u l d n ’t

It was        pitch alack          in the       tunnel?         all    you    could      see was       the    1 :i.ght at

the     end of the          tunnel,.

F rom    the moment          I got     t h r o u g h the metal            railed        gates    it was       one

At    the end of the            tunnel         1 was      swept       to t h e    right and        ended up         in

ref ere n c & jifro w 11 r\o u t any           effort       it just       flowed,        there was        nothing

you     could do.           Once    I was       in that         position         it was     then    I became

aware     people       had gone        down      in front         of us and           people     had    come       in

behind us        it was        solid.          I became         aware     1 was       actually      treading            on

people and had              no where       to go.           There was a sa d d e n silence                   and    the

crowd     seemed for           no e x p l a i n a b l e     reason to         pull      b a c k , it was      then       I

I noticed        one    lad     in particular               about      S3 years         he seemed       to    be

trapped        by his       legs,    we    pulled         him    clear a n d tried                 give      him    the

kiss     of    life    but a p o liceman            said        it was       no use^r       I was      right       by

the     b a r r i e r , there were         loads       on    it when         it ygave way,         we all

fell     but    I managed          to get       back      up,    a iok^udn't.               After      it had

give w ay       it seemed          to ease and            the    crowd went           back a bit.

1 could see a lot of                  people were            not going           to   get   up again,         it

               H i l l s b o r o u g h between L i v e rpool        and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.              I got my £1 0 . 0 0

               ticket        for the S S tand from the She/rfield W e d n e s d a y F. C.                             via my son

                             ,    knowing     the area and th*? ground                very well,         I set out          from

home at about            1.55pm    (1355)    and got       to S h e f f i e l d at about 2.20pm.           I

p arked my       car on a tem p o r a r y     car    park somewhere          off Herries       Rd and

made my way to the ground.                  On route       I saw two moun t e d Police Officers

having      to deal w ith a couple            of Liverpool          fans who were        carrying       cans

of     beer and obv i o u s l y the worse           for wear       due /to the drink.        Also     on
                                                                   /
route      I. passed a number         of    pubs w hich were' open and o b v iously doing a

good     trade        because   there were      lots of/fans           drinking    in the    pubs.
----------------------------------------- 7 * ------------------------ :---------- .
As I got to the ground at about 2. 3 u p m (1430) I was surprised by the
                                        /
 lack of people around the g r o u n d/along P e n i s t o n e Rd and outside the S

Stand,      knowing       the   layout     I assu m e d    that all       the Notts Forest        fans

must      have a lr e a d y got     into tjl^e ground.          After     collecting my ticket              from

the ground            I made my way       to the toilet at          the end of the S S t a n d near

the Lepp ings Ln end of the ground.                       I was a gain s u rprised         because      of

the      crush    I had to e xperi ence         getting         in and    out of the toilet,          it was

quite a crush w hich              is unusual     for a seating area toilet.                 F r o m there      I

made      my way to my seat,          w hich was      in the uneven section of the S S tand

Row 00 seat 26,            which    I found was about             7 rows    from the track wall

near      to Leppings Ln end of the ground.                      I must    have arri v e d at     the       seat

a bout 2 . 5 0 p m      (1450),    well    I ’d only been there a minute               or so when the

players       came out      onto    the    pitch.

F r om    past exper i e n c e and also         to help with my scouting when w a t ching

an d     studying       players    I always     now take my binoculars              to matches with

me,      I was    to find these       very useful          that afternoon.

W h e n Li verpool        came out    they made       their way to the Leppings                Ln end to

where      their s upporters         were massed.          Bruce GROBBELAR,         the Liverpool

goalkeeper,            when making    towards       the goal       kicked a ball w h i c h hit the

upright       and went      over    the goal and          landed    in between the wall           and the

a dv er t i s i n g    hoardings.    As a matter          of    interest    I watc h e d GRO B B E L A R

young lad crushed up ag a i n t                  tIte fenc:e w ith his face                    pushe d int a the

fence,       making      his face distorted,               it was         obvious     to me that         the young

boy was       in some         distress.     I carried on looking at this

situation,        because        it was     causing me some                   concern,      I looked along           the

rest of       the fence a n d a l t h o u g h         1 couldn't           see anyb o d y else         crushed

agai n s t    the fence         it was     obvious       to me that             towards      the front      of the

t e r racin g    behind        the goal,       the fans were              getting      crushed but as            I

moved     towards        the middle and back of the terraces                               there still a p p e a r e d

to be space,            and    I also    saw that        lots of          people were          still   entering

the    terraces         thro u g h the     tunnel.       I also        noticed at this time                that

there was        still        plenty of     room      in the ad j o i n i n g         terracing.       Scanning

back, towards           the    lad    I now saw that/Pol icemen were                        climbing     onto        the

fence and gesturing to fans at t/fe back of the terraces to push back.

Fans were now climbing over tKe fence onto the track, climbing over

the    fences     into the a d j oi n / n g terraces                  and also        being     pulled up        into

the    seats.     My first           reaoaion was        that     the         idiots are       playing     up again

and that        they were trying            to    invade      the      pitch.       From then on my

a t t e n t i o n was    taken up w a t c h i n g      the events              in the terraces          rather           than

watching        the match,           because     I was having             d i f f i c u l t y believing what              I
                                                                          /

I was aware         that       the m at c h had k icked/off                   so   I was    scanning     back and

f orth and       I now saw that            fans were        cni the           track and behind the goal,                       I

could see about a dozen Police                        O f f i c ers    standing        on the fence         urging

fans    to stop         pushing and to pusbr back                 but to no avail,               because     I

could still        see        fans    coming a j/ t    of the         tunnel        into the terraces.               I

scan n e d    back to the            fence and     could see more                  people being        crushed

in the       fence area of the             terraces.        More and more              people were         trying             to

get    out of the         pens onto        the    pitch or        into         the seats and still           the

Pol i c e were     urging        the    fans     to stop      pushing.

The    next     thing     I recall was           the Police           Inspector        running      anto    the

           p i t c h and stopping           the m ate h bee a use of t,h e crowd               p r o b 1 e m . Gy n o w rny

           view    through the         binocula rs was           becoming       somewhat       o b s t r u c t e d due   to

           the    numbers     of Police,        press and fans now on the track and fence.                                 The

           next    thing     I saw was two P o li ce me n working                 hard on a young             lad who was

           lying    on the        pitch right        in front         of me.    These    two O f f i cers      tried to

           revive     this young        lad wit h m ou t h to m o u t h and heart massage                      for about

           fifteen to twenty minu t e s                 before    they    carried him away.              It was at this

           time    that      I realised that            this was a lot more             serious        than at
                                                              c^v-r     p a -(
           first    thought,        but there was             no message       over   the P A system telling                    us

           what was       happening.         I continued         to w atch the        events      in the terraces

           unfold     in front        of me,     I could        now see P o 1 iceyOfficers              trying      to    pull

           the    fences      down w ith their           bare    hands.     Itydas about          this time         that       I

CA"I       saw a barrier            thrown over         the    fence    b^/the Liverpool            fans,     thi

           barrier was a c t u al ly          the    top sectij/fi of a barrier w hich was                      blue      in

           go a l p o s t s and     landed on t h e /track            like a javelin,          before      falling        onto

           the    grass.      If that bar        iy m    hit anyone        it may have         killed them and             it

           must    have      taken two or three               people    to have       thrown     it.

           By now     its about 3 . 2 0 p m         (1520)      and    I am awart ' t h a t      there are a lot of
                                                 o r r
           people     badly       injured and fans were                carryjt'ng the     injured on ad v e r t i s i n g

           boards     they have        ripped down and            runnrfng with         the boards and the

           injured towards            the    p a ssageway       between the N Stand and S p i o n Kop.                     I

           then saw the           first a mb ul a n c e .%/rive and            it seemed       to take ages          for       it

           to get ar o u n d thie pitch to Vthe terraces.                       I just    c o u l d n ’t believe          the

           lack of medical            faci l i t i e s available,          no stretchers,           no medication,

           e ve r y t h i n g was    so disorganised.

           A f t e r w a t ching     this and still            seeing    that    the Police were            still        having

           d if fi cu lt y    in getting       the      fences    down,     I decided       I w ould try and get

           hold of the g ro u n d s m a n        to suggest           that a tractor       be used to           pull      the

           fences     down,       but after      speaking        to a P o l i c e w o m a n outside        the S Stand,
                                                                                                     P AGE     5

             this was       no t possible,     so I d e c ided at   this   time that   there was      still

             a   po s s i b i l i t y of trouble   between the two    sets   of supporters,     so    I

             deci d e d to    leave   the   ground and make my way back to the           car,   so    I left

             the    ground at about 3 . 5 5 p m      (1555).

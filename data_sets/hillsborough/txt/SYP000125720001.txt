AS I WAS SAYING IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE GAME STARTED THAT PEOPLE SEEMED TO
NOTICE THE OVERSPILL WITHIN THE GAME AS THE GAME WAS STOPPED PEOPLE BEGAN TO
SPILL ON TO THE PITCH IN THE PENALTY AREA AT APPROX 1510 AN AMBULANCE ENTERED
THE GROUND AND PARKED BEHIND THE GOAL POSTS I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHY A FEW
MINUTES LATER ABOUT 150 POLICE OFFICERS ENTERED THE GROUND BUT THEY DID NMOT
SEEM TO DO ANYTHING THEY JUST STOOD IN A LINE FACING THE NORTH STAND THE
LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS TRIED TO GET THE POLICE TO GO OVER TO THE TROUBLED AREA
BUT THEY DID NOT. AT ABOUT 1530 THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS DECIDED TOI ORGANISE
THERE SELVES AND MAKE STRETCHERS THEY BROKE THROUGH THE POLICE LINES AND MADE
THE STRETCHERS FROM ADVERTISING BOARDS SOME TIME LATER ANOTHER AMBULANCE
ARRIVED AT 1530 THERE WAS A TANNOY MESSAGE TO ASDK PEOPLE TO CLEAR THE
P ® H SO I WENT FOR A CUP OF COFFEE WITH MY SON AT 1540 WE WERE TOLD THAT THE
MATCH WAS OVER SO WE LEFT WHEN WE GOT OUTSIDE ALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE
RELLY WORKING HARD THEY SEEMED TO HAVE REALIZED THE PROBLEM

I SUDDENLY FOUND THAT THE PRESSURE GAVE WAY AND I LUNGED FOR THE OPEN GATE. I
COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A MAN BESIDE ME WHO WAS DEAD. THE NEXT THING I
REMEMBER I WAS LYING ON THE PITCH WITH A POLICEMAN STANDING OVER ME, AND HE
FETCHED A ST JOHNS AMBULANCEMAN TO ME. I SAT AT THE SIDE OF THE STAND FOR A
LONG TIME TO GET MYSELF SORTED OUT. THEN I SAW A GIRL I KNOW WHO WAS BEING
CRUSHED AND I JUMPED OVER THE ADVERTISING HOARDINGS TO PULL HER OUT. THE
POLICE JUST WOULDN'T HELP ME. THE BOBBIES WERE JUST LINED UP ALONG THE CENTRE
OF THE PITCH DOING NOTHING. I HELPED AS MUCH AS I COULD, CARRYING DEAD
BOQIES, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO FIRST AID. I JUST HELPED WHERE I COULD,
CiaP&ING BODIES. THERE WAS A SENIOR POLICEMAN WITH BLACK BRAID ON HIS HAT
SHOUTING AT THE POLICE TO GET MOVING.
THERE WERE POLICE DOGS GETTING IN THE WAY AS WELL.
I WAS THERE WITH               . I DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS OR PHONE NUMBER.

I SAW THE PLAYERS WARMING UP, THEN EXPERIENCED AN ALMIGHTY CRUSH. THERE WAS A
LITTLE LAD BEHIND ME, AND HIS FATHER WAS TRYING TO GET ME OUT. I WAS
LITERALLY PUSHED UP OUT OF MY TRAINING SHOES AS I WAS TRYING TO STAY UPRIGHT.
THE HEAT AND CRUSH WAS UNBEARABLE. ALL I COULD SEE WAS ARMS AND FIGHTING
PEOPLE OFF WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO PUSH AGAINST YOU. I COULD SEE PEOPLE ON
THE FENCE TELLING US TO TRY TO PUSH BACK, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY YOU COULD. IT
SEEMED LIKE AGES BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONLY MINUTES BEFORE THEY OPENED THE
GATE. I WAS IN THE PEN TO THE RIGHT AS YOU COME OUT OF THE TUNNEL (PEN 3). I
WAS INJURED IN THE CRUSH.

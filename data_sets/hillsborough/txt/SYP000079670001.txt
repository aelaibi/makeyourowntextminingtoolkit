Upon      reaching           the     Lappings       Lane       turnstiles,            I had some            difficulty

locating          those        which     would       admit       spectators           with     terrace           tickets.




There       were       perhaps        4 or 5 t u r n s t i l e s         for    holders        of N o r t h S t a n d

I probably             entered        the    SH^rnst i les a b o u t           13.45       hours.          Having    passed

In aeed?         upon     leaving        the      policeman who            had     searched            m e , tne    oruy

entrance          to    the     terrace        immediately            in v i e w      was    the       tunnel      beneath       tne

never       stood       at     the    ground       before.



However          from my        knowledge          of    its     topography,           1 knew          from which         part    of

the    terrace          I would        be a b l e       to   obtain a          good    view       of    the      game,    that    is

to    say    on    the       high     terrace        banking        between        the      North and West               stands.

    Mysteriously,             tne      outside          sections         remained          under-used and                I    remember

    thinking          to m y s e l f    that       it was         ridiculous             that    so m a n y       people          were

    crammed       into       the m i d d l e       section         with       so    few    in the       adjoining             areas.




    So    great       was    the    number         of    people         in the       middle       section           that      at       about

    14.45      hours        I noted       the      crowd       swaying         and       pushing       down       to    the       f r on t

    before       regaining          its      previous          position.




    In the       days       before      vertical           fencing,           the    crowd       would       have       spread

    itself       out     naturally           from       the m i d d l e       to    the    outsides          by     people         making

    and    pushing          their      way     through         the m o r e         densely       occupied           par t s       of    the

    terrace       while       the      natural          sway      of    the    crowd would            make        sure       that       it

    found      its     own    level       by    dispersing              itself       across       the     whole         of    the

    terrace.




    Tne    fact       that    the      various          s ec ti on were            isolated       from       each       other          by

    virtue       of    the    vertical          fencing           and    the       locking       of   the     gates          at    tne       top

    of    that    fencing          rendered         t hi s     natural         movement          impossible.




    It w a s     quite       obvious         to me       long      before          the    kick    off     that         the    middle

    section       of     terracing           had    reached            saturation          p oint     and     could          not

    accommodate             any more         people.



    From    14.13        hours      until       1 5 .0 0     hours,       I was          amazed       that    more       and       more

    people       seemed       to    be a d m i 1 1 e d       to    t he rniddle           se c 1 1 on whi ie t ne             a utside

    sections          remained,         inexpli c a b l y , very much                     under-populated.

(AT       No a t t e m p t     was      made       by    theSjfai i ce           to    relieve          the    congestion           in tne

          middle       section          by    opening          the      gate      on the          perimeter          fencing        or    the

          9a t e s           the     top     of    the    vertical           fencing             and    relocate          spectators           in

          the    adjoining             areas       of    the       terrace.



          There       di d    not a p p e a r       to    be a n y        club        stewards          patrolling           the    track

          was    available             in o t h e r      sections           of    the       terracing.




          As    s o o n as      the     game       began,          my a t t e n t i o n       wa s     drawn    from       the     terraces          to

          the    field        of     play     but       it w a s      soon       obvious          that    there       wa s      fierce

          overcrowding               in the        middle          section        of     terrace         because          spectators           were

          a t t e m p t isw     to     climb       the    perimeter              fencing          and    were    also        being       pulled

          up    by o t h e r       *ans      into       the    west       stand        it s elf.




          As    more       and more          sp\ctyors              attempted            to      come    over    the       perimeter           fence
fau c £
          onto       the     tra c k    and       field       of    play,        I kept          watch    on    the       developing
 at
          circumstances                Put    initially             the     police          simply       tried       to    push     people

          uack       into     the      terrace          ana    prevent           them       from       climbing       out,       in m y    view

          somehow          failing         to a p p r e c i a t e       just      ho w      serious       things          were.




          No    doubt        the     police        felt       that      they were             dealing         with    crowd        disorder

          rather       than anything                else       out      1 am a m a z e d          that,       with    cameras,

          monitors,           nigh      powered          binoculars              and     other         equipment,          nobody        seemed

          to a p p r e c i cate         that       the    middle          section           of    the    terrace          was

          frighteningly                overcrowded             while        the       adjoining          sections          were     capaaie          of

          holding          many      more     people          than were           occupying             the    availaDle           space.




          When       people        were      dying       in    the      middle         terrace,          other       spectators           HU    or

          30    yards        away      had    superabundant                 space,,

             Whi le    conceding         that       I was         on    the     terracing      rather          than     behind        the

             West     Stand,      it s e e m s      reasonably             c l e a r , by   virtue        of    the     fact        that    more

             people       were    all    the       t im e    attempting           to   gain    access          into     the

             middle       section       of    terracing            that        spectators      weren't          prevented            from

             using     that      tunnel       when       lead      to a s u f f o c a t i n g l y    full       terrace         and

             weren't        directed         to    other      entrances           to a d j o i n i n g    sections            where    there

             was    ample     room      to a c c o m m o d a t e        them.




             Once     through      the       turnstiles,               there     was   no m e c h a n i c a l       che c k    of    how many

             spectators          were    funnelling               into    each     Darti.cul.ar          section        of     terracing.




             To    a very     large      extent,            the    spectators          entering          the    Lappings            Lane

             turnstiles          were    left       to      thsir       ow n   devices,       that       is    to    sa y     left    to    f i nd

             occupation          and    where       the      entrances          were    situated.

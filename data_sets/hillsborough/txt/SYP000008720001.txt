On    Saturday           15 A p r i l          1989       (130489)           I was       performing             duty          for    the       St

At    about       3.20pm            (1520)          I was        working       at       Oakwell       football                ground       when

that     I was       required                 to    go    to     Sheffield.               I went          out       of    the       ground

Area     Ambulance              which          is       kept     in C u r d w o r t h ,       Barnsley,




The    three        of     us       then       transferred              to    the       Area    Ambulance                                  was

Using     the       blue        beacons             and     the       sirens       we    made       our    way       to       Hillsborough.

When     we    reached           the          junction           of   Doe     Royd       Ln    and    Halifax             Rd    in

Hillsborough                 we    encountered                stationery             traffic.           Police          officers             who

were     on     traffic            control          duties          waved       us    to    the    ’w r o n g *     side          of    the

dual     carriageway                and       in    this       manner          we    proceeded          to    the       junction             of

Penis tone          Rd       North       and       Leppings          Ln    where       a    road       traffic          island          is

s it u a t e d .




At    this      location            the       Police          directed          us    towards          the    Leppings             Ln

entrance           to    Hillsborough                   football          ground.            In L e p p i n g s         Ln    we       joined       a

queue      of      waiting          county          arribulanc.es.                  This    was    at    approximately

3.55pm        (1555).




After      we      waited          in    the       queue       for       about       five    minutes          the       Police

instructed              us    to    go    to       the       opposite          side    of    the       ground       where          injured

people        had       been       taken.               At    this       time       Leppings       Ln    was       very       busy       with

people        walking             from    the       ground.               Many       people       seemed          upset       and       were

crying,         however            I had       no       conversation                with    any    of    them.




We    were      escorted            by    motorcycle                police          officer,       via       Parkside             Rd,    to       the

main     entrance             to    the       ground.               We    then       drove    along          an    internal             road       to

a    point      where         the       South       Stand       joins          the    West    Stand«




The    ambulance              was       reversed             into    this       location          in    order       to       receive

casualties.                   We    all       made       our    way       to    the    pitch       area,          however          there

were     no     injured            people          on    the    pitch.               All    I saw       was       people          sitting          on

the    pitch        crying.               They          were    being          comforted          by    other       football

supporters.




A    Police        Officer,             who    I    c a n ’t    describe,             told    us       that       all    of       the

casualties              had       been    taken          to    the       gymnasium          and    he    told       us       to    take       the

ambulance           there.

                                                                                                                                        S77&



We    then         returned       to    the    ambulance                and       drove          back    to      the       main    entrance

to    the      g round      in P e n i s t o n e        Rd.            We    turned          left       into      the       road       and

joined         a    queue    of    ambulances                waiting             to    get       to   the     Sports         H a l 1.




The    Barnsley            District       Major          Incident                ambulance            pulled          up    behind       us      and

I assisted            in    carrying          some       equipment                to    the       sports         hall.            W h e n we

got    t h e re      I was       told    that      all            of    the           injured         had been         taken away and

that     there        were       only    deceased                  left          in    the    s p o r t s hall.




I then         reloaded          the    equipment                  into          the    ambulance and                 we    d i r e c t e d to     go

to    the      bus    depot       on    Herries          Rd       South          and    standby.                 When       we    got    there

we    w e re       asked    to    set    up    a    first          aid       station             which      we    did.




There       w e re    a    lot    of    football             supporters                at    the      bus     depot         awaiting

transportation.                    We    set       up    a    first          aid       station          but      I d i d n ’t h a v e         to

treat       anyone.              I just       spoke          to    a    few       Nottingham             Forest            Supporters            who

were     enquiring           about       what       had       happened.




At    about         5.15pm       (1715)       I went          back          to    the       sports       hall         with       the    others

in    the      ambulance          and    we    were          stood          down       by    a    senior         county

ambulanceman.




We    then         returned       to    Barnsley             and       I finished                my   duty       at    about       6.00pm

(1800).

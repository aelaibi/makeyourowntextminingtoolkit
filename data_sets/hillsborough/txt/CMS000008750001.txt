D e a r Mr M o y n i h a n

        I am a                        year     student       at

                                 and     as    part    of my       studies       I am r e q u i r e d

to    produce        a project           on a c h o s e n     current      subject.           I have

chosen      to     focus        on    the     issue    of    " Who    should      pay   for    the

safety      at     football           grounds      and      why?"      I am      paying     particular

attention          to the        recent       Taylor        Report     recommendations.

        It w o u l d       be    v ery      helpful      if y o u     could      provide      me

with    the       G o v e r n m e n t ’s p o l i c y   regarding        t hi s    subject      and

any    o t h er    relevant           information.

        Thank        you    v ery m u c h       in a d v a n c e     for y o u r help.

                       Yours         sincerely

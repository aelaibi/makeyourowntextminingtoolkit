               w ould be ejected from the                   ground.       At this         he became       very abus i v e and

          out myself.                    By now there were more Police                                              in the               tunnel                           as        it became

          obvious             that a d i sastrous                         si> d a t i o n was              occurring.                              We had to step

          over man y bodies w hich M d                                     been       put down                 in the tunnel                                     until we got

          was    breathing,                   put him             in the          recovery            position and                                  left                  him, in the

          It is my opin i o n that                               from the shear                   number             of   injured and                                            dead

          people and the                      c ondition of some                       of^fefie bodies',”1the                                       crushing must

      i   Next      I helped a colleaoue who was                                         trying                to    revive a dead man,                                                            I gave

          smelled s t r ongly of alcojxfl.                                       A l t h o u g h we worked                          for a long time we

          fans were              in an extreme sdfate of shock.                                                I tried to                           c o m f o rt ana

          It seemed to be quite a while                                           before          the a mbulances arrived,                                                               during

           this    time       I a d m i n i s t e r e d first aid to several              people as       best       I

           could.       When       the ambu l a n c e s a r r i v e d      I tried      to organise       those who             I

           knew were          ser i o u s l y    injured to have           priority      in the ambulances.                    she

           ambu l a n c e s    queued      up     in the      lane behind the walled area                 behind the

           West Stand.            Dead     bodies                 aid along       one side      of the        lane ,

           injured      bodies al o n g ^ t h e          other    side,.      When all     the dead bodies                had

           bee n r e rno v e d f r o m t h e          a s'-e a b e h i n d t h e W e s tS t a n d an announc e m e n t w a s

           broadcast,          asking      the         fans to     leave. I stood with a line                 of other

           Policemen          in front          ofthe gate       leading out           to where    the    dead and

           injured      people were              lying    to prevent        them from using           this     gate.           As

           the    fans made          their way^p-olf from the               seating area of the West Stand

Cp £       m a n y of them were abusive                   to the Police,          saying     such things as               ‘’This

           is all your           fault" and            "MurderijjflHSastards. "           W hen all      these       people

           had made       their way             out    I went    back    into    the    pens to       clear    the

           remaining          fans    from there.            There were         several     people      looking          for

           missing      friends and              relatives, 1 advised             these     people      to go to the

           Police     room by the N orth Stand a l t h o u g h at this time                            I w a s n ’t aware

           that any a r r a n g e m e n t s           had been made        to deal      with these       people.

           Eventually          I was      reunited with other members                    of serial       15 and we made

           our way to the N o r t h Stand where we were                           told that 96          people had

           died.      Whe n we were              stood down from the N o r t h S tand                 I returned to

           uJombwei 1 Police            s t a t i o n and went       off    duty at      /.csOprri.

              the back        of the North -Stand.                    This    sudden         influx       of    people was              cleared

   nose were almost             black.       When       I got             near          to the body        I felt at her

   face and         it, was    cold.     It is my opin i o n that this                                 wojbw—   h S c T b e e n dead

   myself       finding       the    body.    As    I got              some            of the    fans    to drag      her   body

   out       of the    pen    I saw that her            clothing was                         in an e x tremely

   dishev e l l e d     condition and that                 her         hands were also                  blue.

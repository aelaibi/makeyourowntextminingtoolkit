           I am employed at the above named Hospital as a Porter and have been so

           for some five y e a r s .    On Saturday 15 April       1989 <150489) my tour of

           duty was 0700hrs     (1700)    to 15.30hrs    (1530).



           I completed my tour of duty and made my way home,               I then went on to a

           local Football Match and as a result of the radio transmission I heard

           regarding the Semi Cup Final at Hillsboroug hy'l returned home and rang

           the enquiry desk at the Northern General j               pital and as a result of

           what    I was told I returned to offer my               ices.   I arrived at the

           ,hospital at approximately 15.30-15.^5^" s <1530) - <1535).              X was

           directed to the casualty block and from there on as sisted with

           deceased persons,     the first job I did was to assist

             ,he plaster room to lift a deceased onto a stretcher,             the deceased was

The body had already been stripped of^              1ng by Police Officers              I
                         'vi? > 0 3
was aware that the girls father wa^wlaiting outside the room demanding

to see his daughter,    so I was waiting    in readiness to w h e e 1 the body

                   round in order for the father to identify
                                                       A screen

erected ready for the identification but for some uknown reason it did

not go ahead at that stage.



I do not recall how long I had been waiting with this body, all time

from arrival at the hospital escapes me.



When         returned to the Mortuary together we wheeled the body across

to the Mortuary.



We were instructed to put the body to one side in the Mortuary by who

I presume was a Dr,    he was a fairly large gentleman and I believe he

may well have come from the City Mortuary.           I assumed he was a Dr

purely be cause he was wear i ng a white c oa t .    A f te k/ 1eav i ng the

deceased to one side    I went straight back to tfyt plaster         room another

Porter was there by the name of                              attendi ng to a

young male deceased about    12-13 yrs,

       again he had been stripped of all      clothing



I assisted         to lift him       the stretcher, and again we wheeled

him across to the mortuar            body we put straight into a fridge

After this I got took off the plaster       room and told to assist at CICU

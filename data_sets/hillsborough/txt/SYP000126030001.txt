THE POLICE MADE THE CORRECT DECISION IN OPENING THE GATE BUT THERE WAS NO
ONE INSIDE TO CO ORDINATE THE FANS.SO WHEN THEY WENT IN IT WAS CHAOS.I ONLY
SAW FOUR OR FIVE POLICEMEN ON HORSEBACK OUTSIDE THE GROUND,NOMORE THAN THAT.
I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING ANY POLICEMEN IN THE STAND,ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SOME
AROUND THE PITCH.THE ONLY INSTRUCTIONS I HEARD WAS FROM KENNY DALGLEISH
ASKING FOR CALM FROM THE FANS,AND THEN AN APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE FOR THE
EMERGENCY SERVICES ETC.PLENTY OF ROOM WHERE I WAS AND I WASN'T HURT.

THERE WAS A SURGE OF PEOPLE TOWARDS THE GATE.THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND ME WHO
DID NOT HAVE TICKETS AND AS A RESULT OF THE GATE OPENING THEY RUSHED FORWARD.
THE POLICE WAVED EVERYONE IN. MY TICKET WAS NOT TAKEN FROM ME.THE CROWD
SURGED FORWARD THE FIRST THING YOU SEE IS THE TUNNEL AND EVERYONE SURGED
FORWARD. WE COULD SEE THAT THE TUNNEL WAS FULL AND WE WENT UP THE STAIRS TO
THE STANDS ABOVE.THESE SEATS   WERE FULL SO WE SAT ON   THE STEPS OVERLOOKINGTHE
PENS. WE HAD A CLEAR VIEW OF   WHAT HAPPENED.AS WE SAT DOWN THE   GAME KICKED
OFF.WE COULD SEE THERE WAS PROBLEMS IN THE PENS BELOW.THERE WERE NO POLICE
NEAR US.PEOPLE WERE ASKING US TO HELP THEM UP.
POLICE STARTED TO ARRIVE AND   AS THE PEOPLE TRIED TO   GET OUT THE POLICE WERE
PtMKING THEM BACK IN.
i K w AN OFFICER WITH A FLAT CAP GO ONTO THE PITCH AND THE PLAYERS LEFT THE
FIELD. AT THIS TIME THE PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED.
I SAW PEOPLE BEING GIVEN FIRST AID. WE STOPPED WHERE WE WERE.
WE LEFT THE STAND BET. 1615 AND 1630HRS.
I ARRIVED AT THE GROUND ABOUT 1415HRS THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 8POLICEMEN.4 OF
THEM WERE ON HORSEBACK. THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH POLICE OUTSIDE.THERE WERE FEW
POLICE AT THE TURNSTILES.
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS AND WHEN THEY SAW THE GATE OPEN
THEY RUSHED FORWARD.I CONSIDER THATS THE REASON THERE WAS THE CRUSH IN PEN 3
I TRAVELLED DOWN WITH MY BROTHER AND HIS TWO FRIENDS. MY BROTHER HAS ALREADY
CALLED.

              OF TRAFFIC CAUSED BY THE MATCH.THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
              LEPPINGS LANE AT THIS TIME, WHICH SURPRISED ME.THERE WERE TWO

FANS GO INTO THE GROUND.THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE TRYING TO BUY
TICKETS.AT 2.00 I GOT INSIDE AND HANDED MY TICKET IN TO THE PERSON ON THE
TURNSTILE. THERE WERE TWO PC'S FRISKING PEOPLE AS THEY CAME THROUGH , HOWEVER
I DID NOT SEE ONE SINGLE STEWARD TO DIRECT FANS TO AREAS OF THE GROUND, IT
WAS A CASE OF FINDING THE PLACES FOR YOURSELF.I EVENTUALLY FOUND MY WAY TO
PEN 4.1 HAD BEEN ADVISED BY MY BROTHER NOT TO GO INTO PEN 3 DUE TO THE
CRUSHING LAST YEAR.I COULD SEE AT ABOUT 2.30 THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE
I1UPEN 3 AND THERE WAS CRUSHING OCCURRING.IT WAS BECOMING EXTREMELY
D J®EROUS.FANS WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCING AND THEN WERE BEING PUSHED BACK
OVER BY THE POLICE.                                     ______

            THE CROWDS OUTSIDE. THERE APPEARED TO BE A TOTAL LACK OF POLICE
            OFFICERS. THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHING GOING ON BUT IT DIDNT SEEM
            MALICISOUS. I MOVED AWAY AND STOOD ON THE BRIDGE IN LEPPINGS LANE
            AND COULD SEE THE CROWD. I FEEL IF THE GATES HADNT BEEN OPENED
            THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEATHS OUTSIDE.

AT 3PM THE QUEUES HAD SUBSIDED A LITTLE AND WE GOT IN WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE AS
THE GATES HAD BEEN OPENED. THERE WAS NO ONE TO DIRECT US AT ALL AND WE WNET
DOWN THE CENTRE TUNNEL WHICH BROUGHT US OUT AT THE CENTRE OF THE STAND RIGHT
AT THE BACK. I COULD SEE IT WAS REALLY PACKED AND FELT IT WASNT SAFE SO I
PUSHED MY WAY BACK DOWN THE TUNNEL AND WENT TO THE LEFT WHERE WE SAW TWO
STEWARDS WHO WERE TRYING TO DIRECT PEOPLE. I WENT INTO THE LEFT OF THE
LEPPINGS STAND WHERE THERE WERE SPACES. I COULD SEE THYE CRUSH GOING ON AND
AT FIRST THOUGHT THE PEOPLE CLIMBING THE FENCES WERE HOOLIGANS TRYING TO STOP
T H ^ MATCH. THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO PUSH THEM BACK. ON CE THE GAME STOPPED
I M F POLICE STARTED TO HELP THEM GET OVER. I AM AMAZED THAT ALTHOUGH THE
POLICE MUST HAVE SEEN THE STAN WAS FULL THAT THE TUNNEL WASNT CORDONED OFF
AND THE FANS RE-DIRECTED. ALSO LAST YEAR THE FANS WERE CHECKED FURTHER DOWN
LEPPINGS LANE BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR THE GROUND AND THEY WERE CHECKED TO MAKE
SURE THAT THEY HAD TICKETS. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT THIS YEAR.

WHEN WE GOT TO THE TUNNEL THERE WERE NO STEWARDS OR POLICE TO DIRECT US OR
CHECK OUR TICKETS. I STILL HAVE MY TICKET. I FOLLOWED THE CROWD IN AND AT
ABOUT 2 MINS TO 3. THE CRUSH STARTED. I WAS PUSHED FORWARD AND WAS ABOUT 2
YARDS AWAY FROM THE FENCING WHEN PEOPLE STARTED DYING. I REALISED THAT THIS
WAS NOT THE NORMAL PUSH. PEOPLE WERE GROANING AND MOANING. ONE MAN IN
PARTICULAR WAS GROANING REALLY LOUD AND THEN STOPPED. I THINK HE MUST HAVE
BEEN ONE THAT DIED. I WAS PUSHED TO MY LEFT AND ONLY STOPPED WHEN I HIT A
BJBfl|.IER. PEOPLE WERE BEING SICK OVER ME AND ONE PERSON URINATED OVER ME. I
Om R MANAGED TO GET OUT WHEN SOMEONE CUT A HOLE IN THE FENCING TO MY LEFT.

 UP THE SIDES FENCES TO ESCAPE. I HELPED FANS UP TO STAND. WHEN THAT GATE WAS
OPENED EVEN MORE FANS WERE FORCED IN TO THE STAND. PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING TO
THE POLICE TO LET THEM OUT SOME OF THE FANS CLIMBING ON TO THE FENCE WERE
PUSHED BACK BY POLICE OFFICERS. THE POLICE WERE NOT DEPLOYED RIGHT. THERE
WERE 100 OFFICERS ON THE HALF WAY LINE DOING NOTHING TO HELP THE INJURED AND
DYING THE TREATED THE SITUATION AS PUBLIC DISORDER .
          THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ADVIODED IF THE POLICE HAD SUPERVISED THE CROWD
OMy*RIVAL AT THE GROUND. AND WHEN THAT GATE WAS OPENED IF THE HAD BEEN
Of H c ERS OR GROUND STAFF TO SHOW THE FANS WERE TO ,GO.

PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING AT THE POLICE TO GET HELP, I LATER SAW PEOPLE BEING
CARRIED ON STRECHERS AND SOME WERE OBVIOUSLY DEAD.
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE GET IN THROUGH TUNNEL THEY HAVE TO GO TO
THE MIDDLE SECTION OF THE TERACES AND IT IS THEN DIFFICULT TO MOVE ANYWHERE
ELSE.

               LANE END, THEN WE APPROACHED THE TURNSTILES, AND AS WE DID WE
               REALISED THE CROWD WAS OUT OF CONTROL, THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHING
               EVEN THEN. THERE WERE NO QUEUES TO THE TURNSTILES, JUST A MASS
               OF PEOPLE. THERE WAS ONE POLICE HORSE WHO DIDN'T SEEM ABLE TO DO
               ANYTHING, AND NO ONE FUNNELING PEOPLE INTO THE TURNSTILES. CONT.

T 'PR&VTCT.T.Rn TO THE MATCH WITH 3 PEOPLE:
                                                                          LANCS

AT ONE POINT THERE WAS A LAD NEARBY, HE APPEARED TO BE STRUGGLING TO BREATH,
AND PEOPLE SAID HE WAS ASTHMATIC, SO WE PASSED HIM UP TO A POLICEMAN ON THE
WALL NEAR THE TURNSTILES TO GET HIM OUT - IN FACT I LATER SAW THAT INCIDENT
OMMPHE TV NEWS.
THE FOUR OF US GOT SEPARATED IN THE CRUSH AND ALL GOT IN SEPARATELY.                   IT TOOK
SOME TIME TO ACTUALLY GET INTO THE GROUND, UNTIL ABOUT 2.45.
WHEN WE WENT INTO THE GROUND WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE RIGHT HAND WING OF THE
TERRACE TO AVOID THE CRUSH. THERE WERE NO STEWARDS OR ANYONE DIRECTING US,
WE FOUND OUR OWN WAY UP THERE, ON THE ADVICE OF ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CAR,
WHO SAID THE CENTRE PENS GOT VERY PACKED LAST YEAR. THERE WAS A FAIR BIT OF
SPACE IN THIS WING, IT FILLED UP AS KICK-OFF TIME CAME.
ONCE THE GAME KICKED-OFF WE SAW PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE CENTRE PENS
ONTO THE PITCH.

ONE LAD WAS LYING OUT ON THE PITCH RIGHT IN FRONT OF WHERE I WAS STANDING AND
HE WAS STONE COLD, PEOPLE WERE TEARING THE HOARDING BOARDS DOWN TO USE AS
STRETCHERS, I COULDNT HELP BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD HAVE GOT OUT ONTO
THE GROUND. THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCMENT OVER THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM URGING
PEOPLE TO GET OFF THE PITCH I DONT THINK THEY REALIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
I BLAME THE TICKET ALLOCATION FOR WHAT HAPPENED THE LIVERPOOL FANS SHOULD
HAVE HAD THE MOST TICKETS. I WAS ON MY OWN INSIDE THE GROUND ALTHOUGH I DID
GET SPEAKING TO OTHER FANS WHEN THE CHAOS WAS HAPPENING

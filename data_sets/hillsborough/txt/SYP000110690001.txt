Stephen Robert Sewell
5th Inspector 'Fl'


Since October 1987 I have been the 5th Inspector at 1F l 1 Sub

Division and from that time I have had responsibility for the

preparation of the 'FI' football orders at 'Fl1.     I took over from

Inspector Calvert who had been doing   the football orders at

Hammerton Road for a number of years   and the systems of       organising

the manpower etc are largely based on systems he introduced.

Generally speaking officers who attend the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Ground on match duty all say that the policing of the

grounds at Hillsborough is more efficient than that at other grounds

in the county.   It may well be that as Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club is a First Division club - more   money is available       andassuch

manpower is not reduced as it is at other grounds.



I was involved with the organisation of the 1988 Semi Final for

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.   This was done together with Chief

Inspector Beal and Inspector Calvert in consultation with

Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent Mole.



As the semi finals for 1989 were drawing near I was watching which

teams were likely to be in the semi finals.   During the week

commencing 13 March 1989 it looked as if a semi final could be

staged at Hillsborough and at that stage I started addressing my

mind to a possible semi final at Hillsborough.
                                                                  (2)



On Saturday 18 March 1989 the FA Cup 6th rounds took place.      On 20

March 1989 the draws for the semi final took place and again

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were drawn to play.   I believe it

was later on that day that Chief Superintendent Mole informed me

that the semi final between those two teams was due to be staged at

Hillsborough.   Easter Bank holiday weekend was due on 24, 25, 26 and

27 March 1989 and together with Chief Superintendent Mole a meeting

was arranged for Wednesday 22 March 1989 of ail persons involved

with the semi final.   Chief Superintendent Mole, Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, who was to be the divisional commander

from 27 March 1989, Superintendent Marshall, Superintendent Murray,

Chief Inspector Beal, Inspector Sewell, Police Sergeant Goddard

Control Room, Police Sergeant Fidler admin,    Chief Superintendent

Nesbit, Superintendent Brougham Traffic Inspector, Sayers Traffic,

Sergeant Sorsby mounted, Inspector Phoenix dogs, Police Sergeant        'D'

Divisions representative, Inspector Dews 'D2', Headquarters

catering, communications department, press    liaison, Police Sergeant

Walton motorcycle, Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson, South

Yorkshire Transport representative, British Transport Police and

British Rail, Sector Superintendent commanders and their Chief

Inspectors, South Yorkshire Highways Department, Headquarters

operations staff, football liaison officer.    Through Football

Liaison Department; liaison was made with Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club, Nottingham Forest Club, Liverpool Football Club,

Merseyside Police and Nottinghamshire Constabulary.    Through

operations room; liaison was kept with South Yorkshire Ambulance

Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.
                                                                 (3)



After the formal meeting on 22 March 1989, close liaison was kept

with all parties until the semi final on 15 April 1989. Close co­

operation was maintained throughout.



Together with Chief Inspector Beal, the previous match order for the

1988 semi final was studied and as this was a total successful

operation, it formed the basis of the 1989 semi final.    Briefs were

prepared with Chief Inspector Beal, these were all discussed in

detail with Superintendent Murray and approved by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield.



Basically, the serials were the same as for the 1988 semi final

with the following main changes.    I will deal with these briefly as

I am aware that Chief Inspector Beal will be dealing with the

changes in minute detail in his report.



Three Inspectors who acted as liaison officers to sector commanders

were dispensed with as they were under employed.    One reserve serial

stationed at South Stand/Spion kop was dispensed with as it was

superfluous to requirements. Supervision of mobile units was reduced

by two Inspectors as in practice they could only be with one unit at

a time.   Serials 1 and 2 were increased by two Police Constables and

one Police Sergeant respectively.



Serials 11 and 12 (North Stand) were decreased as their main task of

ensuring that supporters did not use the Penistone Road North egress

did not require the manning afforded in 1988.    Serial 15 was

decreased by one Sergeant, leaving one Sergeant supervising one

serial.
                                                                    (4)



Further serials on the outskirts of the ground patrols were reduced

from one Sergeant and 10 Police Constables to one Sergeant and eight

Constables.   None of these serials were directly involved with

access or egress from the football stadium and it was considered by

all that these extra two Police Constables per serial were

additional to requirements.



Better use was made of resources and at Phase III,       four:serials

from within the ground, that was serials 2,8,20 and 21 were to assist

the track serial to prevent any pitch invasion at the end of the

match.



Also, during>the 1988 semi final, all serials deployed outside the

ground were on standby    for refreshments at Claywheels Lane

throughout the duration of    the match.     They were some quarter of a

mile away from the ground and were too far away to deploy in the

ground at short notice.   This year, following an idea put forward by

Superintendent Murray,from 2.45 pm on the day of the       1989 semi

final,   a Police coach   was stationed in Leppings Lane near to the

ground and a further Police coach was stationed in Penistone Road

near to gate 'O'.   Of the men who were due to meal at Claywheels

Lane Police Station throughout the match, five serials ie five

Sergeants and 40 Police Constables were detailed to get on each

coach at the two locations at 3 pm.        They would remain on standby

until 3.30 pm when the coach would drop them off at Claywheels Lane

Police Station for meal and then pick up five further serials on each

coach to return to the ground for deployment.
                                                                 (5)



This would make better use of 20 serials throughout Phase II of the

game.     In actual fact, the five serials which were making their way

to each of the two coaches for 3 pm brought them to the ground for

that time instead of the men being    \ of a mile away at Claywheels
Lane Police Station.    These 10 serials being in the vicinity of the

two coaches at 3 pm were all in addition to manpower resources to

the 1988 semi final as all these men would have been at Claywheels

Lane Police Station.



The serials around the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and Penistone

Road and in the enclosure to the same were the same as for 1988

which had proved adequate.     The intelligence supplied by Football

liaison and Detective Sergeant Charlesworth local intelligence     did

not throw up any different problems from the 1988 semi final which

proved to be a total success.     However, just because the 1988 semi

final had been a success earnest consideration was made when

preparing the 1989 semi final and every effort was made to improve

on an already successfull operation from the previous year.



The operational order was approved and circulated on 6 April 1989 to

all senior officers of Chief Inspector and above involved in the

operation.     A pre-briefing was arranged for sub sector Inspectors

and above on Friday 14 April 1989 in the North Stand of the

Wednesday ground.     All Inspectors involved in the operation attended

or a Sergeant deputising for the few Inspectors who were unable to

attend.     This Sergeant then liaised with the respective Inspectors

prior to the match.
                                                                 (6)



On that pre-brief, Inspectors were handed an operational order and

details of serials under their command and their duties.    They were

also givenserial orders for their respective Sergeants under their

command.



At the pre-brief, these Officers were briefed by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield on Policy*   by Superintendent Murray on

what was required at the match and by myself on admin procedures

which included reporting on and off duty, overtime claims, the issue

of radios including all ground serials to have an earpiece, the

issue of meals and the issue of vehicle keys for those on transits.

The individual sector commanders then briefed their men taking them

to all the relevant parts of the grounds to examine locations

pertinent to their duties.



A personal carrier was made available for Inspectors on out-lying

parts of the order to view their duties.    Whilst placing the

individual manpower on the operational order, every consideration

was made to using the best resources available and in particular

supervisory officers with extensive experience of the ground used in

locations familiar to them.   With this in mind, key Inspectors were

placed in the following locations:

Inspector Darling (Fl ) - South Stand and track

Inspector Calvert (late F l ) - Spion kop

Inspector Woodward (F2 late Fl) - North Stand

Leppings Lane Terraces - Inspector White (F), always works this duty

extremely experienced.
                                                                  (7)



Inspector Bullas (HQ) PSU - West Stand regular relief at F Division.

Inspector Harvey (late Fl ) - South Stand car park

Inspector Sykes (F2) - Leppings Lane Turnstiles, always works this

duty extremely experienced at this location assisted by Inspector

Purdy HQ, (relief at F l ).

The serials picked to work in the ground were mainly 'F' Division

Officers, all have good knowledge of the ground assisted by Spion

Kop,   'E' Division Officers, regularly work that area.   West Stand

'E' Division Officers under Sergeant Burman, worked that duty

before.   Leppings Lane terraces 'B' Division Officers worked at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club before on several occasions.

Leppings Lane turnstiles three serials 'F2' Officers and one 'E'

Division Officer all worked these duties before.     The Sergeants in

particular have extensive knowledge of this particular duty,



Other duties were considered when the manpower was placed on the

serials and great thought was used when identifying Officers to

particular duties so as to make the best use of resources.      Also, I

personally made arrangements for the stewards to be briefed in their

respective stands at 11.15 am on 15 April 1989.      This was arranged

in conjunction with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Mr Macrell

club secretary and Mr Lock, security officer Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club and ex-superintendent and football commander at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.    Officers briefing were:    South

Stand Inspector Darling, kop Inspector Calvert, North* Stand

Inspector Woodward, West Stand Inspector White.      In addition I have

close liaison with the senior stewards on all match days and with Mr

Macrell secretary SWFC and Mr Lock security officer.
                                                                    (8)



During August 1988, I had attended a stewards meeting at Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and briefed all the stewards re emergency

evacuation and other problems and the gate men had been briefed by

my deputy, Police Sergeant Goddard during August 1988 whilst I was

on leave.   Liaison had been made with senior officers from the Fire

Service and the ambulance service and Superintendent Murray and

myself during this present season re any major disaster.



On 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at 'FI' at 7 am.    At 7.30 am I

patrolled the ground area and surrounding roads with Police Sergeant

Hodkinson who was detailed as a driver for the day.    At 7.50 am that

morning, I located some rubble near to Parkside Section Station and

message was raised on the computer to have this removed, it was from

a gas board excavation the previous day.



At 8 am that morning, at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, I

liaised with Inspector Bennett admin, and Police Sergeant Fidler,

checking all cones and barriers in position, radios collected and

ready for distribution.    Police Sergeant Colley was seen in the

Police room and all was in order.     Inspector Scarfe was liaised with

re cell buses arriving, articulated vehicle     from West Yorkshire

(food wagon) arriving, assisted with positioning.     I then saw Police

Sergeant Dent, dog section, liaison     then took place regarding

search for explosives.     I then liaised   with Civilian staff

regarding hot drinks to be served to approximately 700 officers

attending briefing.      Checked with Inspector Bennett, all in hand

assisting officers into North Stand for briefing in accordance with

seating plan.
At 10 am that day, briefing takes place in North Stand, Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield set the scene, Superintendent Murray

gives the order of the day and what is required.    Detective Sergeant

Charlesworth gives details of intelligence.    I gave details of

reporting on and off duty, radio issue and collection, overtime,

transit keys allocation and meal allocation.



At approximately 10.30 am the briefing finished and everything was

going to plan.



At 10.45 am that day, with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

Police Sergeant Hodkinson, we patrolled round area of ground and

coach routes in 'F' Division.



At 11.15 am that day, Officers out on ground, general patrol of area

with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on foot walked down Leppings

Lane,barriers in position.Near to Leppings Lane traffic island, a

minor road traffic accident had taken place. Officers under command

of Inspector Millett dealing.



At 12.30 am approximately, liaising with Mr Lock security officer in

club video room and general patrol of ground with Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield - no problems, there were not alot of

fans about.     Fans spoken to in vicinity of the ground all in good

spirits, no problems, no evidence of alcohol at that stage.



At 1.30 pm with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield we went to the

gymnasium for a hot meal, outside CID officers and track serials

also mealing.

                                                                     (10)



    At 1.45 pm approximately, to Control Room left Chief Superintendent

    Duckenfield, Superintendent Murray, Police Sergeant Goddard, Police

    Constable Ryan, Police Constable Bichard in control box.    I believe

    Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson in civilian clothing also

    present.



    Between 1.50 pm and 2.30 pm, general patrol of North Stand and South

    Stand area upper concourses checking on betting booths, no problems

    noticed and that South Stand concourse were busy,quite a lot of

    Nottingham Forest fans arriving early.   No evidence of alcohol in

    South Stand.   Checking North Stand betting booths - not so busy in

    Liverpool side, still no visible evidence of alcohol.



    At 2.45 pm in the vicinity of the gymnasium and Police room area I

    was aware that there were a number of prisoners on the cell buses

    and that the Police room were busy but I spoke with Inspector Barker

    who did not report any problems other than busy, but this was to be

    expected.   Everything was still going to plan.   About this time I

    was aware of a message from Control that there were problems at

    Leppings Lane and that further manpower was required.   About this

    time problems with radio reception.   I recall Police Sergeant

    Goddard's (Control) voice was having a 'warbjing' effect.   I thought

    my radio battery was faulty, other officers were experiencing

    difficulty, obvious a radio fault, not   aiy particular radio.   I got

    the impression that Control were receiving calls, but officers

    outside were having difficulty in receiving Control.
                                                                      (11)



It was apparent by the tone of Police Sergeant Goddard's voice that

urgent assistance was required at Leppings Lane.     I returned to the

gymnasium and informed Control that there were a large number of 'D'

Division officers on standby who were available for deployment.          I

got from Control that Officers were required at the track,Leppings

Lane end, West Stand and 'A' gate.



I grouped the serials together and as the Sergeant in charge left

the gymnasium, I got Police Sergeant 467 Sewell on logistics in the

gymnasium to record who was beingdeployed     andwhere to.   The

following Sergeants and serials    ofapproximately eight men   in each

were deployed as follows:     (All 'D' Division)

Police Sergeant 2916 - Track

Police Sergeant 1055 - West Stand

Police Sergeant 915 - Track

Police Sergeant 2379 - West Stand

Police Sergeant 916 - 'A' Gate

Police Sergeant 993 - 'A' Gate



I radioed to Control where these officers were being deployed, but I

am unable to say if Control received my messages.     All the above

Officers were deployed at 2.50 pm.     It was obvious from Control that

they required further manpower to the Leppings Lane end.       I do

recall some radio message about the gates being opened and that

people were on the track.     At that stage I got the impression from

the gymnasium that there was a pitch invasion.     I then regrouped 'E'

Divison Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who were a

reserve serial and deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane

track at 3 pm.
                                                                      (12)



Further serials from 'D' Division arrived in the region of 3 pm,

these were deployed as follows:

Police Sergeant 690     )    and serial to Leppings Lane track
                        )
Police Sergeant 628     )

Followed by Police    Sergeant 1379, Police Sergeant   593, Police

Sergeant 7, Police    Sergeant 1415 and a number   of 'D'   Division Police

Constables to the track.      Some few minutes.later, I saw Chief

Superintendent Nesbit, who I think came into the ground from

Penistone Road end.     I spoke to him and he went onto the track.       At

this stage which was now approximately 3.10pmas I recall, it just

still seemed as though there had been trouble      at the Leppings Lane

end and that there    had been a pitch invasion.



I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the kop.

There were a lot of Officers in front of the Leppings Lane terraces

and obviously a number of fans in front of them.        The Nottingham

Forest fans on the kop were chanting and I got the impression at

that stage that a large number of fans were going onto the pitch at

Leppings Lane end and that there was going to be severe public

disorder.   At that stage I feared that fans may get to the Police

room and attempt to release the prisoners.      At this stage also I

could hear over the radio that fans were trapped at the Leppings

Lane end and that medical care was required. Ambulancemen were

arriving and I assisted with getting medical care and ambulances

down on to the track.       The crowd was continually hostile and I was

aware of about 10 to 12 Police dogs and handlers being on standby

near to the rear of the kop/North Stand entrance.        Then a number of

injured and dead were brought from the track up to the kop/North

Stand exit on stretchers and hoarding boards.
    I


                                                                            (13)



        At first it seemed as if there were just a few, six or so,       deador

        injured and then people came running off the track with dozens.          At

        this stage which was probably about 3.20 pm, Superintendent Bates,

        arrived, he came into the gymnasium with me, the tables and chairs

        for the meals were cleared and bodies were placed on the floor in the

        gymnasium.    Injured people were taken to the far end of the

        gymnasium.    Many Police officers were bewildered and some were

        crying.    As bodies were being placed on the floor, friends were

        with some and they were hysterical.     Two Liverpool males, one with a

        dark moustache was drunk and shouting at the Police, he was

        restrained by Detective Sergeant Smith and another CID officer.          He

        was wanting to fight and was    obviously in drink and shock.    The

        bodies kept being brought in fast and I was asking Control for a

        doctor to ensure that they were dead.     There was nothing to suggest

        that any of the bodies were alive, but I was conscious they had not

        been certified as dead.    The bodies were covered with the table

        cloths    previously laid out for the meals.    A doctor with a beard

        attended after about 30 minutes and certified the dead.       I recall

        Detective Superintendent McKay being in the gymnasium and arrangements

        were getting in hand for the bodies to be numbered and an officer

        allocated to each of them.      Outside the gymnasium there were

        numerous bodies and injured people lying on the ground near to the

        cell buses.    St John Ambulance personnel, Police Officers and

        civilians were in attendance.     There were about six young St John's

        personnel who were all under 14 or 15 years of age, who were very

        distressed near to the Police room.     I got these sat in the cab part

        of a cell bus and a Policeman from 'B2' was detailed to look after

        them.
I

                                                                   (14)



I remained in the vicinity of the gymnasium for the next hour or so.

Inspector Charles was detailed to start making records of the bodies

and several CID officers came to assist.



About 4.30 pm I saw Chief Inspector Beal and together we grouped all

the remaining officers who were not involved with bodies or other

duties together in the North Stand.    A short de-brief took place

telling Sergeants to hand their de-brief sheets in at that location

before being stood down by Control from the ground.     Arrangements

were made via message switch for a message to be relayed to all

Police Stations and over local radio that no Police    officers   had

been injured in the incident.



About 4.30 pm I saw Chief Superintendent Molein uniform at the ground,

he then took control of events.   Many officers throughout the next 12

hours or so expressed comment that it was reassuring to see Chief

Superintendent Mole.



About 6 pm I returned to the gymnasium and assisted with supervision

of the casualty bureau forms.



Throughout the evening I was involved with liaising with the

relatives and social workers and arrangements for extra telephones

to be placed in the gymnasium for the use of relatives.



General liaison of events re busing of relatives from Forbes Road,

Casualty Bureau duties were completed and seeing that the ancillary

admin staff and civilian staff were supervised and accounted for.

At 5.30 am on Sunday 16 April 1989 I left the gymnasium after

the last body had been removed and returned to duty at 11 am

the same day.



The Chief Constable, Colin Moynaham, the Minister for Sport,

Councillor Irvine Patnick, Detective Chief Superintendent

Addis, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Chief Superintendent Mole,

Professor Usher, Docter Popper and numerous social workers and

clergy attended the gymnasium, this boosted the morale and

efforts of the 150 plus Police Officers involved in the

gymnasium.   Many Police Officers have been in deep shock since

the event and in particular six of my Area Officers who were in

the front line on the track in front of Leppings Lane terraces,

went off sick due to shock and stress-related illnesses.     All

the Police Officers I saw involved in the event, acted in a

professional manner and are a total credit to the South

Yorkshire Police.



When Liverpool attended the semi-final at Hillsborough last

year, a large number of fans were the worse for drink and they

were even urinating on the upper concourse of the North Stand,

instead of bothering to use the toilets.   As such, urine was

running out of the upper concourse, onto the enclosure outside

the Police room and gymnasium.   Contingency plans were in hand

for this match, for Superintendent Murray from Control, to

deploy standby 'D' Division Officers from the gymnasium to deal

with this problem.



In the planning stages, up until the day of the event and up

until 2.45 pm approximately on 15 April 198^ everything was

going to plan and was showing to be a success in every way.

    Fans supporting Nottingham Forest were in position on the Spion kop

    and South Stand in good time.   Due to the large number of Liverpool

    fans who were outside the ground at Leppings Lane at 2.45 pm and

    after, together with facts, that some public houses in the Wadsley

    area sold more alcohol in two hours that Saturday lunchtime than on

    New Years Eve, one can draw ones own conclusions as to whether

    Liverpool fans were arriving late, the worse for drink or not.



    As I was not at the Leppings Lane end prior to the build up of fans,

    I am unable to comment on how or why the disaster happened.



    Although I was involved in the supervision of many of the Officers

    allocated to bodies, I did not physically assist the removal of any

    particular body.

      -STEVEN ROBERT SEWELL

          INSPECTOR



          Since       October           1987,    I have        been    the    fifth Inspector at               'FI' Sub-Division

          and     from       that       time     I have       had     responsibility          for     the    preparation    of   the

          'Fl'     football            orders     at     'FI'.        I took over from Inspector Calvert who had

          been     doing          the football orders at Hammerton                       Road for a number of years and

          the systems of organising the manpower etc. are largely based on systems he

          in t r o d u c e d .

          I was       involved with              the organisation of the                 1986 Semi-Final            for Liverpool

          and    Nottingham              Forest.        This     was    done       together with Chief             Inspector Beal

          and Inspector Calvert                       in consultation with Superintendent Murray and Chief

          Superintendent Mole.

          As    the    semi-finals              for    1989 were        drawing near I was                watching which teams

          were    likely to be in the semi-finals.                                 During the week commencing 13 March

          1989,       it    looked as           if a semi-final          could be staged at Hillsborough and at

          that     stage           I     started        addressing my          mind      to     a    possible      semi-final     at

          Hillsborough.

      On Saturday 18 March 1989,                             the F.A. Cup 6th rounds took place.                     On 20 March

          1989,       the        draws    for     the    semi-final          took     place     and       again,   Liverpool     and

      Nottingham Forest were                          drawTi to play.              I believe        it was later on that day

          that     Chief Superintendent                  Mole       informed        me   that       the     semi-final   between

      those         two teams was due to be staged at Hillsborough.                                         Easter Bank Holiday

      weekend              was    due    on     24,    25,    26 and 27 March            1989       and     together with Chief

      Superintendent Mole, a meeting was arranged for Wednesday 22 March 1989, of

      all persons involved with the semi-final.                                       Chief Superintendent Mole, Chief

      Superintendent                   Duckenfield, who was to be the Divisional Commander from 27

         Press    Liaison,     Police          Sergeant        Walton       -    Motor      Cycle,      Assistant      Chief

     Constable,       Mr.     Jackson,         South     Yorkshire         Transport        representative,          British

     Transport        Police       and    British        Rail       Sector      Superintendent           Commanders      and

     their Chief        Inspectors,            South    Yorkshire          Highways        Department,       Headquarters

     Operations        staff,          Football        Liaison       Officer.            Through       Football      Liaison

     Department ,         liaison        was     made        with    Sheffield           Wednesday       Football     Club,

0    Nottingham       Forest        Club,       Liverpool           Football       Club,        Merseyside    Police    and

     Nottinghamshire          Constabulary.              Through          Operations        Room,      liaison was kept

     with South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.

     After the formal meeting on 22 March 1 9 8 9 , close liaison was kept with all

     parties      until      the    semi-final          on    15    April       1989.      Close       co-operation     was

    maintained throughout.

    Together with Chief Inspector                      Beal,        the previous match order for the 1988

    sem.!.-final     was     studied      and     as    this was          a successful           operation,    it formed

    the      basis    of     the       1989     semi-final.               Briefs    were         prepared     with    Chief

^   Superintendent Beal,               these were all discussed in detail with Superintendent

    Murray and approved by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

    Basically,       the    serials       were    the        same    as for the          1988     semi-final with the

    following main changes.                    I will deal with these briefly as I am aware that

    Chief    Inspector Beal will be dealing with the changes                                      in minute detail in

    his report.

    Three    Inspectors       who      acted     as    liaison       officers       to     sector      commanders were

    dispensed with as          they were under employed.                         One     reserve serial stationed

    at    South     Stand/Spion          Kop    was     dispensed          with     as     it    was   superfluous      to

    requirements.          Supervision of mobile units was reduced by two Inspectors as
 in practice          they    could only be with one unit at a time.                                   Serials      1 and 2

 were     increased              by     two     Police       Constables             and       one     Police       Sergeant

 respec t i v e l y .

 Serials       11    and     12       (North    Stand)     were    decreased             as   their    main       tasks   for

 ensuring      that       supporters           did   not   use    the Penistone               Road North egress did

 not require          the manning afforded                 in 1988.       Serial           15 was decreased by one

 Sergeant,      leaving one Sergeant supervising one serial.                                        Further serials on

 the outskirts            of the ground patrols were reduced                             from one Sergeant and             10

Police     Constables             to    one    Sergeant      and       eight    Constables.                None   of   these

serials      were         directly       involved       with     access        or    egress         from    the    football

stadium and it was considered by all that these extra two Police Constables

per serial were additional to requirements.

Better use was made of resources and at Phase III, four serials from within

the ground,          that was serials, 2,8,20 and 21 were to assist the track serial

to prevent any pitch invasion at the end of the match.

Also,    during       the    1988 semi-final,              all serials deployed outside                       the ground

were on standby for refreshments at Claywheels Lane through the duration of

the match.           They were some quarter of a mile away from the ground and were

too far away to deploy in the ground at short notice.                                          This year, following

an idea put          forward by Superintendent Murray,                         from 2.^5 p.m. on the day of

the semi-final,            a Police coach was stationed in Leppings Lane, near to the

ground and          a further Police coach was stationed                             in Penistone Road near to

gate    'O'.         Of    the    men     who    were      due    to    meal        at    Claywheels        Lane    Police

Station     throughout            the match,         five serials,        i.e.           five Sergeants and forty

Police Constables, were detailed to get on EACH coach at the two locations

at   3.00 p.m.            They would remain on standby until                             3-30 p.m. when the coach

would drop          them off at Claywheels                 Lane Police Station for a meal and then

pick up five further serials on EACH coach to return to the ground for
 dep l o y m e n t .

 This    would make           better use of 20                serials throughout Phase II of the game.

 In actual fact, the five serials which were making their way to EACH of the

 two coaches for 3-00 p.m.                    brought        them to the               ground for that time instead

 of     the    men           being a        quarter     of a      mile          away    at     Claywheels       Lane    Police

 Station.          These          10 Serials         being       in     the      vicinity      of   the   two coaches          at

 3.00    p.m.        were     all      in    addition       to    manpower             resources    to    the    1988       semi­

 final, as all these                   men would have                      been at           Claywheels Lane Police Station.

The     serials             around the turnstiles                       at Leppings Lane and Penistone Road and

 in   the     enclosure           to   the    same     were       the       same as      for    1988 which had proved

adequate.              The    intelligence            supplied             by    Football       Liaison    and       Detective

Sergeant        Charlesworth                local    intelligence,               did not       throw up any          different

problems       fron         the    1988 semi-final which proved                         to be a success.             However,

even     though        the    1988 semi-final               had       been a success            earnest     consideration

was     made    when        preparing         the    1989     semi-final and every effort was made                            to

improve on an already successful operation from the previous year.

The Operational Order was                       approved and               circulated on 6 April               1989, to all

Senior Officers of                  Chief Inspector and above involved in the operation.                                       A

pre-briefing was arranged for sub-sector Inspectors and above on Friday,                                                      14

April       1989       in    the North         Stand     of the            Wednesday         Ground.      All    Inspectors

involved        in      the       operation         attended          or    a    Sergeant       deputing       for    the    few

Inspectors who were unable to attend.                                   This Sergeant then liaised with the

respective Inspectors prior to the match.

On that pre-brief,                 Inspectors were handed an Operational Order and details

of    serials        under        their      command    and       their          duties.        They    were    also    given

serial orders for their respective Sergeants under their command.

At    the     pre-brief,            these       officers were               briefed       by    Chief     Superintendent

Duckenfield on policy, by Superintendent Murray on what was required at the

match and by myself on admin procedures which included reporting on and off

duty,    overtiise claims,           the   issue of radios including all                    ground serials      to

have    an    earpiece,     the      issue    of   meals       and    the     issue    of vehicle        keys for

those on transits.             The individual sector commanders then briefed their men

taking       then   to   all    relevant         parts    of    the     grounds       to    examine     locations

pertinent to their duties.

A personnel carrier was made available for Inspectors on out-lying parts of

the order tc view their duties.                    Whilst placing the individual manpower on

the    Operational       Order,       every      consideration          was    made        to   using   the   best

resources      available       and    in particular supervisory officers with extensive

experience of the ground used in locations familiar to them.                                         With this in

mind,    key Inspectors were placed in the following locations

Inspector Darling (Fl)                             South       Stand and track.

Football Club before on several occasions.                                    Leppings Lane turnstiles three

serials,     'F2' Officers and one 'E' Division Officer all worked these duties

before.          The     Sergeants         in    particular         have        extensive          knowledge    of    this

particular day.

Other      duties were         considered when               the manpower was placed on the serials

and great         thought was used when identifying officers to particular duties

bo    as    to    make     the      best        use    of     resources.              Also,    I     personally       made

arrangements           for the stewards               to be briefed in their respective stands at

11.15      a.m.    on     15    April       1989-           This    was        arranged       in    conjunction       with

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,                           with Mr Macrell,             Club Secretary and Mr

Lock,       Security           Officer          Sheffield          Wednesday          Football         Club,     an       ex

West Stand                                        Inspector White

In addition I have close liaison with the senior stewards on all match days

and with Mr Macrell, Secretary SWFC and Mr Lock, Security Officer.

During      August        1988,      I     had    attended          a    steward's        meeting       at     Sheffield

Wednesday         Football          Club        and    briefed          all     the     stewards        re     emergency

evacuation         and    other      problems          and    the       gate    men    had    been     briefed       by   my

deputy, Police Sergeant Goddard, during August 1988, whilst I was on leave.

Liaison      had been made            with senior officers                     from the Fire Service and the

Ambulance Service and Superintendent Murray and myself during this present

season re any major disaster.

On    15 April         1989,    I   commenced duty             at   'Fl' at 7-00 a.m.                 At 7*30 a.m. I

patrolled         the    ground          area    and     surrounding            roads     with       Police     Sergeant

Hodkinson who was detailed as a driver for the day.                                      At 7-50 a.m. that
morning,          I    located           some    rubble      near    to     Parkside         Section        Station    and    a

message was raised on the computer to have this removed,                                              it was from a gas

Board excavation the previous day.

with     positioning.                I    then    saw Police         Sergeant       Dent,       Dog Section,          liaison

then     took         place       regarding        search      for    explosives.              I     then    liaised       with

gives        details         of    intelligence.             I gave       details       of     reporting       on    and    off

At approximately                  10.30 a.m.       the briefing finished and everything was going

to p l a n .

At    10.45       a.m.       that    day,       with    Chief Superintendent                 Duckenfield        and Police

Sergeant          Hodkinson, we patrolled round area of ground and                                      coach routes in

*F' Division.

At 11.15 a.m. that day, officers out on ground, general patrol of area with

C h ie f Superintendent Duckenfield on foot walked down Leppings Lane,
 barriers       in position.               Near to Leppings Lane traffic island, a minor road

 traffic       accident          had    taken       place.       Officers          under        command    of       Inspector

 Millett dealing.

At     12.30    a.tr.. approximately,                liaising with Mr.                  Lock,    Security Officer           in

 club    video       room        and    general      patrol      of     ground       with       Chief     Superintendent

Duckenfield - no problems,                      there were not a lot of fans about.                             Fans spoken

to in vicinity of the ground all in good spirits, no problems, no evidence

of alcohol at that stage.

At 1.30 p.m. with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield we went to the gymnasium

for a hot meal, outside CID officers and track serials also mealing.

At     1.45    p.m.        approximately            to   Control           Room,    left        Chief    Superintendent

Duckenfield,              Superintendent             Murray,          Police        Sergeant        Goddard,          Police

Constable           Ryan,        Police     Constable          Bichard       in     Control        Box.         I    believe

Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson, in civilian clothing also present.

Between       1.50        p.m.    and     2.30 p.m.      general           patrol       of North        Stand    and South

Stand area upper concourses checking on betting booths, no problems noticed

and    that South Stand concourse were busy, quite a lot of Nottingham Forest

fans     arriving          early. No      evidence       of          alcohol       in      South    Stand.          Checking

North     Stand       betting           booths           -    not     so     busy in      Liverpool        side,still       no

visible evidence of alcohol.

At    2.45 p.m.        in the vicinity of the gymnasium and Police                                  Room area I was

aware    that there were a number of prisoners on the cell buses and that the

Police    Room       were        busy     but   I    spoke      with       Inspector        Barker,       who,      did   not

report        any    problems             other than         busy,     but         this     was     to     be expected.

Everything          was     still         going to    plan.          About         this time      I was     aware      of   a

message       frons Control            that     there    were        problems       &t    Leppings       Lane       and that

further       manpower           was    required.             About        this    time     problems        with       radio

reception.          I recall Police Sergeant Goddard's (Control) voice was having a
                                                                  -9 -




    'warbling'          effect.         I thought my radio battery was                         faulty, other officers

    were    experiencing              difficulty,          obvious        a    radio     fault,      not    my     particular

    radio.          I    got     the        impression       that        Control       were     receiving         calls,    but

    officers outside were having difficulty in receiving Control.

    It was apparent             by the tone of Police Sergeant G o dd ar d ’s voice that urgent

    assistance was required at Leppings Lane.                                   I returned to the gymnasium and

    informed Cor.trol that there were a large number of 'D' Division officers on

    standby        who        were    available       for     deployment.               I     got    from    Control       that

    officers were required at the track,                            Leppings Lane end, west Stand and                       'A'

    gate.

    I   grouped         the     serials       together      and     as        the    Sergeant       in    charge    left    the

    gymnasium,          I got Police Sergeant                467 Sewell on logistics                      in the gymnasium

    to record who was being deployed and where to.                                     The following Sergeants and

    serials    of        approximately          eight       men     in        each    were    deployed       as     follows

    (All 'D' Division)

    Police Sergeant 2916                                     Track

    Police Sergeant             1055                         West Stand

    Police Sergeant              915                         Track


•   Police Sergeant 2379                                     West Stand

    Police Sergeant              916                         ’A ’ Gate

    Police Sergeant              993                         ’A ’ Gate

    I   radioed     to        Control       where    these    officers were              being deployed,            but I am

    unable to say if Control received my messages.                                     All the above officers were

    deployed       at     2.50       p.m.      It    was    obvious           from    Control       that    they    required

    further manpower to the Leppings Lane end.                                      I do recall some radio message

    about    the    gates        being      opened    and     that people were                on    the    track.     I then

    regrouped 'E' Division Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who

    were a reserve serial and deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane

track at 3-OC p.m.

Further serials from 'D' Division arrived in the region of 3-00 p.m., these

were deployed as follows:-

Police        Sergeant      690        )                and serial to

Police        Sergeant      628        )                Leppings Lane track.

Followed by Police Sergeant                        1379, Police Sergeant              593,    Police Sergeant 7,

Police        Sergeant 1415 and a number of                   'D' Division Police Constables                  tothe

track.Soce       few minutes                     later, I saw        Chief Superintendent             Nesbit who      I

think came       into the ground from Penistone Road end.                                  I spoke to him and he

went onto       the    track.          At     this stage which was now approximately 3.10 p.m.

as I recall,          it    just still seemed as though there had been trouble at                                  the

Leppings Lane end and that there had been a pitch invasion.

I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the Kop.

There    were    a    lot    of officers            in front         of   the    Leppings      Lane   terraces     and

obviously a number of fans in front of them.                                The Nottingham Forest fans on

the Kop were          chanting and I got the impression at that stage that a large

number    of    fans       were       going      onto   the    pitch      at    Leppings      Lane    end   and   that

there was going to be severe public disorder.                                   At that stage I feared that

fans may get          to    the Police Room and attempt                        to release the prisoners.            At

this    stage    also       I could hear over the radio that fans were trapped at                                  the

Leppings      Lane    end       and    that medical           care    was      required.       Ambulancemen were

arriving and I assisted with getting medical care and ambulances down onto

the track.       The crowd was continually hostile and I was aware of about ten

to twelve Police dogs and handlers being on standby near to the rear of the

Kop/North Stand            entrance.             Then a number of injured and dead were brought

from    the     track      up     to       the    Kop/North        Stand       exit   on     the   stretchers      and

hoarding boards.

At first it seemed as if there were just a few, six or so, dead or injured
and     then    people           came    running       off          the    track        with    dozens.         At     this    stage

which    was        probably        about      3-20 p.m.             Superintendent              Bates       arrived,        he came

into     the        gymnasium          with    me,     the          tables       and     chairs       for     the      meals      were

cleared        and       bodies     were       placed          on    the    floor        in     the   gymnasium.             Injured

people       were        taken    to    the far end of                 the gymnasium.                 Many Police Officers

were    bewildered and some were crying.                                   As bodies were being placed on the

floor,       friends        were        with    some       and       they        were    hysterical.             Two    Liverpool

males,       one with        a dark moustache was drunk and shouting at the Police, he

was restrained by Detective Sergeant Smith and another CID Officer.                                                           He was

wanting        to    fight        and was obviously                  in    drink and           shock.        The     bodies       kept

being brought              in fast and I was asking Control for a doctor to ensure that

they were           dead.        There was nothing to suggest that any of the bodies were

alive, but I was conscious they had not been certified as dead.                                                        The bodies

were    covered           with    the    table cloths previously laid out for the meals.                                             A

doctor with a beard attended after about 30 minutes and certified the dead.

I recall        Detective          Superintendent McKay                     in the gymnasium and arrangements

were getting in hand for the bodies to be numbered and an officer allocated

to    each     of        them.     Outside           the       gymnasium          there       were    numerous         bodies      and

injured        people       lying       on     the    ground         near        to     the    cell     buses.         St.    John's

Ambulance           personnel,          Police        Officers             and     civilians          were     in    attendance.

There were about six young St. John's personnel who were all under 14 or 15

years    of     age,        who    were       very    distressed             near        to    the Police        room.         I got

these    sat        in    the     cab part       of        a    cell       bus    and     a Policeman           from       *B2'    was

detailed to look after them.

I    remained        in     the     vicinity          of       the     gymnasium          for     the    next       hour     or    so.

Inspector       Charles           was detailed             to start          making           records    of the bodies and

several CID Officers came to assist.

About 4.30 p.m.             I saw Chief Inspector Beal and together we grouped all the

  remaining         officers      who    were    not     involved        with     bodies     or    other        duties

  together in the North Stand.                  A short de-brief took place telling Sergeants

  to hand      their de-brief sheets              in at that location before being stood down

  by Control        from the ground.            Arrangements were made via message switch for

 a message to be relayed to all Police Stations and over local radio that no

 Police Officers had been injured in the incident.

 About 4.30 p.m. I saw Chief Superintendent Mole in uniform at the ground.

 At   6.00 p.m.       I returned        to the gymnasium and assisted with supervision of

 the Casualty Bureau forms.

 Throughout      the evening I was involved with liaising with the relatives and

 social    workers         and arrangements         for extra          telephones       to be     placed in the

 gymnasiumn for the use of relatives.

At    5.30 a.m.       on Sunday        16 April     19-39, I left the gymnasium after the last

STEVEN ROBERT SEWELL

INSPECTOR



Since October            1987,    I have    been the          fifth Inspector at             'Fl'    Sub-Division

and    from       that   time     I have    had responsibility                 for the preparation of           the

'FI'    football orders at               'FI*.     I took over from Inspector Calvert who had

been doing the football orders at Hammerton Road for a number of years and

the systems of organising the manpower etc. are largely based on systems he

introduced.

I was       involved with the organisation of the                         1988 Semi-Final for Liverpool

and Nottingham Forest.                   This    was    done    together with Chief Inspector Beal

and Inspector Calvert in consultation with Superintendent Murray and Chief

Superintendent Mole.

As    the    semi-finals         for 1989 were drawing near I was watching which teams

were likely to be in the semi-finals.                          During the week commencing 13 March

1989,       it looked as if a semi-final could be staged at Hillsborough and at

that    stage       I    started     addressing          my    mind       to   a    possible      semi-final     at

Hillsborough.

On Saturday 18 March 1989, the F.A. Cup 6th rounds took place.                                        On 20 March

1989,       the    draws    for    the    semi-final          took    place        and   again,     Liverpool   and

Nottingham Forest were drawn to play.                           I believe it was later on that day

that    Chief       Superintendent          Mole       informed      me    that      the   semi-final       between

those two teams was due to be staged at Hillsborough.                                      Easter Bank Holiday

weekend was          due on 24,       25,       26 and 27 March            1989 and together with Chief

Superintendent Mole, a meeting was arranged for Wednesday 22 March 1989, of

all persons involved with the semi-final.                            Chief Superintendent Mole, Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, who was to be the Divisional Commander from 27

March 1989, Superintendent Marshall, Superintendent Murray, Chief Inspector

 their Chief       Inspectors,            South Yorkshire Highways                 Department, Headquarters

 Operations       staff,       Football          Liaison     Officer.            Through      Football    Liaison

 Department,       liaison          was    made     with     Sheffield           Wednesday     Football    Club,

 Nottingham       Forest      Club,        Liverpool       Football        Club,     Merseyside     Police    and

 Nottinghamshire         Constabulary.             Through        Operations       Room,      liaison was kept

 with South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.

After the formal meeting on 22 March 1 9 8 9 , close liaison was kept with all

parties       until     the   semi-final          on   15 April         1989.      Close      co-operation was

maintained throughout.

Together with Chief Inspector Beal,                        the previous match order for the I9 8 8

semi-final       was    studied and as            this was        a successful operation,            it formed

the     basis     of    the    1989        semi-final.            Briefs      were      prepared   with    Chief

Superintendent Beal, these were all discussed in detail with Superintendent

Murray and approved by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

Basically,       the    serials were         the same        as for the          1988 semi-final with the

following main changes.                   I will deal with these briefly as I am aware that

Chief Inspector Beal will be dealing with the changes in minute detail in

his report.

Three    Inspectors who acted as                  liaison officers            to sector commanders were

dispensed with as they were under employed.                              One reserve serial stationed

at    South     Stand/Spion         Kop    was    dispensed        with     as     it   was    superfluous    to

requirements.          Supervision of mobile units was reduced by two Inspectors as
                                                         -3 -




in practice       they could only be with one unit at a time.                                    Serials        1 and 2

were     increased           by       two      Police    Constables            and       one     Police        Sergeant

respectively .

Serials     11    and       12    (North     Stand)     were     decreased          as   their main          tasks   for

ensuring       that    supporters           did not use         the Penistone Road North egress did

not require the manning afforded in 1988.                               Serial 15 was decreased by                   one

Sergeant,      leaving one Sergeant supervising one serial.                                    Further serials on

the outskirts of the ground patrols were reduced from one Sergeant and 10

Police    Constables             to   one   Sergeant     and      eight     Constables.               None   of    these

serials    were       directly          involved    with       access     or    egress         from    the     football

stadium and it was considered by all that these extra two Police Constables

per serial were additional to requirements.

Better use was made of resources and at Phase III, four serials from within

the ground,       that was serials, 2,8,20                 and 21 were to assist the track serial

to prevent any pitch invasion at the                       end of the match.

Also,    during       the    1988 semi-final,           all serials deployed outside the ground

were on standby for refreshments at Claywheels Lane through the duration of

the match.        They were some quarter of a mile away from the ground and were

too far away to deploy in the ground at short notice.                                     This year, following

an idea put forward by Superintendent Murray,                               from 2.45 p.m. on the day of

the semi-final, a Police coach was stationed in Leppings Lane, near to the

ground and a further Police coach was stationed in Penistone Road near to

gate    'O'.      Of    the       men    who    were    due     to   meal      at    Claywheels         Lane      Police

Station throughout the match,                     five serials,         i.e.        five Sergeants and forty

Police Constables, were detailed to get on EACH coach at the two locations

at 3-00 p.m.           They would remain on standby until 3-30 p.m. when the coach

would drop them off at Claywheels                       Lane Police Station for a meal and then

pick up five further serials on EACH coach to return to the ground for
                                                               -4 -




deployment.

This would make better use of 20 serials throughout Phase II of the game.

In actual fact, the five serials which were making their way to EACH of the

two coaches          for 3-00 p.m. brought them to                             the ground for that time instead

of     the   men     being       a    quarter    of        a    mile          away   at    Claywheels           Lane    Police

Station.          These     10 Serials          being          in     the      vicinity        of   the   two coaches         at

3-00    p.m.      were     all       in addition       to manpower                resources         to    the    1988    semi­

final, as all these men would have been at                                     Claywheels Lane Police Station.

The serials          around the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and Penistone Road and

in the       enclosure          to the   same were             the       same as for           1988 which had proved

adequate.           The     intelligence         supplied                by    Football        Liaison     and    Detective

Sergeant       Charlesworth           local     intelligence,                  did not throw up any different

problems from the               1988 semi-final which proved to be a success.                                      However,

even    though       the    1988 semi-final            had been a success earnest                          consideration

was made when preparing                  the    1989 semi-final and every effort was made to

improve on an already successful operation from the previous year.

The Operational Order was approved and circulated on 6 April                                                1989, to all

Senior Officers of Chief Inspector and above involved in the operation.                                                       A

pre-briefing was arranged for sub-sector Inspectors and above on Friday,                                                      14

April      1989     in    the    North    Stand       of       the       Wednesday Ground.                All    Inspectors

involved       in    the    operation          attended             or    a    Sergeant        deputing     for        the   few

Inspectors who were unable to attend.                                 This Sergeant then liaised with the

respective Inspectors prior to the match.

On that pre-brief,               Inspectors were handed an Operational Order and details

of   serials        under       their command         and       their duties.                  They were         also    given

serial orders for their respective Sergeants under their command.

At   the     pre-brief,          these    officers             were           briefed     by    Chief     Superintendent

Duckenfield on policy, by Superintendent Murray on what was required at the
                                                   -5 -




match and by myself on admin procedures which included reporting on and off

duty, overtime claims,            the   issue of radios including all                  ground serials to

have    an earpiece, the          issue    of meals       and    the     issue    of vehiclekeys         for

those on transits.          The individual sector commanders then briefed their men

taking    them   to   all    relevant      parts     of    the     grounds       to    examine     locations

pertinent to their duties.

A personnel carrier was made available for Inspectors on out-lying parts of

the order to view their duties.               Whilst placing the individual manpower on

the    Operational    Order,       every    consideration          was    made        to   using   the    best

resources   available       and    in particular supervisory officers with extensive

experience of the ground used in locations familiar to them.                                  With this in

mind, key Inspectors were placed in the following locations:-

Inspector Darling (FI)                        South       Stand and track.

Inspector Calver (late FI)                    Spion       Kop

Inspector Woodward (F2 late FI)               North       Stand.

Leppings Lane Terraces                        Inspector White (F) always works this

                                              duty extremely experienced.

Inspector Harvey (late FI)                    South Stand car park

Inspector Sykes (F2)                          Leppings Lane turnstiles, always works

                                              this duty, extremely experienced at this

                                              location assisted by Inspector Purdy HQ

                                               (relief at F I ).

The serials picked to work in the ground were mainly 'F' Division Officers,

all have good knowledge of the ground assisted by Spion Kop,                                  'E' Division

Officers, regularly work that area.                 West Stand 'E' Division Officers under

Sergeant Burman, worked that duty before.

Football Club before on several occasions.                                   Leppings Lane turnstiles three

serials,     'F2' Officers and one 'E' Division Officer all worked these duties

before.          The    Sergeants        in    particular          have        extensive          knowledge    of    this

particular day.

Other duties were considered when the manpower was placed on the serials

and great thought was used when identifying officers to particular duties

so    as    to    make     the     best       use    of      resources.              Also,    I     personally       made

arrangements for the stewards                       to be briefed in their respective stands at

11.15      a.m.    on     15    April     1989.           This     was        arranged       in    conjunction       with

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, with Mr Macrell, Club Secretary and Mr

Lock,      Security            Officer        Sheffield           Wednesday          Football         Club,     an     ex

During      August       1988,     I     had    attended           a    steward's        meeting       at     Sheffield

deputy, Police Sergeant Goddard, during August 1988, whilst I was on leave.

Ambulance Service and Superintendent Murray and myself during this present

morning,       I    located          some   rubble       near     to    Parkside       Section           Station    and   a

message was raised on the computer to have this removed,                                           it was from a gas

Board excavation the previous day.

with    positioning.             I     then saw Police            Sergeant      Dent,     Dog Section,             liaison

then    took       place       regarding      search       for     explosives.           I        then    liaised      with

At     10.00       a.m.    that         day,briefing         takes       place     in        North        Stand,     Chief

gives    details          of   intelligence.             I gave        details    of     reporting          on   and    off

meal allocation.

At approximately 10.30 a.m.                       the briefing finished and everything was going

to plan.

At    10.45 a.m.          that day,         with Chief Superintendent                  Duckenfield and Police

Sergeant Hodkinson, we patrolled round area of ground and coach routes in

'F* Division.

At 11.15 a.m. that day, officers out on ground, general patrol of area with

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on foot walked down Leppings Lane
                                                             -8 -




barriers in position.                 Near to Leppings Lane traffic island, a minor road

traffic       accident       had    taken     place.            Officers          under    command      of       Inspector

Millett dealing.

At   12.30 a.m.           approximately,             liaising with Mr.             Lock,     Security Officer                in

club    video       room     and    general          patrol     of     ground            with Chief     Superintendent

Duckenfield - no problems, there                        were not a lot of fans about.                    Fans spoken

to in vicinity of the ground all                            in good spirits, no problems, no evidence

of alcohol at that stage.

At 1.30 p.m. with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield we went to the gymnasium

for a hot meal, outside CID officers and track serials also mealing.

At     1.45    p.m.       approximately          to         Control Room, left             Chief      Superintendent

Duckenfield,              Superintendent             Murray,         Police       Sergeant       Goddard,           Police

Constable       Ryan,        Police    Constable             Bichard        in     Control      Box.         I     believe

Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson, in civilian clothing also present.

Between       1.50 p.m.       and     2.30 p.m.         general patrol of North Stand and South

Stand area upper concourses checking on betting booths, no problems noticed

and that South Stand concourse were busy, quite a lot of Nottingham Forest

fans    arriving          early.      No    evidence          of     alcohol      in South      Stand.           Checking

North    Stand        betting      booths        -    not     so     busy    in    Liverpool       side,         still       no

visible evidence of alcohol.

At 2.45 p.m.          in the vicinity of the gymnasium and Police Room area I was

aware that there were a number of prisoners on the cell buses and that the

Police    Room       were    busy     but    I       spoke    with     Inspector          Barker,      who,       did    not

report        any    problems       other        than       busy,      but       this     was   to     be     expected.

Everything          was    still    going     to plan.              About     this      time    I was       aware       of    a

message       from Control          that    there       were        problems       at Leppings         Lane and that

further       manpower       was     required.               About     this       time     problems         with     radio

reception.          I recall Police Sergeant Goddard's (Control) voice was having
                                                           -9 -




'warbling' effect.                I thought my radio battery was faulty, other officers

were     experiencing          difficulty,         obvious         a    radio     fault,     not     my     particular

radio.         I     got    the     impression       that         Control       were     receiving        calls,      but

officers outside were having difficulty in receiving Control.

It was apparent by the tone of Police Sergeant Goddard's voice that urgent

assistance was required at Leppings Lane.                                I returned to the gymnasium and

informed Control that there were a large number of 'D' Division officers on

standby        who    were     available      for     deployment.                 I got          from Control       that

officers were required at the track,                              Leppings Lane end, west Stand and 'A'

gate.

I   grouped        the     serials    together       and     as        the    Sergeant      in    charge     left     the

gymnasium,          I got Police Sergeant 467 Sewell on logistics in the gymnasium

to record who was being deployed and                          where to. The following Sergeants and

serials    of        approximately       eight      men           in    each were      deployed as          follows

(All 'D' Division)

Police     Sergeant 2916                             Track

Police     Sergeant 1055                            West Stand

Police     Sergeant         915                     Track

Police     Sergeant 2379                            West Stand

Police     Sergeant         916                     'A' Gate

Police     Sergeant         993                     'A' Gate

I   radioed     to Control           where   these    officers were being deployed,                          but I am

unable to say if Control received my messages.                                  All the above officers were

deployed       at    2.50    p.m.      It    was    obvious            from    Control      that     they    required

further manpower to the Leppings Lane end.                                   I do recall some radio message

about    the    gates       being opened and          that people were                 on   the     track.      I then

regrouped 'E' Division Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who

were a reserve serial and deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane

track at 3-00 p.m.

Further serials from 'D' Division arrived in the region of 3-00 p.m., these

were deployed as follows

Police Sergeant           690        )                and serial to

Police Sergeant           628        )                Leppings Lane track.

Followed by Police Sergeant                     1379, Police Sergeant 593, Police Sergeant 7,

Police Sergeant 1415 and a number of                         'D' Division Police Constables to the

track.        Some    few minutes later,               I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit who I

think came into the ground from Penistone Road end.                                   I spoke to him and he

went     onto the track.             At this stage which was now approximately 3.10 p.m.

as I     recall,      it just still seemed as though                     there had been trouble at          the

Leppings Lane end and that there had been a pitch invasion.

I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the Kop.

There    were     a lot of officers               in front of the Leppings               Lane   terraces   and

obviously a number of fans in front of them.                             The Nottingham Forest fans on

the Kop were chanting and I got the impression at that stage that a large

number    of     fans    were   going          onto   the    pitch   at    Leppings     Lane    end and    that

there was going to be severe public disorder.                              At that stage I feared that

fans     may get      tothe Police Room and attempt                      to release the prisoners.          At

this     stage    also I could hear over the radio                       that fans were trapped at          the

Leppings       Lane   end and        that medical           care was required.           Ambulancemen were

arriving and I assisted with getting medical care and ambulances down onto

the track.        The crowd was continually hostile and I was aware of about ten

to twelve Police dogs and handlers being on standby near to the rear of the

Kop/North Stand entrance.                      Then a number of injured and dead were brought

from    the     track    up     to       the    Kop/North        Stand    exit   on    the   stretchers    and

hoarding b o a r d s .

At first it seemed as if there were just a few, six or so, dead or injured
                                                                 -1 1 -




and    then     people          came    running          off     the      track with dozens.               At     this stage

which was        probably about               3-20 p.m.            Superintendent Bates arrived,                        he    came

into     the    gymnasium          with       m e , the          tables         and    chairs    for      the    meals        were

cleared        and    bodies       were       placed       on      the     floor       in the    gymnasium.             Injured

people were           taken      to the far end of the gymnasium.                                Many Police Officers

were bewildered and some were crying.                                     As bodies were being placed on the

floor,       friends       were        with    some        and     they were           hysterical.          Two    Liverpool

males,    one with a dark moustache was drunk and shouting at the Police, he

was restrained by Detective Sergeant Smith and another CID Officer.                                                      He was

wanting        to fight and was obviously                          in drink and shock.                  The     bodies        kept

being brought in fast and I was asking Control for a doctor to ensure that

they were dead.                 There was nothing to suggest that any of the bodies were

alive, but I was conscious they had not been certified as dead.                                                   The bodies

were    covered        with the         table cloths previously laid out for the meals.                                          A

doctor with a beard attended after about 30 minutes and certified the dead.

I recall        Detective Superintendent McKay in the gymnasium and arrangements

were getting in hand for the bodies to be numbered and an officer allocated

to    each     of    them.         Outside          the    gymnasium            there    were    numerous         bodies       and

injured       people       lying       on     the    ground         near        to the    cell      buses.        St.    John's

Ambulance        personnel,             Police       Officers             and    civilians       were     in     attendance.

There were about six young St. John's personnel who were all under 14 or 15

years    of     age,       who were         very         distressed         near       to the Police          room.          I got

these    sat     in       the    cab part           of    a cell          bus    and    a Policeman        from        'B2'    was

detailed to look after them.

I    remained        in    the     vicinity          of     the      gymnasium          for   the    next       hour     or    so.

Inspector Charles                was detailed             to start making records                    of the bodies and

several CID Officers came to assist.

About 4.30 p.m. I saw Chief Inspector Beal and together we grouped all the



                                                                                                      c

remaining       officers      who    were    not     involved        with   bodies     or     other    duties

together in the North Stand.                A short de-brief took place telling Sergeants

to hand their de-brief sheets in at that location before being stood down

by Control from the ground.                 Arrangements were made via message switch for

a message to be relayed to all Police Stations and over local radio that no

Police Officers had been injured in the incident.

About 4.30 p.m. I saw Chief Superintendent Mole in uniform at the ground.

At 6.00 p.m.       I returned to the gymnasium and assisted with supervision of

the Casualty Bureau forms.

Throughout the evening I was involved with liaising with the relatives and

social workers       and arrangements             for extra         telephones    to be placed in the

gymnasiumn for the use of relatives.

General    liaison       of    events       re-busing          of    relatives       from   Forbes     Road.

Casualty Bureau duties were completed and s ^ j ^ g ^ t h a t                     the ancillary admin

staff and civilian staff were supervised andofcounted for.

At    5.30 a.m.    on Sunday        16 April      1989, I left the gymnasium after the last

body had been removed and returned to duty at 11.00 a.m. the same day.

The    Chief    Constable,      Colin       Moynahan      the       Minister   for    Sport,    Councillor

Nesbit,    Chief     Superintendent           Mole,       Professor      Usher,      Doctor    Popper      and

numerous social workers and clergy attended the gymnasium, this boosted the

morale    and     efforts     of     the    150    plus        Police    Officers      involved       in   the

gymnasium.        Many Police Officers             have       been in deep shock since the event

and    in particular,       six of my Area Officers who were in the front line on

the   track in front of Leppings Lane terraces, went off sick due to shock

and stress related          illnesses.         All    the Police Officers I saw involved in

the   event,    acted    in a professional manner and are                      a total      credit    to the

South Yorkshire Police.

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE INCIDENT ROOM,
HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION, BY 18.4.89. THE QUESTIONNAIRES OF
OFFICERS ON ANNUAL LEAVE MUST BE COMPLETED ON THEIR RETURN TO DUTY.
Stephen Robert Sewell
5th Inspector 'FI*


Since October 1987 I have been the 5th Inspector at 'FI' Sub

Division and from that time I have had responsibility for the

preparation of the 'FI' football orders at 'FI'.     I took over from

Inspector Calvert who had been doing the football orders at

Hammerton Road for a number of years and the systems of organising

the manpower etc are largely based on systems he introduced.

Generally speaking officers who attend the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Ground on match duty all say that the policing of the

grounds at Hillsborough is more efficient than that at other grounds

in the county.   It may well be that as Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club is a First Division club - more money is available and as    such

manpower is not reduced as it is at other grounds.



I was involved with the organisation of the 1988 Semi Final for

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.   This was done together with Chief

Inspector Beal and Inspector Calvert in consultation with

Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent Mole.



As the semi finals for 1989 were drawing near I was watching which

teams were likely to be in the semi finals.   During the week

commencing 13 March 1989 it looked as if a semi final could be

staged at Hillsborough and at that stage I startedaddressing my

mind to a possible semi final at Hillsborough.
                                                                 (2)



On Saturday 18 March 1989 the FA Cup 6th rounds took place.      On 20

March 1989 the draws for the semi final took place and again

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were drawn to play.    I believe it

was later on that day that Chief Superintendent Mole informed me

that the semi final between those two teams was due to be staged at

Hillsborough.   Easter Bank holiday weekend was due on 24, 25, 26 and

27 March 1989 and together with Chief Superintendent Mole a meeting

was arranged for Wednesday 22 March 1989 of ail persons involved

with the semi final.   Chief Superintendent Mole, Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, who was to be the divisional commander

from 27 March 1989, Superintendent Marshall, Superintendent Murray,

Chief Inspector Beal, Inspector Sewell, Police Sergeant Goddard

Control Room, Police Sergeant Fidler admin,    Chief Superintendent

Nesbit, Superintendent Brougham Traffic Inspector, Sayers Traffic,

Sergeant Sorsby mounted, Inspector Phoenix dogs, Police Sergeant 'D'

Divisions representative, Inspector Dews 'D 2 ', Headquarters

catering, communications department, press    liaison, Police Sergeant

Walton motorcycle, Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson, South

Yorkshire Transport representative, British Transport Police and

British Rail, Sector Superintendent commanders and their Chief

Inspectors, South Yorkshire Highways Department, Headquarters

operations staff, football liaison officer.   Through Football

Liaison Department; liaison was made with Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club, Nottingham Forest Club, Liverpool Football Club,

Merseyside Police and Nottinghamshire Constabulary.    Through

operations room; liaison was kept with South Yorkshire Ambulance

Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.

                                                                     (3)



    After the formal meeting on 22 March 1989, close liaison was kept

    with all parties until the semi final on 15 April 1989. Close co­

    operation was maintained throughout.



    Together with Chief Inspector Beal, the previous match order for the

    1988 semi final was studied and as this was a total successful

    operation, it formed the basis of the 1989 semi final.    Briefs were

    prepared with Chief Inspector Beal, these were all discussed in

    detail with Superintendent Murray and approved by Chief

    Superintendent Duckenfield.



    Basically, the serials were the same as for the 1988 semi final

    with the following main changes.    I will deal with these briefly as

    I am aware that Chief Inspector Beal will be dealing with the

    changes in minute detail in his report.



    Three Inspectors who acted as liaison officers to sector commanders

    were dispensed with as they were under employed.    One reserve serial

    stationed at South Stand/Spion kop was dispensed with as it was

    superfluous to requirements. Supervision of mobile units was reduced

    by two Inspectors as in practice they could only be with one unit at

    a time.   Serials 1 and 2 were increased by two Police Constables and

    one Police Sergeant respectively.



    Serials 11 and 12 (North Stand) were decreased as their main task of

    ensuring that supporters did not use the Penistone Road North egress

    did not require the manning afforded in 1988.   Serial 15 was

    decreased by one Sergeant, leaving one Sergeant supervising one
    serial.
                                                                  ( 4)



Further serials on the outskirts of the ground patrols were reduced

from one Sergeant and 10 Police Constables to one Sergeant and eight

Constables.   None of these serials were directly involved with

access or egress from the football stadium and it was considered by

all that these extra two Police Constables per serial were

additional to requirements.



Better use was made of resources and at Phase III,     four serials

from within the ground, that was serials 2,8,20 and 21 were to assist

the track serial to prevent any pitch invasion at the end of the

match.



Also, during the 1988 semi final, all serials deployed outside the

ground were on standby for refreshments at Claywheels Lane

throughout the duration of the match.    They were some quarter of a

mile away from the ground and were too far away to deploy in the

ground at short notice.   This year, following an idea put forward by

Superintendent Murray, from 2.45 pm on the day of the 1989 semi

final,   a Police coach was stationed in Leppings Lane near to the

ground and a further Police coach was stationed in Penistone Road

near to gate 'O'.   Of the men who were due to meal at Claywheels

Lane Police Station throughout the match, five serials ie five

Sergeants and 40 Police Constables were detailed to get on each

coach at the two locations at 3 pm.     They would remain on standby

until 3.30 pm when the coach would drop them off at Claywheels Lane

Police Station for meal and then pick up five further serials on each

coach to return to the ground for deployment.
»
                                                                      (5)



    This would make better use of 20 serials throughout Phase II of the

    game.     In actual fact, the five serials which were making their way

    to each of the two coaches for 3 pm brought them to the ground for

    that time instead of the men being £ of a mile away at Claywheels

    Lane Police Station.     These 10 serials being in the vicinity of the

    two coaches at 3 pm were all in addition to manpower resources to

    the 1988 semi final as all these men would have been at Claywheels

    Lane Police Station.



    The serials around the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and Penistone

    Road and in the enclosure to the same were the same as for 1988

    which had proved adequate.     The intelligence supplied by Football

    liaison and Detective Sergeant Charlesworth local intelligence     did

    not throw up any different problems from the 1988 semi final which

    proved to be a total success.     However, just because the 1988 semi

    final had been a success earnest consideration was made when

    preparing the 1989 semi final and every effort was made to improve

    on an already successfull operation from the previous year.



    The operational order was approved and circulated on 6 April 198 9 to

    all senior officers of Chief Inspector and above involved in the

    operation.    A pre—briefing was arranged for sub sector Inspectors

    and above on Friday 14 April 1989 in the North Stand of the

    Wednesday ground.     All Inspectors involved in the operation attended

    or a Sergeant deputising for the few Inspectors who were unable to

    attend.    This Sergeant then liaised with the respective Inspectors
    prior to the match.
On that pre-brief, Inspectors were handed an operational order and

details of serials under their command and their duties.       They were

also givenserial orders for their respective Sergeants under their
command.



At the pre-brief, these Officers were briefed by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield on Policy,       by Superintendent Murray on

what was required at the match and by myself on admin procedures

which included reporting on and off duty, overtime claims, the issue

of radios including all ground serials to have an earpiece, the

issue of meals and the issue of vehicle keys for those on transits.

The individual sector commanders then briefed their men taking them

to all the relevant parts of the grounds to examine locations
pertinent to their duties.



A personal carrier was made available for Inspectors on out—lying

parts of the order to view their duties.      Whilst placing the

individual manpower on the operational order, every consideration

was made to using the best resources available and in particular

supervisory officers with extensive experience of the ground used in

locations familiar to them.   With this in mind, key Inspectors were

placed in the following locations:

Inspector Darling (FI) - South Stand and track

Inspector Calvert (late F l ) - Spion kop

Inspector Woodward (F2 late F l ) - North Stand

Leppings Lane Terraces - Inspector White (F), always works this duty
extremely experienced.
                                                                  (7)



Inspector Bullas (HQ) PSU - West Stand regular relief at F Division.

Inspector Harvey (late F l ) - South Stand car park

Inspector Sykes (F2) - Leppings Lane Turnstiles, always works this

duty extremely experienced at this location assisted by Inspector
Purdy HQ, (relief at F l ).

The serials picked to work in the ground were mainly 'F' Division

Officers, all have good knowledge of the ground assisted by Spion

Kop,   'E1 Division Officers, regularly work that area.    West Stand

'E' Division Officers under Sergeant Burman, worked that duty

before.   Leppings Lane terraces 'B' Division Officers worked at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club before on several occasions.

Leppings Lane turnstiles three serials 'F2' Officers and one 'E1

Division Officer all worked these duties before.      The Sergeants in

particular have extensive knowledge of this particular duty. \ '



Other duties were considered when the manpower was placed on the

serials and great thought was used when identifying Officers to

Particular duties so as to make the best use of resources.      Also, I

personally made arrangements for the stewards to be briefed in their

respective stands at 11.15 am on 15 April 1989.    This was arranged

in conjunction with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Mr Macrell

club secretary and Mr Lock, security officer Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club and ex-superintendent and football commander at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.   Officers briefing were:    South

Stand Inspector Darling, kop Inspector Calvert, North* Stand

Inspector Woodward, West Stand Inspector White.    In addition I have

close liaison with the senior stewards on all match days and with Mr

Macrell secretary SWFC and Mr Lock security officer.
During August 1988, I had attended a stewards meeting at Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and briefed all the stewards re emergency

evacuation and other problems and the gate men had been briefed by

my deputy, Police Sergeant Goddard during August 1988 whilst I was

on leave.   Liaison had been made with senior officers from the Fire

Service and the ambulance service and Superintendent Murray and

myself during this present season re any major disaster.



On 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at 'Fl1 at 7 am.      At 7.30 am I

patrolled the ground area and surrounding roads with Police Sergeant

Hodkinson who was detailed as a driver for the day.      At 7.50 am that

morning, I located some rubble near to Parkside Section Station and

message was raised on the computer to have this removed, it was from

a gas board excavation the previous day.



At 8 am that morning, at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, I

liaised with Inspector Bennett admin, and Police Sergeant Fidler,

checking all cones and barriers in position, radios collected and

ready for distribution.     Police Sergeant Colley was seen in the

Police room and all was in order.     Inspector Scarfe was liaised with

re cell buses arriving, articulated vehicle     from West Yorkshire

(food wagon) arriving, assisted with positioning.     I then saw Police

Sergeant Dent, dog section, liaison     then took place regarding

search for explosives.     I then liaised   with Civilian staff

regarding hot drinks to be served to approximately 700 officers

attending briefing.      Checked with Inspector Bennett, all in hand

assisting officers into North Stand for briefing in accordance with
seating plan.
At 10 am that day, briefing takes place in North Stand, Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield set the scene, Superintendent Murray

givss the order of the day and wha*t is required.    Detective Sergeant

Charlesworth gives details of intelligence.     I gave details of

reporting on and off duty, radio issue and collection, overtime,

transit keys allocation and meal allocation.



At approximately 10.30 am the briefing finished and everything was
going to plan.



At 10.45 am that day, with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

Police Sergeant Hodkinson, we patrolled round area of ground and

coach routes in 'F' Division.



At 11.15 am that day, Officers out on ground, general patrol of area

with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on foot walked down Leppings

Lane,barriers in position.Near to Leppings Lane traffic island, a

minor road traffic accident had taken place. Officers under command

of Inspector Millett dealing.



At 12.30 am approximately, liaising with Mr Lock security officer in

club video room and general patrol of ground with Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield - no problems, there were not alot of

fans about.     Fans spoken to in vicinity of the ground all in good

spirits, no problems, no evidence of alcohol at that stage.



At 1.30 pm with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield we went to the

gymnasium for a hot meal, outside CID officers and track serials
also mealing.
                                                                  (10)



At 1.45 pm approximately, to Control Room left Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield, Superintendent Murray, Police Sergeant Goddard, Police

Constable Ryan, Police Constable Bichard in control box.    I believe

Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson in civilian clothing also
present.



Between 1.50 pm and 2.30 pm, general patrol of North Stand and South

Stand area upper concourses checking on betting booths, no problems

noticed and that South Stand concourse were busy, quite a lot of

Nottingham Forest fans arriving early.   No evidence of alcohol in

South Stand.   Checking North Stand betting booths - not so busy in

Liverpool side, still no visible evidence of alcohol.



At 2.45 pm in the vicinity of the gymnasium and Police room area I

was aware that there were a number of prisoners on the cell buses

and that the Police room were busy but I spoke with Inspector Barker

who did not report any problems other than busy, but this was to be

expected.   Everything was still going to plan.   About this time I

was aware of a message from Control that there were problems at

Leppings Lane and that further manpower was required.   About this

time problems with radio reception.   I recall Police Sergeant

Goddard's (Control) voice was having a 'warbling' effect.   I thought

mY radio battery was faulty, other officers were experiencing

difficulty, obvious a radio fault, not   my particular radio.    I got

the impression that Control were receiving calls, but officers

outside were having difficulty in receiving Control.
It was apparent by the tone of Police Sergeant Goddard's voice that

urgent assistance was required at Leppings Lane.     I returned to the

gymnasium and informed Control that there were a large number of 'D'

Division officers on standby who were available for deployment.           I

got from Control that Officers were required at the track, Leppings

Lane end, West Stand and 'A' gate.



I grouped the serials together and as the Sergeant in charge left

the gymnasium, I got Police Sergeant 467 Sewell on logistics in the

gymnasium to record who was being deployed    andwhereto.    The

following Sergeants and serials    ofapproximately eightmen in each

were deployed as follows:     (All 'D' Division)

Police Sergeant 2916 - Track

Police Sergeant 1055 - West Stand

Police Sergeant 915 - Track

Police Sergeant 2379 - West Stand

Police Sergeant 916 - 'A' Gate

Police Sergeant 993 - 'A' Gate



I radioed to Control where these officers were being deployed, but I

am unable to say if Control received my messages.     All the above

Officers were deployed at 2.50 pm.     It was obvious from Control that

they required further manpower to the Leppings Lane end.       I do

recall some radio message about the gates beingopened       and that

people were on the track.   At that stage I gottheimpression           from

the gymnasium that there was a pitch invasion.     I then regrouped       'E'

Divison Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who were a

reserve serial and deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane
track at 3 pm.
                                                                      (12)



Further serials from 'D1 Division arrived in the region of 3 pm,

these were deployed as follows:

Police Sergeant 690     )     and serial to Leppings Lane track
                        )
Police Sergeant 628     )

Followed by Police Sergeant 1379,     Police Sergeant 593,   Police

Sergeant 7, Police Sergeant 1415      and a number of 'D1 Division Police

Constables to the track.       Some few minutes later, I saw Chief

Superintendent Nesbit, who I think came into the ground from

Penistone Road end.     I spoke to him and he went onto the track.      At

this stage which was now approximately 3.10pmas I recall, it just

still seemed as though there had      been trouble at the Leppings Lane

end and that there had been a pitch invasion.



I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the kop.

There were a lot of Officers in front of the Leppings Lane terraces

and obviously a number of fans in front of them.       The Nottingham

Forest fans on the kop were chanting and I got the impression at

that stage that a large number of fans were going onto the pitch at

Leppings Lane end and that there was going to be severe public

disorder.   At that stage I feared that fans may get to the Police

room and attempt to release the prisoners.       At this stage also I

could hear over the radio that fans were trapped at the Leppings

Lane end and that medical care was required. Ambulancemen were

arriving and I assisted with getting medical care and ambulances

down on to the track.       The crowd was continually hostile and I was

aware of about 10 to 12 Police dogs and handlers being on standby

near to the rear of the kop/North Stand entrance.       Then a number of

injured and dead were brought from the track up to the kop/North

Stand exit on stretchers and hoarding boards.
At first it seemed as if there were just a few, six or so, dead or

injured and then people came running off the track with dozens.         At

this stage which was probably about 3.20 pm, Superintendent Bates,

arrived, he came into the gymnasium with me, the tables and chairs

for the meals were cleared and bodies were placed on the floor in the

gymnasium.    Injured people were taken to the far end of the

gymnasium.    Many Police officers were bewildered and some were

crying.    As bodies were being placed on the floor, friends were

with some and they were hysterical.     Two Liverpool males, one with a

dark moustache was drunk and shouting at the Police, he was

restrained by Detective Sergeant Smith and another CID officer.         He

was wanting to fight and was obviously in drink and shock.       The

bodies kept being brought in fast and I was asking Control for a

doctor to ensure that they were dead.     There was nothing to suggest

that any of the bodies were alive, but I was conscious they had not

been certified as dead.    The bodies were covered with the table

cloths    previously laid out for the meals.   A doctor with a beard

attended after about 30 minutes and certified the dead.      I recall

Detective Superintendent McKay being inthe gymnasium and arrangements

were getting in hand for the bodies to be numbered and an officer

allocated to each of them.      Outside the gymnasium there were

numerous bodies and injured people lying on the ground near to the

cell buses.   St John Ambulance personnel, Police Officers and

civilians were in attendance.    There were about six young St John's

personnel who were all under 14 or 15 years of age, who were very

distressed near to the Police room.     I got these sat in the cab part

of a cell bus and a Policeman from 'B2' was detailed to look after
them.
                                                                      ( 14)


I remained in the vicinity of the gymnasium for the next hour or so.

Inspector Charles was detailed to start making records of the bodies

and several CID officers came to assist.



About 4.30 pm I saw Chief Inspector Beal and together we grouped all

the remaining officers who were not involved with bodies or other

duties together in the North Stand.     A short de-brief took place

telling Sergeants to hand their de-brief sheets in at that location

before being stood down by Control from the ground.          Arrangements

were made via message switch for a message to be relayed to all

Police Stations   and over local radio that no Police officers       had

been injured in   the incident.



About 4.30 pm I   saw Chief Superintendent Mole in uniform   at the ground,

he then took control   of events.   Many officers throughout the next 12

hours or so expressed comment that it was reassuring to see Chief

Superintendent Mole.



About 6 pm I returned to the gymnasium and assisted with supervision

of the casualty bureau forms.



Throughout the evening I was involved with liaising with the

relatives and social workers and arrangements for extra telephones

to be placed in the gymnasium for the use of relatives.



General liaison of events re busing of relatives from Forbes Road,

Casualty Bureau duties were completed and seeing that the ancillary

admin staff and civilian staff were supervised and accounted for.
At 5.30 am on Sunday 16 April 1989 I left the gymnasium after

the last body had been removed and returned to duty at 11 am
the same day.



The Chief Constable, Colin Moynaham, the Minister for Sport,

Councillor Irvine Patnick, Detective Chief Superintendent

Addis, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Chief Superintendent Mole,

Professor Usher, Docter Popper and numerous social workers and

clergy attended the gymnasium, this boosted the morale and

efforts of the 150 plus Police Officers involved in the

gymnasium.   Many Police Officers have been in deep shock since

the event and in particular six of my Area Officers who were in

the front line on the track in front of Leppings Lane terraces,

went off sick due to shock and stress-related illnesses.     All

the Police Officers I saw involved in the event, acted in a

professional manner and are a total credit to the South
Yorkshire Police.



When Liverpool attended the semi-final at Hillsborough last

year, a large number of fans were the worse for drink and they

were even urinating on the upper concourse of the North Stand,

instead of bothering to use the toilets.   As such, urine was

running out of the upper concourse, onto the enclosure outside

the Police room and gymnasium.   Contingency plans were in hand

for this match, for Superintendent Murray from Control, to

deploy standby 'D' Division Officers from the gymnasium to deal
with this problem.



In the planning stages, up until the day of the event and up

until 2.45 pm approximately on 15 April 198^ everything was

going to plan and was showing to be a success in every way.
Fans supporting Nottingham Forest were in position on the Spion kop

and South Stand in good time.   Due to the large number of Liverpool

fans who were outside the ground at Leppings Lane at 2.45 pm and

after, together with facts, that some public houses in the Wadsley

area sold more alcohol in two hours that Saturday lunchtime than on

New Years Eve, one can draw ones own conclusions as to whether

Liverpool fans were arriving late, the worse for drink or not.



As I was not at the Leppings Lane end prior to the build up of fans,

I am unable to comment on how or why the disaster happened.



Although I was involved in the supervision of many of the Officers

allocated to bodies, I did not physically assist the removal of any
particular body.

  INSPECTOR




  Since       October        19 8 7 , I have           been      the    fifth Inspector at                ’Fl'   Sub-Division

  and    from        that    time     I have          had responsibility                for      the    preparation   of    the

   Fl     foctba^.           orders      at    ’F I ’ .      I took over frorr. Inspector Calvert who had

 been doing the              football orders at Hammerton Road for a number of years and

 the systems of organising the manpower etc. are largely based on systems he

 introduced.

 I was        involved       with     the      organisation            of the       19SE     Seni-Final for Liverpool

 ana     Nottingham          Forest.           This        was   done    together with Chief Inspector                     Beal

 and     Inspector Calvert               in consultation with Superintendent Murray and Chief

 Superintendent Mole.

 As     the    semi-fmals            for      I9 S9    were      drawing near I was                   watching which teams

 were likely           to be in the semi-finals.                         During the week commencing 13 March

 1989,        it    looked    as    if a semi-final               could be staged at Hillsborough and at

 that     stage        1     started       addressing            my     mind       to   a       possible    semi-final      at

Hillsborough.

On Saturday 18 March 1 9 8 °, the F.A. Cup 6 th rounds took place.                                               On 20 March

1989,         the    draws     for    the       semi-final             took    place      and     again,    Liverpool      and

Nottingham Forest were                     drawn       to play.          I believe          it was      later on that day

that     Chief        Superintendent             Mole        informed         me    that        the    semi-final   between

those     two teams was due to be staged at Hillsborough.                                             Easter Bank Holiday

weekend        was    due     on   24,     25,        26   and    27 March         1989     and       together with Chief

Superintendent Mole, a meeting was arranged for Wednesday 2 2 March 1 9 8 9 , of

all persons involved with the semi-final.                                     Chief Superintendent Mole, Chief

      Nottinghamshire           Constabulary.              Through          Operations       Room,        liaison    was kept

      with South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.

     A f ter    the formal meeting on 22 March 1 9 8 9 , close liaison was kept with all

     parties      until        the   semi-final          on    15    April         1989.     Close        co-operation    was

     maintained throughout.

     Togeth er     with Chief Inspector                  B e e l , the previous match order for the 1966

     semi-final      was       studied      and    as     this      was     a successful          operation,        it formed

        V                      the   1989        semi-final.                Briefs    were        prepared     with    Chief

j                          Beal, these were all discussed in detail with Superintendent

    Murray      and approved by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

    Basically,      the     serials were            the    same      as     for the        1988    semi-final       with the

    following main changes.                     I will    deal with these briefly as I am aware that

    Chief      Inspector Beal .ill               be dealing with              the changes          in minute detail       in

    his report.


    T h ree    Inspectors       who acted         as    liaison       officers        to    sector        commanders    were

dispensed          with as       they were         under employed.                 One reserve serial stationed

at       South     Stand/Spion            Kop    was     dispensed           with    as     it    was     superfluous     to

requirements.             Supervision of mobile units .as reduced by t.o Inspectors as
     in practice          they       could only be with one                     unit        at    a time.     Serials      1 and 2

     were      increased             by        two         Police        Constables              and     one Police       Sergeant

     r es pec t i v e l y .

     Serials        11    and       12    (North Stand)           were   decreased           as    their      main       tasks   for

 ensuring           that       supporters            did    not    use    the     Penistone              Road North egress did

 not        require       the manning afforded                    in 1988.            Serial           15 was decreased by       one

 Sergeant,           leaving one Sergeant supervising one serial.                                          Further serials on

 the        outskirts          of    the ground patrols were                    reduced          from one Sergeant and 10

 Police         Constables               to    one         Sergeant      and    eight Constables. None                    of   these

 serials           were       directly          involved       with      access        or    egress        frou;   the    football

 stadium and it was considered by all that these extra two Police Constables

 per serial were additional to requirements.

 Better use was made of resources and at Phase III, four serials from within

 the ground,             that was serials, 2,8,20 and 21                           were to assist the track serial

 to prevent any pitch invasion at the end of the match.

 Also,       during       the       1988 semi-final,               all serials deployed                   outside     the ground

were on standbj                 for refreshments at Claywheels Lane through the duration of

the match.               They were some quarter of a mile away from the ground and were

too far away to deploy in the ground at short notice.                                                   This year, following

an idea put              forward by Superintendent Murray,                             from 2.^5 p.m. on the day of

the semi-final,                 a Police         coach was stationed in Leppings Lane,                              near to the

gate        'O'.         Of    the       men    who    were       due    to    meal     at       Claywheels        Lane    Police

Station        throughout            the match,            five serials,          i.e.       five Sergeants           and forty

Police Constables, were detailed to get on EACH coach at the two locations

at     3.00 p.m.              They would remain on standby until                             3.30 p.m. when the coach

would drop           them off at Claywheels                       Lane Police Station for a meal and then

pick up five further serials on EACH coach to return to the ground for
                                                                             - k -




           deployment.

       This        would make           better use of 20                 serials throughout Phase II of the ga.ne.

           In actual fact, the five serials which were making their way to EACH of the

       two coaches              for 3-0 0 p.m.            brought        their, to the ground for that time instead

       of     the     men        being        a    quarter        of    a     mile         away   at    Claywheels          Lane    Police

       Station.            These        10 Serials              being       in       the   vicinity     of     the    two    coaches at

       3-00        p.m.    were       all         in    addition       to manpower            resources        to     the    1988    semi­

       final, as a l t h e s e men would have been at Claywheels Lane Police Station.

       The    serials           around      the        turnstiles        at Leppings Lane and Penistone Road and
f'Z
V.     in    the     enclosure           to       the    same    were        the      same as     for    1988 which had proved

       adequate.            The       intelligence               supplied            by    Football Liaison             and Detective

       Sergeant        Chanesworth                 local       intelligence,               did not      throw    up     any different

       problems       fron        the    1988 seci-final                which proved              to be a success.             However,

       even    though           the   1988 semi-final                  had    been a success             earnest       consideration

       was    made     wher. preparing                  the     1989    semi-final           and every effort was made                 to

       improve on ar. already successful operation from the previous year.

      The Operational                 Order was approved                 and         circulated on 6 April              I9 8 9 , to all

      Senior Officers of Chief Inspector and above involved in the operation.                                                           A

£3    pre-briefing was arranged for sub-sector Inspectors and above on Friday, 14

      April        1989     m     the     North          Stand    of     the         Wednesday     Ground.           All     Inspectors

      Inspectors who were unable to attend.                                      This Sergeant then liaised with the

      respective Inspectors prior to the match.

      On that pre-brief,                 Inspectors were handed an Operational Order and details

      of     serials       under        their          command     and       their         duties.      They    were        also given

      serial orders for their respective Sergeants under their command.

      At     the    pre-brief,           these           officers        were         briefed      by    Chief       Superintendent

 A personnel carrier was made available for Inspectors on out-lying parts of

 the order       tc view their duties.                 Whilst placing the individual manpower on

 the     Operational        Order,        every    consideration         was    made        to   using     the     best

 resources       available         and    in    particular supervisory officers with extensive

    Everything            was    still        going    to       plan.            About        this       time     I was        aware       of   a

    mes s a g e    fro*      Control         that     there         were     problems              at    Leppings       Lane        and    that

    further         m anpower          was    required.               About            this        time    problems        with           radio

    reception.            I recall Police Sergeant Goddard's (Control) voice was having a

                                                                   -9-



      warbling          e.fect.           I thought my        radio battery was              faulty, other officers

     were     experiencing               difficulty,       obvious        a   radio    fault,          not    my    particular

     radio.        _        got     the     impression       that        Control     were      receiving            calls,    but

     officers outside were having difficulty in receiving Control.

     It was apparent               by the tone of Police Sergeant Goddard's voice that urgent

     assistance was required at Leppings Lane.                                I returned to the gymnasium and

     informed Control that there were a large number of ’D' Division officers on

  standby         whc        were        available     for    deployment.             I     got    from       Control        that

  officers were required at the track,                              Leppings Lane end, west Stand and ’A ’




 I     grouped         the        serials    together        and    as     the   Sergeant         in    charge       left    the

 gymnasiuE,             I got Police          Sergeant       467 Sewell          on logistics in the gymnasium

 to record w h o was being deployed and where to.                                    The following Sergeants and

 serials          of        approximately          eight     men    in    each     were     deployed          as     follows

 I    radioed          to    Control       where     these    officers        were    being       deployed,          but    I am

 unable to say if Control received my messages.                                    All the above officers were

deployed          at        2.50    p.m.      It     was    obvious       from     Control        that       they    required

 further m an power to the Leppings Lane end.                                 I do recall some radio message

about       the    gates          being     opened    and    that people were             on      the    track.        I then

regrouped          E         Division Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who

w e r e a reserve serial and deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane

  Followed          by Folice Sergeant                 3379,    Police              Sergeant     593,   Police    Sergeant      7,

  Police          Sergeant          1415 and a number of              'D' Division Police Constables                        tothe

  track. Soce          few minutes                   later, I saw              Chief Superintendent              Nesbit who         I

  think came           ir.to the ground from Penistone Road end.                                      I spoke to him and he

  went       onto     the    track.           At     this stage which was now approximately 3.10 p.m.

  as I recall,              it     just still         seemed as though there had been trouble at the

  Leppings Lane end and that there had been a pitch invasion.

  I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the Kop.

  There       were     a    lot        of officers       in front              of    the    Leppings     Lane    terraces     and

  obviously a num be r of fans in front of them.                                          The Nottingham Forest fans on

  the       Kop were        chanting and I got the impression at that stage that a large

 number        of    fans        were        going    onto   the     pitch           at    Leppings     Lane    end   and    that

  there was going to be severe public disorder.                                            At that stage I feared that

 fans may           get    to the Police              Room and attempt to release the prisoners.                               At

 this stage           also        I could hear over the radio that fans were                                   trapped at the

 Leppings         Lane      end        and    that    medical      care         was       required.     Ambulancemen were

 arriving and I assisted with getting medical care and ambulances down onto

 the track.            The       crowd was continually hostile and I was aware of about ten

 to twelve Pol i ce dogs and handlers being on standby near to the rear of the

 Kop/North          Stand        e nt r a n c e .    Then a number of injured and dead were                           brought

 from       the     track         up    to     the    Kop/North            Stand          exit   on   the   stretchers       and

 hoarding boards.

 At first it seem e d as if there were just a few, six or so, dead or injured
    and     then        people       came    running          off       the    track       with    dozens.           At    this stage

    which      was      probably           about   3.20 p.m.             Superintendent            Bates       arrived,         he came

    into     the        gycnasium          with    me,        the       tables       and    chairs       for      the     meals      were

    cleared         and       todies       were    placed         on     the    floor       in    the    gymnasium.             Injured

    people        were      taken      to the far end of the gymnasiuir..                               Many Police Officers

    were    b ew il d er e d        and some were crying.                      As bodies were being placed on the

    floor,        friends           were    with    some          and    they       were    hysterical.            Two      Liverpool

    males,      one      with       a dark moustache                was drunk and shouting at the Police, he

    was restrained by Detective Sergeant Smith and another CID Officer.                                                          He was

    wanting        to     fight       and was      obviously             in    drink       and    shock.       The        bodies kept

    being    brought          in fast and I was asking Control for a doctor to ensure that

    they w e re         dead.        There was nothing to suggest that                             any of the bodies were

 alive,        but I was conscious they had not been certified as dead.                                                    The bodies

 were       c ov e re d       with    the    table       cloths previously laid out                        for the meals.              A

 doctor with a beard attended after about 30 minutes and certified the dead.

 I recall           Detective          Superintendent               McKay       in the gymnasium and arrangements

were g e t t i n g in hand for the bodies to be numbered and an officer allocated

 to     each       of       them.      Outside          the       gymnasium         there       were    numerous          bodies     and

 injured           people       lying       on    the     ground         near       to   the     cell    buses.           St.   John's

Ambulance              personnel,           Police       Officers             and    civilians          were    in      attendance.

There were about six young St. John's personnel who were all under 14 or 15

years        of     age,       who    were       very     distressed            near       to    the Police        room.         I got

these        sat       in     the    cab part        of       a   cell        bus    and    a Policeman           from      'B2'     was

d e t a i l e d to look after them.

I     re m a i n e d     in    the     vicinity         of        the    gymnasium          for    the     next      hour       or   so.

In s p e c t o r    Charles          was detailed             to start          making records            of the bodies and

several C I D Officers came to assist.

About       *1.30 p.m.          I saw Chief Inspector Beal and together we grouped all the
      remaining       officers          who    were    not     involved      with    bodies          or     other        duties

      together in the North Stand.                     A short de-brief took place telling Sergeants

   to hand      their de-brief sheets                  in at that location before being stood down

   by Control         from the ground.                Arrangements were made via message switch for

   a message to be relayed to all Police Stations and over local radio that no

  Police Officers had been injured in the incident.

  About 4.30 p.m. I saw Chief Superintendent Mole in uniform at the ground.

  At    6.00 p.m.       a returned             to the gymnasium and assisted with supervision of

  the Casualty Bureau forms.

  Throughout         the evening I was involved with liaising with the relatives and

  social      workers       and     arrangements          for extra       telephones          to    be    placed        in the

  gymnasiumn for the use of relatives.

 At    5.30    a.m.    on Sunday          16 April        19 B9, 1 left the gynmasiur. after the last

 body had been removed and returned to duty                              at 11.00 a.m. the same day.

 numerous social workers and clergy attended the gymnasium, this boosted the

gymnasium.           Many Police Officers                 have     been in deep shock since                  the event

and     in   particular,          six    of my Area Officers              who were       in the          front line on

the    track    in    front       of Leppings          Lane terraces, went off sick due                       to shock

and    stress       related    illnesses.             All     the Police Officers             I saw involved              in

the    event,       acted    in a professional               manner      and are    a    total       credit    to        the

STEVEN ROBERT SEWELL

 INSPECTOR



Since       October       1987,    I have     been    the    fifth Inspector at            'FI* Sub-Division

and     from      that     time    I have     had responsibility           for the preparation          of   the

 FI      football orders at               'FI*.      I took over from Inspector Calvert who had

been     doing      the football orders at Hammerton Road for a number of years and

the systems of organising the manpower etc. are largely based on systems he

introduced.

I was       involved with          the organisation of the            I988 Semi-Final for Liverpool

and Nottingham             Forest.        This was     done   together with Chief Inspector Beal

and Inspector Calvert in consultation with Superintendent Murray and Chief

Superintendent M o l e .

As    the    semi-finals          for   1989 were      drawing near I was watching which teams

were likely to be in the semi-finals.                         During the week commencing 13 March

1989,       it looked as          if a semi-final could be staged at Hillsborough and at

that     stage       I     started      addressing      my    mind to        a    possible      semi-final at

Hillsborough.

On Saturday 18 March 1989, the F.A. Cup 6 th rounds took place.                                   On 20 March

1989,       the    draws    for     the    semi-final       took   place     and       again,   Liverpool    and

Nottingham Forest were drawn to play.                         I believe it was later on that day

that     Chief Superintendent              Mole    informed     me   that        the    semi-final   between

those two teams was due to be staged at Hillsborough.                                   Easter Bank Holiday

weekend      was    due     on    24,   25,   26 and 27 March         1989 and together with Chief

Superintendent Mole, a meeting was arranged for Wednesday 22 March 1989, of

all persons involved with the semi-final.                          Chief Superintendent Mole, Chief

     Department,         liaison           was     made      with Sheffield               Wednesday      Football     Club,

 Nottinghamshire                Constabulary.             Through      Operations           Room,      liaison was kept

 with South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.

 After the formal meeting on 22 March                            1 9 8 9 , close liaison was kept with all

 parties      until         the      semi-final         on    15 April        1989 .        Close      co-operation     was

 maintained throughout.

 Together with Chief Inspector Beal,                             the previous match order for the 1988

 semi-final       was       studied and           as    this was       a successful operation,                 it formed

                  ^         ^         1989      semi_final •           Briefs        were       prepared     with    Chief

Sup e rintendent Beal, these were all discussed in detail with Superintendent

Murray and approved by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

Basically,        the       serials were           the    same    as    for the           1988 semi-final with the

following main changes.                       I will deal with these briefly as I am aware that

Chief Inspector Beal will be dealing with                                the changes in minute detail in

his report.


Three    Inspectors who acted                     as   liaison    officers           to sector commanders were

dispensed with as they were under employed.                                    One reserve serial stationed

at    South    Stand/Spion              Kop      was    dispensed       with         as    it    was    superfluous     to

requirements.           Supervision of mobile units was reduced by two Inspectors as
                                                              3




 in practice         they could only be with one unit at a time.                                     Serials      1 and 2

 were     increased             by     two     Police     Constables                and     one     Police       Sergeant

 respectively.

 Serials       11   and    12        (North    Stand)    were      decreased           as    their main         tasks   for

 ensuring      that      supporters           did not use         the      Penistone         Road North egress did

 not require        the manning afforded in 1988.                              Serial 15 was decreased by               one

 Sergeant,      leaving one Sergeant supervising one serial.                                      Further serials on

 the outskirts of the ground patrols were reduced from one Sergeant and 10

Police     Constables           to     one    Sergeant    and          eight    Constables.              None   of   these

serials     were         directly       involved       with       access       or    egress       from    the    football

stadium and it was considered by all that these extra two Police Constables

per serial were additional to requirements.

Better use was made of resources and at Phase III, four serials from within

the ground,         that was serials, 2,8,20 and 21                        were to assist the track serial

to prevent any pitch invasion at the end of the match.

Also,    during      the    1988 semi-final,            all serials deployed outside                        the ground

were on standby for refreshments at Claywheels Lane through the duration of

the match.          They were some quarter of a mile away from the ground and were

too far away to deploy in the ground at short notice.                                        This y e a r v following

an idea put forward by Superintendent Murray, from 2.4p p.m. on the day of

the semi-f in a l, a Police coach was stationed In Leppings L a n e , near to the

ground and a further Police                     coach was stationed in Penistone Road near to

gate    'O'.        Of    the    men     who    were    due       to    meal     at       Claywheels      Lane    Police

Station    throughout           the match,       five serials,             i.e.       five Sergeants and forty

Police Constables, were detailed to get on EACH coach at the two locations

at 3.00 p.m.             They would remain on standby until 3-30 p.m. when the coach

would drop      them off at Claywheels Lane Police Station for a meal and then

pick up five further serials on EACH coach to return to the ground for
                                                                -4-



 deployment.

 This would make               better use of 20 serials throughout Phase II of the game.

 In actual fact, the five serials which were making their way to EACH of the

 two coaches         for 3 .0 0 p.m. brought them to the ground for that time instead

 of     the    men       being     a    quarter     of     a    mile       away   at      Claywheels        Lane    Police

 Station.           These        10 Serials       being        in   the    vicinity       of   the    two coaches        at

 3.00       p.m.    were    all        in addition       to manpower          resources          to   the    1988     semi­

 final, as all these men would have been at Claywheels Lane Police Station.

 The    serials      around the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and Penistone Road and

 in    the    enclosure          to the same        were       the same as for             1988 which had proved

 adequate.           The     intelligence          supplied           by   Football       Liaison      and      Detective

 Sergeant       Charlesworth            local     intelligence,            did not        throw up any different

 problems      from      the     1988 semi-final which proved to be a success.                                  However,

 even    though      the     1988 semi-final             had been a success                earnest     consideration

was made        when      preparing        the    1989    semi-final and every effort was made to

improve on an already successful operation from the previous year.

The Operational Order was approved and circulated on 6 April                                              I9 8 9 , to all

Senior Officers of Chief Inspector and above involved in the operation.                                                  A

pre-briefing was arranged for sub-sector Inspectors and above on Friday, 14

April       1989    in     the    North    Stand     of     the       Wednesday      Ground.          All    Inspectors

involved       in    the       operation         attended       or     a   Sergeant       deputing        for   the    few

Inspectors who were unable to attend.                               This Sergeant then liaised with the

respective Inspectors prior to the match.

On that pre-brief,               Inspectors were handed an Operational Order and details

of    serials       under      their      command    and        their      duties.        They     were     also    given

serial orders for their respective Sergeants under their command.

At    the     pre-brief,          these    officers        were        briefed       by    Chief      Superintendent

Duckenfield on policy, by Superintendent Murray on what was required at the
 match and by myself on admin procedures which included reporting on and off

 duty, overtime claims,               the issue of radios including all ground serials to

 have    an    earpiece,    the       issue    of meals      and    the    issue    of       vehicle   keys    for

 those on transits.             The individual sector commanders then briefed their men

 taking       them   to   all    relevant      parts    of    the    grounds       to    examine       locations

pertinent to their duties.

A personnel carrier was made available for Inspectors on out-lying parts of

the order to view their duties.                   Whilst placing the individual manpower on

the     Operational       Order,       every    consideration        was    made        to    using    the    best

resources       available       and    in particular supervisory officers with extensive

experience of the ground used in locations familiar to their..                                   With this in

mind, key Inspectors were placed                  in the following locations

Inspector Darling (FI)                             South Stand and track.

Inspector Sykes (F2)                              Leppings Lane turnstiles, always works

                                                  this duty, extremely experienced at this

                                                  location assisted by Inspector Purdy HQ

                                                  (relief at F I ).

The serials picked to work in the ground were mainly 'F' Division Officers,

all have good knowledge of the ground assisted by Spion Kop,                                     'E' Division

Officers, regularly work that area.                    West Stand 'E' Division Officers under

Sergeant B ur m a n , worked that duty before.

Leppings Lane terraces 'B' Division Officers worked at Sheffield Wednesday
 Football Club before on several occasions.                                   Leppings Lane turnstiles three

 serials, 'F2' Officers and one 'E' Division Officer all worked these duties

 before.          The    Sergeants        in    particular             have    extensive          knowledge    of    this

 particular day.

 Other duties were considered when the manpower was placed on the serials

 and great thought was used when identifying officers                                        to particular duties

 so   as    to     make         the   best use        of    resources.               Also,    Ipersonally            made

 arrangements for the stewards to be briefed in their respective stands at

11.15      a.m.     on     15    April       1989 .         This       was    arranged       in    conjunction       with

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, with Mr Macrell,                                      Club Secretary and Mr

Lock,      Security             Officer      Sheffield         Wednesday             Football         Club,     an     ex

West Stand                                      Inspector White

In addition I have close liaison with the senior stewards on all match days

and with Mr Macrell, Secretary SWFC and Mr Lock, Security Officer.

During     August         1988,       I   had    attended          a    steward's       meeting       at    Sheffield

Wednesday         Football        Club       and      briefed          all     the     stewards       re    emergency

evacuation        and     other       problems        and    the       gate    men    had    been    briefed    by my

deputy, Police Sergeant Goddard, during August 1988, whilst I was on leave.

Liaison had been                made with senior officers from the Fire                             Service and the

Ambulance Service               and Superintendent Murray and myself during thispresent

season re any major disaster.

On 15 April        1989,        I commenced duty at                'FI' at 7.00 a.m.                At 7.30 a.m. I

patrolled        the     ground       area      and    surrounding             roads    with       Police     Sergean

Hodkinson who was detailed as a driver for the day.                                     At 7.50 a.m. that
morning,        I     located        some     rubble      near     to    Parkside         Section        Station    and   a

message was raised on the computer to have this removed,                                           it was from a gas

 Board excavation the previous day.

At     8.00     a.m.      that       morning,        at     Sheffield        Wednesday           Football    Ground,      I

distribution.             Police       Sergeant Colley was seen in the Police Room and all

was     in order.           Inspector Scarfe              was liaised with re cell buses arriving,

articulated           vehicle        from     West    Yorkshire          (food    wagon)         arriving,       assisted

with    positioning.             I     then    saw Police          Sergeant      Dent,       Dog Section,          liaison

then     took       place     regarding        search        for    explosives.             I     then    liaised      with

civilian        staff       regarding         hot    drinks        to   be    served        to    approximately         700

officers attending briefing.                         Checked with Inspector Bennett,                       all in hand

assisting officers into North Stand for briefing in accordance with seating

plan.

At     10.00     a.m.       that       day,    briefing        takes         place     in    North       Stand,     Chief

Superintendent            Duckenfield         set     the    scene,      Superintendent            Murray gives the

order    of     the    day     and     what    is required.              Detective          Sergeant Charlesworth

gives    details        of    intelligence.               I gave        details      of     reporting       on   and   off

duty,    radio        issue      and    collection,          overtime,         transit       keys    allocation and

meal allocation.

At approximately             10.30 a.m.        the briefing finished and everything was going

to plan.

At    10.45 a.m.        that     day,       with Chief Superintendent                     Duckenfield       and Police

Sergeant Hodkinson, we patrolled round area of ground and coach routes in

*F' Division.

At 11.15 a.m. that day, officers out on ground, general patrol of area with

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on foot walked down Leppings Lane,,
 barriers in position.               Near to Leppings Lane traffic island, a minor road

 traffic       accident     had    taken       place.           Officers      under     command     of     Inspector

 Millett dealing.

 At    12.30 a.E.        approximately,            liaising with Mr.            Lock,       Security Officer           in

 club    video     room    and     general         patrol       of   ground    with     Chief     Superintendent

 Duckenfield - no problems,                there were not a lot of fans about.                          Fans spoken

 to in vicinity of the ground all in good spirits, no problems, no evidence

 of alcohol at that stage.

 At 1.30 p.m. with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield we went to the gymnasium

 for a hot meal, outside CID officers and track serials also mealing.

At     1.45    p.m.    approximately           to     Control        Room,     left     Chief     Superintendent

Duckenfield,           Superintendent              Murray,        Police      Sergeant        Goddard,         Police

Constable        Ryan,     Police        Constable         Bichard         in Control             Box. I      believe

Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson, in civilian clothing also present.

Between       1.50 p.m.     and     2.30 p.m.         general        patrol of North           Stand     and South

Stand area upper concourses checking on betting booths, no problems noticed

and that South Stand concourse were                        busy, quite a lot of Nottingham Forest

fans     arriving      early.       No    evidence         of     alcohol in        South      Stand.      Checking

North     Stand    betting        booths       -    not    so     busy      in Liverpool      side,        still      no

visible evidence of alcohol.

At    2.45 p.m.       in the vicinity of the gymnasium and Police Room area I was

aware that there were a number of prisoners on the cell buses and that the

Police    Room     were    busy     but    I       spoke    with     Inspector        Barker,     who,     did     not

report     any     problems       other        than       busy,      but     this     was    to   be     expected.

Everything       was   still      going     to plan.            About       this    time    I was      aware     of   a

message       from Control        that    there       were      problems      at    Leppings      Lane   and that

further       manpower     was     required.              About      this     time    problems         with    radio

reception.        I recall Police Sergeant Goddard's (Control) voice wqs having
     warbling'        effect.            I thought my radio battery was faulty, other officers

    were   experiencing              difficulty,          obvious       a   radio    fault,        not    my    particular

    radio.        I     got        the    impression       that     Control        were      receiving          calls,    but

    officers outside were having difficulty in receiving Control.

    It was apparent by the tone of Police Sergeant Goddard's voice that urgent

    assistance was required at Leppings Lane.                               I returned to the gymnasium and

    informed Control that there were a large number of 'D’ Division officers on

    standby      who        were     available       for    deployment.             I   got    from       Control        that

 officers were required at the track, Leppings Lane end, west Stand and                                                   'A'

 gate.

 I    grouped         the    serials        together       and     as   the    Sergeant       in    charge       left    the

 gymnasium,           I got Police Sergeant                467 Sewell on logistics in the gymnasium

 to record who was being deployed and where to.                                    The following Sergeants and

serials          of    approximately             eight     men    in    each    were      deployed        as     follows

 (All 'D' Division)

Police Sergeant                2916                        Track

Police Sergeant                1055                        West Stand

Police Sergeant                    915                     Track

Police Sergeant                2379                        West Stand

Police Sergeant                    916                     ’A' Gate

Police Sergeant                    993                     'A* Gate

I    radioed      to    Control           where    these    officers        were    being deployed,              but   I am

unable to say if Control received my messages.                                  All the above officers were

deployed         at    2.50        p.m.     It     was    obvious       from   Control        that       they    required

further manpower to the Leppings Lane end.                                  I do recall some radio message

about      the    gates       being       opened    and    that people         were     on    the track.           I then

regrouped         E' Division Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who

were a reserve serial and deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane

       track at 3.00 p.m.

       Further serials from 'D' Division arrived in the region of 3.00 p.m., these

       were deployed as follows:-

       Police Sergeant         690                       and serial to

   Police Sergeant             628                       Leppings Lane track.

   Followed by Police Sergeant                   1379,    Police Sergeant 593, Police                Sergeant 7,

   Police Sergeant          1415 and a number of               'D' Division Police Constables to the

   track.         Some    few minutes          later,     I saw Chief           Superintendent Nesbit          who I

   think came into the ground from Penistone Road                                end.      I spoke to him and he

   went onto the          track.        At this stage which was now approximately 3.10 p.m.

   as I recall,          it just still          seemed as though there had been trouble at the

   Leppings Lane end and that there had been a pitch invasion.

   I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the Kop.

  There     were    a lot        of officers       in    front       of    the Leppings Lane        terraces     and

  obviously a number of fans in front of them.                                 The Nottingham Forest fans on

   the Kop were chanting and I got the impression at that stage that a large

  number     of    fans    were        going   onto     the pitch         at     Leppings     Lane end   and    that

  there was going to be severe public disorder.                                  At that stage I feared that

  fans may get           to the Police Room and attempt to release the prisoners.                                 At

  this stage also I could hear over the radio that fans were trapped at the

  Leppings       Lane    end     and    that medical       care       was required.          Ambulancemen were

  arriving and I assisted with getting medical care and ambulances down onto

  the track.        The crowd was continually hostile and I was aware of about ten

  to twelve Police dogs and handlers being on standby near to the rear of the

 Kop/North Stand           entrance.           Then a number of injured and dead were brought

 from      the    track     up    to     the    Kop/North        Stand         exit   on   the   stretchers     and

 hoarding boards.

 At first it seemed as if there were just a few, six or so, dead or injured
                                                                        1 1




    and    then    people           came    running          off       the     track with          dozens.        At     this stage

    which    was       probably about             3-20 p.m.             Superintendent             Bates arrived,            he    came

    into    the        gymnasium        with      me,        the       tables        and    chairs       for    the      meals     were

    cleared       and        bodies    were       placed         on     the     floor      in     the    gymnasium.           Injured

 people          were       taken     to the far end of the gymnasium.                                  Many Police Officers

 were       bewildered and some were crying.                                   As bodies were being placed on the

 floor,          friends        were       with    some          and    they        were    hysterical.           Two     Liverpool

males,           one with a dark moustache was drunk and shouting at the Police,                                                     he

was restrained by Detective Sergeant Smith and another CID Officer.                                                           He was

wanting           to    fight and was obviously                         in drink and              shock.       The     bodies kept

being brought                 in fast and I was asking Control for a doctor to ensure that

they were dead.                     There was nothing to suggest that any of the bodies were

alive, but I was conscious they had not been certified as dead.                                                          The bodies

were        covered          with the        table cloths previously laid out for the m e a l s .                                    A

doctor with a beard attended after about 30 minutes and certified the dead.

I recall           Detective Superintendent McKay                               in the gymnasium and arrangements

were getting in hand for the bodies to be numbered and an officer allocated

to        each    of        them.     Outside          the       gymnasium          there    were       numerous       bodies      and

injured          people        lying       on   the     ground          near        to the      cell     buses.        St.    John's

Ambulance          personnel,              Police       Officers              and    civilians          were   in      attendance.

There were about six young St. John's personnel who were all under 14 or 15

years       of    age,        who     were      very     distressed             near       to the Police          room.        I got

these       sat        in    the     cab part       of       a    cell        bus    and    a Policeman           from      'B2'   was

detailed to look after them.

I    remained           in     the    vicinity          of       the     gymnasium          for    the     next      hour    or    so.

Inspector          Charles           was detailed            to    start making records                    of the bodies and

several CID Officers came to assist.

About 4.30 p.m. I saw Chief Inspector Beal and together we grouped all the
  remaining      officers       who    were    not     involved       with     bodies     or    other        duties

  together in the North Stand.                 A short de-brief took place telling Sergeants

  to hand their de-brief sheets                 in at that location before being stood down

 by Control from the ground.                  Arrangements were made via message switch for

 a message to be relayed to all Police Stations and over local radio that no

 Police Officers had been injured in the incident.

 About 4.30 p.m. I saw Chief Superintendent Mole in uniform at the ground.

 At 6.00 p.m.         I returned to the gymnasium and assisted with supervision of

 the Casualty Bureau forms.

 Throughout the evening I was                 involved with liaising with the relatives and

 social    workers       and arrangements           for extra       telephones     to be placed in the

 gymnasiumn for the use of relatives.

 General       liaison     of    events       re-busing        of    relatives        from     Forbes        Road.

 Casualty      Bureau duties were           completed and s ^ j g g j h a t           the ancillary admin

 staff and civilian staff were supervised andrtfcounted for.

At    5.30 a.m.       on Sunday      16 April 198 9 , I left the gymnasium after the last

body had been removed and returned to duty at 11.00 a.m. the same day.

The    Chief     Constable,       Colin     Moynahan         the    Minister    for    Sport,    Councillor

Irvine     Patnick,      Detective     Chief        Superintendent Addis          Chief Superintendent

Nesbit,       Chief    Superintendent          Mole,        Professor    Usher,       Doctor     Popper       and

numerous social workers and clergy attended the gymnasium,                              this boosted the

morale     and      efforts     of    the     150    plus     Police    Officers        involved        in    the

gymnasium.          Many Police Officers             have    been in deep shock           since the event

and   in particular,          six of my Area Officers who were                  in the front line on

the   track    in    front of Leppings Lane terraces, went off sick due                            to shock

and   stress     related      illnesses.       All     the Police Officers I saw involved in

the   event,     acted    in a professional            manner       and are a     total      credit     to the

South Yorkshire Police.

Since October 1987, I have been the fifth Inspector at 'FI' Sub-

Division and from that time I have had responsibility for the

preparation of the 'FI' football orders.



* On 14 January 1989 a Football League match took place at
Hillsborough between Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
Liverpool.   I have been shown a copy of the operational order
for that match which I can say is a true copy and which I can
identify by the label attached which I have signed.
In that order the officers on serial 10 are instructed tofill
the Leppings Lane pens as directed by match control (Can he give
any further details why this should be so).


I was involved with the organisation of the 1988 Semi Final for

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

On Monday 20 March 1989, the draws for the 1989 semi finals took

place and again Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were drawn to

play.   I believe it was later on that day that Chief

Superintendent Mole informed me that the semi final between

those two teams was due to be staged at Hillsborough

The previous match order for the 1988 semi final was studied and

as this was a successful operation, it formed the basis of the

1989 semi final.   I have been shown a copy of that order which I

identify as a true copy and further identify by the label

attached which I have signed.

Briefs were prepared with Chief Inspector Beal, these were all

discussed in detail with Superintendent Murray and approved

subsequently by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

Basically, the serials were the same as for the 1988 semi final.

The Operational Order was approved and circulated on 6 April

1989, to all Senior Officers of Chief Inspector and above

involved in the operation.



* Paragraph here to expand on his visit to ground prior to match
with Superintendent Murray when they spoke to Mackrell.


A pre-briefing was arranged for sub-sector Inspectors and above

on Friday 14 April 1989 at Sheffield Wednesday Ground.

On that pre-brief, Inspectors were handed an Operational Order

and details of serials under their command together with their

duties.   They were also given serial orders for their respective
Sergeants under their command.

At the pre-brief, these officers were briefed by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield on policy, by Superintendent Murray

on what was required at the match and by myself on

administrative and logistic matters.   The individual sector

commanders then briefed their men taking them to all relevant

parts of the grounds to examine locations pertinent to their
duties.

I personally made arrangements for the stewards to be briefed in
 STEVEN ROBE R T SEWELL - INSPECTOR                       PAGE 3




 their respective stands at 11.15 am on 15 April 1989.    This was

arranged in conjunction with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,

with Mr Mackrell, Club Secretary and Mr Lock, Security Officer

at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

During August 1988, I had attended a steward's meeting at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and briefed all the stewards

regarding emergency evacuation and other problems and the gate

men had been briefed by my deputy, Police Sergeant Goddard,

during August 1988, whilst I was on leave.

On 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at 'FI' at 7.00 am.

At 10.00 am that day I attended the briefing in the North Stand.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield set the scene, Superintendent

Murray gave the order of the day and what was required.

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth gave details of intelligence.      I

again gave details of logistics and administration.



* I was obviously present at both briefings and can say that the

subject of safety was mentioned by impressing on those present
that we were responsible for the safety of supporters both
inside and outside the ground and that the safety of supporters
was of paramount importance.


At 12.30 am approximately I liaised with Mr Lock, Security

Officer, in the club video room and by 2.45 pm I was in the

vicinity of the gymnasium and Police Room area.   About this time
 STEVEN ROBERT SEWELL - INSPECTOR                           PAGE 4




 I was aware of a message from Match Control that there were

problems at Leppings Lane and that further manpower was required

in that area.   About this time there were problems with radio

reception.   I recall Police Sergeant Goddard's (Control) voice

was having a 'warbling' effect.     I thought my radio battery was

faulty.   However other officers were experiencing difficulty and

it was obviously a radio fault and not my particular radio.      I

got the impression that Control were receiving calls, but

officers outside were having difficulty in receiving Control.

It was apparent by the tone of Police Sergeant Goddard's voice

that urgent assistance was required at Leppings Lane.       I

returned to the gymnasium and informed Control that there were a

ls^gs number of 'D' Division officers on standby who were

available for deployment.



* How by radio or phone?    Where were these officers, in
Gymnasium or expected to arrive?


I got from Control that officers were required at the track,

Leppings Lane end, West Stand and 'A' Gate.



* Can he elaborate on what he received and what his instructions
were.



I grouped the serials together and as the Sergeant in charge
 STEVEN R OBERT SEWELL - INSPECTOR                         PAGE 5




 left the gymnasium, I got Police Sergeant 467 Sewell on

logistics in the gymnasium to record who was being deployed and

where to.   The following Sergeants and serials of approximately

eight men in each were deployed      as follows

 (All 'D' Division)

Police Sergeant    2916     Track

Police Sergeant   1055      West Stand

Police Sergeant       915   Track

Police Sergeant   2379      West Stand

Police Sergeant       916   'A' Gate

Police Sergeant       993   'A' Gate

I radioed to Control where these officers were being deployed,

but I am unable to say if Control received my messages.     All the

above officers were deployed at 2.50 pm.     It was obvious from

Control that they required further manpower to the Leppings Lane

end.   I do recall some radio message about the gates being

opened and that people were on the track.     I then regrouped ’E ’

Division Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who

were a reserve serial and deployed them through Control to

Leppings Lane track at 3.00 pm.

Further serials from 'D' Division arrived in the region of 3.00

pm, these were deployed as follows

Police Sergeant 690     )   and serial to

Police Sergeant 628     )   Leppings Lane track.

Followed by Police Sergeant 1379, Police Sergeant 593, Police
S T E V E N ROBERT SEWELL - INSPECTOR                   PAGE 6




Sergeant 7, Police Sergeant .1415 and a number of 'D' Division

Police Constables to the track.

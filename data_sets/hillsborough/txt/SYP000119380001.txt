                      On S a t urday         15 April       1989,     I was    on duty             in company wit h other

                       officers           involved       in duties at the FA Cup semi— final                          football       match

                      at Hillsborough,               Sheffield,        between Liverpool Football                         C l u b a'ndi- .

                      At 9.45 a.m.            that date,          I a t t e n d e d the main briefing at H i i l s b o r o u g p

                      S t a d i u m with my four            serials which          consisted of four S e r g e a n t s and
                              "TMi Q-~0
                       tw-en^y—4,wo Police Constables.                      The    serials under my                  command numbered

                      22 to E5            inclusive.        Our    duties     to be performed on the day Were

                       public order           patrols along M i d d l e w o o d Road,                   S h e f f i e l d from C r o f t o n

                      Avenue        to B r a d f i e l d Road,      this area             being desig n a t e d S u b - S e c t o r       10.

                      After a short break                  for a packed meal                    I briefed my m e n        regarding

                       their specific              duties.        Special     a t t e n t i o n was        to be paid to all              shop

                       premises along              the    route and      to any           public houses           in the vicinity,              I

                      also      instructed the officers                  re car           parking       facilities        in the area.



                      At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   11.05 a.m.        I wa l k e d with my serials                    to their

                       respective           points.        The    four serials                 in my   command we re spread over a
'distance Of a p p r o x i m a t e l y one and half miles.              At a p pr o xi m a t e l y

12.30 p.m.       I returned to the j un ct io n of Mi ddlewood Roa d an d Wads 1ey

L a n e , me n from serials           22 and 23 were      in that      location,       this    covered

a shopping a rea w ith a number of fast food shops w hi ch we re a ttracting

Liverpool      supporters.            It was obvious      that      this was the       busiest        point

in my sector        so     I remained there.           I a d de d a further 2 officers                from

serial 24 to this area for                 that    reason.    Fro m the outset,, myself and

the officers wit h me were being a p p r o a c h e d by Liverpool                      supporters

asking    directions          to public     houses and off          licences.       The m ain public

house    in the area was          closed so many supporters w a n d er e d off                 towards

the   city and along W a ds le y Lane              seeking    licensed premises.              It was

a pp arent at     this e ar ly stage            that the m aj ority of supp or te rs had

already       been drinking       quite heavily.          As time      progressed more

supporters       a rr iv ed    in the area,        the m aj or it y of w h ic h were walking

round with       cans and bottles           of beer and bottles of wine.                  We were

continually being a sk ed for d irections                    to licensed       premises.



At a p pr o xi ma te ly     1.45 p.m.      I was joined by S up e ri n te n de n t Marshall,

he was    the senior          officer    in charge      of the area.          Mr.   Marshall         wished

to s«fei:ia€l my officers             on their     respective       points.     W it h this      in

mind,    together we started             to walk along M i d dl e wo o d R oad         in the

di rection of       the H i l l s b or o ug h    precinct.    After we had w a l k ed a short

distance,       a radio message was              received to the effect             that a dwelling

house    holder     on W a d s l e y Lane was e x pe ri en ci ng d i ff ic ul ti es with

drunken       supporters.        It was a l le ge d that       the supporters were

urinating       in V ^ e    ga rd en and    being abusive.           A Police       vehicle was sent

  o     the    location.        Mr.    Marshall     said that he knew the are a an d that he

\was only a short distance away to where                      the    incident was occurring.

We therefore        tu rn ed    round,     wa lk ed back along M i d dl e wo o d R oa d and up

along Wads ley L a n e .         We wa Ik ed some       considerable       d i s t a n c e , but found
                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                 R299

no trace of the             incident.           However,,    during       this walk we did,                  in fact,

walk    by an off          licence,        I am unable       to say this off              licences           exact

location,       but       it was    off W a ds le y Lane.           O u ts id e these          premises were a

number       of Liverpool          s u p p o r t e r s , some of who m were          stood and some of

whom were sat on the frontage                       of the off          licence.      They were all

drinking       from cans of beer and bottles                       of beer and wine.                  The       off

licence       itself was       full       of    customers,        all    of which a p p e ar e d to be

Liverpool        supporters.             1 wa lk ed      into the off       licence and was

immediately sur p ri se d at the amount                      of staff who a p p ea r ed to be

serving.        They numbered a p pr o xi m a t e l y five or six                    persons,             a lt ho ug h

the    off    licence       itself       is of the        corner    shop t y p e .        A    lady who

a pp e a r e d to be the owner              or the       person    in charge,        enquired about my

visit.        1 mer el y     enq ui ri ed       into her and her s t a f f s 9 well                  being,       but

also    reminded them          regarding           the    law relating to selling                    intoxicants

to    persons under          18 years          of age.      I must add that at                 that       time    inside

and outside         the     premises        I did not see any             person who a p p e a r e d to be

under     18 years        of age drinking             intoxicants.          However,           some of whom

a p p e a r e d to be border            line    cases.      After       being assu re d that               they we re

m o n i t o r i n g all    persons       they were       selling        intoxicants           to,    I left       the

premises and          rejoined S u pe ri nt en de nt Marshall.                  We made our way back

to the junction of W a ds le y Lane and M i d dl e wo o d Road,                               at w hi ch        point

S u p e r i n t e n d en t Marshall       de parted and w al k ed off towards                       the

H i l l s b o r o u g h Football        Gr ou nd   itself.        I remained       in that           location.

The    stream of supporters                 continued up and down these                       roads,       there was

a small      amount        of trouble          in the K e n t uc k y F ried C h ic k en             premises,

w hi c h was quickly          resolved.            The Police Officers             in that are a were

continually a d vising              supporters           not to get drunk,           to       leave       their

drinks with the threat that they w ou ld not be allowed                                        into       the

ground.        The a mo u nt       of    cans and bottles           left     in the area was                 enormous.
                                                                                               PAGE   4
                                                                                               R299

At this     point    I must        say that the      hundred and hundreds         of supporters

I saw who were            drinking    intoxicants      or obviously had been drinking

intoxicants were            not    d isorderly or     incapable,     but   1 can say that they

were all     in drink.



At a p p r o x i m at e ly £ . 4 0 p.m.   to 2.4 3    p.m.   the volume      of supporters

s tarted to      increase.          At a time w hen one would have            e xp ec te d a

d ecrease as kick-off              time approached,      they were      coming    from the

W ads l e y Lane area,        all    or most   still    carrying     cans and     bottles       of

intoxicants.         My opinion of this was             that    because the m a j o r i t y of

licensed     premises        in the area were         closed,    they had t r av el le d greater

distances      to obtain their            drink and were       returning     late.    A short time

later,    a l t ho u gh    I could just see the L ep pings Lane              end of the ground

in the distance,            I could not see the turnstiles             or gates. ; I started

to hear     radio m es sa ge s       from S up e ri n te n de n t Marshall    regarding        the

build up of s upporters at that end of the ground.                           These    radio

messages     star t ed to         increase and at one stage          I can remember         someone

saying    they had a hundred men on s ta nd-by                  in the gym and they were

a sked to attend.            Also M ou nt ed Bra nc h Officers        said they were

attending.        The      radio    traffic    increased with M r . Marshall           then

starting     to say that there was a serious                   crush, a&4-+r&    requested that

the game be delayed for               15 minutes and that this should be                put out

over the      loud speaker          system at the ground. '^He''j o r i g i nal ly asked for

this    to be done and then demanded for                 it to be done,         but   the   reply

came back      negative.



As    previously stated            1 could see the Leppings Lane end of the ground,

but    not the gate         or turnstiles.        The area      looking from a distance

a pp ea r ed to be ext re me ly         congested with supporters.              1 then noticed

an officer who            I believed      to be Mr.    Marshall,     certainly w ith gold
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             R299

braid on his hat,           standing          on the top of -a Police          vehicle             posi tioned

in the middle        of this      crowd        looking       towards the gate area.                   I then

heard Mr.       Marshall     over       the    radio ask       that a gate be opened to

relieve    the    crush,     this       request was queried by the               control.               Mr.

Marshall    a gain a sk ed for           the gate       to be opened,        saying           the sit ua ti on

was   becoming      serious.        1 cannot       r emeiTibe r a reply to this                  request,          but

then Mr.    Marshall        then demanded          that       the gate be opened,                saying       that

if it w a s n ’t opened someone would be s eriously                         injured or even

killed.     1 can remember              the    reply    came back over the                 radio,     similar           to

"In that    case okay",         or,      "In that       case yes".         I can remember               it was

about    this    time that       I heard the           crowd    in the stadium              roar.       I

immediately a ss u me d that the teams                      had entered the      pitch.             I realised

from the    radio m es sa ge s          that a crush was          taking     place and             slowly

m oved down the Hill           towards        the ground.         I was expecting                to b e

summoned with my men,             but wasn't           called.        Ar ou nd this         time    there was

a small    distur ba nc e      between s upporters              further     down the hill,                  towards

the ground       itself,     so I again m oved               nearer    to the ground             in response

to this    incident.         This       turned out to be a small              skermish,             w hi ch

off along a road to the                 right.



S h or tl y after    this a call          came    over       the radio saying              ’E v e r y b o d y to

the g r o u n d * , owing    to the fact          that only myself and the Ser ge an ts                            in

officers    in sight and shouted to them.                        As a result      of this we all

ran down the hill           over a small          bridge and turned           right           into the

Leppi ng s Lane end of the ground.                      Radio    traffic a p p ea r ed to be

S up er in t en d en t Marshall     as ked me and some          of my men to close a barred

gate    to stop any further          supporters        entering.       We quic kl y       closed this

gate and were       i mmediately      confronted          by a group of a ngry supporters

showing    their tickets and demanding                 entry.       At this time         I had no

idea of what       had o cc urred     in the stand behind m e , so                I started

calming    these fans       down.     I can remember          say i rig, " T h e r e ’s been a bit

of a crush,       give    us a few minutes whilst             i t ’s sorted out then we will

let you    in.     We are    only doing       this for your own goad."                   To their

credit    these supporters,          who    numbered maybe thi r ty or more,                stood

back and wai t e d .



A short    time    later Mr.       Marshall       a p p ro a ch e d us and just said,        "Go       in

there and help them out with the                   i n j u r e d " , indicating   the     stand at

the L ep pings Lane        end.     Along wit h other         officers     from the gate           1

then ran across a large             concrete a rea directly behind the Lepp ings

Lane    end stand    (West S t a n d ) «     As    I did so     I not i ced there were a few

supporters       coming    from a tunnel          under    the stand,    they were         shouting

and swearing       saying,    "You'd better          get    in there you       bastards",        and

"What are you fucking             doing out here,          you're    needed    in there",        and

similar    other    comments.



I ran through the tunnel with a number                      of officers,       there were        some

supporters       walking    through and       some standing.           I noticed Police

Of ficers were      carrying       someone    through,       I thought     it was a youth,              I

could see he was          injured,    but    I was     sure he was alive as he was                 being

brought    out of the tunnel.              1 then     ran through the tunnel              into   the

terraced area.           In front of me       I could see P o li ce me n at the             perimeter

fence    passing an       injured or dead person through a hole                        in that

fence.    There was a large group of Police Officers                          on the      pitch side

of the fence,       so many that       the only thing           I saw of the           pitch are a was

                                                                                   k

the top of the goalposts and an ambulance.                          I had no    idea what was

h appening    on the       pitch.



I immediately noticed a pile of bodies                      towards the     right      hand      corner

of the terrace.            The first     thing    that struck me was           that all         the

faces    of these     people were        blue.     1 made my way towards              this area of

the terrace.         At this     time    I also    noticed a metal         barrier which

a p p e a r e d to be bent over and twisted.                I noticed one       pol ic em an who                1

who    I d o n ’t know s truggling           to get someone       off the ground.

1 immediately went           to help him down on the               concrete are a at           the     back

of the tunnel.         This y ou th was         blue and showing no signs             of       life.            We

started giving him mouth to m outh                 resuscitation,         we did this           for a

few minutes,        but got     no    response.      I can remember        the Police Officer

with me saying,        “ I think he's dead boss,              I think he *s dead".               We

therefore     covered his        face and       ran back     into the tunnel        and back             onto

the    terraces.      As    I did so,        quite a number       of people     injured and some

who a pp eared to be         lifeless were        being     carried out by Police

Officers.      R e ga rd in g   the y outh we      carried out,        the only d e sc ri pt io n                   I

can give     is that       he was a white y ou th wearing             blue denim jeans and a

light    coloured T shirt            or jumper,    this we        pulled up to    cover his

face,    before     retreating        back    into the tunnel.



When    I a r ri ve d back onto the terraced area,                  I found two P ol i ce m en

giving m outh to m ou th         r es uscitation to a y outh on the terrace                      floor,

they were having           d if fi cu lt y getting    his    head back w it h the          steps,          so

I. told them to carry him away.                  I a ss is t ed them    in carrying            this

yo ut h back through the t u n n e 1 and onto               the    concrete area.          All       this

time    I had noticed that           some     supporters,     still    standing     on the

terrace,     were    shouting and swearing at us a cc using                 us of being

responsible,        calling us killers and murderers.                   I left    the two

officers         giving      this y ou th mouth to m ou th             r es uscitation and once

again       returned to the terraced area.                      On this o cc asion             I noticed that

the supporters above                 us,    in the stand,         many of them were              shouting and

swearing and waving                 their   fists at us,          some were        even spitting at

us.        I can't     remember       how many times           I went     back on to the terraced

area,       but e v e n tu a ll y    it cleared.          I can remember           entering         the

concrete area and              looking ar ou nd me.             It a pp ea re d to be covered with

people       laid out.         I looked around and. everywhere                     I looked         I could

see P o l ic e m e n and P o l i ce w om e n bent down with these                    pople,         giving

m o u t h to m ou t h     r es us ci ta ti on or talking            to t h e m .    At    one    point a

m iddle aged         lady a p p ro a ch e d me and said that she was a nurse and

a sk e d    if she     could help.          This     lady quickly became              involved.           I saw

her giving m o ut h to m outh                r es us ci ta ti on to a number             of    people,

examining          injuries and also            reassuring        other supporters who a pp ea re d

to be distraught.               1 have       no idea who this            lady w a s , but she

certainly did a marve ll ou s                 job and her         services were muc h a pp r ec i at e d

by all       those     present.



1 noticed an a mbulance                pull     up at the       gate,     so    X went        towards      that,

at this time           the     radio traffic was            constant.          I shou te d my        call

sign,       ’India     10* ,        but had noacknowledgements,                everyone       was    talking          at

once,       so    1 wa it ed        for a lull and shouted up              requesting a call               for

doctors          to at te nd at the         rear of the Leppings Lane                 stand.         I d o n ’t

know if this was               received or not          because of the             radio traffic,              I

c o u l d n ’t tell,      I just hoped that             they had heard my message and were

acting       on it.       1 also       shouted up for air              to be brought to the                 rear of

the Leppings Lane                end stand.         I went      to the     ambulance, called               a

couple of Police O ff icers                  nearby and we helped the a m bu la nc e men

were       quickly     despatched.           U n f o r t u n a t e l y after   this had gone,             it

seemed ages        before another             arrived,       I suppose    it w a s n ’t that    long,

but     it a pp ea r ed    so at       the t i m e .   I can remember a P o l i c e w o m a n who       I do

not know,       ask me for a stretcher                 urgently.        She and a St-       Johns

A m b u l a n c e m a n had a y outh on the floor,              she was giving him m ou th to

m ou t h and the a m b u l a nc e ma n was         thumping      his    chest.     1 can remember

they said that            he had gone once and that               they had brought          him round.

It w ould ap p ea r that           he had gone again,            but they continued and

a l t h o u g h the y ou th was         blue,    he e v en tu al ly a pp ea re d to be breathing.

I told them to keep               looking after          him and that      I w ould get an

ambulance.         I went        towards      the gate and to my          right,    near the

roadway,        1 could see a fire engine.                    I shouted to a Police Officer

w hom    I recognised from A2 Sub-Division,                      I instructed him to go to the

fire     engine and try and obtain breathing apparatus,                            but w he n he

a rri v e d all    the firemen had              left   the    engine.     An amb ul an ce    came

almost      immediately,          so    I c o mm an de er ed a stretcher and brought             that

to the Policewoman.                We    1 ifted the y ou th on to the stretcher and

placed him        into the ambulance,              he was      still    breathing,    but he     looked

very     ill and was           still    quite    blue.



I continued o rganising                 stretchers as the ambulances arrived.                    On one

occasion,       after      I had been to the             concrete area,       I returned to the

gate and a p oliceman brought a doctor                         to me,    he was a tall man,          quite

young.       By this      time we had a number of                injured persons       propp ed up

along     the outer wall,              bodies were also         being    put a short     distance

away.      An    Inspector and a serial                of    policemen,    mainly from       AS Sub-

Division,       were      standing       in a line       covering the bodies         from    view.      The

doctor walked along,               pointed out supporters and was                  saying,     "This man

must     be next    in the ambulance,              this one      is d e a d , this one      is injured

but     can wait".         I    can remember       instructing Sergeant Lomas and some                     of

the other officers               present to follow            the doctor's       instructions
                                                                                                     PAGE


regarding           priority for ambulances,             this was     complied with.         As the

f re quency of a m bu la nc e arrivals                increased we e ve nt u al l y m ov ed all               the

injured        parties and bodies            from the     concrete area at the         rear      of the

stand.         I pers on al ly thought            the doctor     did a fine job,      he a pp ea re d

to be quick and methodical                   in diagn os in g     injuries and death.            His

instructions were              being      passed on to the ambulance           drivers,      w hich           in

turn were           related to the hospital             staff.



After all           the    injured had been         removed,     I can remember      standing            by

the gate whe n the             crowd star ted to leave the stand.                 I w a s ’taking a

breather and also at                   the same time stopping any of the             crowd    coming

through the gate so they wouldn't                       see   the bodies.      One Liverpool

supporter           stood    in front      of me and started shouting at the              crowd to

use the other              entrance,     he was    trying     to help and maybe       letting            off

steam.         E v e n tu a l l y we    closed the gate,       but not before a number               of

supporters           had d e li be ra te ly tried to push by to have a look at the

bodies.            I then    went and joined a cordon of officers                 s it ua te d at the

entrance           to the    L ep pings Lane end         of the ground.      At this tpoint 1

joined up with some                of my other serials,          we stood     in a line whilst

the whole of the Liverpool                   s upporters      left the ground,      m an y of them

were     very angry,          they were      calling     us   "Murdering b a s t a r d s ’ and       *

K i l l e r s ’.     I    can remember one        shouted,     "Thirty scousers       dead,      I

suppose you              lot are happy now."          There was a continuous          torrent         of

abuse and threats made                  by the    crowd as they passed by.            To their

credit all           the officers        stood up to this        constant abuse and made no

comments           back.     I believe      had any      one of these officers        lost    his

nerve     or       lost    their   heads,    or   reacted     in any way,     there w o u ld have

been a riot.

         The a t t a c h e d    report     refers    to my rec ol le ct io n of the event

*■       s urrounding          the    incident at the H i ll s b o r o u g h Football               Ground»

         S he f f i e l d on S a t u rd a y    13 April    1989.      I have         received a p ro -fo rma

         document         from Chief Su pe ri nt en de nt         Wain    requesting       specific       details,

         most, of these are             fully covered w i t h i n the           content of the          report.

         H o w e v e r , items       six to ten I w ou ld      like to cover            separately:



         Item 6 - What was              the mood of the fans,             as    previously stated,            prior

         to the      start of the match,             the m a j o r i t y of fans        I saw were       in drink,

         a lt h o u g h   I must      say they were not abusive                or disorderly.



         Item 7 - Actions              of stewards ? I can say that at                  no time      throughout

         the entire         incident,         in w hich   I was    involved,          did I notice any                :

         stewards whatsoever.



         Item 8 - B re a kd o wn         in radio transmissions;                as    previously      stated,     the

         problem w ith t ra ns mi ss io ns was that                the    radio traffic was            constant and

         on many occasions              there a pp ea re d to be more than one                 person talking

         at once.



         Item 9 ~ I have a tt e mp t ed to describe                   the body of the y outh with

         which     I was       personally       involved,    a l t h ou g h    1 did assist wit h and see

         quite a number              of other    bodies.     I am unable to assist any further

         with any form of              id en ti fi ca ti on of these          people,    but   I can say that             I

         cannot      recollect         seeing    the bodies       of any women or children.



         Item    10 - I can remember              feeling e x tr em el y sad for the                persons who

         had died and those              injured    in the    incident,              I was also      shocked and

         amazed at the           conduct      of some of the supporters                 during and after          the

         incident.          I can under st an d some of their                  behaviour,      through

                                                                                               “r

         r bereavement    or maybe   shock,     but m any of them        I feel were     just    jumping

           on the b a n dw ag on and maybe     trying   to   lay blame     on others     for their

           own actions.     There was    one    particular      point   that   1 could not

           understand,    after   entering     the L ep pings Lane end of the           ground,

           behind the West Stand,       as   p reviously m e nt io ne d a large        concrete area,

           this area   could have safely a c c o m m o d a t e d a very     large     number    of

           supporters and yet      on the face of       it everyone      seems to have         entered

           or tried to have ente re d the tunnel             leading    to the small     terraced area

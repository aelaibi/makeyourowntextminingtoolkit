ADJOURNMENT DEBATE - MONDAY 9 MARCH

LOUISE ELLMAN MP (Labour - Liverpool Riverside)

SUBJECT - HILLSBOROUGH -TH E SCRUTINY OF EVIDENCE RELATING TO
THE FOOTBALL STADIUM DISASTER

We have been advised today by the Chief Whip's Office that Louise F.llman MP intends to
raise the above subject in an Adjournment Debate on Monday 9 March. The Home Secretary
will respond for the Government.

Assuming business follows its normal course, this half-hour debate should come on at
10.00pm. I will inform you nearer the time if there is any change to these arrangements.

I should be grateful therefore if you would set in hand the preparation of a short speech of
about 15 minutes duration, together with any necessary background material, to reach M r
Sutton, PPS to the Home Secretary, by close of play on Thursday 5 March.

It would be helpful if, nearer the time, you could let me know which officials will be
attending the debate.

                                  Further   to   my  letter  on the   subject   of my
                         Committee Report ’’Policing Football Hooliganism1', I am glad
                         to enclose a draft of a Bill to introduce three of the four
                         offences identified by Lord Justice Taylor in Cm 962.

                                  I thought you might wish to be informed with some
                         background information which explains my approach to the
                         Bill:

                                   (a)   With the exception of the 'relevant offence'
                         amendment,    I have   not  attempted  a detailed   list  of
                         consequential amendments and repeals.     If the Government
                         wish to introduce their own Bill, Parliamentary Counsel will
                         do these conseguentials anyway; and if my Bill is proceeded
                         with, then amendments to do this in Committee (no doubt also
                         drafted by Counsel) will be within the scope of the Bill.

                                   (b)   It would be possible to achieve much of what
                         I want by legislating by reference - simply amending the
                         Criminal Justice Act 1982, the Public Order Act 1986 and the
                         Football Spectators Act 1989.     But such amendments would
                         not make it clear on the face of the Bill what it is I am
                         trying to do, and I therefore propose a largely free­
                         standing Bill.

                                            (c)      Some points on the drafting:

                                        -                 the Football Offences Act 1989 extends
                         to England and Wales, so the additional power for Scotland
                         conferred by Clause 1(1 )(b) is needed.

                                          4th February, 1991


               -                I have not defined "obscene     abuse"
obvious reasons of difficulty.  The usual definition is that
obscenity tends to corrupt and deprave, but this would pose
evident problems.   Perhaps it is better to leave it to the
interpretation of the Court?

                   Lord   Justi ce   Tay lor focuses  on  the
transmission of abuse by "chanting", but this seems too
vague in the circumstances.       As he says, someone has to
start a chant.      Again, the volume is critical; to be
offended,   people   must   hear   it;   and we  do not want
inadvertently to catch people who slip on the steps and
utter an understandable (but rather quieter) obscenity.    So
I have suggested "shout, chant or similarly utter".   Despite
the amount of racialist abuse in the Psalms, incidentally, I
resisted the temptation to include a saving for Chants
taken fromgCathedral Psalter.

                  I think that the attendance centre order
power has to be separately provided for, and will not ride
on the back of the fine provisions. This is done in Clause
6 (2 ).

conduct at football matches; and for connected purposes.

                 stationed at Rotherham.

                 On Saturday,          15 April,      1989 (130489)      I commenced duty, at Main Street

                 My duty was with Police Sergeant Kennedy and several                                 other officers

                 and immediately after               the briefing at       10.30 (1030) we went on foot to

                 Wads ley Bridge Railway Station to meet a t r •«»—             ■■■>   a J t   — i ••••• r poo 1.

                 supporters which was due to arrive at 2 . 0 0 pm (1400).

                 At 2. 0 0 p m   (1400)      in    company with several       other officers               I escorted

                 approximately          1->0 Liverpool        supporters    from the railway station to

                 Hi 1 Ist'orough football            ground.     These supporters were                in high spirits

                 and o rder 1y .                                                                 "" ''

                 W© arrived at the football                  ground,   Leppings Lane end at approximately

                 2 .20pm (1420).           I then carried out a stationary duty outside the

                 Lappings Lane end,               on both sides of Leppings Lane where                     1 along with

                 other of f i cers wer e concerned wi th p u b 1 i c order and di r ect ing

                 supporters to the turnstiles.                   Although the majority of supporters

                 were drinking alcohol               from cans as they waited to enter the stand

                 they were fairly well               behaved.
   At 2 . 5 0 p m    (1430)        there      appeared      to be a sudden           influx     of Liverpool

   supporters             into L e p p i n g s Lane.        M any    of the    supporters who were              now

   enter i n g L e p p i n g s Lane were            i n t o x i c a t e d and were     in m u c h more      of a

   panic       to get       into     the ground.         Myself       and other officers           became

   h eav i l y    invol v e d      in holding       back     large     numbers       of s u p p o r t e r s who were

   d e s pe r a t e l y    pushing      to get to the         tur n s t i l e area.       With    the aid of a

   Police        vehicle         w i t h a public addr e s s         system,       fans were     c ontinually

   toeing r e q u e s t e d to hold back and                 refrain frotri pushing.              It was at

   this       time   that        I f ound myself        being       pushed along w i t h the        crowd

   t,o w a r d s t h e L e p p i n g s L a n e end t u r n s tiles.

   At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 6 p m    I heard a m e s s a g e       over my personal         radio to

   the      effect        of all     personnel      to go to         the    pitch and     I went a long with

   other       officers          a long a tunnel        w h i c h w i t h i n a minute      brought      us onto

   the      pitch near           the L e p p i n g s Lane    erid.     On e n t e r i n g the    pitch    I first

   s a w s o m e f a n « w a n d e r i rig i n t o the g o a 1 area of t h e pitch a n d I f i r s t

   thought        it was a pitch              invasion w h i c h      I have       seen occur     in the        past.

   As    I ran towards             the goal      area    I soon       realised that         suppo r t e r s were

   fae i ng    cr ushecl agai nst          the   f ences              ont    of the stands .        Po 1 i ce

   officers were              frantically        trying      ■.o . *11 fans onto          the    pitch to

   safety and w i t h i n            seconds      fans were         being    brought     out onto     the

   pitch,         I then became            in’    „ved in giving            hear      assage and m o u t h to

   mouth       r e s u s c i t a t i o n to supporters who            had stop*       i breathing,,         I

   compl e t e l y        lost    track    of time as        1 became        involved wit h the attempts

   of saving         the      supporters.

Dated                        080689                                                             Signed


            In 1988 I was on duty at the Semi Final at Hillsborough stadium.

            After a morning briefing held at the ground,                   I walked with other

            members of my serial               to Middlewood Road in the area approximately

            three quarters of a mile away from the ground near to Middlewood

            Hospital and Wing Gardens housing estate.

            I patrolled this section of road along with other officers for the

            remainder of the morning and again during the afternoon after a lunch

            break at Claywheels Lane.                  I patrolled that section of Middlewood

            before,          during and after the match.         I recall that although busy with

            traffic,              that particular section of Middlewood Road was fairly quiet

            with very few football                 supporters on foot at this location.    No

            incidents occurred that                 I can bring to mind.

            After the match I remember the road again being very busy as

            supporters were on their way out of Hillsborough.                    I do not remember

            which particular              football    team were travelling out on that section of

            Middlewood Road,              but all supporters were     in high spirits and no

            incidents took place.

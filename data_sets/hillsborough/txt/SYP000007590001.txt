           After speaking with a traffic control Police Officer we parked our car

           another Police Officer swho was at the entrance we were requested to

           wait in our vehicle if we were needed to attend any casualties.                                           After

           about half an hour it became apparent that we were not required./

                s u p porter made             contact         but was       drag g e d away       by other         s upporters a n d

                towards        me.          The   group w a l ke d       past     the    vehicle we were             in and       I could

                see     that       the y outh who             had tried to grab the Police Officer,                              the    fan

                We    c o ntinued           into M i d d l e w o o d RD and was held up by traffic.                             Our    lane

                was     fairly         clear      but    traffic        going     the other way was at a standstill.

I               Hy a t t e n t i o n was          drawn       to 4 or 5 L i verpool             supporters who             bfad come out

                 I cannot          recollect         what      the    person who w a l k e d          over    the    car    looked

                 like,     he was           however      older       than    I e x p ected       possibly      in his       late 2 0 ’s .

                 I. d o n ’t know           if the      car was       damaged.          All    of them had          cans    of beer.

    O Y T        in L e p p i n g s LN        I did see a person walking                       towards       the    entrant:/ to the

                from the           fly of his           t r o u s e r s , it was     not      erect and he a p p e a r e d            to be

                o bl i v i o u s    to the fact            it was almost as              if he had been to the                   toilet

                and     for g o t t e n      to do his         trousers        uj^ again.         He didn't make any

                a d va nc es       towards a n yb od y and he                continued         to walk       towards       the    football

                ground and             I lost      sight       of him       in the      crowd.

                W h i l s t we were           parked up several                s u pporters who         I believe were

           L i ve rp oo l      fans    became    v e r b a l l y abusive     shouting   "stupid    cows" at us

            t hr o u g h    the w i n do w   of the      car.     I have     no   idea why they did this

            perhaps         it was     because        of the    uniform.      we were also      instructed by the

            Police         to sound the        car     horn on the way        to Leppings      LN to   clear    the

            crowd     perhaps         this ma y have a n t a g o n i s e d    the situation.

            I w o u ld      like    to say that         I was    frightened       by the behaviour       of the              i

           L i ve rp oo l      fans    that w e r e a r o un d u s , as they were        not    provoked   fey us       in

            people         I have m e n t i o n e d    in this    statement.

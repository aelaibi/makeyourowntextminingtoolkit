1.   The Minister has been invited to speak during the lunchtime
slot at the second seminar on Sports Stadia after Hillsborough,
following the first seminar in March of this year in which
Lord Ferrers gave the opening address.,

2.   The Minister may see advantage in addressing this seminar
given the opportunity which it presents to stress the importance
which he attaches to improved spectator facilities and the
Government's commitment to all-seater football stadia, and to
emphasise the encouragement being given to local planning
authorities to give sympathetic consideration to proposals for
such all-seating in the draft Planning Policy Guidance Note on
Sport and Recreation (which should be   out for consultation by
then).         1

3. i The lunchtime slot provides the Minister with an opportunity
to give a broad overview before the problems of planning control
and the establishment of the Football Licensing Authority are
discussed by subsequent speakers.

Owen Luder that no announcement has yet been made on membership
of the FLA but we understand that Professor Maunder ha^s not been
invited as a candidate. Mr Luder is speaking to the Home Office
about this and may obtain a new speaker for the FLA slot.                                                /

JOINT    RIBA    AND   SPORTS   COUNCIL   SPORTS    STADIA   SEMINAR   2   -   25
OCTOBER


Thank you for your kind invitation to speak at the second seminar
on Sports Stadia after Hillsborough.


I would be happy to give a speech of some 20-30 minutes during
the lunchtime slot providing a broad overview of the Government's
position.       This would include setting out the importance which we
attach    to    improved   spectator   facilities    and   in particular our
commitment to all-seater football stadia.            The seminar would also
give me an opportunity to refer to the positive guidance which we
are intending to give local planning authorities in dealing with
planning applications for new or redeveloped football stadia.


I look forward to the seminar.

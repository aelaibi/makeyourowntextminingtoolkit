       Background

       1.       Any w i t n e s s      at the inquiry may                    re fu se    to answer q u e s t i o n s w hi ch

       may     incriminate           him.       It is not u n c o m m o n             for the A t t o r n e y G e n er al              to

       offer a l imited              i mm u n i t y   from c ri mi na l          p ro c e e d i n g s    to w i t n e s s    at

       public      i n q u ir ie s     in resp ec t         of any e vi de n c e w h i c h              they may give             at

       the in qu ir y        and     this was         done at,            for example,          the Red Lion Square

       and B r i x t o n I n q u i r i e s     c o n d uc te d    by Lord S c a r m a n under                the Police Act

       1964.       If Lord J u s t i c e         Taylor c o n s i d e r e d           that    the cond uc t          of the

       i nquiry was          or was       l ik el y    to be p r e j u d i c e d           if an offer           of immunity

       w er e not m ad e        it w o u ld      be for him to a p p r o a c h                the A t t o r n e y G e ne ra l

       and     re qu es t    him to c o n s i d e r         an offer          of immunity.

       2.       The q u e s t i o n     of d i s c i p l i n a r y        proceedings         is m or e      difficult,

       particularly           as,     in c e r t a i n c i r c u ms ta nc es ,           the Police C o mp la in ts

       A u t h o r i t y m ay d i re c t     disciplinary                 char ge s     to be p r e f e r r e d      if the

       C hi ef C o n s t a b l e     does not         prefer      charges          himself.        But      there     is no

       r eason     to suppose,            at the pres en t                stage,      that d i s c i p l i n a r y    offences

       w ill    have been c ommitted,                 as oppo se d            to errors         of judgment.

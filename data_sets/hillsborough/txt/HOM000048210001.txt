Thank you for your letter of 20 November about Mr Houldsworth’s statement.


I think we can probably live with not having the information we asked you for on 30 October.
Please do not trouble your solicitors any further for now. I will come back to you again in
the event that it proves vital for us to have the answer to this question.

           right    outside       the ground        in L ep pings Lriy*- On the              road down to Lepping*
                                                     CwV-T     _                 .
          Lri I saw about          four      pubs open w it h^^ans            s i t t i n g outside    them having a

          drink.         When we gat         off   the    catfch we went to the entrance to the

          g round       in order     to go     inside.       It was busy but             there were       no    problem?

          at that        time.     There were        no queues         of    fans at the turnstiles,

          although         there were        plenty of      people about.             E ve ry on e was    very

          a mi ca bl e and f ri endly and there was only a light                             pol^de^resence

  '°rr    about     10 to       15 pol ic em an on foot           near to the         tuf/nstiles.        I found my

          entrance         turns tile quite eas il y and w i t h i n c o u p l e                 of minu te s       had

          gone     th ro ugh     into the ground.            I thought         the stew ar di ng at         this     point

          was     very     poor for such an event.                   I/saw none at all           near to the

          turnstiles,           in fact      the   first

          stairs        leading    to the N o r t h 0 t a n d .

By about 2 . 2 5 pm         < 1425)    I could see thaJr^peop3.e at the back                      of the

central       pens of the L ep pi ng s L n ^ m l           were   being hauled up by people

in the West S t a nd a b ov e           t b*m.       I thought    it was      just a case of

people    pulling          theirJriends            up into the    seating area.             I d i d n ’t

realise       that    it was    due to the           people    being     crushed.        E v e r y o n e was

foc us in g    their a t t e n t i o n towards         this    part    of the ground.             There was a.

s te a dy build up of          people        in the    pens and more and more were                  being

ha u le d up    into the       stand.         At about 2 . 5 0 p m     < T 4 5 0 ) the    players       came

onto the       pitch a nd my a t t e n t i o n was then focu se d towards                     them and

away    from the L ep pi ng s          Ln end of the          ground.      The rn#tch ki ck ed off

and after       three or four minu te s               I saw a police         officer       run onto the

pitch d i a g on al ly from           the    far    corner at the Leppings               Ln end towards          us.

He was w av ing his arms               in the air and the             referee     halted the        game.        I

again    looked towards             L ep pings Ln,        not knowing what was wrong                and saw

lots more       people       getting        pulled up at       the back of the            pens.     There was

a lot of mo ve ment           but     I c o u l d n ’t see what was        taking        place at       the

front    of the       pens.      I thought         that   there must       have    been a fight or

some th in g    like that        in the       pens.



A fter about         ten minu te s      I saw a long          line of     p oliceman       come     from the

left    of the g ro un d and form up standing                     in front of our           stand.         There

was at    least a h u n dr ed          of them and they a p p e a r e d         to be taking            a s tance

to   prevent     people       from the        stand from going           onto the        pitch.      At about

the same       time    I saw     people       from the L e p p i n g s    Ln end of the ground

sp il li ng    onto    the    pitch.         There were       lots of other        people       b e tw ee n the

g o a l m o u t h and the     fencing w h ic h        pre ve nt ed me from seeing             how the         fans

were    coming       out    of the     pens.        I d i d n ’t see any     come over        the    top of

the fencing,          but we were           quite a long way awa y from them.                     I then saw

that    sections       of b oardings          were    being    ripped down from the               far    corner

of the West Stand and                 being    taken onto       the    pitch.      I saw people

             carrying        the boardings         on the js^fTch w ith               people       lying     on them and

             towards       the other       end of J/Ke pitch,                the Notts Forest               end,        w h ic h was       on

             my    left.      Some were       o b/ i o u s l y s e r i ou sl y       injured a nd some              had     coats

             over     their    faces.       my initial             thoughts were            that    the     coats must              have

             s li pp e d over     their     faces.          I d i d n ’t realise            that    they were            in fact
                                                                            yjjr
             dead.      At one stage,           the Notts Forest                   fans were       chanting and             this

C   a t      caused some L iverpool              fans       t^p^run the            length of the          pitch towards

               hem      F urther      Police w ^ e          then brought             onto    the    pitch and formed a

             cordon a cross         the hadTf w ay          line and         faced towards              the L ep pi ng s        Ln

             End.      The    only i n f o r m a t i o n    that was         coming        over    the tanrioy system was

             someone       saying,     "Will     the fans           please         clear    the    p i t c h ’ this       seemed

             lu dicrous       because      by this         time      it was        obvious       that    it was         not a. pitch

             i nvasion and that            lots of         people were             injured and          lying     on the        pitch

             a nd the      fans were a tt em p t i n g           to help them.               T h r ou gh ou t what was

             taking     place     the two       rows       of    p olicemen did nothing and did not                             break

             ranks     even though fans were                    going    betw ee n them           carrying         the    injured to

             the     other    end of the        pitch.            Pe op le all        a ro u n d me      in the stand were

             sho ut in g at      the Po li ce      to go and help but                     still they stood their

             ground.          I saw two officers w ith flat                         caps    who a p p e a r e d    to     be    in

             charge     of the Policemen.                   As     time went         on    I did see some               police

             still     in position.             It seemed to me               that        they must       haveieen             under

C Q M H & s/T h 6 lP the     injured     caused a lot of anger a m o ng st                        the    crowd.           By about

             3.50pm     <1550)      I could see            the scale        of what         had taken       place          and      I then

             d ec id e d wit h my friends            to make          our way out           of the ground.                  As      I got

         S h e f f i e l d and drove      back to Liverpool.                  I feel      that a major

         c o n tr ib ut or y factor       to the disaster             was    the m et h o d of e n tr y to the

         g round at the L ep p i n g s Ln end of the                   pitch there         is    insufficient          room

         to form          proper    queues    because        of the    lay-out      of the t urnstiles               and    the

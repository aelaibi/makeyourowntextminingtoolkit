                On       Saturday              15    April      1989       I came      on      duty     at      Wombwell          Police    Station

                at       9am,        to      be     transported         to      the    Sheffield             Wednesday            Football       Stadium

                at       Hillsborough                   for    the   match       between            Liverpool          and    Nottingham

                Forest.                 At     9.50am         I paraded         with       other       members         of    my    serial    in     the

                North          Stand           of    the      Hillsborough            Stadium.             I was       with       serial    15,

                responsible                    to                                          [    At     10.15am         we    ate    our    packed

                meals          then          I was       given       a .more     detailed            briefing          with       serial    15    and

                serial             14     on      the    terraces          of   the    West         Stand       at   the     Leppings       Lane     end,

                    by    Inspector               White.        My    serial,         serial         15,     was     deployed        to    turnstiles

                    9    to   16     behind          the      West    Stand      inside          the    ground         to    search       incoming

                    fans      for       prohibited             articles.

                    Once       the      match        began      we    were      to    be       deployed         in   the     North    tunnel        to

                    observe          public          order.          I was      not    deviated            to    any    other       location.

                    At    liam       I began            my    duties       inside      the          turnstiles         at    the    Leppings        Lane

                    few       people         came       through       at    this      time.           Gradually,            the    Liverpool        fans

                    began       to      trickle          through,          mostly      families            at    this       time.     The

atmosphere           was       good          na~ured          and       friendly.              I was          engaged                m        searching

cne     incoining         fans          as    tnsv          came       through          tne    turnstiles                   and          cirecting

tiiem    Co    their          Diaces.              At       i.iupm       I confiscated                   a    Swiss             pen       Knife          from

a iaaie       tan    which          was       put       m     tne       property          store          to       be       coiiected                by    the

gentleman           after          the       match.           At       tms        time    there          was       still             oniy       a    slow

trickle        of    supporters                entering                the    ground.

At    2.Z0pm        I remember                noting          the       time       and    commenting                   to       a    colleague

that     it    did       not       seem       very          busy       and    that       it    seemed             that          many          fans

were     "cutting             it    a    Pit       fine‚Äù          to    get       into    the      ground              for          the       kick-

off.         Very    shortly             after          this,          iarge       numbers          of       Liverpool                   tans       began

to    congregate              outside          the          turnstiles,             pushing          and          shoving                to    get

through        the       turnstiles.                    Most       of    the       fans       I searched                   at       this       time

smelled        of    alcohol.                 Through             the    turnstiles                I could             see          people

pushing        and       shoving             and    being          crushed          up    against             the          turnstiles.

People        coming          through          were          pale       faced,          sweating             and       complaining                   about

the     crush       outside.                 1 could          hear       people          banging             on    the          concertina

gate    next        to    the       turnstiles                (Gate          B)    to    be    let       in.           Several                fans

climbed        up    the       wall          above          the    turnstiles             and       refused                to       get       bacK       down

when    we     shouted             at    them,          saying          they      were        being          crushed                against          the

wall     outside.              A    tew       fans          clambered             through          the       turnstiles                   without

tickets,        these          were          apprehended                and       ejected          from       the          ground.

As    kick-off           approached                the       mood       of    the       crowd       worsened,                   there          was       an

air     of    apprehension                   inside          the       turnstiles             as    those          outside                became

more     desperate             to       get    in       the       ground.           It    became             obvious                that       the

situation           outside             was    becoming                chaotic.           1 spoke             to       a    Policewoman                   who

came     through          the       turnstiles.                    She       said       she    had       been          outside                the

turnstiles           and       had       been       pinned             against          the    wall          by    the          crush          of

people        and    that          she       had    been          frightened.                 More       and       more             fans       were

clambering           up       on    top       of    the       wall       above          the    turnstiles                   now,

complaining              of    the       situation                outside          and    trying             to    jump             down       inside

the    ground.              An    inspector             from       another          serial             climbed             on    to       the        roof

of    the    turnstiies                nimselt          to       view       tne    situation                on    the       other             side.
                                                                                                                                 *



He    oeqan       to    heip          the    rans       wno       were       sitting          on       the       wall       to       get       down          on

to    the    roof       of       the    turnstiles                and       into    the       ground.              Many          of       the        fans

were    injuring                themselves             as    they       jumped          off       the       turnstile                roof.              By

now    lots       of    fans          were    on       the       wali       and    as    they          jumped          from          the       top       of

tne    waii       or    otf       the       roof       of    the       turnstiles             they          were       running                into       the

ground,          it    was       impossible             to       check       to    see       if    they          all    had          tickets.

As    they       jumped          off    the       turnstile             roof       they       brought             down          the

guttering.              One       such       fan       almost          landed       on       top       of    me.           I helped                him       to

his    feet       and       asked       to    see       his       ticket,          he    said          he    had       given             it    m        at

the    turnstile.                 1    told       him       that       if    he    could          not       produce             his       ticket             he

would       be    ejected             from    the       ground.              At    this       he       became          very          abusive             and

started          to    struggle             violently.                                            came       to m y         assistance                   and

he    anCj |                            [m a r c h e d       the       fan    away       to       be    ejected.                 I       then

resumed          my    duties          at    the       turnstiles.

By    now    it       was       impossible             to    search          everyone,             as       they       came          over          the

wall    or       through          the       turnstiles,                they       were       charging             into          the       West

Stand,       shoving             past       anyone          in    their       way.           Suddenly,             I became                   aware          of

a    surge       of    fans       and       saw    that          the    concertina                gate       (Gate          B)       had       been

opened.           1 had          to    jump       to    the       side       to    avoid          being          knocked             over          as

fans    ran       into          the    ground.              I would          estimate             that       approximately                         three

hundred          people          came       through          the       gate       and    then          it w a s        closed.                 When

the    area       inside          the       turnstiles             had       cleared          of       people          I made             my       way       to

the     tunnel         in       the    centre          of    the       West       Stand,          noticing             a    number             of

empty,       crushed             beer       cans       which       must       have       been          kicked          through                t he

turnstiles.                 A    few    fans       were          coming       out       of    this          tunnel          and          shouting

abuse       at    me,       saying          that       they       were       being       crushed             in    the          pens          and       that

I     should      do    something             about          it.        One       man    came          up    to m e         in       a

distressed             state          and    said       that       there          were       some       children                at       the       front

made       our       way       clown          the       tunnel.           1 aid       not       note       the           time    out        it   was

the    end          or    t ne       tunnel,             which       was    empty          at    this       stage           except           tor      a

couple          or       rans        making             their       way    out,       1    saw       that       the       pens       on     either

side       or       the    central                 dividing          fence       were       packed.                 Fans        were       climbing

up    on       to    this        fence             and       being    nauiea          up    into          the       seating          area        above.

Other          people          were           pushing          each       other       up    to       be    caught           by      people

leaning             down       from           tne       seats.        1 shouted             at       the    fans          on     the       fence          to

get    down,             partly           oecause             I feared          they       would          fail       and        injure

themselves                and        partly             because       I    feared          the       overhanging                 seating           area

might          collapse.                  I    tried          to    push    my       way    into          the       left        hand      pen      (Pen

into       the       tunnel.                  As    I shoved          further          down          the    pen          I saw       that        several

fans       had       spilled              on       to    the       pitch    and       that       there          were       Policemen

standing             on    the           fence          at    the    front       of       the    pen       signalling                to m e        to      get

people          out       to     the          rear.

At    this          stage        I       realised             the    seriousness                of        the       situation             and      began

shoving             the    fans           under          the       barriers          and    shouting                at    them       to     get       out.

It    was       almost           impossible                   for    me    to m a k e       myself          heard          above          the      noise            <

the    crowd.              Myself              and                          tried          to    clear          a    passage           to    tne        from

but    most          of    the           fans       we       tried    to m o v e       w o u l d n ‚Äôt g e t              out,       stating           that

they       had       paid        to       see       the       match       and    weren't             leaving.              As       I managed             to

get    nearer             the        front          of       the    pen    the       crowd       was       hysterical,                 screaming

abuse          at    me    as        I    tried          to    get    them       under          the       barriers,             some        because

they       didn't          want           to m o v e          and    others          because          I    think          they       were

frightened.                    I could              hear       someone          screaming             " S h e ‚Äôs         fucking          dead,         do

heap       of       about        six       male          bodies       with       a    female          body          on    the       top.         This

pile       of       bodies           was       being          trampled          on    by    other          fans.           The       woman        on      top

to    carry       ouc       these          bodies          and       helped        carry          the     iast          man    from          the       pile

obvious          that       a       disastrous             situation             was     occurring.                     We    had       to       step

over       many       bodies          which          had       been       put    down        in    t he    tunnel             until          we    got

to    a    clear       space          in       the    enclosed             area,        immediately                 behind          the          West

were       now    laid          out       in    the       area       behind       the        West       Stand.

It    is    my    opinion             that       from          the    sheer       number           of     injured             and       dead

people          and    the          condition             of    some       of    the     bodies,           the          crushing             must

have       started          some          time       before          the    gate        was       opened.

Next       I helped             a    colleague             who       was    trying           to    revive           a    dead       man,          I gave

mouth       to    mouth             resuscitation                whilst          she     worked           on    his          chest.           The       man

smelled          strongly             of         alcohol. A l t hough                  we w o r k e d          for       a    long       time          we

were       unable          to       revive       him.           I covered             his face          with        something                and

moved       on    to       help       someone             else.           I saw        a man       laying           on       the    ground

w h o ‚Äôs    face       was          blue       and    there          was    blood        running           from          his       mouth,          he

was       dead    so       I removed             his       outer          coat    and        covered           his       face.           There

were       fans       wandering                amongst          the       dead    and        injured           bodies,             frantically

searching             for       friends          or       relatives             who     were       missing.                  Most       of       the

fans       were       in    an       extreme          state          of    shock.            I tried           to       comfort          and

reassure          several             of       these       people          but    there           was     little             I could          do       f or

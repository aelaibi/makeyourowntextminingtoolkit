I am writing to you about the timetable for my scrutiny of evidence relating to the Hillsborough
football stadium disaster.

When the Home Secretary appointed me to carry out this task I said that I expected to be able
to let him have my report by the end of this year. My work on the scrutiny is now well
advanced. I have looked in great detail at all the points which have been put to me by the
Support Group and others. Unless important new evidence is presented to me I believe that
I shall be able to keep to the timetable which I outlined when I began and I would like if at all
possible to do so. I think this would be in the best interests of all concerned.

It would be a great help to me if any further evidence which parties would like to
submit could be at this office by close on Friday 5 December. I am writing in si m ilar
terms to Mr Hicks and Ms Adlington, to Professor Scraton, and to the police and others
whom I have approached in the course of my scrutiny.

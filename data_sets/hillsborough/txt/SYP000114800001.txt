                       On Saturday,. .15th April                 1989,.       I was    on duty together              with officers            in

                       turnstiles            that   there was a serious                crowd      congestion sit u a t i o n

                       outside         the     t urnstiles.       People       were     coming        through and        coniplai nai ng

                       of   injuries and            how   people were           being       crushed outside.            After a short-

                       time    I could see             that youths were           climbing         over      the outer       perimeter

                       wall    and standing             on the    roofs       of the turns t i l e s         just     to the       right

                       of   *8'’ gate.           1 moved    over      to just         below     these youths          together       with

                 PC Gee       I h e l p e d these youths               down from the              roof.        1 could see through

                 the     t u rnstile       doors      into the          crowd outside and                 could see         people

                 tu r n s t i l e    entrance.          I could also             see      the    blue     dividing      fence       in the

                 Le p pings Lan e          t u r n s t i l e e n c l o s u r e and        could see          people    sc ra m b l i n g      for

                 their      lives       ii^ this      fence and then, along                     it to the       roof    of the

                 t u r n s t i 1es/where        Insp.         Joh n B e n n e t t   was     helping          them over.        As they

                 were     coming        over    I could see            them showing              us their m a t c h         tickets          but

                 due / o      the     u r g e n c y of the s i t u a t i o n did not                  check the       tickets.

                 iyter a short             time     of this a serial; of officers were                             stood by         'B ' gate

                 which      could be seen             to be being           pushed         in fram the outside                and the

                 gate w^s           opened.        I cannot          say who        by,     pe o p l e    then fell         into    the

                 ground t h r o u g h        the    gate.          I stood       there      telling          them to be       calm and

                 slow     down.         Afte    the m ain bulk             of    people         had    come t h r o u g h and the

                 orush      problem a l l e v i a t e d the             gates were          closed.          I cannot       say by whom.

                 I then m o v e d        over      to gate         *A* arvd saw that most                    of my unit was          there

                 going      thro u g h     that     gate       outside      in to the Leppings                  Lane    area.        I went

             ,   wit h    them and after              only a short              time      I heard a radio m e s s a g e             from

                 in front           of the L ep p i n g s        Lane.      As a unit we went                  back    t h r o u g h gate

                 *A *■ and down          towards        the N orth S t a n d           up the         first    gangway       entrance at

                 that     end of the N o r t h EStand and                   thro u g h onto            the    pitch.        I could see

                 a large       crowd       of   people         on the      pitch a r o u n d          the goal     area at         the

                 L e p p i n g s Lane      end and        it a p p e a r e d to me that there                   had been a pitch

                 invasion.            I saw none         of the        football           players        on the    pitch.          Together

                 wit h    other       officers        I formed a cordon a r o u n d the                       18 yards       box.        I

                 could see           people w a l k i n g aro u n d holding                 their        ribs and      in obvious

                 pain but           did not     realise          the extent          of the       disaster.           The    cordon

                    I then went           over      to behind goal                are a and      saw Police O f f i c e r s         pulling

         to a t t e n d a        report       of fighting        in W a d s l e y Lane.       We went        to W a d s l e y

         Lane     but      could find          no fighting.          We then        returned to L e p p i n g s Lane

         and left          the    vehi c l e and stood by the                em e r g e n c y v e h icles and a si s s t e d

         in the dispersal                of    fans    there.       I then heard a radio m e s s a g e                from

         our PS       1066 H i g g i n s       that    our unit w h i c h       had become       s e p a r a t e d were

         there a n d joi n e d           unit w h i c h was       complete         except    for PC    1398

         Goodwill.              As a mob i l e       unit we were          then direc t e d to       fighting at the

         B ur g o y n e    Arms     public      house,       Langs e t t    Road,     On arrival       all      was    quiet

         and we       resumed back             to the     ground.          We were    then d i r e c t e d    to

         the    casualty          dept.       N or t h e r n General       Hospital    a report       of fighting.              On

         arrival          all    was    quiet and we          resumed       back    to the    ground.         We were

         then d i r e c t e d       to the L e p p i n g s .Lane       terrace where we made                 a search of a

         sect i o n of the             terrace       between the       tunnel       entrance a n d the North

         Stand,           On    c om p l e t i o n we a t t e n d e d C l a y w h e e 1s Lane and had our meal.

         We were          then    deployed          to N i a g a r a Po l i c e Club on stan d b y duties.

         At    1,30 am we were                stood     down.     At no      time    did I realise           the enormity

         of the       d i s aster an d b e l i e v e d that at most                 no more    than about          10-15

         persons          had been killed.               It was     not     until much       later    that      1 heard

         that, the         number       of    persons     killed was 93,

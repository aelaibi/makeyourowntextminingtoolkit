                                      Dr John Ashton



I am    a   medical   practitioner         and    senior    lecturer    in Community   (Public)
Health at the University of Liverpool.                     On Saturday 15th April I vent to
the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield with other members of my family.
This year we travelled by way of the M62 and Ml because for the same evenu
last year we had travelled on the direct route through the peak d^stric^
and there had been very bad build-ups of traffic on the way home.                       «*e left
Liverpool at about 10.15 am and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.15 - 12.30
pm.    We had a meal at        a pub some distance from the ground and               afterwards
walked perhaps 2 miles         to the match.        While we were       at the pub a coach-load
of Liverpool supporters came in.                 They were boisterous but well behc.red ar.d
there was good humour between them and the local people who were ec_ing in

the dining area.


We arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2.30 - 2.35 pa

(myself, ______________________________________ anc*__________________________
It was      immediately apparent that it was going to                   be difficult to get in.
We    had   four    tickets    together      for    row    2 of   the   West   Stand, above   the
Leppings Lane terrace.           I had been particularly relieved to obtain seats
this year because           at last year's         game    in the semi-final we were     in the
terrace itself (in the right hand corner behind the goal) and it had been

 terribly crowded and unpleasant.


 On Saturday we found that outside the ground there were a large number O j.
 supporters trying to get in to a small number of turnstiles and that the^e
 was verY little police presence.                   I saw no stewards outside "he        ground.
 There appeared to have been no attempt to marshal the supporters into lines

 in advance of our approaching the turnstile areas.


 We    managed     to get    nearer   to    the    turnstiles     but the crush vas     ceconur.g
 unpleasant.        I heard a police officer telling the supporters that                  it was

 their own fault for coming late.
I decided^ that I did not want to go on because it was so unpleasant.
said     it would       only        get     worse    and       that   he   was   going   in.                 and
               Insisted on going in with                          and they stayed where they were as
I withdrew to the wrought-iron fence.



After a few minutes I thought I would try again.                                 I could not see my family
and assumed that they had managed to get                              through the turnstiles.         When I
approached again it was now much worse and again I withdrew.                                     I was aware
of an officer trying to close one of the wrought iron gates, but he had no
chance on his own.              I noticed that there was now a police landrover in the
lane just outside the gates and my instincts and experience of 30 years as
a Liverpool supporter told me that things were going badly wrong.                                     I went
to the police landrover and obtained the attention of one of the officers.
I said to him,          "you’ve got to get a grip of this situation,                            it is out of
control,        there     is        going    to     be    a     tragedy."         He   seemed   bemused      and
unresponsive.           People were closing in around the landrover and I withdrew
to the other side of the road to see if it would ease off and I could try
again.        The time now must have been 2.45 - 2.50.


After a few minutes                 I suddenly realised that everybody had gore in and I
was able to walk up to the turnstiles and gain admission without difficulty
after tendering my ticket.



Once inside the turnstile it was at first uiy:lear where I should go.                                  Thet£
were     no    stewards        in    sight    and        the   section     labelling     was    confusing.     I
realised where the entrance was to the West Stand and vent to get in after
buying a programme.                 At this stage I had no idea that things had actually
now deteriorated to the extent that they had done.                                 It must have been just
after 3.00 pm.



When I went to the gate into the West Stand there were a few other people
in the process of getting in and two policemen were checking their tickets.
I then became aware of a man crying and beseeching the police.                                    "There are
kids dying in there," he said,                      "you’ve got to do something."               He seemed to
have come out of the terraced area.                            The police were unresponsive to hire.
They checked my ticket and let me in.
Once inside the stand area                  I turned up the stairs,       now worried to check
that                             and           were alright.       As I got to the top of the
stairs it was difficult to make progress because there were so many people
in the aisle.        At the top of the stairs I could begin to see why.                        Many
people were being pulled up out of the terrace and into the front of the
stand.



I could neither attempt to get down to row 2 nor see the boys.                          I decided
to make my way along the adjacent row.                      Everybody was helpful and I was
able to do this without difficulty.                   It must have been about row 20.          When


First I saw            then                    then          I was able to make my way down
to them over the seats.


When I reached them I could see that there were a large number of people on
the pitch,    people      trying       to get out of the          terrace on to the pitch and
people were continuing to come up in to the stand.                      There seemed to be few
St. Johns Ambulance people attending the people who were lying around the
pitch and     I could see people lying on the pitch unattended.                      There was a
large line of police officers across the pitch at the centre                         circle.    The
tannoy told the supporters who were on the pitch to get off it.


The pressure was bad where we were so I made my way back some rows with
       and                         stayed        where he was to help pull people up from the
terrace.      When   we    got     further      back   we   had    a   clear    view of what    was
happening     on   the pitch;          it    seemed incredible.The      time must have been
about 3.15 pm.


The overwhelming impression was of a large and growing number of casualties
and not much response.           The supporters were now impatient and angry at the
slowness of the response to the emergencies.                   There appeared to be only one
or two stretchers on the pitch and one ambulance was making its way around
from the far corner.             The    supporters were chanting for assistance to be
brought to the injured who were lying on the pitch.                            The next thing vas
that many of the supporters who were on the pitch began to tear down the
advertising boards          and organise    themselves   into    stretcher parties.        This
all happened very quickly.


I heard      the   tannoy    appeal   for   doctors   to help.     I could    see   that    the
situation was really bad and could count six people who appeared to be dead
near the goal mouth.          I made sure that              and              were safe with
_____ and that I knew where they were and made my way out down the back of
the Leppings Lane Stand.


On    the   stairs   a policeman was        attending somebody who was       injured.       The
injuries     did not appear to be critical            so I asked the policeman where I
should report to help.           He did not know.        I went back into the stand and
brought the boys out and down the stairs to place them somewhere safe and
in sight.      I then tried to find somebody in charge to tell me who to report
to.     I asked several officers,           but none of then knew.      There were people
lying everywhere in the yard area between the Stand and the turnstiles.                       I
asked the officer who was in charge and he indicated a senior officer.                        I
approached this officer and told him that I was a doctor and asked him who
was in charge of emergencies and where I should report.                 He said he did not
know and that he had just arrived.             By this stage I realised that there was
no organised response and I was angry.                I asked the officer for his number
but he did not appear to have one.              I asked for his name.        He said he was
Inspector Grace.        I left him and went to see what I could do.


All around were people either dead or unconscious, or seriously hurt.                       The
supporters were fantastic.            They were all helping each other and trying to
resuscitate people.           Individual police officers were also doing what they'
could.      At no time did I see anybody attack a police officer, nor did I see

anybody who was drunk.


 I came to the conclusion that somebody needed to take an overview of the
 situation and began to go round all the casualties to appraise them.                      There
 did not seem to be any St. Johns Ambulance workers around at all.                   I became
 aware that some casualties were being taken out into Leppings Lane itself
 and I went out there.           There was one ambulance.         The time must have been

 about 3.30 - 3.35 pm.


                                                 4
The policy were beginning to put people into the ambulance and I realised
that a system of prioritising by triage was needed.                             So I did this.           I went
around    and     either       checked       people   myself        or   asked    the    person who          was
attending them.             There were two or three other health workers in evidence
who    were     assessing,         resuscitating       and    doing      what     they    could.           There

appeared to be no medical or emergency equipment.


The dead were          taken to one side and I allocated the other casualties to
category one or category two.                   I told the police who should be despatched
by ambulance next and who could wait.                       The officers were mostly very good.
They    took my        instructions       and acted on         them      immediately.          By this      tine
there was a steady flow of ambulances.                       It must have been 3.45 or 3.50.                    I
became aware of a local general practitioner who had arrived at the scene.
Over     the    next    half       an hour    we    worked    together       as   a    team,    sorting the
casualties and despatching them in the ambulances.                            An anaeswhetist arrive—
from somewhere and fire-engines came with resuscitation equipment, but &i.
of this was really too late.                       By 4.25 pm it was all over.                   Tne serious
casualties had gone to hospital and what remained were people with miner
 injuries,      shock and distress and a line of dead                        people.       I went    to chec.s
 that my family was                alright and when I came back a police officer asked re
 to certify the deaths.               A general practitioner had already started this at
 one end of the row of bodies.                     I started at the other.               I thin* the tic=
 was 4.27 or 4.29 and I think                      I certified five or six dead.Only one cf

 whom could be identified from                  documents on his body.


 During this whole period the                      public were fantastic,             although shocked ar.d
 angry.        On one occasion            atthe end a group of young men cane past                            the
 dead,    and    one     of        them   expressed his        anger      at police      who were        standir.g
 there.        I told him          to "cool it", that it was not helpful and                         he stopped.     1
 saw     no    other    episodes       like    this    at    all,    although      there       was   a    general
 atmosphere of anger at what had been happening.                              I remember thinking hr-

 restrained everybody was.


 It must have been about 4.30                   - 4.35.       There did not seem to be an ythin
 else     for    me    to     do    behind    Leppings      Lane.        I   checked     that                 \z~z

                were     alright with                 and    then made       ny way       to    the gv.^nasi
around the side         of the ground to see if I could be of any help there.                                  I
had become aware that other casualties had been taken to the gymnasium.


At first I had difficulty finding it as nobody could give me directions.
When I arrived there I went in and found that it was all over.                                    At one end
there were tables (I think three) which must have been used for processing
details of the injured.                  There were now no casualties in this area.                      At the
near end of the gym were rows of bodies.                           On my way past I noticed a large
display    of    photographs             and   information        on     the wall    of    the   gym    showing
Liverpool supporters who were thought to be pickpockets, etc.


I left     the gym      and returned round to                 the Leppings Lane end to check                  my
family again.          They were alright.               I thought that I should go back to                    the
gym   to   see    if    there       would      be   a   debriefing         of   people     involved      in   the
emergency       response,          so    all   four     of   us    went     round.        This   time    it vas
difficult to get near the gym because there was a large cordon of police
around it.       I spoke to an officer and he let us through when he knev I was
a doctor and I left________________ and                                ^afely behind them and went to
the gym.         This       time    it was very difficult                 to get in.        There was tight
control on       the door.              I explained why I wanted to go in and was allowed to

enter.


 I asked     about      a    debriefing but nobody could help.                        Those who had been
helping were being             cleared out of the                 gym.      Just    then a senior officer
 called    all    the       officers       together     at    one      end of      the hall      for a    police

 briefing.       I don't know what it was about.                         I left.


 On our way back to Leppings Lane we encountered a police officer who                                     was in
 great distress and being comforted by another.                              I put my arm around him to
 comfort him as well.               He was sobbing uncontrollably and saying that now the
 police would get the blame.                    Another officer was angry and *-ol'l "te that he
 felt that       they had been let down by                    the .senior officers.              He said      that
 nobody had       taken charge and that when senior officers had come they had

 been of little use and just got in the way.

  ‘f* £ •   € C   cc-   €STo ^                                     Address:


I arrived at the approach to the Leppings 3oad end of the Hillsborough
Stadium at 1L.25 hours,           I was accompanied by cy                                                    3'on and
a young man of               Ve all had a valid ground ticket.                                        The immediate
approach to the turnstiles, a distance of some 70 yards, was full cf
a jostling crowd of ticket holders trying to make their way to the
turnstiles.         There was no semblence of orderly cueues, with some kind
of order trying to be maintained by three mounted police officers.
Despite the lack of organisation and frustration the mood of the fans
remained reasonably co -operative.                     To emphasise this, one of the horses
was very close to me a nd accidentally almost knocked ny spectacles off.
The officer apologised and we exchanged smiles and I stroked the horse's
nose.


The nearer one got to the actual turnstiles the pushing and crashing
became severe.          After approximately ter. minutes all three of us were
literally catapulted through the turnstiles.                                    Over the last ten yards
one had no control whatsoever over our movements.


Once through the turnstile all three of my party cane together.                                                  Fy son
attempted to remonstrate with a police officer regarding the lack of
organisation on the approach to the turnstile.                                    He was warned by a
steward standing alongside the officer to keep quiet because other far.s
who had made similar protests had been forcibly                                   •ejected from the ground.


Ve then moved away and vent to use the toilet situated in front of us
under the stand.           As ve came out of the toilet we were directly facing
the rear of the turnstile area and were immediately aware of the
opening of one of the gates alongside the turnstiles.                                              The time was now
just after ll.UO hours.           Anticipating the ensuing rash I took                                         my
companions to the right, aiming to take our place high up on the terracing
to the left of the Lepping Road Stand facing the playing area.                                                 The
previous y e a r ’s experience had alerted me that this was a sensiole area
to stand, both from a safety viewpoint and it also provided an excellent
view.         I have a vivid mental picture, as we hurried past the now
infamous tunnel leading to the ill-fated sections, of turning my head
and noticing there was nobody to be seen, either spectator or official.
                                    -2-


The high u p area we entered was very full, but with no crush.       We

positioned ourselves within feet of the blue boards.      Looking down from

my high vantage spot I could see the two middle Dens immediately behind

the goal were jammed to capacity with a seething nass of people.      To my

surprise, the pens on the left and right were half empty.      The area on

the far ri^it around the electronic scoreboard was also half empty.

The time of this observation was 14.50 hrs.




Ify- attention then became diverted when tne Liverpool team took to tr.e

field, followed a couple of minutes later by the opposition.       At -the sar-e

time I was conscious of a few people entering cur section behind ar.i

alongside me.      There was no large influx just before the kick-off vr.ere

I was standing.



       0           had beer, in progress for some five mr.u~ss vitn Liverpool presa-.^

home an attack at the far end, with a c o m e r followed by a shot whicr. hit

the woodwork.      I believe this shot to be significant because it Rear.*

a tremendous surge down the pens behind the Liverpool goal to try ar.i see

what was hapoenir.e.    This is the normal react!cr. on the terracing a~ any

 football match.       From my vantage point I was then immediately avsre

 of fans trying to come over the metal fence ber.ir.d the goa:.    So.^.e ..a-

 been successful and were being led down the touchline by the police.         C'r.ers

 were being stopoed climbing out of the pens despite their obvious pretests.

 At the same time a senior police officer ran from behind the Liverprcl gcal

 and approached the referee.    He immediately stopped the game taking rotr.

 teams off the pitch.        By this time a few more fans had managed ir

 escape from the pens.      One fan on the field of ulay appeared to be

 pleading whilst he was being forcibly led to the side of the playir.r s-rea.

 Behind the goal the two oens were a seething mass of people with lit-le

 or no movement either backwards or forwards.     A few people were beir.=.

 passed from the back of the pens to the front.      ' The front of the per.s
  next to the fence seemed to be flat without the usual bobbing heads*


  Within two minutes of the teams leaving the field X realised something was

. very wrong.      On reflection I have come to the conclusion that my alarm was

  confirmed due to a combination of medical experience combined with an

  intimate knowledge of years of attendance at football matches on the

  terracing.



  I quickly realised that help would be required on the pitch.         I informed my

  son what I was doing and because I was so close to the entrance to the

  terracing X had entered I quickly made my way down the stairs to find a

  Steward to get me to the side of the pitch.        I quickly found a Steward who

^ P ^ c e p t e d what I was tellinr him and he took me through a tunnel under the main

  stand where a Police Officer again accepted nry explanation of being a trained

  nurse and let me on to the pitch.


  I raced to the area immediately behind the goal net.       The narrow gate belonging

  to the pen behind the net was open with police officers trying to pull flaying

  bodies through the narrow openinr.       Other officers appeared to be trying to

  instruct the fans to push back in the pens.        I helped officers pull people

  through the gate.       We were pullir.c any part of their body we could ret hold

  of.   On reflection I realise now because their bodies were level with the

^ P p t t o m of the gate that they must have been lyinr on top of people because

  the gap between the bottom of the gate to the floor of the terracing was some

  three feet.



 The first casualties I helped pull through the gate were conscious, but very

  shocked.      I attended to them at the back of the goalmouth on the netting.

  Their recovery was comparatively quick and sinple were coved away from the

 immediate area.        Very quickly I was aware that we were pulling out

 unconscious bodies.      I can next recall working on a young man who once he

 was conscious seemed to have chest injuries.       I looked around the goalmouth

 for a stretcher or something to remove him to a place for him to get treatment.
                                              -4 -


 Ifte scene around me remained completely chaotic with everyone trying to do

 their own thing, fans and police all mingling together.          I eventually found

' a stretcher lying on the pitch with which I quickly returned to the injured man.

  I literally ordered three police officers to help me lift the patient on to the

  stretcher.   By this time he was complaining about the pain in his chest.               We

 tjuickly made our way to the corner of the field between the main stand and the

 Kop and took the young man behind the stand to the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance room.

 I then ran back on to the field to the goalmouth.        In that short interval of

 time a lot more bodies were lying behind the goal.         People of all descriptions

 were attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.         On the right

   jid side of the goal net a young girl was being worked on by a i?.an who stated

 he was a surgeon.      I moved to the body next ir. line and worked with a young

 police officer until the patient appeared to be starting to cone round.              I

 then moved on to the next person who was lying unconscious and unattended in

 the goalmouth.      I was working alone in this instance giving both mouth to r.outh

 and cardiac massage, an impossible and hopeless situation.        The patient started

 vomiting to complicate the issue.       I was conscious of ar. elderly white haired

 St. John’s Ambulance man working alongside me.         I requested some swabs tc clear

 an airway, all that was forthcoming was a dry sponge.          By this tine it v=s

^^.fter 15.30 hours and ve still    had no equipment of any sort to work with.        It

  tzs just after that that I was    conscious of the first ambulances beginning to

 cake their way on to the pitch.        Eventual 1;/ I realised that I had lost the

 battle for this young m a n ’s life.       I looked around but I could r.ot see anymore

 unattended bodies.      By that time our ranks had been swelled by ar-bular.ce crews

  and firemen with some oxygen.


  I next left the field making my way behind the main stand to tne gymnasium, vr.ere

 I understood some of the injured were being taken.         Again I found another scene

  of chaos.    The only entrance    to the gym was a door of similar dimensions

  to that found in any household    room.     Directly outside this door was the

  St. John’s Ambulance Room.       The space was becoming janmed full of people

  with comparatively minor injuries.        Tne area was also rapidly filling witr.

  people presumed deajj*,
    I next assisted police to make some sort of pathway to the door of the gym by

helping and organising the movement of both the prospectuve dead and the

    seriously injured.      Inside the gymnasium the space was roughly divided

    into two, half for the dead and the rest for the living, with tables set up

    to interview the relatives.    I began to work with the injured in the

    gymnasium at around 15*55 hours.    I was conscious of around three doctors in

    attendance, but when I arrived there there was still no medical equipnent of

    any sort.     One doctor shouted across the gym for some drugs to treat an

    injured fan who was in obvious pain.    There was nothing available so I

volunteered to go to the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance room.      I was informed that

they were not allowed to carry any drugs.          I rushed back to the gym asking

    some Senior Police Officer on the way if "they could obtain some equipment

    for us.     Quickly three small plastic boxes arrived with medical equipment

    plus an emergency case with drugs in it.     I began passing out the meagre

items of equipment to the doctors present.         There were still only roughly

    a dozen injured in the area.    I prepared ter. intravenous lines ready for the

Medical Officer to set up, and we commandeered police officers to hold the

    I.V. packs because we had no stands to attach them to.         3y then some

    semblance of order was being maintained in the part of the gymnasium giver.

over to the injured.          The other side of the gymnasium was rapidly filling

with the pr-acw'tf t *✓-? dead.    One of the doctors present had taken one of the
I
three stethoscopes available to enable hi- to declare them clinically dead.


I next tidied up the medical equipnent as most of the injured were being

    rapidly removed to hospital.    J then began to realise the full extent of

the disaster for there were already over fifty bodies lying on the floor.

I'fiy final act in this carnage was to comfort and stay with the husband of the

young girl whom I had seen attended to behind the goal.         At least I knew

    she had had the best of attention that had been available in the

    circumstances.    I stayed with him whilst he gave the necessary details

    to the police, and then a local vicar took over from me.

    When I left the gymnasium, to my amazement it was still only 16.45 hours.

    Th e longest hour and a half of my life.
 PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS



 1.   Comparison of the   organisation with the previous year.

      The previous year I arrived at the same area of admission    at 14.50 hours

      with my daughter.    Before we reached the turnstiles at Leppings Lane

      we had to go through a police filter system, whereby it was ascertained

      that we did have the appropriate match tickets.

      This year no such system was set up.




      Both years I was delayed 'because of travelling difficulties.     The

      appropriate Authorities had decided to initiate roadworks on the Ko2

      to commence around a week before each gane.      Surely tr.e matches could

      have been taken into consideration when setting up these roadworks.




 3.   VJhen we cane through the turnstiles for the 1 9S8 gsse ve were met by   a

      line of stewards and police officers who gently but firmly prevented us

      from entering the tunnel to the middle sections.      It had been decided

      that these sections were already full to capacity.

      This year no such precaution was in operation.

t>
 4.   I can understand the Police Officers at the turnstiles wishing to open

      the gates to relieve pressure and avoid injury to life cr limb, but

      in these days of ultra modern and sophisticated personal conuunications

      surely it could have been done in conjunction with their central police

      control area at the side of the electronic scoreboard.




 5.   Very recent national publicity has assured us that surveillance cameras

      at football grounds means that any problems can be dealt with within

      two minutes of their occurrence.

      Surely with the police central control post with all its battery of

      T.V. monitors available, they should have been able to ascertain the
                                       ■2 -



fteed "to close the Diddle sections when they becaune full.



6.   Observing from the outside it appears to have taken far too long

     for the authorities to decide that it was not a security problem and

     that the fans genuinely needed help.     '.forking with   and alongside

     the individual police officers in the immediate disaster area, I

     have tremendous praise and admiration for their efforts.        Overall

     at the scene, however, there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

     and genuine leadership.




7.   For an extremely long time we were vrithout ar.y form of medical

     equipnent of ar.y description.    I still cannot understand why the

     local Health Authority’s Major ?*edical Disaster Tear, was not called

     upon.   T understand that all Health Authorities ir. this country

     have a major disaster policy.    It is inoossible to accurately

     estimate the difference, this would have made in saving life.

     I do, however, believe that the Liverpool fans should have been

     given the chance.




                                                                  I X <tf O J u J L   n i 9

       Dear Or. Popper.

        At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a se rie s of questions concerning
     (fljkie aftermath at Hillsborough, we were l e f t with the impression th a t the
     Q u e s t i o n s would be dealt with at a la te r stage.


       However since then you have ruled that i t i s not necessary to proceed after
       15.15pm and i t now appears that our questions w ill not be addressed, you
       did say that in an Ideal world everyone would have ended up 1n hospital and
       you suggested that we were naive in thinking that the medical response was
       Inadequate, that sort of answer i s not conducive to the facts as shown in
       the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying v a lia n tly to
       a s s i s t the injured.

       The video shows 1t took t i l l at le a s t 15.35pm before all the ca su a lties
       were removed from the pens, a f a i r l y lengthy delay which obviously did
       nothing to help th eir chances of survival.


        Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
         nclosed) certainly imply that in th eir opinion, the response l e f t a l o t to
     t   e desired.

        We also know of people who were removed 1n an unconscious sta te , a prime
        example being Mr. Edward Spearrltt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
        admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
        i t was possible for people 1n the crush who suffered severe injury to
        survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.


        At the very le a s t th is raises questions 1n the eyes of the fam ilies that
        the Inefficiency of the major incident response could have contributed to
        the number of deaths occurring at Hillsborough and therefore we consider
        that t h i s should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for tne
        deaths.

        You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
        I t would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.

Dear Mr Jones

Thank you for your lette r dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
which I have noted and have read with care.

Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
you view the points raised, I do not think that i t i s either right
or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
the issue which you have raised.

However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
to say that i t i s not my intention to ca ll either Dr Ashton or
Dr P h illip s.
I have also read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
apply for a judicial review i s a matter e n tire ly for you and/or your
advisors    1 ’ do not think that I should comment on th is either.

                  THE CORONER:   I have got no particular objection
             you being here.   I thought you probably would not ho
            the bestUfh- bUt I.wanted to be sure about that.   PerhapI
            the best thing would be if we started with you really a n d

                     J ING:   sir* my primary legal submission is
                 Itr  ? your Preliminary ruling on the last occasion
            that this inquest should be concerned only with events ud
            to about 3.15 pm.     As I understand your Juling. si?’ i?P
            ronrfrniHne^ i ° ensJ!re that this Inquest would only be
            concerned with events leading to the crushing on the
            terraces and the first arrival of an ambulance.

                 As you know, sir, the families whom I represent are
            very anxious that this Inquest should deal with what to
                           maj°r issue' as to how their loved ones came
            by their deaths, namely how the services and the rescue
                      and       attending with the emergency, coped
            with it immediately after people were brought off the
            terraces because death was not certified in many, if not
            most cases until after 4 pm.    Sir, I do not k ^ w if you
            have had an opportunity to read these.    I did ask those
            instructing me to send to you statements from each of the
            families whom I represent setting out a number of
            individual questions directed to their own Inquest but also
            incorporating in their individual cases why they were
            anxious to learn of what happened between the time there
            was a first sighting of any loved one being brought off the
            terracing and the pronouncement of death.    I do not know
            if you had an opportunity to read them.

                 THE CORONER:   I have briefly because these did not
            arrive until Friday afternoon but I have looked at them.

                 MR. KING:    What I would like to do is take you
            through some individual examples in order to persuade you
            that this is a question which ought to be gone into at this
            particular Inquest.    I do not know whether that is a
            format you want to follow or whether you want first to hear
            some other representatives as to their attitude to my
            submission.    I am happy to go into considerable detail
            about it.

                 THE CORONER:   There are several points which have
            occurred to me and the first point I would like you to deal
                                                            I




with is this; you were not present but you will be aware
that xn April/May this year we sat for two-and-a-half weeks
approximately and we dealt with the 95 deceased and we
dealt with three issues which Coroners deal with; who the
deceased was, when he/she died and where he/she died.    I
specifically excluded from discussion at that time the
question of how he or she died because as you will
recollect the DPP was still actively considering the matter
and we did not want to trammel his investigation but, on
the other hand, I felt it was right we should allow people
to hear what we could deal with.

      I will raise the second point at the same time because
it may be easier for you to deal with the two things
together.    At those hearings we dealt in considerable
detail, in fact infinitely more detail than we would
normally deal with in an Inquest, with events after the
pathological cause of death and I did it because I realised
that the families were desperately anxious to know what had
happened immediately after the incident.    My question to
you is - and I think this is what we need to deal with and
get right - bearing in mind we have only dealt with the
question of who, when and where and that we have done it in
considerably greater detail than one would normally expect
to do, why is it necessary to review that very activity
again which I think is what you are really asking me to do?

     MR. KING:      Sir, as I understand the individual
Inquests there was not an enquiry into, in the individual
cases, the impact of the organisation rescue on the
survival or otherwise of the particular loved one.         All
that was done when      one looks at those Inquests was to
identify the time of a first sighting,that is to say,
somebody who seemed to be unconscious, and of a time when
effort was made to resuscitate in any given case and then
death was certified.       In many of the cases there was a
large gap of time after 3.15 pm when it was not
investigated at the individual Inquests the nature of the
services available to deal with those being brought off and
if I can just give      one or two examples of that, you have
examples of people      who are brought off at 1522 and it is
said that there was an effort to resuscitate by a lay
individual and then that particular lay individual is not
heard of again, or the officer is not, and it is said that
the given loved one arrives at the temporary mortuary.
There has been no investigation directed to the alobai
organisation_of what happpnprf immediately after they were
brought off_the terrsrfis._ certainly I have ueen through
the m o * vidjai^ transcripts and there does not seem to be
any evidence directed to that issue and those witnesses who
were called could not deal with those issues, sir.
              ™ 0NE? : * Are you su9gesting that the cause of
         ■. •re?Pect of these individuals   is not in fact the
      a°         cause of death which we have been given but due
 e v i ^ n r!US      in effect bY person or persons whose
 evidence you have not yet heard?

     i1®'         Certainly the families, and I put it as
              V Slr# and Puttin9 it bluntly, cards on the
table, are not convinced at all that had there been a far
     *e"**blei .lo9ical organisation of the rescue services,
      i       dlsaster team being brought in, of proper
m#dical equipment being available, of proper t r i a g e beino
carried out, that those measures, had they been there, in
several cases, would not have resulted in the survival of
their loved ones.     They cannot - obviously they were not
there - produce through me concrete evidence of that at this
             .eYefy stage of an Inquiry into this disaster,
and this certainly is true even in theTaylor Inquiry, that
particular aspect of the disaster has never properly been
gone into.                                    * y       y

                 Putting it very simply to you, sir, most of the
                *£epr?SewJ feel there has been a complete blanket
              ellberat® blanket) been held down over what happened
                 were br°ught off the terraces and before
             f    were certified dead and there has been no effort
       4-^y ?ma         y to analy se what was the organisation at
S*       “ S      **52 rescue' what ®ight have been, and what could
t am ”       J a      ?5ence*   A very simP le example again is that
I am instructed there is evidence of Dr. Gumpert given at the
Inquest that without an electrocardiogram we can never be
sure whether or not there is a pulse and when dealing with
             f loved ones taken off the terraces and simply dealt
with by lay people, the absence of such sort of equipment
means that one would never know whether or not that
individual was alive or dead at that stage.          It is a
m a t t e r - and I do not mean this pejoratively - which is swept
under the carpet as if to say, "All we are interested in is
the immediate crushing leading to those being brought off the
terraces .         I cannot put it any more firmly than that, sir.

     THE CORONER:    You have put it very plainly and I
appreciate it.    I will give a ruling on your application in
a few moments but do you want to develop it further?
Obviously I want an opportunity to hear from your colleagues.

     MR. KING:    Have you the individual statements which
were supplied?

     THE CORONER:   i do have those in front of me.   I would
not want to go through all of them but if you wish to pick
one or two as examples I am prepared to listen to you and
indeed it also makes it easier for everybody else.
                                                                o

        MR.       Sir, if you were to turn to No. 1 1 to star-
Pilhk h i    1S the submissi°ns to you of the Jones family,
Richard Jones, I do not know whether you have been given one
or two documents.    I have two documents in relation to Mr

        THE CORONER:    No. 11, did you say?

«   ■«!?*' K??G: . Yes' sir*   * be9 your pardon, sir, it is
No. 10.     Sir, if you look ---

      THE CORONER:   Mr. King, may I just stop you for one
moment because something has occurred to me, and I have beer,
reminded, which I ought to say to the Press before we go
further?    The session this morning is being heard without
the Jury and the reason we have not got the Jury is because
we are dealing with legal points.    That means no doubt that
you can report we are in session but you should not actually
report what is being said.    You will no doubt be familiar
with the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 4 of the
                           I say you must not report what we
are discussing.    if we had wanted the Jury to hear we would
have had them present but we do not wish them to hear at thii
stage.    You may, when we have finished the Inquest, if you
still feel it is a reportable and interesting aspect then, o:
course, that is a different matter but for the moment please
do not report the content of the legal matters we are
discussing.    Mr. King, I am sorry to interrupt you, would
you continue?

     MR. KING:   Sir, the document I am looking at and I
appreciate those alongside me are not looking at any docuroen*
but it is just to help you is one headed to myself. "Dear Mr
King".

     THE CORONER:   I have a document headed "Dear Miss
Steel" dated 22nd October.

        MR. KING:    Sir, this is dated 7th November.

     THE CORONER:   I have not got it I am afraid.      It is
not in front of me.

     MR. KING:   I apologise for that and I will take you
through, if I may, through five points which are raised by
Mr. and Mrs. Jones.   Sir, they make the basic point that ttu
report into the death of their loved one, Richard, was
certified at 1600 hours in the temporary mortuary and,
therefore, so far as the family are concerned, so far as
evidence is concerned, they presume, as they say they must b<

            naving already  time the evidence of death is not

,  nT.P°intNo: 2 ' sir' is extracted from the evidence given
by Dr. Gumpert at the Inquest already held here and in fact
^ " a? evidence 91ven on the occasion of Kevin Tyrrell and
?ec4ll- 18 a qUOtation from his evidence which ylu may


     is autlt      -t0 °b?erve that feeling the carotid pulse
     is quite difficult in someone who has a low blood
     pressure as would have been here.    In fact it can be so
     difficult it is impossible and you have to have an
     electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
     stopped or not."

     Th®n there is the statement of Mr. Eccleston, which is
            5 ^ em2nt in.the lar9e bundle of statements given
to the West Midlands Police, and indeed Mr. Eccleston gave
evidence to the Taylor Inquiry in which he says this:

  ' As a comment on what Mr. King has said, strictly it aDDear«
to us that he is saying that there is the possibility to put it
in a legal term, of a novus actus, i.e. something which
intervened after the crushing and before the deafhs which causec
or contributed to the deaths of at least some of the people and
the response of the Chief Constable to that submission if i pCt
it correctly, is that we can quite see that is something which
people would wish to see investigated on the question of how it
came about.  I only make that comment in an endeavour to be
helpful, but the position of the Chief Constable is that he has
no submissions one way or the other.

     May 1 just say while I am on my feet with regard to what Mr
 f    f* JUSt Said’ as a matter of fact it is not correct that
the Police have admitted negligence.  It is well known and has
been well publicised that what has happened is that the Police
have agreed to make payments to those people who were injured anc
to the dependents of those who died, and that such payments are
in the process of being made. Also there has been a civil actior
in respect of apportionment of liability in respect of those
matters.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much, indeed.  I accept
entirely what you say and in a sense I accept what Mr. Manning
s^ys as weH -  It is not really relevant to my proceedings
whether or not negligence has been admitted or not admitted,   it
is neither here nor there. So I did not comment on it, but I
appreciate what you have said.

     MR. ISAACS:   I think, sir, in fact, that is Mr. Hale.       Mr
Manning sits to my left.

      THE CORONER:    I beg your pardon.   Forgive me. please, both
of y o u .

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I have no submissions.  It is entirely a
matter for you having regard to the breadth or depth which you
consider appropriate for this particular Inquest.

     MR. MANNING:   Sir, I have exactly similar comments as far
as my client is concerned.

     MISS SINCLAIR:     I have no submissions on this matter, sir.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   I add to that.  The matter is entirely for
you. You are the best person, having read all the evidence, to
make that judgment, and no doubt that was the reason we had, as
you have already pointed out, sir, a fairly detailed
investigation into the earlier Inquests.

     MR. CALLAGHAN:   Sir, this is not an application of which I
have had previous notice, and which in the circumstances of the
application is some surprise to me. All I think I should, sir,
is this is not the time and place for some sort of Public Inquir>
into the activities of the Ambulance Service and the Emergency
Services, and it is not appropriate to bring such a matter into

                    MR. KING:          S ir,    t h a n k you f o r     th a t...
                                                             20




         MR. KING:   Thank you for that.   Can I raise a
 separate matter, sir, which is not connected with the issue
 ° k -Ck      u    is connected with the issue of 50 pages
 which you have referred to?                         pages

      THE CORONER:   I was not saying that as a criticism.

           KIN5 :. ?ot at a11/ sir.      One only has to state
the number of families whom I represent to know that.
Sir, a number of the families have raised specific
questions relating to the summaries which were put before
you in their individual Inquests.        I just give one
example, sir; in the case of No. 13, Jonathan Owens, you
 h       ®       y    Ve a Particular concern as to the timinq
when thea.r son came to the ground and a particular concern
 ? r faCJ             the summary suggests he joined the crowd
            t o . ^ ree yhen, in fact, they point out to you
   f   ® positive video evidence shows they were standina
not having joined the crowd at all, round about ten to or
eight minutes to three.        I put that as an example.

     Are you willing, sir, to go through those individual
questions “ not now - and indicate at some stage, perhaps
even in writing to us, whether or not you would be prepared
to reopen those individual Inquests to deal with those -
may be small points in the whole but to the individual
families - important points of factual errors which seem to
have crept in by reference to positive evidence whicn can'~
now be laid before you?

     THE CORONER:   My recollection of the papers is that
     affected very few or where I feel it is justified.    I
think those two things go together.   As I say, I have not
    fu“ lcient time to study it in detail but if I were to
think there was a genuine error and that that error was
actually relevant - the incident which you have given me
indicates with respect to the family it is an anxiety to
them - but the crucial point is not whether he was standing
in a crowd or whether he was standing aside but where was
he or at least at what time was he still outside the
ground?   One has to ask the question, does it actually aet
us any further forward?

     MR. KING:   May I just interpose to say that the
example I gave was directed as much to the timings outside
the ground in fact.

     THE CORONER:   If we have made a mistake, and we will
be checking that...

     MR. KING:   I am obliged.
                                                             21




       THE CORONER:    When points have been made of actual
error we have been trying to check.      If we agree Sith
them, as Mr. Fraser and some of the others will remember,
we ^ a v e made from time to time a£ hoc amendments when
points of error were pointed out to us.      I am not averse
to that, not in principle anyway, and if it helps somebody
by clarifying something then I will be pleased to do so but
I would not want necessarily to spend endless time on
clarifying minutiae which, in the final analysis, do not
matter so far as the Jury are concerned.      I am sure you
accept that.

     MR. KING:   I understand that, sir, but I am sure when
families are supplied with an "agreed" summary and they see
matters which are of great concern to them which appear to
be incorrect then obviously they are desirous that that
should be rectified as quickly as possible.

     THE CORONER:      I take it none of you have any adverse
comments on that?

     MR. KING:   What I am going to suggest is that those
instructing me extract from those documents which do
confuse two issues, those which are directed specifically
to individual questions and they can be then sent to you in
a more orderly manner which enables us the more quickly to
obtain help from you.

     THE CORONER:   That would be very helpful indeed
because then we would really know what we are looking at
and what we have got to concentrate on.

     MR. KING:      Yes, sir.

     THE CORONER:     Are there any other comments from
anybody?

     MR.   ISAACS:   Yes, sir.   I just wondered how we are
going to   deal with these matters.   I know that you started
with Mr.   King and I thought probably what you would do is
run down   the line so to speak.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, we will do that.     Have you got
any submissions to make?

     MISS HAMPTON:   I have no submissions raised by Mr.
King, though he has raised one particular matter which
concerns the City Council with regard to the agreed summary
of facts.   They have been through the proposed summary
prepared for today's hearing and there areone or two
matters, they have instructed me on, which concerns them,
sir.
                                                         22




      THE CORONER:   I think I will be able to short circuit
this submission. You will recollect, ladies and gentlemen,
at the business meeting a suggestion was made that we
should try and extract various paragraphs out of Lord
Justice Taylor's Report as an agreed statement.    I was not
particularly enamoured of the view and for some reason
which at the moment I cannot account for I forgot to
mention at the meeting that we were actually in the process
of preparing what we thought was an actual non-
con troversial, entirely neutral, account of various
activities which we hoped it.would be possible to put to
the Jury so that they had an underlying base on which one
could build the edifice, so to speak.

     In the events which have happened, we have heard from
most of you, if not all, but whilst quite a lot of you have
actually come back and said that you are reasonably happy
with the summary there have been quite a number of you who
have had substantial points of criticism to make with
regard to the content.   Unfortunately some of these points
- and I do not think I am criticising anybody and I am not
going to name any names either - were not made until Friday
or even later.   When I say Friday, I mean Friday late
afternoon.   I have come to the conclusion that we are not
going to use these summaries at all.   We will build, if
that is the right word, what we need as we go along.

     I mention that now, and I will mention it when the
Jury are here, but what we are going to do is that we have
got some two dozen slides which we are going to show.
They are shots of the ground from the air and so on in
order to give the Jury some idea of what we are talking
about and then we will just build the evidence on it as far
as is necessary for the purposes of the Inquest.   I think
that probably deals with your poin£.   I know that many of
you thought it was a jolly good idea but in the event it
has not worked out.   I thought it was a jolly good idea as
well which is why I intended to do it but I would rather
not.   Some of the points which were made, I could see what
was being said and some were very good, but I would rather
not have anything which people were not entirely happy on.
Some of you might feel you have been pushed because you
have been asked to agree to something.   If you are not
happy with the evidence, that is another matter altogether.
I take no responsibility for what the witnesses say.    We
have to accept the evidence that is given.   Are there any
other submissions you want to make, Miss Hampton?

    MISS HAMPTON:   No, thank you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Hr. Hale, what about you?

          t?J tUr5 over the page again to what would be 726 the
left-hand side of the page at D. Again, after a review of'the
authorities. Lord Justice Roskill says:

             It cannot, I think, be right in these cases for
           tne court to attempt a quantitative assessment of
           tne probability one way or the other of the risk
           of proceedings ultimately being taken, and then
           to seek to draw the line one way where the
           probabilities in the view of the court are
           thought to be more or less evenly balanced and
           the other where the balance is more disparate.
           It is not for the court to resolve problems of
           this kind by calculating odds.   I think that the
           right question to ask is that posed by Shaw LJ; can
           exposure to the risk of penalties (or in other cases t.
           the risk of prosecution for a criminal offence) be
           regarded as so far beyond the bounds of reason as to b-
           no more than a fanciful possibility?”

In fact, later on Lord Justice Shaw said exactly that.

     Could I ask you to turn from that case to part 7 of the
folder you have been handed, because the case ended up in the
         Lords* where as I say the Court of Appeal’s view was
upheld as were the dicta of the Master of the Rolls and the
learned Lord Justices.  It is interesting to note when the Hou^e
of Lords dealt with the case what was said in relation to this
                1^formation already being in the possession of,
    us call them in the context of this case, the prosecuting
authorities.  I anticipate you are lacking in numbers again. If

that part of the case as to what was held by their Lordships,     i
would draw your attention to (ii) starting with "The RTZ
companies” .


          "(ii) The RTZ companies were entitled to claim the
          privilege from the production of documents given by s
          14(1) of the 1968 Act notwithstanding that the
          commission had knowledge of the cartel and had not
          taken any action in respect of it, for if the document*
          were produced under the letters rogatory the RTZ
          companies would be exposed to a greater risk of
          proceedings being brought against them by the
          commission for recovery of a fine than they were
          exposed to at present, since production of the
          documents might authenticate and support the existing
          information in the hands of the commission and afford
          conclusive proof of a breach by the RTZ companies of
          the prohibition against cartels, and might cause the
          commission to decide to take action against the RTZ
          companies” .

So, sir, we have there the House of Lords dealing with the point
that may be raised in this case as to the decision that has been
taken by the Director in this case, but who knows what will
happen in the future.

     Could you then turn four pages on to what would be page 445
between B-C, still the speech of Lord Wilberforce. He says at C

          "I base that conclusion in part on evidence which was
          before and considered by the High Court and the Court
          of Appeal and in part on the proposition that the
          tendency to expose to a penalty would be increased if
          the documents in question were to be validated and
          connected with the RTZ companies by sworn evidence,
          as opposed to being, as they are now, pieces of paper
          found in a file".

Sir, it won't have escaped you the difference between, albeit th«
evidence that was given before Lord Justice Taylor was all taken
down, it was not evidence that was given on oath, but of course
the evidence before you would be given on oath.

     Then, sir, could you turn another six pages, pages 456 and
457.  "To give any evidence". This is the speech of Viscount
Dilhorne. between G-H, and you appreciate, sir, I am only pickin:
those parts which are germane to this matter:

          "Secondly, it was argued that the discovery of the
          document would not in the circumstances tend to expose
          the RTZ companies to such proceedings". (That is for a
          penalty)  "it was said that as the commission had
          knowledge from the ’Friends of the Earth’ documents fo
          a considerable time of the existence of the cartel and
          had taken no action, there was no real risk of such
          proceedings if the documents in the possession of the

                                                                  i
                                                            33




          RTZ companies were disclosed".


Then he deals with the arguments and reference to certain
authority.

     If you could move to page 457, the right-hand side, between
C-D, and he refers to what was said by Lord Denning in the Court
of Appeal to which I have just referred you. he says:

          "With these observations I respectfully agree.   It was
          suggested that the reasoning in the Triplex case had
          reduced the burden which formerly lay on a person
          claiming privilege but I do not think that that is the
          case.  In his judgment du Parq LJ reviewed the earlier
          cases and based his conclusions on them. Lord Denning
          MR contrasted a real and appreciable risk with a remote
          or insubstantial one, and once it appears that the risl
          is not fanciful, then it follows that it is real. If
          it is real, then there must be a reasonable ground to
          apprehend danger, and. if there is, great-latitude is
          to be allowed to the witness and to a person required
          to produce documents.

          If the RTZ companiesare compelled to produce the
          documents which they were asked to produce, I
          cannot reach the conclusion that it would be
          fanciful to suppose that that would expose them to
          no greater risk than at present of proceedings for
          the recovery of a penalty being brought against
          them.  The documents might well authenticate and
          support the information now in the hands of the
          commission” .

So what the learned Law Lord is saying, sir, in my submission,
that even though the Commission nad evidence before it which the>
had decided to take no action on, the production of these
documents, the production of additional information, may well be
sufficient to cause them to take a different view.

     There is just one further part I would ask vou to look at.
and that is in the speech of Lord Diplock. Page 465 on the
right-hand side of a page which begins, "The privilege claimed b:
the RTZ companies". Could you go to the right-hand side, sir. a-
B:

          "I do not think that your Lordships are entitled to
          dismiss as fanciful the risk that if the documents
          relating to the cartel were produced at the trial in
          the Virginia proceedings and came, as they then would,
          into the public domain, the resulting publicity in tni:
          sensitive political field might result in pressure on
          the commission to take against the RTZ companies
          speedier and severer action than they might otherwise
          have done".

      offence had been committed and that for other
      verdicts (except an open verdict) they had to be
      satisfied on the balance of probabilities
      Furthermore, when directing a jury on
      manslaughter comprising unlawful killing alleqed
      to have occurred because of neglect on the ptlt
      of police, the coroner was required to direct the
      jury on four matters..."

I pause there.     My submission is this, against the
background of the submission I have already made, namely
that any question which Mr. 'Duckenfield was asked wSSfd
have the tendency to incriminate that in relation to those
four matters that the Divisional Court referred to if anv
         n    asked of     Duckenfield which touches#upon anv
jj ^ e s e four matters, or of any of the four ingredients of
the first matter to which the Divisional Court refers
there will be a tendency to incriminate him in the verv
nature of the question itself because these are Questions
which would be directed to the possible commission of a
criminal offence.     Those matters are these:

     "...firstly that they had to be satisfied, on the
     evidence, of four ingredients, namely (a) that
     the police were under a duty to have regard to
     the health and welfare of the deceased..."

So any question to Mr. Duckenfield as to his duty in
                spectators at Hillsborough, or those who
tragically died, would require an answer which would have a
tendency to incriminate.  It continues:

     "...(b) that in the circumstances there was a
     failure to do what should have been done for the
     health and welfare of the deceased..."

       question asked of Mr. Duckenfield as to what he did
or did not do that day which touched upon the health and
welfare of the deceased would be a question which would
require an answer which would tend to incriminate him    It
goes on:                                              *

     "...(c) that the failure amounted to a
     substantial cause of death..."

So any question asked of him - of course this is only a
privilege of self-incrimination - as to causation between
what he did and any death or deaths, or the deaths of those
who died in general terms, would be a question which would
tend to incriminate, that is, the answer would tend to
incriminate and:

 on that particular question Mr. Duckenfield or oerhaos
 myself saying, "Sir, I object to answering thltoueStion
 I rely on privilege".     The risk of prejudice s o f!! 12 the
 Jury is then concerned is overwhelming both in so far as
 Mr. Duckenfield is concerned and indeed the position so far
 as the South Yorkshire Police themselves as a body are
 territory) |an<^ here 1 intrude a little on to Mr. Payne's

       One can perhaps, no matter how carefully you are
          9 '*Sfe the difficultY that would be in the mind of
the Jury if to every question the position of privilege is
claimed. They would be bound to think, "What h a s this man
1° L I Z  Itir    Y?U ' silF'.know    «y learned colLagilfs and
I know, that such a privilege is said not to be taken
against a man but lay people and lawyers are quite
different and there comes a time when they say to
bofnnei^%KTheJe-,iS somethin9 funny here. MyWe concern
being told the whole truth and whatever".
                                                are not
                                                        is
that even in the asking of a question that may be
disallowed by you there will be sufficient in the question
to prejudice the Jury against either Mr. Duckenfield or
orners•

. . 1 c°me back to the point I made earlier about the line
being drawn.   Everything at the moment is above the line.
I am concerned there should be nothing below the line which
may prejudice Mr. Duckenfield.    May I go back to the
analogy you drew as to the straightforward case of the
reckless driver and the fatality?

     1 « * H ° f pate that it would be your practice - let us
               interview had taken place - that the driver had
relied upon his right not to answer any questions, as has
taken place m this case so far Mr. Duckenfield was
concerned, and you would not in those circumstances with
the driver facing the possibility of prosecution say to the
             U must a°swer these questions as to what you did
and what you thought" etc.      You would not expect the driver
to answer those questions in those circumstances. Mr.
Duckenfieid is in exactly the same position.

     It may be said that Mr. Duckenfield is such an
important participant in the events of that day that
without him what is the point of going on at all but in my
submission that would be misconceived because the privilege
is only against self-incrimination. There are many, many
people, both police officers and civilians who can give
evidence as to the facts and the factual decisions that Mr.
Duckenfieid took on that day and so the Jury will not in
a*y ”aY be deprived of the opportunity of hearing about
what happened. They would just be deprived of not being
told by Mr. Duckenfield.

            I come back again to the point that I made at fho

    further - that if it be felt necessary by you? and both you
    and I know, sir, that there are no PACE statements or

    something about what Mr. Duckenfield said about the day

    tnat I put this - I have no complaint with what Mr.
    Duckenfieid said to the Taylor Inquiry going before the
    Jury. I say that because that is all above the line as
    opposed to anything new below the line.

          That has already been considered by the Director and
^ S ° nSurn iS t h ,a t t h e r e i s so m eth in g e l s e .     «   may“ e

the last occasion to, cross-examine Mr. Duckenfield or

those circumstances that seeking to protect Mr.

my submissions, sir.

t   i?HE CwR2NER,:  Can 1 ^ust ma*e two small points before
I call anybody else? Perhaps it was my fault, I do not
recollect, but if I instanced an RTA where the driver was
reckless then I made a mistake because if a driver had been
reckless he would have been charged with causing death by

have to say that considering what questions may be raised,
and considering tnose criteria which have been put before
you as to the sorts of questions which clearly have to be
in tne mind, and have to be enquired into, if those are
tne questions whicn normally would be asked and there is
   e Jule and the law, and that is what we, and you, sir.

 made by my learned friend, Mr. Isaacs, and indeed, I have
 no other submissions to make at this stage.

      MR. CATCHi’OLE:   Sir, can I say., on behalf of t*ie
 Officers of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, that we
 came nere prepared and expecting to see every witness
 called to give evidence, subject to the normal rules, and
 indeed, as I hope has been made clear, we areanxious to
 help throughout.   I would like, however, toreserve ray -
 position in the light of any ruling you may make. If the
 senior Police Officers are not going to be giving evidence
 at this inquiry naturally that is something I would like
 to have the opportunity of discussing with my clients.    I
 cannot predict what the outcome will be of that a n d i f
 n ecessary I w i l l make an a p p l i c a t i o n a t r i a ? « ’ s?a»„

      And we will then reproduce it as an amended version,  it
      you a visual impression of where the people were when last
      seen alive on the visual evidence.  Put the other one up now
      Please. - a . This plan is DRG.10.                     P now*

Q. That will be C.276.

          THE CORONER:   Members of the Jury, the purpose of this
     is just to give you an impression where the people were to
     save you looking at 95 individual plans:

O. That is right, is not it? -       a   . That is right.

O. it does not have 95 spots on it because we did not find
   everybody on the visual evidence? - A. That is right, sir.
   Finally, as I have already stated, the events outlined in thi*
   statement are not actually in chronological order, and to
   assist with this particular aspect a schedule has been
                  has been referenced SB.l, which seeks to place
   schedule    events into chronological order. I produce that


°*        Wf     5hat on an overhead as well, perchance? - A. I
     understand the quality is not....

O. It is too difficult to read.          C.277.

     ^ ^       K*NG:      Would it be possible to have photocopies of


          JHE CORONER:       We will do that.     Tomorrow morning you
     will have them.

           THE WITNESS:     Sir, that completes my evidence.

          THE CORONER:    What we are trying to.do with that
     schedule Is to pick out some of the major events. You have
     given us an awful lot of detail which is useful, but that
     Picks out' some of the n a jor events In chronological order as
     to the outside of the ground and to the inside? - A. That is
     right, sir, and where there is an "E", that is estimated time


          THE CORONER:   It is supposed to be an aide memoire so i
     somebody says, "What time did that gate open?” , we can tell.
     It is difficult to follow because there are so many numbers,
     but basically he was telling us events which he and his team
     found either on photographs or videos, and relating to variou
     things, when you see the schedule it will be shorter. We
     will have them available tomorrow morning.

                     Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

 O. You referred at a point about quarter-of-the-way through vour
    evidence, to a photograph taken by a photographer called
    Warburton Lee. I just did not get the reference. - a The

°*           ?0R0NER;   Can you point? - A. It is the second set
     of perimeter gates as you look from the ground side towards
     Leppings Lane;

             put t*ie overhead on. Show us which one it is?
     (Indicated) - A. That is right, sir, the second set of
     perimeter gates from the ground side towards Leppings Lane
     Exactly where Mr. Brown is pointing.
0. That is c .254.

                     Cross-Examined bv MR. Is a a c s -

O. Mr. Layton, could you help me with just a number of matters
   How many People in your team? - A. It varied initially from*a
   its height I think 12 to as a norm an average of 6.

O. Let us put to one side for a moment the accumulation of the
   evidence.  I am only concerned with the looking at the
   evidence, particularly of the video evidence, and you have
   told us something of your observations, and when 1 say ’•you"
   mean you and your team, of, for example, outside and then
   inside the ground of certain parts of different videos. Coult
   you help me with this against that background. Taking, for
   example, what was seen on the videos Inside the ground, fur
   example, the BBC film that was being taken, in order to
   produce the observations which you have produced how long
   approximately would the film have been looked at for? I don'
   want it 5 minutes, 10 minutes. How many hours? - a .
   Countless. The process was never ending. I think it would b
   fair to say every time you view a video you see something
   else, because there are so many images on the screen that it
   is not possible to take them all in at one viewing.    It was a
   continual process right M p to the time of the limited
   Inquests.  Indeed. I have no doubt since then it has continue
   as well, albeit on a more limited scale.

Q. So could you help us, have you done any of the watching
   yourself? - A . I have done some of it, 'yes.

Q. But are we talking about a video, for example, inside the
   ground where you tell us that certain things were taking
   pl^ce, being watched over 20 hours or 40 hours or 100 hours o
   more than that? - a . It would be impossible to put a figure o
   it. a s I said at the beginning, the initial process after
   retrieving the original video tapes, was to copy them.

             a" un'fi*e comment, bearing in mind that we are
    Judlce here and it is a matter for this court, or my

others will refer to and that is the question aa to whether

is certainly one aspect of the matter.

'       PAUL WILLIAM CARLILE


        1.   Paul Carlile the        son and brother respectively             of the

             Applicants Sandra Stringer and             Donna Carlile was born

             on 8th August, 1969, and was 19 years old when he died

             at Hillsborough football ground on 15th April, 1989.



    2.       He went to the stadium ■ in the company of friends, but

             it is not     known whether he was in            their company when

             he took up a     position inside the stadium in enclosure

             3.

                    *
             During the course       of the mini inquest          the jury heard

             from Professor     Usher that          in his    view the     cause of

             death was     traumatic asphyxia.           The death       would t w e

             been   painless as      he    would     have fallen        unconsci   jus

             within 10     or 20 seconds          of his chest    being crushed.

             This was     followed by          the evidence of    Police Officer

             Geraldine Evans and Detective Inspector Michael Layton

             which when combined produced            the following chronology

             of events: At 2.45 p.m.              Paul Carlile was outside the

             ground near to     the perimeter gate.              Some time before

             3.03 p.m.     he climbed          over the fence from enclosure 3

             into enclosure     4.    Between        3.03 p.m.    and     3.15 p.m.

             Michael     Hollinghurst, an          off duty    nurse, found        Mr.

             Carlile lying on the          floor unconscious in enclosure 4

             whereupon    he tried        to    resuscitate him      but was       not
■Jh
  a



    ANNAAF                                 o
 successful.             He    then    moved        on       to     treat^Limbther

 casualty        after    being       told     by        a    uniformed : police

 officer to leave the terrace.                  Shortly after 3.15 p.m.

DC Goulding and DC Pont saw Paul Carlile being carried

from      the general          direction      of     the tunnel,           in    the

concourse at         the Leppings           Lane end           of the     stadium.

The      two     officers and         an    unidentified             ambulanceman

attempted to revive             him but were not                  successful.     At

4.35      p.m.    behind       the Leppings          Lane stands          Doctor'

Monaghan certified Paul Carlile dead.



The     jury also        heard directly         from Mr.             Hollinghurst
       -I »
that it        was only when          the pressure began to               ease in

enclosure 4 that he realised Paul Carlile was lying at

his feet.         He began       helping him and'another                  man who

was unconscious           a few feet         away*           Eventually    he was

told that it was time             for him to leave the enclosure/

and he did this through a hole in the perimeter fence.

He recollected           two ambulancemen            had arrived          to take

over     from     him     in     the       attempts            to    resuscitate

casualties.



The Applicants submit that much important evidence was

not put        before the       jury thus       depriving them             of the

opportunity properly to consider                     what happened.             Much

of this        evidence was       also relevant               to the     issue of
whether death was aggravated by lack of caxe/' an issue

which was not left to the jury.



The evidence          that Mr. Hollinghurst gave            was markedly
                  \

different        to that       contained       in a    statement he     had

previously        made.        In this     he stated      that he     first

became aware of Paul when                he felt him climbing up his

legs.     He    was pulling himself up by               holding onto Mr.

Hollinghurst's          trousers.        Mr.    Hollinghurst        reached*

down and        took Paul's hand         and began pulling          him up.

This task       was made       difficult by        people standing       on

Paul.      He lost        Paul's hand and        so took hold       of his

hair’
    .     All    this time Paul was trying               to pull himself

up.     He was in         pain and aware        of what was     going on

around him.       This contrasts strongly with the evidence

of Dr. Usher          that Paul would have            fallen unconscious

within 20 seconds of            being crushed and would not have

been in pain.           In the statement Mr. Hollinghurst also

said that       he was     told to       leave the      enclosure by      a

policeman or ambulanceman on the grounds that he could

do no more.       However the        person who told him to leave

did not       himself check       Mr.     Carlile      to see   if there

were    any     signs     of    life,     before      instructing     some

supporters to         carry him to        the back of      the terrace.

The Applicants submit that this evidence was extremely

important and possibly indicated that Mr. Hollinghurst
      was given insufficient time           to attempt to resuscitate

      Mr. Carlile.



7.    There was    a ,discrepancy between PC Evans account of
                     I
      the    activities of DC Goulding and DC Pont and DC
                                                                    •       ••
                                                                *

      Gouldii-Tg's own account.          This account, contained in a

      statement he had        made, was to the effect         that he was

      initially on his own with           Paul Carlile.     He then left

      him in    order to      see what     his colleagues     were doirig

      after which he returned to him          with DC Pont.             DC Pont

      then left and returned to him with an ambulanceman.



8.    The Applicants       were informed by West      Midlands Police

      Officers that Paul       Carlile was the first          casualty to

      have been taken       off the terraces.       This matter never

      came out at the inquest.           They are deeply concerned by

      the    fact   that he    was   left     in   the area     and        only

     certified dead at 4.35 p.m.            They feel .that he should

      have been one of the first persons to have been placed

      in an ambulance and taken to hospital.              They were also

     informed that Dr. Monaghan           had requested the use of a

     machine when      he was attending       to Mr. Carlile.              This

     possibly indicates that he believed that he could only

     be     certain that    Paul Carlile      was dead      or alive         by

     using such a machine        or that alternatively efforts to

     save Paul may have        been successful had a machine been

     available.

          the evidence       of Dr.   Glynn Phillips, Dr.      John Ashton

          and Mr.   F. Eccleston       been put   before the     tribunal,

      there would have been            sufficient material for them to
                         %

      consider whet'her to return a verdict that the death of

      Paul Carlile was aggravated by lack of care.

        ITi. FHAS'SU: Sir, the evidence you aro G’oinS to
licE-.r now relates to r-nul Villiam Carlilq. Sir, Paul's
mum is within the precincts of the building but would
rather not hear the pathological evidence so will come
in, as it were, halfway through the hearing.      haul's
stepfather and two sisters and aunt are present in
Court, sir# Sir, the practico that represents them
is a member of my Group and I, therefore, appear in the
usual guise this norninj as their agent through the
Steering Conjnittee •

     tie ; COnCIiEr.:      You, sir, are the stepfather, is
that right?

      UTJl’FATI^il:       Yes.

     OTB COROIHSRs   Just so T. know who I am looking at.
Vhich are the tiro sisters? Ilight.

        Can I just explain to you, before we begin, so to
•speak, the procedure so that you know what is coning.
 You havo probably already been told, in the circumstances,
 but very very briefly I ar.i going to read the evidence
 which I took right at the beginning last year in April,
 in fact, the 19 th, and then, when I havo done that, I
 cm (joing to toll you what the blood alcohol levels
 were and then ve will listen to Prof. Usher who will
 tell us about the pathology. I think I will pause then,
 I-jr. Fr.-.sor, so that ve can allow Paul's mum to come back
 if she winhos. ’..lien wo aro all settled again, g o to sponlc,
 tlso presenting Officers of tlio Vest Midlands 1 olice will
 present the evidence which they have summarised for me
 and Inspector Layton will dor.1 with the visual side of
 the evidonce. lie will describe it, first of all. There
 is not, I think, in fact, very much visual evidence,
 is there, in this particular instance?

     IIJSriSCTOn LAYTON:          There is, sir.       Some of it is
not confirmed.

      Tffii CORONER: Anyway, he will describe it. You may
fini that bit a little bit confusing. Do not bo too
worried about that because, in a moment, after he has
described it, ho comes round here and, as far as ho is
able, ho shov/s us on these big plans what he has boon
talking about and then it falls into place somewhat
better.
                        This then is a rosu.i.ioo Inquest which vns opnnecl on

                   *3.   Prof. Usher, you aro a Horae Office Pathologist and
                         l’rof. of Forensic Ilodicino here in Sheffiold, is
                         that right? - A, Yos.

                   r‘. Prof. Usher, you tire going to tell me about a nan by
                       tho name of Paul William Carlile and what number did
                       we .... ~ A. 73» sir.

                   •'». That is ric?it, yos.    Can you tell nie then, please? -


H «rph»m H°d                        (if
A. The bp<1y I examined was that of a heavily-built,
dark-haired young, v/liito nalo, 171 cr.is in height and
weighing 00 kgs. The typical signs of traur:atic
asphyxia vore present both externally and internally.
There was sotr.c swelling of the brain which is, again,
not unccrnnon in traumatic asphyxia, and occasional
pctechinl haemorrhages on the liuijs. The her.rt weighed
about ^no gracs and that is slightly enlarged but I
am quite certain that heart disease played 110 part
in bringing about this nan's deatli.

I.’e will cone back to the heart in a moment. - A. In
fact, I {jive his cause of death as traumatic asphyxia.
I real l y believe that he had an average expectation of
life for his ago.

Yott do, because I think you said there was slight
particular hypertrophy, which is thickening, and you
also nention, I notice, that the valve seemed a little
bit dilated? - A. Vos, it did. I do not know this
man's occupation so ....

A plasterer. - A. l.’cll, that is fairly heavy muscular
work and it nay well be that this slight enlargement
of his heart was, in fact, due to work hypertrophy of
his heart.

So what you aro saying is nothing to worry about,
ccrtainly nothing for tho family to worry about - this
is not a genetic matter which they need to bo concerned
about for themselves? - A. No, not at all.

That is really what I vantod to bo quite certain about
in ny mind. - A. Yos.

     Mr. Fraser?

                    ny   mu.   FRASER:

Prof. Usher, can you offer some reassurance to the
family about the tinescale for this type of injury
in torms of the time that you think it may havo taken
for Taul to lose consciousness once the crushing that
wo havo hoard about actually started to tako place? -
A. Yes, the reason for Paul's death was that his
chest was held so tightly that he could not breathe
in or out and, ..once that had happened, then he would
have been unconscious in a matter of seconds, between
10-20 seconds. He would have died within a few
m inutes but at the time, of course, subsequent to
his unconsciousness, he would not have been aware of
any pain.

     TIIlS C0110IJ15R: Can you check that the family got
that because it is so important that people shovdd
appreciate it.

     HR. FllASER:        Yes, thank you.

      Hello, Mrs. Stringer. Ve will call the Ivest
 Midlands Police Officer, I think.

        O F F I C E OBTIALDIN3 ELIZABETH 2VAXS Called;

                          liY TP1H CO^GNJ^i

 '.Hion you are ready vdLll you introduce yourself and
 take rae throu>jh the summary, please? — A. I am
 Geraldine Elizabeth 25vans, ail Officer of the West
 Midlands Police.

Yes, tell me what you have summarised in this case,
please? - A. At about 0930 hours on Saturdav, 15th
April ....

I am sorry, not what you have summarised, what has
been summarised would bo more accurate, I tliiric ? -
A. At 0930 hours on Saturday, 15th April, 198?, &**•
1-aul ‘Jilliaiu Carlile, together with a Mr. laul Darren
JHiri-ay and Mr. Ian Joseph Ford, left Liverpool and
travelled by train to Slieffield in order to vatch
the FA Cup Semi Final football match which was due
to be held at the Ilillsboroti^I* Stadium that day.

Upon their arrival in Sheffield they boarded a bus
which took then to the Loppings Lane end of the
Stadium, arriving at about 1230 hours. They met up
with other friends and sat on a wall outside the
ground whilst they had refreshments.

Shortly afterwards Paul went off on his own stating
that ho was going to a nearby public house in order
to try to swop his terrace ticket for a scat ticket.

At about 1340 -hours a Mr. Paul Patrick William Nagle
was outside the Stadium in Leppings Lane when he
saw Paul who was in the company of Mr. Carl David
Lewis. Mr. Nagle arranged to soe the other two men
later inside the ground. In fact, this is the last
time Hr. Naglo saw either man again.

That was at 13^0, was it not, I thinlc you said? -
A. Yes.  Shortly after 1515 hours and following the
sovoro crushing in the «est Stand terracing,
Coulding and DC 1'ont entered the Stadium via Gate
C rcict sav: a p'vji who they nov Icno" to be Paul
Cfrlile being carried l*ror<i the general direction of
the tunnel on the West Stand concourse* Together
with an ambulanceman, who has not boon identified,
the officers attempted to revive faxil but without
succoss, The persons carrying Paul have not been
identified.

A Michael Thomas Uollingjnxrst, an off duty nurse,
     a spectator at tl?e natch and was in Ten ^ at the
v p .5
Lepp5.njs Lane ond of the ground when lie became aware
of the increasing pressure being exerted on lain by
the crowd* After boinj subjected to this pressure
for i\ppro::inatcly 15 M inutes, 1‘r* Ilollinghxirst became
aa/rre of. a space being created around him, and on
looking dovm to the floor of the terracing, ho saw a
p.an he now lenows to bo Paul William Carlile. Mr.
oollinghm'st sav that Paul was blue in-the face and,
on not detecting a pulse, he triod to resuscitate him
by heart massage and nouth to mouth resuscitation,
prul failed to respond to the emergency treatment and
Mr, Ilollinghurst then moved on to treat another
casualty.

Can I just stop you? This is very late information,
is it not? - A. That is correct.

And I thirfc, strictly chronologically, this should
have come before the paragraph about Detectivo
Constables Ooulding and Pont because that is still
within the terraces? - A, Yes,

That is ri.3ht, is it not? - A, Yes,

Just so t'-»at wo get the order right, - A, At 1635
hours Dr, David Monaghan examined Taul at the rear
of t: o West Stand and pronounced life extinct,

Shortly thereafter DC Goulding accompanied the body
of Taul to the gymnasium -where a temporary mortuary
had been set \ip.

Thin Officer later escorted the body of Paul to the
Medico I.egal Centre where he confirmed the
identification .to DC Weigold.

At approrcimately 0300 hours on Sunday, 16th April,
19«9, Hr. George lerJ:e identified the body of his
nophev to Detective Constable Wallace at the Medico
1.0gal Goutf*c,

On Monday, 17th April, 1f3o, following an identification
by Dotcctive Constable Weigold, Prof, Alan Ur.her
carried otit an autopsy and submitted a report giving
cause of death.

               Q, Vic'. that one because tliey ure all, 1 toko it, fairly

                   Sir, the photograph I have referred to on the plan is

                   X will confirm the time, Sir, that photograph is

                   again the person that the girls believe is Paul is
                   shovm on that video. All those identifications
                   actually arc in jSnclosure no, h apart from the first
                   one.
               A
               *• 3‘f I can just stop you there because at this point I
                  soeu: to remember hccausc every effort had been made
                  but this was still just tho start cuid this was one
                  of the casos where wo thought it was Enclosure k but
                  wo could not really bo certain? - A, That is right,
                  sir. In fact, ono of the points I was going to make
                  was that the subsequent evidence you will hoax- will,
                  in fact, slightly altor the figures which I cave to
                  you on the first day and perhaps I will mention it
                  in a moment.

                   Sir, in respect of the last identifications I have
                   px-epared a plan which has been given the reference
                   no, ?~.\TL 120, There is another addendum, sir. In
                   respect of -Ur, ITollinghtirst, whose evidence you have
                   already hoard about, he has viewed photographs and
                   confirms that Faul is one of tho persons that ho
                   tried to revive and he has signed a plan of tho
                   terracing indicating the position at which he treated
                   Paxil, That plan, sir, is referenced i r m / 1 , I thinlc,
                   sir, that probably covers the additional visual
                   evidence.

That vill be C221, — A. I have alroady referred to it,
sir, but in.ML 123, which is a plan of the terraces ....

That is C222, This is the one where the two young

A. Thiit is right,   Finally, sir, MTH/1, which is Mr.

all, with the identification outside and that is
li!.7JL I70. The point at which we believe Paul <■— —
well, wo lenov Paul is shown is at this point here,
the outer perimeter gates near to here. These are
the outer perimeter sates and it is din this position

     TIR CORGI33R:   Yos, -* A. Sir, in respect of the
torraco plan, this is Snclosure no. *3 and this is
Enclosure no, h and, in respect of the identification
where it appears that Paul is# as it wore, (joins from
3 to h at the dividing fence, the position that I
believe that is shown is at this point hero. In
respect of tho photographic and video identifications
actually in Enclosure no, h t as I say, on the plan
I havo referred to just one, PRT/2, but the position
shown is here, I think it is fair to say, sir, on
those photographs and tho video, I am satisfied that
Paul is probably still alive at that stage but I
cannot say at. what stage of the medical process that
you have already*heard about Paul has actually reached,

Yos, on the assumption it is Paul, the person you are
looking at? - A, That is right, sir, yes,

Tlion in rospect of tho photograjjh lmi/l, Mr,

 to thank Ilicbael I-ayton and Peter Hogan who, 7.
understand, is an Officer who assistod Inspector
Layton, sir, for their help throughout tho Inquiry.
They want to thank the two Officers, Goulding and
Pont, fox- the assistance which thoy gave to Paul on
the day, together with the ambulanceman whose nan:c has
not been traced* Sir, they want to thank Maureen Y/roe
and l>eter Hyde from Moseley Social Services and they
have been, in the family*s words, sir, a "lifeline for
us throughout the last year."     Sir, they want to thanlc
Michael IJollinghurot for trying to save Paul. They
say, "Words will never express how we feel but knowing
that he was with !*aul, we are all grateful*" Finally,
sir, they want to thank you for boing, again their
words, "so thorough and a gentleman" as you have
been throughout thoso Inquests and, in particular,
tho Inquest: into their loved one*

     THIS CCROIvET*:          That is very kind of you.        Thank
you over so much*            T/hich is Donna?

      I thinlc I have told you, ladies and gentlemen,
that there are very fow families that I have the
opportunity of speaking to but I have spoken to you,
in fact, and I have probably spoken to Michelle as
well but I did not know who you were at the time.
So you arc one of the few families whom I have had an
opportunity to speak to and it is very good of you to
say nicc things•about roe. I appreciate it very much*
I appreciate it even more that you have said nice
things about the Officers, in fact, I thinl-: they are
both in Court, and, of course, all the other people
who you liavo mentioned and who we have heard about*
I must say that I was very pleased that we managed
to get the evidence from Mr* Hollinghurst because
not only does it help with the technical problems as
to whore he was, it is the fact that he was a nurse __—
okay, ho did not succeed in reviving Paul but at least
you have the comfort that fairly immediately after
tho incident there was somebody who was aclfetijilly near
.’.-.ill dftinj his best and that is soino encouraccncnt and
fill crcf.it to hi::i raid all croclit to you for r.clznovl eel"in
it. T I v u ik you vory tnicli indeed,    *                    °

      T :m« - in a sonso I nn just ocho.in'j what you hrve
 said - very very conscious in all Inquests but the
only one I an* thinlvinj about at tho moment is this one.
thinking *ibout i;ml, I an vory very conscious how
greatly loved people r.ro who uo hoar nbcut end today,
at the nor.iont, we have heart! about Paul end I would like
you to Icnov how much we fool for you an<l for you, Mrs,
otrinjor, a very hard tine for you and I am sorry that,
if you like, we have added upset to you this morning
but you are here, you have £ot your family, and they
will support you, I am quite sure.

      The last point is I am exceedingly sorry that you
had tho delay because, of course, that would have added
to your stress today. It was not anybody*s fault but
there is nothing I can do about, I an very sorry that
it hr.ivpcned to you today, /oiyway we waited because wo

    pin you down to say if there were 22 - an approximate
    percentage   of the total crowd that you saw in your
    judgement?   - A. Of people who were talking to the
    ground who were actually drinking?

Q. I think you got to Leppings Lane at about 2.25? - A
      Yes, an approximate time.

°* X U h J S ®  likv outside? - A. We immediately made
   f           r®   e turnstiles were and there were a
   few hundred or maybe a thousand or so people already
   around the turnstile area.                          7

Q. When you say the turnstile area do you mean the
      actual turnstile area or the area outside the
      perimeter gates? - a . The area that actually leads
      down towards the turnstile.

Q. Had you been there before? - A. The previous year.
Q. So you had been there before? - A. Yes.

Q. So there were about 500 to 1,000 people? - A. Makino

Q. That is the turnstiles A to G? - A. I think that is
   the area we went down to, yes.

Q. That is     the area where the people were? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see any mounted Officers or anybody else? -
   A. I noticed in particular one mounted Officer who I
   had seen several times outside Liverpool's ground.

Q. Where was he? - A. He was in that area.

Q. Did you see what he was doing, if anything? - A. He
   was trying to get some kind of order/ people to queue
   in some kind of order.

Q. Why did he not succeed? - A. There were already a
   mass of people. There would be no particular queues.
   There didn't appear to me at that stage to be anybody
   sectioning people into queues which is the kind of
   arrangement I am used to when I go to football
   matches at Liverpool certainly.

Q. Because the configuration at Liverpool is completely
   different, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q. Was there any pushing? - A. As I say, there was no
   order at all and so there were no orderly queues and
   there didn't seem any facility for making any orderly
   queues.- People were just sort of massed in what was
   really a small area trying to get through a few
   turnstiles.

Q.   Did you      see anybody distressed? - A. Yes.

Q.    In that area I am talking about? - A. Yes,becoming
     more so over the next few minutes.

Q.    Why was    that? - A. The crush got more andmore.We
     arrived and more and more people were arriving behind
     us and so the numbers we are talking about originally
     obviously were swelled by the people arriving behind
     us.
Q. Did you feel anybody pushing you? - A. Everybody was
   being pushed. It got to the stage where there was a
   crush of people and, in fact, some people were
   distressed and trying to make their way back out of
   the crush outside the turnstiles.

Q. You did not take that course? - A. No.

Q. Does that mean you were not particularly
   distressed? - A. Yes, I was quite frightened at that
   stage actually as most people around me were, you
   know.

                                        M. T. HOLLINGHURST


Q. At this point, as I understand it, you could not help
   yourself any more? - A. No, as I say, I got into that
   area and people were arriving behind us and it just
   gradually got worse.

Q. Did you hear anybody making appeals for people not to
   push? - A. People were shouting all sorts of things,
   "Don't push, there are people getting hurt, there are
   people getting crushed".

Q. It made no difference? - A. No, it didn't seem to
   make any difference at all.

Q. You entered through a turnstile, is that right? - A.
   Y es.
Q. You did not see any of the big gates open, is that
   correct, or did you? — A. I didn't, no.

Q. Having got in, do you know what time it was that you
   got in by any chance? - A. Only judging by the next
   few minutes I would say between ten to and five to
   three.
Q. That is an estimate, is it? - A. That is an estimate,
   yes.
Q. You do not actually know the exact time? - A. I don't
   remember looking at the time.

Q. Having got in did you go down the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. When you got to the entry of the tunnel before you
   went down did you by chance look towards the pitch? -
   A. Through the tunnel?
Q. Yes. - A. Yes, that is what I am basing the time on
   because as we were entering the tunnel the players
   were on the pitch. The match hadn't started.

Q. We know what time that was and your time is quite
   accurate actually. At the entry of the tunnel the
   players were on the pitch. You could see them, could
   you? - A. Yes.
Q. What was the tunnel like? Was it empty, full, or
   were you able to get down it? That is what I am
   trying to find out? - A. We were getting down it.^
   There were a lot of people going down but it wasn't
   crushed. A lot of people were making their way
   through the tunnel.
Q. Before you went in you actually heard people talking.
   I think you mentioned that you heard stewards or
   somebody saying, "Plenty of room inside" or words to
   that effect? - A. Yes.
                                     M. T. HOLLINGKTIRgt*


Where was that? - A. Once we got through the
turnstile everybody thought they were out of the
worst of it because it was such a bad crush outside
and we were relieved to get through. Of the four of
us who were making their way through the turnstiles
we lost one and so the three of us were still left on
the groundside of the turnstile and we met up
together. Obviously we wanted to make our way
straight into the ground and there were stewards
around and a couple of Police Officers.  I distinctly
remember a Police Officer saying, "Make your way
straight in. There is plenty of room on the
terraces, plenty of room inside".




                            /Q. Did he point you in.

                                            M. T. HOLLINGHORST

Q. Did he point you in any direction or did he just say.
   "May your way through”? - A. Just generally.   He iust
   said, "Make your way in."

Q. He didn't point in any way.   He just said, "In lads", or
   words to that effect, "There's plenty of room"? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it said to you personally or just generally? - A. No.
   I mean, within a couple of feet of me as 1 was making my
   way.

Q. Down you went down this tunnel and you got to the other
   end of it, of course? - A. Yes.

Q. You went left or right? - A. Left.

Q. When you got on to that terrace - we call it pen 4 - tell
   me what happened and how it was? - A. Well, on the way
   through the tunnel the three of us were still together.
   Having been there the previous year, as I have said, when
   it was quite full the previous seasons we had noticed
   that the terracing to the left corner had been
   particularly empty yet where we were was crushed, the
   season before.    Even going through the tunnel, and as
   far as 1 can remember even on the way to the natch that
   day, we said we would make our way to that left terrace.

Q. That is the banked one, the high one?   - A. The left hand
   corner behind the goal.    Of course, not knowing that
   that end was penned off in separate pens. We thought it
   was all one complete terracing.

Q. So that was your objective to get... - A. Out of where it
   was crushed.

Q. You entered pen 4, however, because you were expecting to
   walk along the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. Just describe to me what that pen was like wnen you
   entered it? - A. It was quite full - well, very full, but
   nothing that I had not seen on a football terrace before.
   It was fairly fluid because we could make our way
   through, albeit it was a struggle at first for a few
   minutes.   Then it suddenly became more and more tightly
   packed by the minute really.

Q. Do you recollect when you first entered, when you said it
   was quite fluid, had the match kicked-off? - A. No.

Q. It had not? - A. No.

Q. Then you say it became tighter, that was the word you
   used.   Do you recollect what tine that was in relation
   to the match?   I am not asking you to tell me what time

                                             M. T. HOLLINGHURST


      it was, but in relation to what was going on on the
      pitch? - A. I think we are talking about around kick-off
      time that it really became oppressive and got more and
      more so in the next few minutes.

Q. The tightness, was it coming from behind you? - A. As far
   as I could gather it was coming from behind me.

Q. You had initially made your way in, as you say, andthen
   it got tighter.   Did you come to a stop? - A. I think
   what we actually did was come across the dividing fence,
   that we didn't know was there, obviously.   Then we just
   came to halt and stopped virtually where we were.

Q. Against that fence? - A. We came back in slightly and
   then...
Q. So you were able to move off the fence at that stage? -
   A. Yes.
0. Was that kick-off time or before? - A. That was just
   before kick-off time we hit that fence. Roundabout kick-
   off time we are talking about now.

0. At that point had you ever been in a situation like this
   before on the terrace? - A. No, that is when it started
   to become really frightening then because...

Q. You are saying at kick-off time it became frightening? —
   A. Yes.
Q. Up to then you had coped, so to speak? - A. Yes.   As I
   say, I have been in football crowds before but it became,
   unlike any football crowd I had ever been in before.

Q. I think you were rotated once or twice, is that right? -
   A. Certainly once, yes. At one stage I had my back
   completely to the pitch, facing upwards towards the
   stand.
Q. Did you see people being pulled up at that point? - A.
   Yes.
Q. Then did you  manage to turn round again or were youmoved
   round? - A. I just remember that...   I did get back the
   other way.    I don't know how I managed to do it.

Q. You had lost     your friends by that time? - A. Yes.

0/    What happened then?   What did you see or notice? - A.
  \   The crush got worse rather than better and after a tev
 z    minutes I was aware that somebody was on the ground right
r     by where I was standing, by where I was positioned.

Q. Was the match still in progress when you became aware of
   this or can you not remember? -A. Yes, the match was
   going on.
Q. This was in fact a young man? - A. That's right.

Q. Being a charge nurse you checked to seewhether his pulse
   was going and things like that, as soon as you could.
   A. Yes, but not at that particular moment.

Q. I realise that. - A. As soon as the crowd cleared...

Q. That is in fact   my next question.   !J0* lon§ d^dT.^% 5®ke
   before you were   able to get at this lad? - A. I really
   could not put a   timescale on it because it just seemed
   like forever*     It seemed like it was getting tighter and
   tighter and you   were fighting for your breath.     It was
   probably only a   matter of ten minutes at the moment, five
   or ten minutes.
Q. I presume the match had stopped by then? - A. By that
   stage, yes.
Q. Did you see it stop? - A. I was not aware of what was
   going on to be quite honest.

Q. Most people aren't... - A. I was not aware of when the
   match particularly stopped or when...

Q. Most people can remember bits but they do have 8r*a*
   difficulty with timing so don t be concerned about that.
   What you are saying is that the pressure eased after
   several minutes, it is difficult to say how many but
   after several minutes? - A. Yes, the pressure began to
   ease and a space*.•
0. Then you were able to get down? * A. People were in more
   and more space and that is when I actually saw someone on
   the ground below me.
Q. As I say, at that point that is when you had a look to
   see whether there was anything that could be done for
   this lad?_- A. Yes.
Q.Cln fact I tliink you came to the conclusion            *3
  Cis that right? - A. I tried, as well as the lad who was
   immediately below me.    There was somebody just a couple
   of feet further away.    He was also in the sane
   condition.
Q. So you tried for both of them? - A. Yes, I was going

p. He was the first one of the two whom you tried to help?
   - A. Yes, he was the one who was immediately next to
  -me and the one who I had been aware of originally.

Q.    Did you see any activity on the perimeter fence? - A.
     By that stage people were trying with their bare hands
     to rip the fence, you know get the fence down. That is
     what I was aware of going on around me, people were
     pulling at the fence.

Q. Were you attempting to help the lad when people were
   attempting to pull the fence down or was it earlier.
   Can you remember that? - A. From what I can remember as
   I was helping the young lad and the other fellow people
   were frantically trying to get the fence down.

Q. But it had not yet come down? - A. No, they had made
   a hole. There may have been a gate opened, I don't
   know.

Q. Would that have been at the same time as you were
   resuscitating the lad or had you already started
   resuscitation earlier? - A. Well immediately there
   was any space at all when I saw the lad under my feet.

Q.    Of course that is what you were concentrating on? -
     A. Yes.

Q. And how did you get out yourself? - A. Through a hole
   in the fence eventually.

Q. You went frontways? - A. Somebody picked me up and
   said: "It is time for you to get out yourself". By
   that time I think two ambulancemen had arrived and
   taken over from me trying to resuscitate.
                                   #
Q. Somebody had come into the pen? - A. Yes.

Q. Well I know, I think I know anyway that the family
   were very grateful that you were there with regard
   to that young man, Paul Carlisle.

           Do you remember this was the witness whom we
     discovered so to speak half way through the Inquests
     in April and May so I thought it would be good to have
     him in here.


                   Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. Mr. Hollinghurst, can you just help us a little about
   your experience in 1988 the previous semi-final. You
   gave some evidence that you had made your mind up in
   1989 that if you could you would go to a different
   place? - A. Yes.



                                                                 \

                                      M.T. HOLLINGHURST


Q. Where had you been on the terraces in 1988? - A . I think
   we were, it would probably be Pen 3, the one to the
   right of the tunnel.

Q. As you come down the tunnel ....    A. Rather than the one
   to the left, yes.

Q. And what had been your experiences in that pen in 1988
   which had led you to make the decision you had for 1989?
   - A. Well it was quite crushed. It was quite crushed
   in relation obviously to the situation that we could see
   in the corner of the pitch which is why we made the
   decision in 1989 to try and make our way in that directio

Q. I am sorry to press you a little, but when you mean
   "crushed" could you put that into perhaps a little detail
   of what it meant as far as space went of the people aroun
   you? - A. Well it was a heavy football crowd. As I said
   when I first came in 1989 it was probably still fluid but
   there were quite a lot of people in that particular area
   compared to an area which was a few yards away where
   there was nobody as far as we could see.

Q. I just want to go back to 1988 because you clearly had
   been concerned of what had happened in 1988? - A. Yes.

Q. What had been your concern? - A. I thought somebody may
   have been injured in 1988 and at half-time people were
   clambering into the Stand in 1988 during the half-time
   break out of that pen.

Q. Do you mean clambering up ....   A. They were being
   helped up into the seated area at half-time to get out
   of the standing area.

         MR. KING: Thank you. I ought to say because as
   you know I represent, or you may not know, a large
   number of the ba.reaved and injured including the
   family of the boy who you helped. Can I say also on
   behalf of them how grateful they are for what you did.
   Thank you.


               Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Hollinghurst, when you said you got to Leppings Lane
   at 2.25.did you mean right at the top of Leppings Lane
   or did that mean right by the perimeter gate? - A. No,
   we made our w a y straight down to where the entrance was.

Q. What I am trying to find out   is where you were at 2.25?
   - A. We went straight to the   turnstile area. From
   walking from the car we went   straight to the ground, we
   didn't make a stop anywhere,   we just went straight to
   the ground to get in.
                                      M:T. HOLLINGHURST



Q. How did you know it was 2.25. Why did you say that
   time? - A. That is just a rough estimate. Approximately
   2.25 judging on the events that, you know, my perception
   of the events that followed.

Q. So you are not absolutely sure about the time then? -
   A. I did not look at my watch at that particular time.

Q. What was’ it like anyway when you got to Leppings Lane,
   was it easy enough to walk right down to the perimeter
   gate? - A. Down to the area where the turnstiles was but
   as I say there were probably 500/1000 people already in
   that area. They were in that area, the immediate area
   before the turnstiles and obviously trying to get into
   the ground at that time.

Q. So the crowds were mainly congested just near the perimete
   gate, they'weren't spreading up the Lane at the time? -
   A. I don't know what you mean by the "perimeter gate"?

Q. The main gate before the turnstile area? - A. They were
   in the area that you funnelled into before the turnstiles.

         MRS. McBRIEN:   All right.    Thank you very much.


                    Further By The CORONER:

Q. 1988, do you know what time you arrived in 1988 as a
   matter of interest? - A. I could not tell    you sorry.

Q. we want you to mark the plan, want you to show us where
   you were. We are asking all the witnesses.    If you would
   walk up to the overhead. - A. Is it where I ended up?

Q. What I want you to show me, I want you to mark the positio
   where you were with a cross where you finished up near the
   lad whom you helped. Point out which is Pen 4? Before
   you mark it you had told me that you were next to the
   perimeter fence. Are you saying that you managed to move
   back off, the radial fence, you moved back off it, didn't
   you? - A. When we came to a halt in the fence we just
   stepped back inside.

         THE CORONER:    Mark it then. That is fine.

         MR. BEECHEY:    345 sir.

         THE CORONER:    Thank you.

Q. When you   got to the radial fence before you moved back
   off, was   that when kick-off had taken place or had
   kick-off   not yet taken place. I just can't remember
   what you   told me? - A. I don't think the match had kicked
   off.                        ^
                                                              57

 Q. I am sorry? - A. I was worried about how packed it
    was in 1980.

 Q. When you say very packed, I want to know which bit
    was very packed.   Are you saying that the whole of
    the terrace ^from one end to the other was packed?
    Sergeant Griffiths, can you put the ground plan up?
    This, of course, is a ground plan of 1989 but if you
    just turn round and look. Just indicate the
    terracing from one end to the other.    Ignore all
    those radial fences because you are quite right that
    they were not there. Are you saying that the whole
    of that was packed or are you saying that just a
    central section was packed? - A. When we first came
    in to the right that was less packed. As we moved
    across it was packed for a good distance.    It was not
    just the centre.   A wide area was packed.

Q. It was sufficiently dense there for you to want to
   move towards the front? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that because right at the front it tends to be a
   little bit easier? - A. Yes.

Q. Because people   do not actually like standing there or
   whatever? — A.   At the time I was young and that is
   where a lot of   young people go at the fence, out of
   the way of the   crowd and you have got a better view.

Q. I do not think you are very old now but you were
   younger.  Thank you very much indeed. - A. Yes.

Q. You are Ian John Fearns? - A. That is correct.
Q. Is it still                - A. It is, yes.

Q.                       , I believe? - A. That is right.
Q. Mr. Fearns you are another lifelong Liverpool
   supporter? - A. Yes.

Q. You came to the 1989 match anyway on the 15th
   April? - A. That is correct.

Q. Did you come to the 1988 one as well? - A. Yes, I
   did.

Q. Let us talk about 1989.   I think you had a ticket? -
   A. I did.

Q. You came by train I believe, is that right? -      a   . That


Q* ^ was not a football special but it was just a
   regular train? - A. It was a shuttle train that was
   on its way to Norwich which passed through Sheffield.

Q. You stopped off and you got off I think at about
   quarter to twelve I think the train arrived, is that
   right? - A. That is approximately quarter to twelve.

Q. It does not   have to be to the minute or anything like
   that. When    you got off how many people were there’
   Were you by   yourself or did you travel with a
   group? - A.   I travelled with one friend on the train.

Q. Which one was that? - A. Terry Mainwaring.

Q. I think you met two or three other people I think? -
   A. We met three other friends when we were actually
   put on to the buses that were laid on to take us to
   the ground. We actually met them on the actual bus
   itself.

Q. Was that Paul Carlisle, Paul Murray and Ian Ford? -
   A. Yes, that is right.

Q. Were you wearing football gear? - A. No, I was
   wearing casual jeans and a jeans shirt.




                                /Q. So how come....
                                                             59


                                            I.J. FEARNS


Q. So how come that you got on to the football coaches? -
   A. Well as we were coming off the train the Police were
   sayings  "Liverpool supporters this way, Nottingham
   Forest*supporters the other way", so we just followed
   their directions.

Q. Then you were steered towards these coaches? - A. We
   waited in the forecourt, car park of the area till the
   buses actually arrived.

Q. So you were quite pleased because you came with one
   friend and you had met three more so there were five of
   you at that point? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. You then, I think the coach eventually or bus took you
   towards Leppings Lane.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q       I think you got off near the ground about half-past-12
        something of that order? - A. Something about that.

Q. I think the first thing you did was find yourself a chip
   shop, got something to eat, and then I think you bought
   four cans of lager each. Is that right? - A. That was not
   specifically what I said during the course of the interview
   by the Police.  I said we purchased 'a couple of cans o^.
   lager. I did not give any quantity.

Q.        I see, so how many   cans did you actually have         yourself?
         - A. I myself only purchased two.

q   . It does not matter    to me whether it   is oneor ten.Well
      ten might matter to me but all I am trying to find out
      as briefly as I can, you had a couple of cans. Right.
      I think you sat on some nice grassy slope? - A. Yes, tnere
      was a verge just across the road.

 q. Because it was a beautiful day? - A. Yes.

 0.      All I want to deal with at this point, I want you    to tell
         me about Paul Carlisle, all right, because he was    with
         you at about 12.30? — A. He was.
 Q. How long did he stay with you? - A. He st*yed :
                                                  for approx­
    imately I would say, what, half-an-hour at the most.

 Q. In other words you are saying he left you for whatever
    reason at about 1 p.m.? - A. That is correct.

    q   . You never saw him again after that, did you,    on the day?
          - A. unfortunately not.
    q. So when he left you that in fact was goodbye, unfortunately'
       - A. Yes.

                                          I.J. FEARNS



Q. Now Paul, why did he go? Tell me why he left, as far as
   you know. Don't tell me what other people have told you
   at this stage, just what you know as to why he left? -
   A. Paul was saying previously when we met him on the bus
   and for a number of days before that he wanted to obtain
   a Stand ticket.  Unfortunately he only had a season ticket
   at Anfield for the ground so he was only allocated a ground
   ticket and he wanted to actually try and swap this ticket
   and obtain a Stand ticket.

Q. I see, so when you say "ground ticket" he had a terracing
   ticket? - A. He did indeed.

Q. And what he wanted was to have a Stand ticket to go upstairs;
   - A. Yes.
Q. Was that the reason why he left because he hoped to do a
   swap? - A. He hoped to do a swap.

Q. And in fact I think you went towards a place called the
   Horse and Jockey but you have got no idea, he just said
   "That is where I am going".  Is that right? - A. Well he
   said he was going up to the pub up the top of the hill to
   try and swap his ticket. We gave him roughly three-quarters
   of an hour and followed up.

Q.     Oh I see.And having followed   him you never found him?
      - A. We didn't no.
Q. So you can't say whether he succeeded or not but you know
   that that is what he was trying to do? - A. That is the
   reason he left.

Q. Hoping to do, shall we say? - A. Hoping.

Q. So    you then followed him up and eventually you came back
   to    the turnstile area at about half-past-2 I think. That
   is    right, isn't it? - A. Yes, approximately quarter-past
   to    half-past.  I could not be sure.

Q. I am not going to take you through the detail of how you
   got in apart from asking whether you went through a turn­
   stile or through a gate? - A. I went through a turnstile.

Q. The only other question I want to ask you is did you see
   any of the big gates open? - A. No, not at all.

Q. You never saw that? - A. No.

q    . When you got in tell me who you were with when you got
       through your turnstile? - A. When I entered the actual
       ground I was with Terence Mainwaring; Ian Ford; Paul Murray
       and we had met up with a friend just outside called
       Carl Lewis.
                                                            61

                                         I .J . FEARNS


 Q. So it was Ian Ford, Paul Murray .... How well did you
    know Paul Murray, did you know him well as well? - a .
    We went to home games.  I knew him more through Paul Carlisi*
    who knew him a lot better than myself.  He was a friend wi
    went to the matches with.                              a v,e

Q. And then you met up with this other lad called Carl Lewis’
   - A. That is correct.

Q. You met him on the inside? - A. On the outside.  We were
   actually in the area outside the turnstiles with hi* and
   we all entered the ground together.

Q. Did he come through a turnstile as well as far as you knew?
   - A. He did.

Q. Now on the inside there were the five of you including
   yourself, I think you noticed some Police Officers in tha^
   concourse area.  Is that right? - A. I did indeed.

Q. Do you know about how many you saw? - A. No, it was just
   about three or four, five at the most.

Q. And did they search you, can you remember? I don't mean
   all of them? - A. I recall them searching some fans but
   I myself never got searched.

Q. So you saw that was happening but you weren't? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you wait any longer for Paul or did you decide you
   did not know where he was and you were going .... A. No,
   we assumed if he had swapped his Stand ticket we obvious l v
   would not meet up with him until the way home or if he
   hadn't we told him we would be in the ground at a certain
   place, you know, hoping to meet him in there, so we sade
   our way straight there.

Q. And did you go down the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Now something peculiar I think about Carl Lewis.  Die
   he actually have a terrace ticket? - A. He didn't, he hac
   a Stand ticket.

Q. What did he do, did he go to the Stands or did he ccse
   with you? - A. Unfortunately he came in through the zurn-
   stiles with us and we were waiting for Paul Murray vho
   was still outside at the time.  I don't know exactly what
   happened but between the time we were actually goinc in,
   which must have been all of about two minutes, Carl did
   not have his stub so he was not allowed up into the
   Stands.

Q. Was your ticket torn, can you remember, your ticket I am
   talking about when you came through or was it intact? -
   A. No, the person on the gate had taken the stub frcz
   the ticket.
                                                              62

                                         I.J. FEARNS



Q.    I am not too worried precisely what happened to the ticket,
     but what you are saying is he could not get up to the
     Stands because he could not prove ... A. He could not prove
     he had a Stand ticket.

Q.   So if he was going anywhere he had to go down on to the
     terracing? - A. Well that was the way.

Q. And in fact that is what he did with the rest o*. you?
   A. Yes, he did.
Q. And you all went down I think the tunnel.     Is that right?
   - A. That is correct.
Q. Did you know there were other routes into the ground?
   A. Yes, I did.
Q. But do I take it that   you liked being behind the goal.
   I don't mean directly   behind the goal but in that centre
   section? - A. Well at   Anfield that is usually where we
   stand so therefore to   make it easier when Paul Carlisle
   had gone away to swap   his ticket that is where we said we
   would be.
Q. I see.  So that was where you were hoping Paul would come
   if he had not succeeded with his swap? - A. That is right.

Q.   And you went down the tunnel.   The tunnel I take it was
     reasonably clear. You did not have any particular
     difficulty in the tunnel? - A. No, no real problems at
     all.
Q. And when you exited from the tunnel did you turn right or
   left? - A. Right.
Q. Have you any idea what time this would have been that you
   got there? -A. Roughly about 25-past, half-2.

Q. How long would you say it took you to get through the
   turnstile area? - A. From the outside I would say between
   15 minutes, you know about 10/15 minutes.

 Q. If you got to the turnstile area at the time you told me
    you would have had to be later on the terracing wouldn t
    you? - A- Yes. As I say they were given as approximate
    times.
 Q. In your statement you put 20-to-3.  Would that sound
    reasonable to you or would you prefer to change that.
    - A. 20-to-3 was when we actually got on to the terracing.

 Q. Yes, that is what I am trying to find out.     You have
    understood what I am asking? ~ A. Yes.
                                      I.J. FEARNS


At that point were you able to find, select a spot where
you wanted to be? - A. We obviously had to push through
because obviously there was a crowd there but we didn't
find any great difficulty at all except when we got in
obviously the crowd was still increasing and there was a
lot of pushing going on.

Did you feel any surges? - A. Yes, I did. The first surge
must have been about quarter-to-3 but that was just with
people singing and what have you because as I say at that
time there was nothing out of the ordinary. Then it must
have been some time between 10-to, 5-to-3 there was the
surge that came and that just pushed me right down to the
front.

Can you remember whether the players were already on the
pitch at that point, not for playing but for pre-kick-off?
- A. No, they weren't.

They weren't or you can't remember? - A. No, they weren't
on the pitch.

They were not. So you felt this surge which carried you
forward before the players came onto the pitch? - A. I
did.

Some time after 10-to-3 you would say but before the players
were on the pitch? - A. It was before the players came
on the pitch.

Before, that is   right. Did you hear the teams being
announced? - A.   I can't honestly remember. I probably
did but I can't   honestly say.

Did you see the   players come onto the pitch at    all? -
A. No.

Did you see any bit of the match? - A. No.

I don't mean the detail, but did you .... A. I never got
to focus on one player or the ball at all.

So you are not able to say any of your events in relation
to what was going on on the pitch apart from being sure
when the surge came it was before they had come out? - A-
It was before they came.

Did you get split up from your friends? - A. Yes.

But I think you did actually see Carl at one point, he
was slightly over to the right, wasn't he? - A. Carl was
originally standing to my right just in front of Terry
who was also standing to my right. When the surge came
                                                               64

                                         I.J. FEARNS



     that pushed me right forward to near the front I went
     off sort of to the left and Carl went straight forward
     and that was the last I saw of him.

Q.   Was it at this point when this big surge came? -    a   . Yes.

Q.    Did this surge go forward and ease back at all or did it
     stay continuously forward? - A. No, when the surge came
     the pressure was so intense with the surge that I decided
     me and Paul Murray had been pushed that way, we will see
     what it is like down the front because usually there is
     a gap between the railings and where the terracing starts
     coming up. We got into this gap and then the surge just,
     you know, it became more and more and then we became
     trapped unfortunately.

Q. Tell me: when you first got down to the front was there
   in fact a gap there? - A. No. We assumed there would be
   a gap there but when we got there there wasn't and there
   was no way back.

Q. Obviously we know things became dreadful in the front
   there, we know that. What I am trying to find out when
   you first got to the front bit where you were hoping
   things would be easier, was it in fact any easier at
   that point when you were moving or being moved by the
   surge? - A. No, when we actually got to the front it was
   just as packed as what it was up the back and then it
   just gradually got worse.

Q. Could you see the little gate? - A. I saw it when I
   was further up the pitch being opened once but when I
   was forward I had no view of the gate at all.

Q. Tell me about that. When did you see this little gate
   open then, tell me? - A. It was just before the surge
   came the gate opened.  I don't know for what reason or
   whether there was a fan trying to get out.  I honestly
   don't know.  I just remember the gate opening and the
   Police Officer pushing the fan back in and closing the
   rj^te.

Q. You say this was before the players were on the pitch?
   - A. That was before the players were on the pitch.

Q.   You are quite sure about that? -     A. Positive.

Q. And you say you saw it opened and the fan being pushed
   in at that point? - A. Yes.

Q.   After that you lost sight of it?     - A. Yes.

Q. How did you yourself get out as a matter of interest
     A. I was stuck in the crush for about a f u n 20 25
   minutes and when the pressure did finally ease off I
   little and I was able to move my body and turn, 1
   literally panicked and forced my way to the back

Q. You did the right thing to go back actually.    I am sure
   that was the right thing   for you to do. I want you to
   show us on the plan where you, were when      you took your
   match viewing position, and then show me the second
   position, where you finished up near the front.
   (The witness marked Exhibit C467) I think you said
   that in 1988 you were in   one o£ the stands, is that
   right? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. There was one other thing I wanted to ask you. Do you
   remember a beach ball being knocked about? - A. I do,
   when I first went in, yes.

Q. Was that the position which you have marked with a "1 ?
   - A. Yes.
Q. Were you there at that time? - A. I was there at that
   time.
Q. So the big surge happened sometime after that? - A. It
   did.
                 Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q. Mr. Fearns, you tell us that Paul - this is Paul
   Carbide - wanted to swap his ticket? - A. That is
   correct.
Q.    So he obviously did not want to be on the terrace in
     the standing area, he wanted to be in the stand. Did
     he say anything to you as to why he wanted to swap it.
     - A. He never said anything to me personally but me and
     my friend Terry Mainwaring came to the assumption that
     obviously he was a bit worried about this. For what
     reasons, I didn't get into ....

Q.   I am just interested in whether hespoke to you.   Mr.
     Terry Mainwaring is here, isn't he? - A. He is not, no.

          THE CORONER:   Ask him for the hearsay.   I am not
     intending to call Mr. Mainwaring.

          MR. KING:   I see. Sir, I want the best evidence
     but this may be the best I can get.
          THE CORONER:   Yes.   I don't mind you taking the
     hearsay on this point.

          MR. KING:   Thank you, sir:

Q. Let me investigate a bit further then: what did you
   assume and why did you so assume was the reason for why
   Paul did not want to be on the terraces? - A. For the
   whole of that season, even being at Anfield on the Kop,
                                                          67
                                                 I* J. FEARNS

     on numerous occasions Paul when he did stand behind the
     goal, moved away to either the side or nearer th* front
     because the pressure, he felt it was too much for him.

Q. Do you know whether he had been to the semi-final in
   1988? - A. He had been, yes.

Q. Were you there with him in 1988? - A. No, I didn't
   travel with Paul.

Q. Did you ever speak to him about his experiences in
   1988? - A. Only about the game itself.

Q. Not about his experience on the terrace? - A. Not about
   any experiences, no.

Q. Hr. Fearns, did you say you saw the perimeter gate
   opened before the players came out? - A. The perimeter
   gate in area "C" was actually opened once to my
   recollection, that.I can remember, but that was
   immediately shut by the Police Officer who was on the
   track.

Q. Yes, you are talking about in the perimeter fence,
   aren't you? - A. Inside the ground itself. Not gate C,
   as in the concertina gate, no.

Q. No, gate 3. I was wondering if you could look at C277,
   the sixth time from the bottom.  Can you see there it
   says 14.59.20, I think it is, "Gate 3 open"? - A. Yes.

Q.   So that was a little later than you have said, wasn't
     it? - A. No, I said ....

Q.   You said you saw it open before the players came on the
     pitch? - A. Yes, it did open once.   As I say, there was
     no big flood onto the pitch.   The Police Officer just
     closed it straightaway.

Q. It is just the time that I am trying to get correct. -
   A. As I say, I couldn't be certain on it. It was
   before the teams were on the pitch though.

Q. Because we know the teams came out at 6-minutes-to-3
   and 14.59 is when gate 3 opened, so all the events that
   you have mentioned in the pen, could they have been
   just a few minutes out, do you think? - A. As I say,
   that is possibly the case, but I can remember that gate
   being opened before the teams were on that pitch.

Q. Yes, it is not the events themselves, it is just the
   timing. They could be that little bit later?

          MR. KING:   Sir, to help Mrs. McBrien, it is a
     long time since I made the point, but all we know for
     certain is that 14.59 shows the gate in a state of
     openness.  Sir, I think Mrs. McBrien, probably not
     deliberately, has rather misrepresented to the witness
     when indicating at 14.59 the gate was in the process of
     being opened.

          THE CORONER:   I think what Mrs. McBrien is trying
     to find out is whether this witness could be five
     minutes wrong with his time but we don't know.

          MR. KING:   We don't know.  I am only trying to
     make sure that there is no confusion over the
     significance of 14.59 on the chart for gate 3. That is
     only a time when we know the gate was in a state of
     openness.

          MRS. McBRIEN:   And it doesn't say anywhere that
     gate 3 was opened before, does it, sir?

          THE CORONER:   No, it does not, but you cannot
     from that figure say that it didn't open before; you
     cannot say that it did; and you cannot say what
     happened after it. All you can say, as Mr. King
     correctly points out, is that at 14.59 it was open.
     How long it was open, whether it was shut again,
     whether it stayed open continuously, from the figure
     itself you can't tell. What this witness is saying,
     and he will correct me if I misrepresent what he is
     saying, is that his recollection is that the gate did
     open, but that it was considerably earlier, before the
     players were on the pitch, that somebody came out and a
     Police Officer put him back in, and then it was shut,
     but he has no further recollection of any events on the
     gate. That is his evidence.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:   Mr. Fearns, you do say that your
     timings could be a little out, don't you? - A. Yes, but
     I do know distinctly that the teams were not on the
     pitch when I first saw that gate open.  As I say, when
     the gate was opened it was closed virtually immediately
     by a Police Officer who was on the track, so for the
     record that might not go down as the gate being open,
     but as I say, it was opened and closed straightaway.

Q. When you saw that gate open what was the state of the
   pen then? - A. From where we were it was starting to
   get really quite packed at the time.  It was just
   before the surge actually happened. As I say, then the
   surge came and recollection from then was just panic
   really.
                                                    I. J. FEARNS


You d i d n ’t feel in any danger at all when you saw that
»ate first opened? - A. No.      1 was feeling a bit
worried about the intensity of the pushing, but it was
just like any cup game to me at the time.

Did you see how the gate was opened? - A. No. I can
only recollect the actual gate opening and the Police
Officer closing it virtually straightaway.  I couldn t
tell you who opened, why it was opened.

Did anybody gat out at that time? - A. No, the gate was
closed virtually immediately.

Nobody at all? - A. No.
       th f   CORONER:     Did you say nobody got out?           I



 I see, yes.      I understand.

  IAN THOMAS GLOVER




  1.   Ian Glover, the son            of the Applicants John and Teresa

       Glover was born on            20th January, 1969, and was twenty

       years old when he died at Hillsborough football ground

       on 15th April, 1989.



| 2.      He       was accompanied to       the   ground by     his     brothers

       Joseph Glover and John McCarthy but only he and Joseph

       entered enclosure            3 of     the Lepping     Lane end     of the

       stadium.
               i




  3.      At the       inquest the jury heard         first from      Professor

       Alan Usher about            the cause of death which           he gave as

       death through            traumatic asphyxia.       Evidence      was then

       put by Officer            Geraldine Evans in which         details were

       given, inter alia, of             what had happened to Ian Glover

       between 2.30 p.m. and             shortly after 3.40 p.m. when he

       was certified dead            by Dr. Alan Redgrave.            In summary

       that evidence            was to the      effect that Ian       and Joseph.

       Glover took up a position in the centre of enclosure 2

       at approximately 2.30             p.m.     Following a     surge in the

       crowd they         were both      pushed forward.        Joseph states

       that         both were    being     crushed from     about 2.4 0     p.m.

       onwards.         Joseph managed       to escape from the e n c l o s u r e

       via a        gate in the      front perimeter fence but           Ian was




 ANNAAC
     left     inside        about     4     feet        from the       front      of    the

     enclosure.        Joseph tried to                 climb back in to help Ian

     but was pulled off the fence                       by a police officer.             He

     spoke     to     Ian     through            the     fence     until       Ian     lost

     consciousness.            There is           video evidence           of Ian       and

     Joseph together           in enclosure 3              and of Joseph             on the

     fence outside of the              enclosure.          Approximately twenty

     minutes later          Joseph saw            Ian being      pulled from            the

     enclosure on to           the pitch by two             unidentified police

     officers.         He attempted              to resuscitate          Ian who       was

     then carried on           a makeshift stretcher to                    a gymnasium

     which     was     serving        as     a temporary         mortuary.             The

     officer reported that Joseph                      had that morning said to

     her     that     while      in        the     gymnasium       a     doctor        had

     identified        Ian's     pulse           and     attempted,         for      about

     fifteen         minutes,         to     resuscitate           him       but       was

     unsuccessful.            Joseph        assented that          it was         himself

     together        with     other        fans    who     carried         Ian.        His

     statement was then             changed by a West              Midlands police

     officer        to read     "may        have carried           .... "       Shortly

     after 3.40 p.m. Dr.              Alan Redgrave, in the presence of

     P.C. Glave        certified that Ian                Glover was dead.              The

     transcript        of this        part        of the    inquest hearing              is

     exhibited to this memorandum at Exhibit



4.   The jury never           heard from Joseph Glover                   himself, but

     were merely        presented with                 excerpts from        statements




ANNAAC
     that he had made to the police.            They did not have the

     benefit of     hearing relevant matters which              related to

     the period after        the 3.15 p.m. cut-off         point.     These

     matters are set     out in a note of a             statement made by

     Joseph    Glover   which      was    taken    by    Sheila     Coleman

     (researcher) and is        exhibited at exhibit                to this

     memorandum.     Of particular        relevance are the notes at

     the   end of    the record     which state         first, that      the

     ambulances     had great      difficulty      in    getting to      the

     gymnasium     because    of   the      presence      of    crowds    of

     supporters     trying to      leave the      stadium and       second,

     that Ian, upon being taken out of the enclosure by the

     police, was left on the pitch lying on his back.



5.   These matters when       combined with the evidence            of Dr.

     Phillips and Dr. Ashton are all highly relevant to the

     issue of whether Ian       Glover's death was aggravated by

     lack of   care, this being          an issue which        should have

     been left to the jury.

STATEMENT- QE.JOHN MCCARTHY RE IAN GLOVER

- brother of Ian Glover.
Got Ian out of bed on the morning of thedisaster to give him a ticket
for the Leppings Lane terracing.

- John had a ticket for the North Stand.
He saw people spilling onto the track and turned   to     his   friendand
said 'Our Ian and Joe are in there'.

He saw a fat man being carried from the Leppings Lane end to the Spion
kop' end. His friend was trying to revive him. He obviously failed as
he began punching the ground. John knew then that the man was dead
and his fears for Ian and Joe grew.

He stayed in his seat because although he wanted   to   get on thepitch
and search for them, police with dogs were lined   up   in front of the
stands.

Another friend, who was on the front row of the stands, shouted John
and said: 'Your Ian's dead.  I'll take you to Joe'. This was
approximately 3.25pm.

The friend                 took John to Joe outside the gymnasium
(3.30pm approx) . John asked:

        'Where's our Ian?'
        Joe answered:
        'He's in there.'

John and Joe then went to the door of the gymnasium. There were two
police officers at the door (one had glasses on). They said 'You
can't go in there.' John replied:

        'My brother's in there.'

He moved them out of the way and entered the gymnasium.

Joe took him to Ian who was in the middle of a row of bodies.
Bodies were very close to one another.
John knelt down to see Ian and stood on somebody's head.
He began shaking Ian, trying to wake him up.



John and Joe staying with Ian for what John thinks was about 5
minutes.
They were very upset and were taken outside.
John asked a police officer if he could use a phone. He was directed
to a pay phone but could not get a line. He returned to the police
officer who produced a telephone from under the table and he
immediately rang home and informed his Aunty of Ian's death.

Outside the gymnasium John saw people on stretchers. One of these was
                 (Ian's friend). He was looking at John but John was
unable to .respond to him in his state of shock.
John Glover (father) arrived                   and took them to look for

They travelled to the Police Station and Hammerton Road Boys' Club
where he remembers names being shouted out.
Travelled on bus back to the Hillsborough ground.
Had to look through all the photographs and John picked Ian out. His
(Ian's) body was brought to them and it was then that John

They were taken to a table and were questioned by plain clothes police
officers (who we know to be CID).

HB    John remembers about 3 rows of bodies in the gym when he arrived
      at approx 3.30pm. He estimates about 5£) bodies. This would be
      about right as there were bodies still at the back of Leppings
      Lane.

HB    John's timings as to his arrival at the gym are quite accurate as
      he remembers seeing                 on a stretcher


JOSEPH GLOVER RE IAN GLOVER

-    Travelled to Sheffield with brother Ian.
     In Pen 3.
-     Both being crushed from 2.40pm onwards.
     Shouting to get out.
-    Gate was opened. Few people got out then it was closed again.
-     Gate opened again. Joe got out. Police directedhim to side pens
     but he went back to the fence to Ian.
     Ian approx 5 yards from front fence.
     Joe was shouting to Ian to move.
     Ian was saying 'I can't, I can't move'.
-    Joe was shouting to people around Ian to move and help him, but
     they said that they couldn't move either.
-     Joe saw Ian's eyes closing.
-     Joe climbed on fence (see video) and was shouting to Ian.
-     Joe ran to ambulanceman and pleaded with him to help Ian.
-    Ambulanceman went to Policeman who said 'we can't do anything yet'.
     People were being pulled out.
     Joe was still on the fence.   Ian was unconscious but was standing
     up.
-    Two police officers brought him out, laid him on the pitch then
     returned to get more bodies out.
-     Joe tried to resuscitate him.
     Someone else also tried but said 'it's too late'.
     Ian was placed on a hoarding and Joe andLiverpool supporters
     carried him to gymnasium.
     In gymnasium Doctor (unidentified) felt for pulse and said 'There's
     a pulse there'. He tried for about twenty minutes to resuscitate
     Ian but then said he was dead.

     -Plain clothes police officers in Gym kept Joe with Ian. They asked
      Joe for Ian's name and address and they wrote it on a tag and put
      it on his wrist. They emptied Ian's pockets and put his
      possessions in a brown bag.
     The gym at this time was being partitioned off and Joe was asked to
     move to the side where the injured were being dealt with.   Instead
     he went outside where he met John McCarthy's friend
                 Joe told him that Ian was dead a n d w e n t to find
     John.

HB    Joe remembers that the ambulances had great difficulty getting to
      the gymnasium area because of the Nottingham Forest fans leaving
      the ground (the gym was at the 'Forest' end of the ground).

HB    When Ian was taken out of the pen by the police he was laid on his
      back and left.

JQHtL GLQVJER RE IAM GLQ.VJEB

Ian's father.
Was informed that Ian was dead and travelled to Barnsley Hospital
where he met Joe and John.
Was told at the hospital that Joe was dead - but Joe was standing with
him.
Went to Police Station then to Boys' Club.
- Was taken to ground on bus.
Looked through photographs for Ian.
John McCarthy picked out Ian (no 37).
   Ian was wheeled out.
He had a dirty blanket over him.
His leg was hanging off the trolley and his head was to one side.
John straightened his head and a catholic priest gave him the 'last
rites'.
John and family were then led to a table where they were questioned by
CID officers.
They were asked how Ian had travelled to Sheffield. How much he had
to drink etc.
They were then told that they might as well go home.

HB John states that looking through the photographs was "the worst
   think in [his] whole life".

HB    It was unnecessary for John and the others to go through this
      process of identification as Ian had a tag on him bearing his name
      and address from Joe's earlier identification.

    concern regarding the forthcoming inquests.         In particular, I am

•   concerned that there are specific issues relating to Ian's death which
    might not be addressed.

    I am aware that the inquest held earlier this year was meant to deal
    specifically with who Ian was and when and where he met his death.
    However, I have to state that I found the limitations of this format
    extremely frustrating and intimidating. Consequently, there were a
    number of issues relating to Ian's death which I felt were
    inadequately addressed yet I felt powerless to pursue answers.   It is
    for this reason that I am writing to you to ask that you consider
    calling evidence in an attempt to find the answers my family and
    myself so desperately seek.

    I fear that my family has been irreversibly damaged by the

             Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

When the great big surge came whereabouts did it come?
Go up to the plan and just point. - A . The surge seemed
to come from directly behind and I seemed to ^et pushed
this way and Phil got pushed forward downwards towards
the pitch.
     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much indeed.   I am
very much obliged to you.

     Mr. and Mrs. Hammond, your lad was very young and it
is very very sad you have lost him.   I have said this
before already I know, but it is still the same.    I
wrote to you to check on Mrs. Hammond's occupation.
Have you sent it back?   In that case we will just use
the note.   It pure formality.

                 (Short adjournment)

                 JOSEPH GLOVER Sworn

                   Bv THE CORONER:

You are Joseph Glover? - A. Yes.
                               - A. Yes.

You are the brother of Ian who unfortunately lost his
life? - A. Yes.

It is our dad at the back? - A. Yes.

You went by car with Ian and others to the match on the
15th April, 1989? - A. Yes.   In my statement I made a
while ago, it was the day after I buried my brother and I
have left a lot of things out of it.

Yes, that is why you have come so youcan tell  us.      At
the moment I am trying to find out how you got to
Sheffield.   You came by car? - A. Yes.

What time did you leave? - A. About eleven o'clock.

You had a ticket? - A. Yes.

Did Ian have one as well? - A. Yes.

Having left by car, did you drive straight to Sheffield?
- A. Yes.
What time did you arrive in Sheffield? “ A. It was
roundabout two o'clock, just after two o clock.
                                                                16

                                                         J. GLOVER
Q. Did you stop en route at all? - A. No.

Q. That is quite a long time from Walton? - A. Coming up on
   the notorway we hit a bit of traffic, there were hold­
   ups .

Q. Which way did you come?   Did you cdme across the Passes
   or did you come on the motorway? - A. No, on the
   motorways.

Q. You were in a car so I assume you weren't stopped and
   searched? - A. No.

Q. Did you notice whether the Police were searching coaches
   as you were driving along? - A. Well, when we got not too
   far away from the ground, I am not sure how many miles it
   was, I think we saw a few minibuses getting stopped and
   coaches.

Q.   Of you just drove on? - A. Yes.

Q.    It was of no interest to you.     Having got to Sheffield.
     You weren't driving? - A. No.

Q. Somebody else was driving.         Was the car parked up? - A.
   Yes.
Q.    In fact you parked quite a long   way from the ground?   - A.
     I think it was a mile or a mile    and a half.

Q. You then had to walk to the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. What time did you arrive at the ground, about? - A. I
   couldn't really say.

Q. How long does it take you to walk a mile or a mile and a
   half, normally? - A. Ten minutes, fifteen minutes.

Q. That is quite good walking.    Did it take as long as that
   or longer? - A. I am not sure.    I think it is at
   Penistone...   I am not sure the road we parked in but it
   was just a straight walk down.

Q. Don't worry about the time. - A. I am not sure of the
   times.
Q. It isn't that important what time you arrived. I just
   like to know if I can find out.   Walking down did you
   see other supporters? - A. There were a lot, all walking
   towards the ground.

Q. Did you see any of them carrying cans of alcohol? - A.
   No.
                                                   J. GLOVER
You didn't see any? - A .   No.

None at all? — A. No.
Do y o u remember walking past a big roundabout before you
got into Leppings LaneJ - A. Ho, I can t place it.

Were you checked for alcohol at any point as you were
coming down? - A. No.
Did you see whether anybody else was? - A. No.

Of course you were driving in the car and you hadn't
stopped from Liverpool to Sheffield? - A. No.

When vou eot to the turnstiles, never mind what time it
was, how did you enter?   Did you enter through a
turnstile or through a big gate? - A. We entared through
the turnstiles.
Do you remember the big outer perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

You do remember those. - A. As we walked down we got to
the Leppings Lane turnstiles.   We left Danny, just me
and la£, and we joined...   They weren't queues.    There
was iust like a crowd outside the turnstiles.    We joined
the back at the turnstiles and then a lot of fans started
coming down and getting behind us.   That is when we
first started getting into trouble at the turnstiles.
We started getting crushed at the turnstiles.

Are you saying you were actually crushed at the
turnstiles? - A. Yes.
Did you see any Police horses there? - A. We noticed one.

 Was that outside the perimeter gates or inside the
 perimeter gates when you noticed that? - A. I think it
 was inside.
 Which way on was it to you?      Was it broadways or
 longways on? - A. Long.
 Was he communicating with you or the other people in the
 crowd?   Was he shouting or waving his arms or anything
 that you can remember? - A. No.   I think he was just
 longways by the gates.   There is like a barrier.

 How crushed were you in the area outside the turnstiles?
 - A. It started getting pretty bad.

, Could you feel any pressure from anywhere? - A. Yes.

. Where was it coming from? - A. From the back of us.
                                                J. GLOVER
                                                  it
Did you shout out about pushing or anything at tUSt
Doint?    Tardon?   I didn't hear you. - A. There were
K it crowds coming behind us. I am not sure how many
turnstiles there Ire but there didn't seem to be any
queues or any stewards or anything there.   It was just
people entering the turnstiles to queue up for the match,
but there were no queues.
Did you see any Police Officers outside the turnstiles? -
A. Not outside the turnstiles, no.

You didn't see any? - A. No.
ADart from the mounted Officer you saw no other Poli^®
Officers? - A. I think there might have been two or three
on the side.   There wasn't any outside the turnstiles.

Were they saying or doing anything that you noticed? - A.
No.
I didn't hear your answer to my question when I asked
whether you were shouting out to people not to P“sh.
Did you do that or not outside the turnstiles, you
yourself? - A. Yes.
Did it make any difference as far as you c°u1^       " A*
I think there was just that many coming down and there
L s JiS-one to stop them.  They just all tried to come
towards the turnstiles to queue up to get in. With there
not being any queues it just formed into a crowd.

I don't know whether you will be able to help me on this
because the perimeter gates were behind you, bJj* *** *
notice whether they were open or shut? - A. I didn
notice.
Did you hear any messages over the tannoy while you were
out there? - A. No.
Did you hear any messages from a Land Rover behind you?
A. No.
 Did you see it by any chance? -   A. No.
 split up by then as we got into   the entrance to J*     „
 turnstiles and he shouted over,   "I'll meet you inside.
 As I got through the turnstiles   Ian was waiting inside
 for me.
 So he had got in before you? - A. He got in before me.

 So once you had got through - there is a biggish area
 there? - A. Yes.

                                                   J. GLOVER
Q. Was it quieter in there?   Was it easier? - A. Yes.
   Once you got through the turnstiles, yes.

Q. Were you searched in that area at all? -A. No.

Q. Did you see any Police Officers? - A. No.

Q. None at all? - A. As we got through the turnstiles there
   was none on the turnstiles.

Q. Pardon? - A. There was no-one searching at the turnstile
   as we went through.

Q. Was anybody searching on any other turnstile? - A. I
   couldn t tell you. The turnstile I went through, there
   was no-one on that one.

Q. How long did you stay in this big area behind the
   turnstiles? - A. As we got through the turnstiles?

Q. Yes. - A.How do you mean?

Q. Did you go through the turnstile, saw Ian and walked
   straight into the ground or did you go to the toilet, did
   you buy a programme, did you buy a cup of coffee? - A.
   Ian was there waiting for me as I came through we just
   went straight down the tunnel.   That was the only
   entrance we saw.

Q. Had you been to the ground before? - A. No.

Q. So you could see the tunnel ahead of you? - A. That was
   the only place we could see.   Usually as we go through
   the tunnel we would usually go towards the left or the
   right, to the corner, so we could see.   We would have a
   better view with only being small, but we didn't know
   there were the dividing fences dividing it into pens.
   We just thought it was it was one big area.

Q.    When you got to the tunnel entrance on the concourse
     side, were you ableto see the pitch at all? - A. Through
     the tunnel?
Q. Yes. - A. Yes, we just seen the tunnel and like daylight.

Q. But you couldn't see what was happening on the pitcn?
   A. No.
Q.    Before you left the turnstile area had you noticed...
     There was a big gate there, we call it Gate C.
     notice whether that gate was open or shut? - A. I think i
     just caught it getting shut, so I presume it hac just
     been opened.

   through that gate at that point? - A. No, I just seen
   them getting closed.   They were just finished filtering
   through.

Q. Are you quite sure that you saw it closed because in your
   statement you say you actually saw it being opened?    Was
   it being opened or was it being closed? -A. No, it was
   being closed.

Q. How wide open - when you first caught a glimpse of it,
   okay, let's assume it was being closed, was it at that
   point when you saw it being closed wide open, or was it
   only a narrow little opening? - A. Ho, it was about
   three feet wide.

Q. So it had been opened quite wide? - A. It was as though
   it had been open full, people have come in, they have
   let a few in and they have sort of like closed it, then
   we walked down to the tunnel and went into pen 3.

Q. When you got into pen 3, when you first got into pen 3,
   did you have a quick look to see what was happening on
   the field? - A. There was nothing happening on the   ..
   field.

Q. No one was on it? - A. No.

Q. Now you are quite sure about that? - A. I think the
   players had been out, a couple of players, and had just
   gone off the pitch as we came in to pen 3.

Q.    You are quite sure - I am going back to the gate,
     because you say the gate had been wide open and was
     being shut, you are quite certain about that? - A. Yes.

Q. And yet when you got out of the tunnel there was nobody
   on the field? - A. I think they had just left the
   field, yes.

0. Kick-off had not taken place yet? - A. No, it must have
   been about 20-to-3 by the time we came in, 25-to.   I am
   not sure of the times but it was a while before the
   players came out.

0. How long did it take you, once you got to Leppings
   Lane, when you joined the crowd, how long did it take
   you to get through? Have you any idea? - A. I couldn't
   tell you, no.

Q. The reason why I ask you this is that if the gate had
   been wide open and it was being shut, we know from the
   video, at least we think we know, that that gate was
   opened at 8-minutes-to-3. - A. No, it was before that.

Q. And it was shut at 3-minutes-to-3. - A. No, it was
   before that. I would say the gate had been open before
   that.

Q. Okay, so you went through, you think, at about 20-to.
   You don't know but you think it was about 20-to? - A .
   Yes, it was about that time, yes.

Q. You thought the players had left the field? - A. Yes.

Q. But not pre kick.-off? - A. No, not pre kick-off, no.

Q. You are right, there were players on the field at about
   20-to-3 or thereabouts, and they were going off at
   about that time.  Did you actually see them disappear
   off the field or is that an assumption you have made? -
   A. That was an assumption, yes.

Q. You are not sure, okay. So you got into pen 3, yes?
   Did you see at that point a beach ball being knocked
   about? - A. I am not sure.  I can't remember, no.

Q. You can't remember, or you didn't see it? - A. I can't
   remember, no.  I never seen it.

Q. Sorry? - A. I can't remember, no.

Q. Did you hear the players being announced over the
   tannoy? - A. No.

Q. You didn't hear that? - A. No, I never heard it, no.

0. Sorry? - A. I never heard it, no.

Q. You didn't hear it, okay. Did you see the players come
   out before the kick-off for their .... - A. No, by that
   time in pen 3 me and Ian, we were worried, before the
   players came out.

Q. Yes, I will come to that.  I am just trying to find out
   what you saw.  Did you see .... - A. No, I never seen
   the players come out.

Q. Did you see any players on the pitch at any time? - A.
   Just after kick-off or ....

Q. So you saw them at that .... - A. I ended up on the
   pitch.

Q. Did you see them before you ended up on the pitch? - A.
   No..

Q. Right, so you came out - now we will go back to your
   story - you came out into pen 3, you say? - A. Yes.

Q. Tell me in your words what happened.  You and Ian were
   together, right? - A. We went into pen 3, sort of like
   got through the crowd, took up positions to the right
   of the gate.

Q. Fairly near the front, were you? - A. Fairly near the
   front, yes, and then we sort of like, I think it was
   like a surge, we sort of like just got pushed over a
   bit and then it just started getting tighter where you

  couldn't move.  You were just crushed against people,
  where you couldn't move at all. Then Ian was, you
  could see as though he was choking.

Q. Sorry? - A. You could see him as though he was choking.
   As I was looking at him, he just, I couldn't explain
   it, his face was changing, and I couldn't move. His
   face just kept changing.

Q. That is what you can remember, isn't it? - A.   Yes.
   Just changing colour in his face.

Q. What happened after that? Was thatwhile you were
   still in the pen or had you already left it when you
   saw his face change? - A. It was just before leaving
   the pen.  I was right by him and then there was a lad
   in front of us who vomited.  There was a lad in front
   of us who vomited on his jumper and there was another
   lad who fell onto the floor ....

0. Have a little drink of water. - A. Could I just have a
   break for a minute?

Q. Yes, by all means. Just leave us for a few minutes and
   settle yourself down.

               (The Witness left the Court)

        THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, I should
   perhaps, while he has gone, say that on the whole I do
   not insist on relatives giving evidence.  Basically
   where a relative gives evidence it is because he wants
   us. Of course this poor young boy is obviously very
   distressed but I don t want you to think that I have
   made him give evidence against his will and indeed,^if
   he were to say to me now, "I have had enough, I don t
   want to say any more", I would stop because we have
   plenty of evidence from other people and we can piece
   it together.
         On the other hand, it is only fair that if
    somebody was there who is a relative and he wants to
    give evidence, that he ought to be given that
    opportunity, otherwise quite rightly he will feel,   why
    wasn't I allowed to speak?", so we will wait for him to
    settle down and then I might, in fact, ask him whether
    he wants to carry on.  I suspect he does want to carry
    on.
         While we are waiting, can I mention something else
    to do with Rule 37 and documentary evidence? You will
    have noticed that I was asking earlier whether Mrs.
    Hammond had filled in a form which I had sent to her,
    to do with names and things of that nature.  Vx’
                                                   nat I

intend to do is right at the end we are going to have a
wad of these, and in fact those of you who were here in
April/May time may remember that with every single case
I referred to the form which I sent put, where I asked
people to check that we had got the names and the
spellings right.  As far as I can see reading the
transcripts I don't think I actually said in so many
words, "and I admit these forms as documentary
evidence", so I think for the sake of good order, and
so that we have got a complete picture, rather than
Just viva voce exchanges across the Court, right at the
end what I propose to do is to admit these documents as
documentary evidence.  I don't propose unless you '
insist that I read them all out in detail.  I will
probably read one so that you know the format in which
they were. They contain basically name, address,
occupation, date of birth, a little bit of information
about the GP which is not actually relevant but when we
did them we thought we might need that so we thought we
would get it.

      I am quite certain that these matters will not and
cannot actually be disputed, but I don't intend to do
it now, I will do it right at the end at a convenient
point, and finally, while I am on documentary evidence,
because of the way we took the medical evidence, you
will recollect those of you who were there, that I had
the pathologists.   Normally I get the pathologist to
produce his PM report and say, "Here it is, I produce
it", but for some reason I did not use my standard
formula and again, just as with these forms, certainly
in some cases, in fact, probably most, I did not
actually refer to the typed PM report, and again
similarly I intend to produce them as a wad, simply so
that the information forms part and parcel of the
Inquest proceedings.   All the information that is
relevant was given viva voce and in fact as far as I
know everybody who has wanted a copy of the PM reports
has had one anyway, but I take it that will be
acceptable? I hope it will be acceptable to all of you
because I will be reluctant to read 95 PM reports in
full.

     MR. PAYNE:    Thank you for that information. The
procedure certainly would be acceptable to us.   I think
I can speak for everybody.   I don t think anybody will
dissent from that.

     THE CORONER:   I will probably do it right at the
end, or at some point when I know that I have got five
or ten minutes, when I have got them here.  It is just
dotting "i's" and crossing "t's", so that the record
for the future is complete, rather than having little
gaps in it.

Q. I am   asking you    to look at the density of the crowd
   that   you pushed    through? - A. I can't really tell you
   from   looking at    the photo how thick the crowd is. AIL
   as I   know is it    was packed tight.   „

0.        THE CORONER:   Okay, that is fair enough. What
     you are saying is that when you started your movement
     down towards the gate, you have no recollection of
     anybody being on the pitch side of the ...? - A. No.

Q. Forgive me, I just want to check this. When you, were
   actually outside, when you had got through, did you say
   you do remember Beardsley hitting the crossbar or riot,
   I can't remember? - A. No, I don t remember.  I don't
   remember anything of the game.

Q. No, but you do remember that the game finished almost
   immediately after you came out? That is what you told
   me, and I just want to be sure that we have got that
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. You   are sure about that? - A. As far as I am concerned,
   all   as I seen when I got on the pitch was my two mates
   and   Bruce Grobbelaar was looking back.  I presumed it
   had   stopped.

Q. I see.  It is very difficult with times, I know that.
   That is why we like, if possible, to get the witness to
   say he saw this or that, because it is much easier, but
   if you did not see it you did not see it, that's all
   there is to it. Okay, Mr. King, thank you very much
   indeed.

          THE CORONER:   I think Mr. Glover is ready to
     carry on, so we will go back to Mr. Glover.

                  By THE CORONER (Continued)

Q. Okay, Mr. Glover? - A. Yes.

Q. Now, I think you and Ian were on the terrace, you were
   telling me, and I seem to remember you said that you
   could not really remember what was going on, on the
   field, at all? - A. No.

Q. But do you remember the little gate which leads onto
   the field? - A. Yes.

0. You do remember that, and I think I am right in saying
   that you managed to get out of that, fortunately? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Were you able to walk out? Did you walk out through
   it? - A. It was more like a scramble.

Q. Do you know whether you were one of £he first people to
   get outor not? - A. No, not the first.

Q. Can you  remember it opening? - A. Yes, it opened, I
   think.about ten people got out, and closed.    Then it
   opened again and I got out.

Q. What was the time interval between the two openings,
   can you remember? - A. I can't say, no.

Q. Okay.   I can't remember, as soon as you got out you
   turnedround to look for your brother,     didn't you? Is
   that right? - A. By the gate, before I got out the gate
   I could   feel myself standing on someone. There is like
   steps, I got out of the gate but after standing on
   someone. Then I got onto the pitch and just went
   straight for my brother because I knew where he was,
   then I climbed on the fence, just trying to pull the
   fence down or reach over, shouting to him to move. He
   was saying he couldn't.

Q.   Youwere actually shouting to him, you were talking to
     him? - A. Yes.   He was just talking back dead faint.
     You could see his eyes just closing in front of me.

Q.   Did he speak to you at that point?   Was he speaking to
     you? - A. Dead faint.

Q. Pardon? - A. Dead faint.    His voice was sort of like
   going, yes.

Q. In fact, you have looked at a lot of photographs and
   you have found yourself on a lot, haven't you? - A.
   Yes

Q. Did you start calling to your brother as soon as you
   got out or was there a little time while you had to get
   your breath and sort yourself out? - A. Just a matter
   of seconds.

Q. So almost immediately you .... - A. I knew where he was
   straightaway, yes.

0. Yes, because you had been with him, of course. - A.
   Yes. Before I did get out there was a lot of shouting
   to the Police at the gate, not the gate, sort of like
   the fence, we were shouting for help. He was just
   looking and just waiting for something, something to
   happen, waiting for an order over his radio or
   something.

                                                   J. GLOVER

Q. Sorry? - A. As though he was waiting for an order to
   come to him over the radio, to do something.

Q. Can you speak a little bit slower because I am having
   difficulty hearing. - A. Before I got out of the gate
   there was a lot shouting to the Police Officers, sort
   of like on the track, for help, to do something, but it
   was as though he was waiting for an order to come
   through before he would act.

0. Was it just one Officer who was there or were there
   several Officers at that point? - A. I think there was
   one or two. There weren't many.

Q. There weren't many. Did he have a radio, can you
   remember? - A. I couldn't remember.

Q. You can't remember.   Is there anything else you want to
   tell me, at least that you want to tell the Jury, that
   is? - A. As I was on the fence more Police Officers
   came round then. I was just interested in my brother
   and one pulled me off and just dragged me away, told me
   to get off the fence.

Q. Mr. Glover, can I say how sorry I am that you lost your
   brother.  It is obviously a very distressing time.  I
   think you have also been very brave. I know,   because I
   have been told, that this was not going to be an easy
   session for you so you have done well, a credit to
   yourself and to your dad, and of course I am sorry for
   him as well. Thank you very much for coming.

        MR. HUMPHREYS:    Sir, I am sorry ___

        THE CORONER:     Have you got a picture of 15.03?

        MR. HUMPHREYS:   This is PR1/12A - C354.  Perhaps
   Mr. Glover could identify himself on that for the Jury.

        THE CORONER:   Yes. Did he mark a     plan,I can't
   remember? We will get him to do thatat the same time.
   What time is that one?

        MR. HUMPHREYS:    The time is 15.02.

photographs from album 2.  I don't know if that is the
list before you or one compiled by our team. The time
shown on the photograph would be 15.03, but the true
time would be 15.02 because the clock was slightly out.

           HENRY JOHN CLARK Called

RICHARD JONES



1.   Richard Jones,             the son        of the     Applicants Leslie            and

     Doreen Jones           was born          on 5th     October/ 1963/            and was

     twenty five           years of age         \^en he died       at Hillsborough

     football ground on 15th April/ 1989.



     He     was     accompanied          to    the      stadium    by       his     sister

     Stephanie          and a        woman named       Tracey Cox.           All     thre'e

     entered        enclosure 3          of the      Lepping Lane           end of     the

     stadium.           Stephanie        Jones became       separated from             her

     brother and Tracey Cox                 after a surge and pressure from
             i
     the crowd in           the enclosure forced her               forward towards

     the front of the terracing.



3.   During       the      course      of     inquest the     jury          heard     from

     Professor Usher that in his view the cause of death was

     traumatic asphyxia.               Photographic        evidence showed that

     Richard Jones was standing with Tracey Cox in enclosure

     3 at 2.56          p.m.     The only evidence of             what happened to

     Richard Jones after this time came from Police Sergeant

     John        Killoch       who     disclosed that,       some       time        later/

     Police        Constable         Paul     Bromley      joined       a     group     of

     supporters who             were carrying Richard Jones                  across the

     pitch        to the       north     stand on       a makeshift          stretcher.

     Once there          the Constable attempted to                resuscitate him

     but was        unsuccessful.             He then     assisted in          carrying
     Richard into the temporary                  mortuary where at 4.00 p.m.

     he was certified dead by Dr. Nicholas Seivwright.



4.   The jury heard no evidence relating to what happened to

     Richard Jones either             between 2.56 p.m. and         the moment

     when he was          carried across the pitch, or            after he had

     been taken into          the mortuary prior to          being certified

     dead.         The    Applicants       are    extremely concerned       that

     nothing in the evidence that was put before the inquest

     discloses that Richard Jones                 received any medical care

     whatsoever.          The facts        of his being carried across the

     pitch by supporters alone, and resuscitated by a police
             i
     officer        point     to     the    opposite    conclusion.          The

     Applicants also believe that such a conclusion would be

     reinforced had the evidence                 of Dr. Glynn Phillips, Dr.

     John Ashton and          Mr. F. Eccleston, in          particular, been

     put before the jury.              During the course of the resumed

     inquests the Applicants wrote to the Coroner requesting

     that these people be             called as witnesses together with

     a Dr. Burns          (Pathologist), and that their           evidence be

     put before          the jury.     This evidence, a large          part of

     which concerned events taking place after the 3.15 p.m.

     cut-off point,          demonstrated the         woeful inadequacy       of

     the     organisation and          provision      of emergency     medical

     care.       The Coroner refused the Applicants request.                 Ead

     such        evidence     been     placed      before   the     jury,    the

     Applicants          submit that       good grounds     would have      been




ANNAAG
     established for a jury      to draw the conclusion that the

     death by    traumatic asphyxiation       of Richard    Jones was

     aggravated by lack of care.



5.   In   addition,   that there    was no    evidence of    medical

     intervention     prior to   4.00    p.m. when    Mr. Jones    was

     certified dead, means that         no conclusions can be drawn

     as   to   when   death actually     occurred    and   hence   all

     evidence of what happened      to Mr. Jones     after 3.15 p.nf.

     is entirely relevant to the question of how he died.

     7-^. FP_;v3:vl*: Sir, tho ovidcricc that you will. now
hear relates to Hi chard Jones. ?J.chard*s parents arc
in Court with social workers and monibsrs of tne f rjr.ily.
Tho parents are represented by a practice which is a.
member of ray Group and X appear on their behalf as agent
through the usual Steering Committee arrangement.

      TT”? CCROIHDIi: Now, I thinlc, Mr. Jonos, you x/ere here
on the first day, wore yovi not, so you know ths general
fortn so I am not going to go over that ground now and
we will start straightaway.

         This ia a resumed Inquest which was opener on tne
18th April, 1 3?. On that occasion Neil Anthony Parkin,
A c t in g* Coroner's Officer, said:

        "Tho body which is the subject of this
        Inquest has been identified to FC 2220
        Uror.'.ley of tho South Yorkshire Police as
        that of Ilichard Jonos by Leslie Jones,
        his father. He was 25 years of age having
        been born on the 5th October, 1963 a-t
        Liverpool.     He was a single man and he
        lived at
        lie was an office worker by occupation.
        Tie died at Hillsborough Football Ground
        following an incident there on Saturday,
         15th April, 19C$>. PC Bromley caused the
        body to be removed to the Medico Legal
         Centre and there ho identified it to
        Detective Constable Simon Weigold who
         subsequently identified the same boay to
         Prof. Usher. It is the family wish that
         the body should bo buried."

      And I then adjourned the Inquest and, as was my
normal practice, I wrote and checked whether the information
was correct and, in fact, Hr. Leslie Jones ---- that is
you, I thinlc, is it n o t    you signed the fox-m and
you confirmed that, in fact, the names, addresses, date
and place of birth were correct and I thinlc you have now
told*me that, in.fact, your son had a 3Sc which I am
har>py to acknowledge but it is not one of the registration
criteria which we need for the purposes of the Inquest.

      Slood alcohols were estimated in this case as well
 as. in fact, all the others and Dr. Forrest gave the
 results for these on the first day, in fact, I tniiuv
 wore hero tho first day so you heard him, and the result
 in the case of Richard was loss than 10 mg/100 ml.
And you arc going to tell ir.e about a lac! vl'.o was -
identified to you as i l i chard Jones and you also had
an identification nuriboi* 63, I believe? — A. Yes, that
is rij^it.

C--ui you tell me then what tho pathological findings
arc relating to this nan? - A. Yes, sir, the body that
I examined was that of a heavily-built, brown-haired
yo'»:ng white nan, 179 cr.is in height, weighing 07 kgs.
There were obvious signs of traumatic asphyxia both
externally and internally*-. There vas very slight
dilatation of tho heart and s o e : c enlargement,   I
think that is probably physiological because ho was
not at an ago when hypertension is likely to have
caused that. In niy view he had an average e::pcctation
of life tirxl was normally developed.     I {jive tho cause
of dea.th as traumatic asphyxia.

And tliis vas another young man who had a tricostate
valve dilated? - A. Yes, I think that nay be terminal
really in heart failure right at the end.

In fact, both the valves ncrs marginally dilated but
you would say the sar.ie for both - that you think it
is likely to have been terminal? - A. Yes.

Not/, we have already heard this but loss of
consciousness.   T/hat would you say with regard to
that? — A. This young man died essentially because
he could not move his chest in or out and that meant,
of course, he could not breathe and that meant oxygen
was cut off to his vital organs and, once that chest
was fixed, he would have       been unconscious *in a matter
of seconds, probably between 10 and 20 seconds, and
ho would be completely unknowing of anything that
happened subsequent to that, though he would take a
matter of minutes, perhaps between h and 6 minutes,
to di e .
But once ho was unconscious he v/ould not know anything
more about it? - A. That is right.

                1W Kil. Fit* Sin:

prof. Usher, can you help a little about the alcohol
content. It is recorded in this young man as ’’less
than 10 mg", is that because the level is so small
that it is difficult to measure it accurately? -
A. Yes, it is.
                                                                    ?('T.   •..




                          Tii.-v young nan ir.ay have l".c> r-o alcohol at •''•11
                                  t"’o apparatus tlr\t they do usr - I ar.s not a
                          bioc'-’crsist - it it quite customary to e:r;rcsc- it

                          to 10 but it nay moan none at all.

                          ^tit if it vrfj.ro none at all, presumably it would show
                          r-3 p. distinct negative? l.’hat I hove in nir.d is tho
                          evidence that we hoard on the first day r.bout some tines
            B             when somebody loses their life there is almost a
                          spontaneous production of alcohol within tho body
                          and could the operation of that producc a reading of
                          a very snail alcohol level within tho body? - >-• Yes,
                          t suppose it could but only a very snail level.

                   Q. And that could bo less than 10? - A. Ch, yes.
                          Than!: yon, I'rof. - A. 'Ihero is no evidence at all to
                          show that this boy had in iiira any amount of alcohol
                          that would have affccted his judgment or balance or
                          anything lilce that at alls

                          It certainly played no part in his death so fax’ as you
                          arc aware? - A. Absolutely right.
            D
                                       Further by TTH?. COROHDR;

                          Prof. XJsher, I do want to just clear this up because
                          Dr. ITorrost dealt with the question of yeast
                          production of alcohol and in his opinion, r.*y recollection
                          is, because the high alcohol levels were not present
                          ho :~,r.id that he was satisfied that indigenous produc­
            E             tion of alcohol had not occurred because he could not
                          find any of the higher alcohols? - A. Yes.

                   ri.    iiov, I want to be quite sure - do you disagree with
 #                        •)r. Forrest? - A. ITo.
                          Cr not, with regard to tho possibility .... - A. No,
                          I do not disagree with him. He lenows about the higher
                          alcohols. I did not know that. I have only beer-
                          given the figures with regard to ethyl alcohol but I
                          would accept that argument from him.

                          7culd it be right that what you c-re really saying is
                          that it is true that indigenous production ox
                          alcohol can occur in the body? - A. Yes, I agree with
                          tV.::.t,
                          You arc not saying that, in this particular instance,
                          it did occur? - A. ITo, I could not say that.

                    * •
                          ’.Jhut ,rou are saying is that measuring less tr.an 10

                           1r.^basically? - A. Or to nothing.

                 sister, 1'i.os Stephanie Linda Jones together with
                 Tracey ’Sliyabcth Co::. TIio Court has already hoard,
                 iilr, that Tracoy also lost hor life at IIillt'sooroui2:i!.
                 It ’./as their intention to attend the Semi Final football
                 match which was to be played at the Hillsborough
                 Stadium that day. All three persons had tickets for
                 the tcrraccs at tlxs Vest Stand.
             D
                 Cn arrival at tho stadium they joined a largo crowd
                 outside the Loppings Lc.no turnstiles. After some
                 minutes they entered the stadium via Gate C and walked
                 together olong the tunnel beneath tho West Stand and
                 onto tho terraces.    Stephanie is unable to say which
                 oncloGurc they entered but it has now been establish od
                 as Jsiclosuro Ho. 3. Stephanie was with her brother
                 and Tracey as they entered the tcrraccs and, after a
                 few seconds, Tracey wac subjected to a surge of
                 pressure which forced her towards the front of the
                 terracing.   In    > crush thnt followed she was sepr.ratcd
                 from botli hor brother and Tracey.

                 Followin'? the severe crushing in the Vest Stand
                 terracing, Police Constable Paul Dromley wont onto
                 the pitch and assisted a number of injured persons.
                 The officer saw that a number of supporters were
                 carrying a nan, no-..' known to be Richard, across the
                 pitch on a hoarding which was being used as a temporary
                 stretcher. The officer assisted to carry'- ?J.chard to

     .Tri’ccy Co?:.

      Sir, there arc three photographs, including a
      photograph referenced D21/6, which show Ilichax'd
      lyi^iT ort the pitch being tended to by supporters.

      «'r. and M r s . Jones have, in fact, viewed visual
      evidence, sir, and they have been able to assist us
      in confirming the-t evidence.

     PC Bromley has signed a plan of the pitch indicating
     where ho first saw Richard and th&t plan is referenced
     r.-j/i.

     Sir, if I can, first of all, refer you to a plan which
     has been given the reference number KI/JL 167.

0.    That      willbe C22S. - A, And then a further plan,
              113» which is a plan of the terraces,

 . Tilat   willbe C229 .               -    A. And,           sir, P]j/1 , which is PC
   Bromley*s plan.

 • That will be C230. — A. Sir, first of all, in respect
   of the plan I-"'JL I 6 7 , regarding tho identificaticn
   outside the ground, referring to this plan, the point
   at Vjiich that photograph is shown is in this location
   hero, which, as you have already heard, is, in fact,
   yei'y close to Gate C. In respect of the video
   identification inside the ground I refer to plan
         113. This is Enclosure ITo. 3 and the video
   identification on BBC tape MAP 1, we believe, is in
   this position h e r e . As I have said, at that time,
   Richard is still alive and with Tracey.

   A. 'Jo did not use the sane plan, sir ....

1. I am sorry, I meant the sane video? - A. They are
   actually together, yes.    Sir, PC Bromley's plan,
   P-f/lf the plan of the pitch, the location shown is
   in this position he r e, at the Loppings Lane end but
   further down the pitch.

1. And remind me,          that is a recollection, is it not? -
   A. It is, sir,          yes.  Sir, unfortunately, in respect of
   the photograph          where Richard is shown actually being
   treated on the          pitch, it is not possible to say from
   tho photograph          where it is on the pitch. There is
   not sufficient          detail to identify it.

. Yes, there is a photograph showing him but you cannot
  locate it because there are no landmarks? - A. Ko.

     ITU FTcASE^: oir, will you just give me a minute
before you conclude this particular Inquest?

     Ti::; CCnOT.^R:     Yes.

           ZTIL-t.SETZ: Sir, there are two matters which
concern tho family which do not directly arise from tho
sumnr.r5.es which have been presented but which they would
like, if r.t all possible, you to der.l wit!-: to sr.tisfy
them.

     TI’S CCnCir?^*” :   Tut the first one then.

       l~l. FHAST':   Sir, it is clour fron- the very
ciota.ilocl report of Lord Justice Taylor thathis findings
were th:-.t alcohol played no signific:mt part in the
disaster on tho 15th April. That report has boon widely
published and thi3 family vould like perhaps to
understand a little more why such emphasis seems to
have been placed on the alcohol analysis.      Certainly on
the opening dt»y of these . . . .

     TirD CCTIC'iZZZ: Can I interrupt you? I thin!: I did
say right at the bo ginning that we wore not go ins to
deal with the question of how and I thinlc it is only fair
to say that we have not introduced Lord Justice Taylor*s
report into this Inquiry and whilst, of course, that
report is public property, so to speak, I would not want
it to bo put to tho Jury that that is the conclusion of
Lord Justice Taylor*s report. It r.iay be or it may not
be. 'Jhon the time comes, if it is relevant, wo will
deal with it so I cannot accept as a submission that
that is corroct. You nay put it forward as a vie;: but
I am not accepting it as a proposition or as evidence
of that fact, that ho concluded this or that about
alcohol* I an sorry but I have got to say that.

     Your second point, I think I have understood, your
second point. If I have not, of course, you will correct
me. The second point is they say why are we dealing
with tho question of alcohol levels.  That is right, is
it not?

     i-Sl. FRASER: Perhaps more why such emphasis appears
to have been placed upon it.

       THS CCRCinSR:. The decision as to what evidence to
call, of course, is“ nine. I do not think we have placed
j^jjy undue onphasxs on alcohol, on the contrary, I tuxnk
at this stage we have not because all I am doing is
recording the fact, not drawing any conclusions, because
that would impinge on the issues of how or why which I,
as you know, specifically excluded.    Perhaps I ought to
just say, Hr. Fi'aser - and forgive me if I say that -
that the issue of alcohol has been a matter of great
moment to a lot of tho families. They wanted the figures.
They wanted to know it. Xf I had suppressed the
information I think I would have beer, open to very serious
criticism and so I do pot actually ^fiept the proposition
    that vo are jiviii'; it vuvdur                  e:-:phasiis but X da accept
    that, within each and ..-vory                   cayc, ;.-c jive the f
    ijcjcr.uno that ic part of the                  evidence. '.l.ut relevance,
    if any, it I:c.c we '..'ill deal                with Sue.: wo ccr.o----

    further uvide-ice to cell :.?.d I will tlic : call vnatcver
    witnesses w-j need to deal with that question. Jena
    that      you or your clients?
B
                                   I hope so, sir, yes.

            Tho second point really relates to the condition
    of r.’.cmy of the fans who appear to have died. Gr* the
    day there v.'ore no mutilated - if I can use tl.'-’t word -
    bodies and wo have hoard evidence that the majority of
    funs had coc'.o bluo discolouration but there was no
    apparent aeeuratc diagnosis made at the crouml and
    Hi chard*s fri'ily would like to know why perhaps their
    son v/as not taken to hospital and just assumed that lie
    1/o.s dor.d and resuscitation attempts made at the
    hospital,

        TTT.v CC.^CirSIl: l!r. Fraser, I understand their
  cone c m behind tho question but I thinlc that each and
D ever)' fan, as you know, every one of the people who
  died, i/as certified dead either at the hospital or at
  tho ground by a properly qualified medical man. That
  is the first point.       That has to be appreciated. It
  is net a question of people just saying "He’s dead".
  l>very single one was looked at medically.      Secondly,
  one lias to think back to tho situation. In an ideal
  world it i:ji‘y bo that everybody should finish up i:i
E hospital but, fron: a practical point of view - I do
  not want to deal vitli this any further because I do
  not think we can - but fron a practical point of vis-..'
  it is, with all due rcspoct to your clients, an
  unrealistic expectation in the situation in which
  everybody foLipd t homo elves on that day and it is no
  ur.o uiucin-^ words and seying anything different.      I
  think that that is the truth of the matter.

        Thirdly, I cannot say what people*s judgments
  were at the tine. If that is a relevant point, ar.d it
  nitfbt be when we come to deal with tire quostier, of hov,
  then jy'.in we v:ill deal with it at that sta^-e but it
  is net appropriate to deal with it now. I arn ccr.ccrr.cd,
  in a sense, about tho question because I think it shows,
  with the greatest*of-respect, a misconception as to
  the practicalities of tho situation and also the truth,
  of the natter. 'Jc have heard fron I:rof. Usher and what
  he said about loss of consciousness, duration, length
  of time that it wight take for somebody to die - oven
  if they had {jone to hospital half-an-Iiour ox- an hour
  later it v/ould not have made any difference. I thinlc
  we have ;;ot to face it. That is tho truth. I an not
H very helpful but I think that that is tho best I can do.
  Anyway i-'c will have to deal with that, if «re deal with
  it, as part and parcel of thq how™                      ^
                                                                                           11

     MR. PAYNE:   Before you resume, sir, the lawyers
present would like to thank you for the courtesy in
arranging transport this morning. Thank you very much.

     THE CORONER:   Before I say anything else I would like
to thank Hr. Catchpole and, through Hr. Catchpole, the Club
for making it available, having everything unlocked, having
people there and being more than helpful. I am most
grateful to you.  I think, although I have seen it before,
it was helpful to see it again. You must remember that it
has changed a little bit. You will have noticed that.   I
do not have to point out to you that there were no
perimeter fences and so on but one learns a lot, does one
not?

     MR. KING:   Before Miss Jones starts her evidence,
sir, can I tell you something that I have been asked on her
behalf to tell you?

      THE CORONER:    Yes, please.

     HR. KING:   She has identified herself on one of the
photographs which has already been produced to the Inguest
which is C.295.

     THE CORONER:     Yes, we will put it up at a convenient
point.

     MR. KING:   I know she wanted you to know that from
the beginning, sir.

                  STEPHANIE LINDA JONES Sworn

                        By THE CORONER:

Q. You are Stephanie Linda Jones, is that right? - A.
   Yes.

Q.
     that is right, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it mum and dad who are here? - A. Yes.

Q. You are I think a receptionist? - A. Yes.

Q. Or you were at that time? - A. Yes.

Q. You are in fact the sister of Richard Jones, are you
   not, who unfortunately lost his life at Hillsborough?
   - A. Yes.
                                                             6

Q. Of course, technically you were not related to Tracey
   but she was Richard's girlfriend, was she not, and
   she unfortunately lost her life which is very sad
   obviously? - A. Yes.

Q. I want you to tell me as much as you can and as much
   as you feel able.  I will ask you questions like I
   did with all the other witnesses and we will see how
   we get on. Okay? - A. Yes.

Q. Richard was a season ticket holder I think? - A. Yes,
   that is correct.
Q. Initially he got two tickets because I think it was
   just him and you who were going to go to the match? -
   A. Yes, that is right.

Q. I think that Tracey decided she would like to come as
   well, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.   He got another ticket? -   A. Yes.

Q.    In fact he asked you to get a ticket for Tracey? - A.
     Yes.

Q. He was actually living in Sheffield, was he not,
   Richard? - A. Yes.

Q. It was easier for you to go to the club than for him?
   - A. Yes.

Q.    You got the £12 ticket I think for   Tracey which is
     for the stand? - A. Yes, my father    got it from the
     ground.

Q. Somebody in the family went to the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. As it happens your mum came home that day and she had
   another one and so you finished up with four? - A.
   Yes, that is right.

Q. Hers was a £14 ticket for the stands? - A .     Yes.

Q. You took them.  Did you have ail four or did you have
   just these two and Richard have the other two? - A. I
   had three and Richard had his own.

Q. You looked after them and on the 14th'April, the day
   before the Friday, in the evening you came to
   Sheffield by train? - A. Yes.

                                                     S. L. JONES
Q. Because you had somewhere to stay, that is right, is


Q . Tracey had also come or she may have been here
    already? - A. She lived in Sheffield as well.    They
    both went to university there.

Q. You all went out that evening. Where did you go as a
   matter of interest? - A. The Broom Hill Tavern pub
   just at the bottom of the road for just one drink.
Q.   You had a nice time? - A. Yes.

Q.    Looking forward to the match I expect at thattime? -
     A. Yes.

Q. In the morning of the 15th you had an extra ticket at
   that point, did you not? - A. We had to swap one of
   them because otherwise Tracey would not be with us.
Q. You wanted her with you? - A. Yes.

Q. So Richard had his breakfast and he went off and
   exchanged the £12 ticket with a friend, is that
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. This was really a private arrangement? - A. Yes.     His
   friend obviously wanted to sit down.

Q. He was getting a good deal, was he not? - A. The more
   expensive ticket.

Q* ^ seems to me the sensible thing to have done. He
   then came back and so you had thiree tickets for the
   terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened to the fourth one? - A. Before we went
   to the ground we went and apparently Richard knew
   some friend who wanted the other ticket and he was
   going to sell them the tickets.

Q. He knew somebody, did he? - A. It was a friend of a
   friend.

Q. Again it was a private arrangement? - A. Yes, it was
   just to get rid of the ticket rather than sell it at
   the ground.

Q. Then I think you had something to each for lunch.
   You had a light lunch. - A. Yes.

Q. Kt about 1.15 or so did you set off for the ground'5 -
   A. No, I think we had lunch about that time.

Q. I am sorry? - A. We had lunch at -that time.   It was
   after that. Just after two some time.
Q. Just after two? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you walk or drive? - A. No, we drove.

Q. Because it was too far? - A. Yes.

Q. How long did it take you to drive to wherever you
   parked? - A. We drove to meet somebody at a pub to
   give them the tickets which was on the other side of
   the ground.

Q. I am sorry? - A. It was to the other side of the
   ground, the public house.  I am not sure of the name.

Q. You do not know which pub it was., do you? - A. No.

Q. Did you then park in that car park of the pub or did
   you park somewhere else? - A. No, we parked in the
   car park.

Q. When you say the other side of the ground, are you
   saying he was at the Nottingham Forest side? - A. No,
   it was right over the other end "of the city really.

Q. It was a long way away? -   a   . Yes.

Q. Were there supporters in that pub? - A. No, it was
   very empty.

Q. Richard's friend’s friend was there and you got the
   tickets? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you stop for a quick drink? - A. Yes, we had one
   drink.

Q. What did Richard have? - A. He had a pint of beer.

Q. That is all he had? - A. That is all.

Q. What time was it when you got to that pub? - A. I am
   not really sure.  It was only about fifteen minutes
   away from the house.

Q. From home and you left about two I think you said? -
   A. Yes.

   not have to be to the second. Then I think you
   stayed at the pub tot: about another fifteen minutes
   or so? - A. Yes.

Q. -So in round terms that would be about 2.30, would
   that be fair? - A. About.

Q. We are not pinning you down to a minute or two or
   anything like.

Q. How did you then get from this pub to the ground? -
   A. It was Tracey *s car and she drove to the ground.
   She doesn't drink at all really.

Q. How long did it take to drive to the ground would you
   say? - A. About fifteen, ten or fifteen minutes.

Q. Then you had to park? - A. Yes, in Far Lane.

Q. Which is quite close to the ground? - A. Yes,   not far
   away.

Q. You were fortunate then to find a space? - A. Yes.

Q. From where you parked you then walked to the ground,
   is that right? - A. Yes, that is true.

Q. That would have taken you how many more minutes? - A.
   About ten minutes.

Q. Again if we add it all up we get to about ten to
   three? - A. Yes.

Q. Would that be about right? - A. That would seem about
   right.

Q. Would you agree? If you do not agree please say
   so? - A. Something like that. I am not sure but
   something like that.

Q. I am just adding up the times with ten minutes here
   and ten minutes there. Did you see lots of fans
   first of all on your drive to Farndale Road? - A. No,
   not on the way to Far Lane, no.

Q. When you parked and got out? - A. The nearer we got
   to the ground the more fans.

                                S. L. JONES

Q.   Are you a football supporter yourself, generally
     speaking? - A. Not on a regular basis.  I have only
     been to Anfield maybe 4 or 5 times, and not away at


Q.   So you are not really an experienced football
     attender? - A. No.

Q.   You had not   been to Hillsborough   before, had you? ~ A.
     No.

Q.   So you were not there in 1988? - A.      No, Richard had.

Q.   Richard had but you had not? - A.     No.

Q.   As you were walking towards the ground you were
     walking down Leppings Lane, or up Leppings Lane, I am
      told, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.   Firstly, I want to make sure we have got the right
     road. What is the map number? Is it 284? Yes,
     0.284. Just put it up.    I will just make sure I have
     not misremerabered the road - Farndale. - A. Far Lane.

Q.   I thought perhaps I was getting it wrong.  Do you know
     where it is on that map? - A.  I didn't know at the
      time. It was only afterwards I found out where it
     wa s .

Q.   It is Far Lane - F-A-R did you say? - A. I think it is
     double RR - F-A-R-R, is it?

Q.   In that case, I was thinking of the wrong road. I was
      thinking of Farndale.  I do not know where Far Lane is
     either.   Is it off the map?

          HR. HALE:   I can show it to you, sir.

          THE CORONER: Mr. Hale, thank you very much.   I
     see. It is what I would call below Wadsley Lane, not
     that far from the ground, you are right, but not the
     one I had in mind anyway.
Q.   You are saying that you walked from that road all the
     way to the ground? - A. Yes.

Q.   I do not suppose for a minute you can remember the
     names of the roads you walked down? - A. No, I cannot.

Q.   I will have to go over the ground again. Were  you on
     your own when you were walking there, or were there
     other supporters walking with you? - A. To begin with
     there wasn't many at all.
                                                               9


                                                               11




                                S.     L.   JONES


Q. ' At one point did you start picking up other
     supporters? - A. I don't know. After 5 minutes we
     started seeing a few and then it just got more and
     more.

Q.   They were all walking down towards the ground as far
     as you were concerned? - A. Yes.

Q.   What was their behaviour like? - A. Happy;    they were
     singing.  It was just normal.   I did think there was
     an awful lot of people but it was justnormal.

Q.   Just as a matter of interest, did you see people
     carrying any cans? - A. No, Ididn't.

Q.   None at all?   - A.   No, none.

Q.   You have told me they were singing and other people
      have described that I think as jolly. Would you use
      that word or not? - A. Yes.

Q.   But you were not frightened in any way? - A. No. I
     did think there was an awful lot of people but I
     hadn't been to that many matches so I just assumed it
     was normal.

Q.   Nobody did anything to you.  I do not mean in the
     sense of hitting you, but did people swear at you, or
     anything like that? - A. No, there was no problem at
     all.

Q.   Good.   Then you approached the ground - right? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   As you got towards the turnstiles, which-you had not
      seen before, this was the first time? - A. I didn't
      see them at all.

Q.    You did not see them at all? - A. The whole     time.

Q*   Tell me what you saw? - A.Nothing, just a        mass of
     people as they went towards the ground.

Q.   I see, so the nearer you got, the thicker the crowd? -
     A. Yes.

Q.   And right at the ground it      was an absolute mass of
     people? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you see any police officers, just as a matter of
     interest? - A. I had noticed I had hardly seen any,
     and then like once I got near the ground I saw one
     officer directing traffic, that was all, and then
     nearer the ground, or once we were in the mass, I saw
                         S. L.   JONES


one policeman on horseback and then further back there
were two more on horseback amongst the crowd.

So what you are saying is as far as you remember, you
saw one officer who was directing traffic?--. A. Yes.

Was it near a traffic light, a little bit higher up? -
A. Yes.

Then as you got nearer to the ground your recollection
is of a police officer on horseback? - A. Yes.

Where was he? - A. That was more when we got right
into the crowd, right near the gates.

Then a little bit further in there were another two? -
A.No, there were two quite far out, out of the crowd.

Do you mean towards the roadway, that is what I am
trying to find out? - A. On the outside of the crowd,
where the bulk of the crowd was.

I see. When you saw all this crowd of people there
what did you think? - A. I just wondered why there
were so many people there really.

Was the crowd at that point moving, as far as you can
remember? - A. Sort of shuffling.   They didn't seem
to be going in any sort of direction.

When happened? Did you, Richard and Tracy join in     at
the back? - A. Yes, there seemed no other place to    go.

Did other people join you behind? - A. Yes.

I think that as the people joined you behind, you
started feeling a push forward, is that right? - A.
The pressure of people, yes.

So there was pressure behind you? - A. Yes.

Which was tending to make you go forward? - A.   Yes.

That presumably meant that you were getting closer and
closer to people ahead of you all the time, is that
right? - A. Yes.

You and Tracy and Richard were trying to hold hands
because you wanted to stay together but people tended
to separate you, is that right? - A. Yes.

How did that happen? Just tell me how that happened.
Did they push between you, or what happened? - A. It
is just normal.  People are just moving along. You
                           S.   L.   JONES


'can't seem to stay in a whole bunch together.         It is
 just impossible. That always happens.

When this was happening, can you remember - you may
not be able to remember - at the ground the outer
perimeter gates, the sort of blue gates with railings
on them? Can you remember those at all? - A. No, I
J £ L tw ° ? mber,£°in8 t£rough ^ o s e . I did go through
them but I can't remember.

What I am trying to find out is when you are saying
you were being pushed, do you think that you had gone
through these outer gates, or had you not reached them
then         think I had probably gone through them by

Okay.   Were you going through on the right-hand side?
  A#    X6S •

Was that because Richard said, "That's the turnstiles
that we need , or what? - A. I didn't see the
turnstiles at all. It was just the movement.   That
was the only way sort of thing.

But he had been before so presumably you were relying
   a certain extent upon his knowledge, were you not?
- A. I suppose so.

Yes. At some point I think you saw some blue metal
gates. Can you remember that? - A. Yes.

What sort of gates were they? - A.       Large like.

We have called them concertina*gates.        - A.   Yes, that
is right.

I will just show you a picture of one.   I am not
saying this is the gate you saw because we have not
yet established which gate you saw, but I think it is
<0 ;*. I think there are two of them on. No, it has
only got one of them on. This is probably not the one
that you went through, but that sort of gate, is that
right? “ A* I would say so, yes#

If you look at 261, that is a close-up of this sort of
gate - yes? - A. I think so.

Something of that sort? - A.     Yes.

1      that type of Sate.  It was not a gate with
railings or anything like that? - A. There was such a
mass of a crowd, you couldn't really see.
                                                          14



                               S. L . JONES


Q. "Okay. At this gate was there a policeman? - A.    Not
    that I saw.

Q.   You did see a policeman on horseback, I think, did    you
      not? - A. He was in the middle of the crowd, yes.

Q.   He was not at this gate; he was further away from    you
      then? - A . No, I think he was towards the second
     gate, yes.

                      Q.   Which second gate
                                                                 15


                                                     5.   L . JOHES




Q.   Which second gate are we talkin’        about?- A. Gate C.
Q.   Gate C? - A. Yes.

Q.   That is that gate ovec there, in fact? - A. Yes.

Q.    what was he trying to do a s fa c as you c o u H tall? - A.
     He was trying to split tne crowd.

Q. Was he having any success? - A. No.

0.    Is that because nobody took any notice of hi;.i? - A. Ho,
     it was just the sheer anount of people there uas. i!e
     just had no chance on his own, and there was just
     nobody else around.   It was just it was an impossible
     task for nia to perform.

Q. So the only way he could have succeeded would have been
   if everybody had obeyed him instantly? - A . ?.*o, I think
   it he had had noire manpower it would have helped,
   rather than if everyone had obeyed him.

Q« J- agree with you there, obviously the more people you
   nave the easier a task becomes, but are you saying that
   if people had obeyed him he would still not have had
   any success? - A. I can't really answer that.   I mean,
   * tried to get over to the right because you don't want
   the horse trampling on you, but the sheer amount of
   people you couldn't move that far across anyway.

Q. In fact, did the crowd pressure, if anything, become
   even stronger at tnat point? - A. Yes, it did.

Q. Did you feel uncomfortable at that point? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you a bit worried about yourself? - A. Yes, I got
   pushed right up against the gate and ray a m was
   trapped.

0. So really you were in quite a difficult position then,
   weren t you? - A. Yes.

Q. Tracey was still near you and so w as Richard, is that
   right? - A. Yes.

0. And I take it they were in tne same sort of condition
   as you were? - A. Yes.

0. There were another two Police Officers, weren't tnere,
   whoa you mentioned? Where were they? - A. Thev were
   out of the crowd towards the back, I did notice.

Q. Could you see what thay were trying to do? - A. i»'o. 1
   couldn't see.                                       *
You might not have been able to see because of them
being too far away or because of the crowd, but you
just saw thera because they were elevated, is that
right? - A. Yes. I just noticed because this one was,
the first one, was right in the middle of the melee of
the crowd, but the other two were right outside where
the crowd was.

While you were approaching this gate, before you had
actually got hard onto it, had it opened at all? - A.
It was opened once.  I saw it open once.

You saw it open once? - A. Yes.

On that opening you didn*t get through on that
occasion, did you? - A. No.

That is presumably because you were too far awav from
it, is that right? - A. Well, yes.

And also was that opening - it didn't last very long,
did it? - A. No, only a couple of seconds.

On that occasion, just help me on this because I am
just trying to fix the openings, did people come
through, did people actually go through the gate? - A.
I think three or four, perhaps, people went through -
not raany though.

Some did - it wasn't opened wide at that tine? - A. No

And I think having got up against this gate, I think
Richard said, "If it opens again we are going in?” - A
We had no choice, otherwise it would have been a lot
worse.

In fact, a little while Later that is exactly what
happened, it opened? - A. Yes.

But it opened wide out, is that right? - A. It opened
right across.

And you could see   that it was a Policeman who was
opening the gate?   - A. Yes.

Certainly it was an official person? - A. Yes.

Did he open it all the way by himself or did he begin
to open it and did fans then assist to open it
further?- A. Tne fans helped because everyone had been
screaming for him to open it because we couiri see
something was going to happen outside if he didn't,
because everyone was screaking for hi.-a to open it.
                                                                  17

C. So what you are saying is that the gate began to open
   and you could see it was a Policeman, and then the fans
   started opening it with him? -A. The fans on the
   inside - tnere was fans on the inside.

Q. In fact, what happened then with regard to the fans and
   that gate? - A. They pulled it wide open and we forced
   ourselves sort of to the side and in, and got into the
   clearing, then I think a whole load caae right through
   all together with the force.

Q. There was initially quite a rush in, because people had
   been squashed tight against it, would that be right? -
   A. Yes. It was like taking a cork out of a bottle,
   sort of thing.

Q. Anyway, you managed to get into what is called the
   concourse area and it was a bit better in there, wasn't
   it? - A. Yes, it wasn’t packed at all.

Q. Because there was a lot      of space, relatively speaking?
   - A. Yes.

Q. What happened then? - A. Me and      Richard had both gone
   through together because he had      been just in front of
   me, and we got through together      and then we just waited
   for Tracey and she carae through     just in a matter of
   minutes, and joined us.

Q. Where did you go then? - A. We just - I could only see,
   well, we could all only see the tunnel, and Richard
   said to just go down the tunnel, so we just stood there
   for a minute or so, and I thought everything was okay
   then because it was pretty clear in there, and then we
   just started to walk down the tunnel.

Q. So by the time you went down the tunnel, you are saying
   it was reasonably clear, is that right? - A. Yes, it
   was.

          MISS ADDLEMAN:   Sir, we are having difficulty in
     hearing the witness at this end.

         THE CORONER:       He or the witness?

          KISS ADL/LEHAU:     The witness, sir.

0.        THE CORONER:   Can you sit a little bit further
     forward? You have got to get quite close to these
     mikes. You were saying that when you went into the
     tunnel it was reasonably clear? - A. Yes, it was.

Q. But there were people walking down? - A. Yes, normally.
                                                              18

                                                S.   L.   JJuES




Q. A normal   walk? - A. Yes.

Q. In fact,   you did actually sea one or two people, not.
   that many, who were passing water down the side of the
   tunnel, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. That wasn't something which you would have necessarily
   approved of but you weren't too concerned at that
   point? - A. I wasn't surprised.

Q. Can you remember - you may not be able to remember but
   were you   walking down the   tunnel in the niddle, the
   left side or the right side? - A. I can't really
   remember. We were probably spread right out.    We were
   probably walking together.

Q. Yes, because there were three of you? - A. Yes.

Q. When you got to the end of the tunnel, the tunnel goes
   along and then it has got a dip, hasn t it, and you can
   see the pitch, when you got just to exit of  the tunnel,
   was that part of the tunnel clear of people? - A. Yes,
   it was.

Q. So you were able to get onto the terrace without any
   particular obstruction at that point? - A. Yes.

0. Tell me, because obviously you were interested in the
   match, what was happening on the field at that point? -
   A. I didn’t look. We were just goin^ to try and get a
   place and then look. As far as I was concerned the
   match hadn't started.

Q. You don't think it had started? - A. lio.

Q. Can you recollect whether any players were on the
   field? - A. Ho, I didn't look at the pitch.

0. So you don't really know? - A. No.

Q. You then went on the terraces. 1 think you can't
   actually remember which terrace you went onto, that is
   right, isn't it? - A. That's ri^ht.

Q. But I think I am right in saying that on the
   photographs you found Richard in Pen 3? - A. Hen 3,
   that's right.

Q. And you can say that you were with him? - A. Yes.

Q. I mean, you entered the same pen as he did, that is
   right, isn't it? - A . Yes.
                                                            19


                                                S. L. JONES



Q. So it is a reasonable supposition that that is the pen
   you entered, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. You said to me just a moment ago that the tunnel was
   clear, the exit of the tunnel was clear, you managed to
   get onto the^ terrace and you were going into the right
   hand pen. Did you take up a viewing position? - A. No.

Q. So what happened? - A. We just started to walk down and
   then there just seemed like an awful lot of people came
   behind us and we started to get slowly moved forward
   then, sort of stumbling down the steps sort of thing.

Q. So when you initially went onto the tsrrace, it sounds
   to me from what you are saying that at that point you
   were not apprehensive. You were saying, "I want to
   find a viewing position", and you were walking down
   looking for some convenient spot? - A. Yes.

Q. That s right, and at that point how crowded would you
   say it was? Can you say anything about that? - A. Just
   a normal amount really.  I wasn't really worried. My
   worries had gone after we came off the clearing.

Q. Sorry? - A. My worries had gone when we came out into
   the clear part, and the tunnel, because I was
   frightened outside.

Q» It was outside that you were scared? — A. I was worried
   that it was going to be the same inside but I didn't
   think it was.

0. So once you got on the terrace you were relieved? - A.
   Yes.

Q. It looked better than it had been outside the gate,
   that's right? - A. It did.

Q. And then you say — - was there some crowd that caoe
   from behind and pushed you, a sudden push, or what was
   *t? “ A. First of all it was a gradual movement, sort
   of tning, just moving down as though tnere was a lot of
   people coming in behind us.

Q. Behind, yes. - A. Yes, and then it started to get more
   and more surges, sort of thing.

0. In your statement you have put it a little more
   graphically.   You said:                        —

        "Then I was suddenly shoved from behind and I was
        thrown forward down the steps."

   I haven't said this to you, but I have said it to one or
   two of the witnesses, it doesn't actually matter what
   happened.   All I am trying to find out is as far as you
   can remember what happened and you tell me now so the
   jury can get the picture of what you can recollect.    Can
   we just go over that again?   I am interested to know
   whether this was, as you put it, a sudden shove, that you
   were shoved from behind, or whether it was just a very
   gradual pressure? - A. To begin with it started off
   gradually and then a shove came.

Q. How far down the terrace were you moved, if that is the
   right word, can you say? - A. I have got no idea really,
   probably three-quarters.   I really don't know.

Q. I think this particular surge actually stopped at that
   point and there was a little bit of relief is that right?
   - A. Yes.   Well, Tracey had fell down behind me and
   there was a gap where she had fallen.   A lot of
   supporters picked her up but she had lost   hershoe.

Q. She had lost her shoe at that point?   - A.        Hershoe,        yes.

Q. Can you remember what was going on   on the field at that
   point? - A. No, I was turned round   looking at her.   I
   really hadn't paid any attention.

Q. Did you look at the field at all at around that time? -
   A. No.

Q. So you can't help me at all on that?   - A.        No.

Q. In fact somebody picked her shoe up, is that right? - A.
   Yes.   I couldn t reach it so they picked it up.

Q. But somebody managed to get down and give it to her and
   so she was pleased about that at the time? - A. Yes.

Q. Then what happened after that? - A. Really big surges
   came.   I didn't see Richard or Tracey again after- that.
   In fact I don't even know whether she put her shoe on.

Q. You just managed to get it and then there was another big
   surge? - A. Yes.

Q. That surge split you from Tracey and Richard, of course?
   - A. Yes.

0.   You never saw them again after that until much later of
     course.   Were youpushed against any barriers? - A. No,
     not at all.

Q. Where did you eventually finish up, you yourself? - A*
   Right at the very front, turned round facing the back.

Q. Facing the wrong way, so to speak? - A. Facing the wrong
   way, yes.

Q. When you got down there can you remember what was
   happening with the match?   You may think I am being
   cruel in keep asking that, but it is a convenient way of
   timing things, you see, that is why I am asking you. - A.
   No, I can't because I was turned round the wrong way.    I
   have no idea.

Q.   So really you never saw anything at all of what happened
     on the pitch? - A. No.

Q. If you did you can't remember any of it? - A. Well, until
   I got out.

Q. At that point you were pretty squashed, is that right? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Were you calling out at all?     Were you able to call out?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember more or less what you said? - A. "I've
   got to get out."

Q. Was this in a loud voice or in a little'gentle voice? -
   A. Yes, 1 was screaming.

Q. Were you able to repeat it? - A. Yes,     a few times.

Q. How did    you get out? - A. There is a bit of confusion.   I
   am not really sure.     I was faced the wrong way.    I was
   literally face to face with another boy, like nose to
   nose.    I couldn't see anything.    I thought I was s^oing
   to faint and I just heard somebody say at my side. Here
   you are, love," and I sort of stepped on to the pitch, or
   somebody pulled me.     It is not been found exactly how I
   got out.

Q. So your   recollection is that you juststepped out? - A.
   That is   what it felt like to me but I think somebody must
   have pulled me.

Q. In fact I think we have seen you on the video? - A. Yes.
                                      S. L. J O N E S

Standing near the perimeter fence.   Do you remember
seeing this young lady?   Having got out did you look at
the pitch at all? - A. Yes, I was facing the pitch then.

What was going on at that point? - A. They were pla/ing.

So all this you have described happened before the match,
and including your exiting out of...   You weren't pulled
over the top? - A. No, out of the gates.

Definitely out of the gates before the match ended, or
was stopped, rather? - A. Well, it had probably just
started as I was getting out.

You don't know   that, of course? - A. Well, all I can
assume is thatit had already started because as I got
out of the gates I turned round and I was facing the
television camera and the match was playing.

Was the television camera looking at the match or at the
stand? - A. No, it was turned round to me.

It was already   taking pictures of what was going on?   - A.
I just looked and it was just right on me.

That is why we have got it, of course. - A. Yes.

So that shot of you which is on the television was taken
almost immediately after you got out, is that right? - A.
Well, immediately, yes.

That shot is timed so we will be able to look at it
again.   I can't remember what time is on it but we will
be able to time what time that was, but do you remember
from your impression how long the game carried on after
that? - A. Maybe five minutes at the most.

A short period? - A. Yes.

I don't want to go into this in great detail, but when
you were standing outside did you notice some fans come
past you and go into another part of the ground? - A.
Yes, that's right.

Which pen did they go into? - A. The corner one on the
right.

Is it the one underneath the police control box?   If you
were standing with your back to the fence, did they come
past you towards the right or towards the left? - A. They
were walking past me from the right.   I think they came
out of the gate after me because I think I was...
                                                             23



                                           S. L. J O N E S

Q. Hi'gh up, and they were coming past you going to the south
   stand side, would that be right? - A. Well , I am not sure
   of the layout of the ground, but the corner.

Q. Can we put the plan of the ground up for a moment. * It
   is not that important but I am just interested.  (C.274)
   Mr. Griffiths could you just point to enclosure 3?   That
   is gate 3?    That is the one where you... - A. Came out.
   yes.

Q. Then point to pen 4.   That  is pen 4. Are you saying
   they came from that part and were walking past you
   down... Is that right? - A. I don't think they were
   coming out of pen 4.

Q. No, but there were people who were walking past you in
   that direction? - A. They were coming out justbehind me,
   out of the gate I came out of.

Q. Oh, I see.    I understand you now.  You are saying there
   were people coming out... - A. Yes, because I think I was
   the first or second person out of the gate and then a few
   more followed and then the police were taking them across
   to. the corner.

Q. I just want to go back one moment.    You know the big
   gates that opened when you came outside the ground, the
   concertina gates.    Can you recollect whether you were
   one of the first people to come through on that occasion?
   - A. Through the gates?

0.   Yes, through that big gate.- A. No, not the first
     person.

0. No, I didn't mean the first.   Uhat I meant was were you
   in what I would call the first group of people who came
   through do you think? - A. Yes, possibly.

0. You then waited for a little while because Tracey had to
   join you, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. You don't know how long you waited? - A. It was only a
   few seconds really. She just didn't get in with our
   surge, sort of thing.

Q. There wasn't any delay.   You didn't go to the loo or
   anything like that? - A. No.

Q. As far as you were concerned, we know what time that gate
   opened, the big concertina gate, you had a fairly rapid
   passage right through that? - A. Yes.
                                                                     24



                                               S. L. J O N E S

    ^^ fact there was a very nice man who came up to you at
    some point and comforted you and tried to help and look
    after you? - A. Yes.

 Q. Are you still in touch with him? - A. Sometimes, yes.

Q. He was a supporter? - A. Yes, a Liverpool supporter.

Q. Shall we give his name, do you think? - A. If you want.

Q. Was he Phil Bickley? - A. Yes.

Q. We are not calling him as a witness but it is nice to
   acknowledge what he was doing.   Now what is the number
   ot • * *

            MR. KING:      C.295, sir.

        THE CORONER:   Can we put C.295 up?   Now this is
   tne photograph you are on and we will just show it to
   you.                                  J

        MR. KING:   Sir, if it helps, the time of this
   photograph is 14.54.

            THE CORONER:     That does help:

0. Are you able to see yourself on that projection? - A.
   X6 S •


Q. Go and show us where you are. - A. That's me, that's
   Tracey and that's Richard.

Q. So you are in fact in line.     You have just heard - in
   fact you can read the time on   the bottom ofit, that is
   six minutes to three, or possibly five.

        THE CORONER:         Is it oneminute wrong?       Which wav
   is the minute?

        MR. KING:   Sir, the actual time is 14.54.               Printed
   on the photograph is a minute too long, sir.

        THE CORONER:         So it is 14.54 - six minutes before
   the...:

Q. At that point you were still outside, weren't you? - A.

Q* The gate I can tell you was opening because people were
   coming through and presumably this is when you were
   following them in, is that right? - A. It seems so.

                                                       5. L. JONES
    Q. If you look at that photograph you can see it. That
       is exactly the same photograph and it saves you
       turning round every few moments.  That gate I will
B      tell you had been opened at 14:48 for a moment or' two
       for just a short moment and then it had been
       closed? - A. Yes.

    Q. Then it had been fully opened at 14:52. That is two
       minutes before this photograph is taken. The
       question 1 want to ask you is this; looking at that
       photograph and thinking about what you told me you
       said that you were pushed hard up against the gate
       when it was shut. You are sure about that, are
       you? - A. Yes, I was sure.

    Q. There was another opening of this gate. This gate
       was shut at three minutes to three. Do you remember
       we had a schedule.  14:57:40. .At 14:57 this gate was
       shut again and then it was re-opened at about 14:59,
       in other words just a minute or so before kick-off.
       What I want to establish is which opening you went
       through? - A. Yes.

    Q. Because if that is where you are on that photograph
       you could not have been right up against the gate at
       14:52 because you did not walk back, did you? - A.
       No. That is right, yes.

    Q. So in fact your movement throughout was forward, is
       that right? - A. Yes.

    Q. It was not that you got up against the gate, didn't
       like it, walked away and then ^re-approached it. I
       just want to be quite clear? - A. We carried on
       forward, yes.

    Q. It was opened for the last time at 14:59:12
       approximately. Of course you did not look at your
       watch? - A. No.

    Q. The reason I ask you this is that by the time you got
       out of the gate at the front the match was still in
       progress? - A. That is right.

    Q. If you in fact came through   at 14:59, which you might
       have done because you might   have come through the
       last occasion from what you   tell me, your progress
       would have been even faster   than I would have
       expected? - A. I would have   thought, yes.

    Q. Did you get the impression you went through the
       ground, if I can put it like this, in minutes or did
                                                  S. L. JONES

  you have the impression that it took any length of
  time? - A. It seemed like forever but I think it was
  fast.
     HR. MAXWELL:  I have not got any questions, sir, but
on behalf of all of us, that is all the parties and all
those concerned in investigating this appalling tragedy, I
express our sympathy.
     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much indeed.   That is
very kind of you.
                Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. Stephanie, can I just follow up the questions which
   the Coroner was asking you about the timing of this
   photograph to see if we can get any further? You see
   in the bottom right hand corner of the photograph in
   red there is the time printed at which it is said
   that photograph was taken which reads 55 and we are
   told that is one minute wrong and it should be 54? -
   A. Right.
Q. We are also told that the gate which on the
   photograph is just off to the right where the people
   seem to be heading as they go off the photograph do
   you see that? - A. Yes.
Q. We are told that gate was opened at 14:52:06 which is
   just two minutes before the time of the photograph,
   do you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. We are told that that gate was then kept open until
   14:57, that is to say another three minutes after
   that photograph was taken? - A. Right.

Q. So it appears those are the times.  I am not
   criticising you at all? - A. I can only presume that
   I went through when it was opened the next time at 5-9
   because I know I definitely went through and it was
   closed at first and I was pushed against it. So it
   must have been the 59 time that I went through at.
   It is not a great deal of time in between, is it? It
   is only four or five minutes?

 Q. Yes, but it would not take you three minutes to walk
    from where you are in the photograph to the gate? -
    A. I know, but there was a huge amount of supporters
    there and it took some time to get to the gate.

      MR. PAYNE:    Sir, I do not honestly think that can be
 taken any further.

     THE CORONER:   Perhaps Mr. King will be able to take
it further but I do not know whether he will or not.

     MR. PAYNE:       Mr. King may have some ingenious method
of doing it.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I have a theory which I will put to
the test in a moment.

       THE CORONER:     It is an interesting matter, is it not?

Q.        MR. PAYNE: While that photograph is on the
     screen, you have told the Coroner from what you saw
     you actually only saw a total of three mounted
     Policemen, did you? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. There is obviously a lot more to be seen on that
   photograph? - A. That is right.

Q. But you did not see them? - A. No.

Q. I want you to look at another document please, and
   that is the map, 284, and I think you will find it
   further on in your bundle.  I appreciate you do not
   probably know the roads and so on yourself but I just
   want to see how far we can get. First of all, can
   you find Far Lane where you parked the car and if you
   can find No. 2 which is in the black circle? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You parked your car there and then you walked from
   there in the direction of the ground, did you? - A.
   Yes, that is correct-

Q. On the map that would take you down to the junction
   of what we can see is Wadsley Lane? - A. I have got
   it.

Q. That is going in the direction of the ground and so
   that is probably the way you walked, is it? - A. I
   cannot honestly say.  I have got no idea.

Q. Whichever way you went it would then take you on to
   Middlewood Road, that is the big road with the black
   writing, above the No. 2 I have pointed out? - A.
   Yes.

Q. A little way down Middlewood Road you then cross over
   Catch Bar Lane? - A. Yes.
                                                           28




                                                   S. L. JONES
Q. Then you are into Leppings Lane and over the bridge.
   You can see the river just passing under the e of
   Leppings Lane, do you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. And turn right into the ground. Do you think you
   probably did go down Middlewood Road and over Catch
   Bar Lane? - A. I really wouldn't like to say.  I am
   absolutely hopeless at directions and I have got no
   idea.

Q. I am just trying to put you on the map before I ask
   you about the crowds because you have said you
   thought there were an awful lot of people? - A. Yes.

Q. What I want you to help the Jury about is this;
   about how far back from the ground was it when you
         started to notice? I am not asking you to be
   exact but just give us an idea of about how far away
   you were from the ground? - A. Maybe two roads away,
   one road.

Q. That was an awful lot of people all walking in the
   same direction as you? - A. Yes.

Q.        THE CORONER:   I am sorry, I missed theanswer.
     What did you say?- A. About two roads away.

Q-        MR. PAYNE: For instance, when you cross over
     Catch Bar Lane that is quite a big junction.  You
     must have crossed over somewhere about there from the
     direction you came. So when you crossed over what
     was the scene like? Put the Jury in the picture as
     to what the scene was like as you crossed over that
     big road? - A. There was just a mass of people at the
     ground. You could not see the turnstiles or anything
     like that.

Q. I am trying to get you a little bit further back from
   the ground. Were there people walking on the
   pavement as you approached the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. Were they walking in the roads as well? - A. I can't
   recall

Q. That is as far as I can take that.  The next thing
   was that when you got into the ground and were going
   down the tunnel there were some people passing water
   on the sides of the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. You said you were not surprised at that? - A. No.

Q. Why is that? - A. Because I have been to Anfield
   Football Ground before and it happens all the time.

Q. There., was nothing special about the occasion? - A. 'Oh
   no. tou just don't look. You just look away.




                Cross-Examined bv MR. HANNING:

Q. I have got a theory too.  I wonder if we can look
   back at the photograph we had up before, C295, and I
   wonder whether the gates that you remember being
   pressed up against were the blue gates? If you look
   behind you there are two or three chaps have got red
   sweaters or shirts on. You can see some blue gates
   behind them.  I wonder if those were the gates you
   were pressed up against? - A. I don't think so.

Q.   You do not think so? - A. No.

Q.    Having got through there your way  was free   to come
     through this gate when it was open? - A. No.

Q. Theory exploded!  Let me take you back to the
   beginning.  You say you have been to Anfield and
   obviously you are used to large crowds at football
   matches? - A. Fairly used to them, yes.

Q. This was to be a very large crowd.  I    think you knew
   it was an all-ticket match? - A. Yes.

Q. I do not think there is any secret about the fact
   that a lot more people would have liked to have gone
   to the match than there were tickets available? - A.
   Probably.

Q. Were you not a little concerned about the time you
   were actually going to be arriving at the ground? -
   A. Richard didn't seemed concerned and so I wasn't.

Q. Did it not seem to you to be cutting it fine to be
   getting there at ten to three or five to three or
   thereabouts? - A. I really don't know.

Q. But you were surprised by the     numbers of people who
   were still outside the ground     at that time?- A. Yes.

Q. Were you aware at all of a Police Land Rover parked
   outside the ground? - A. No.

                                                 S. L. JONES
Q. Did you hear any announcements on a PA system of
   somebody saying not to push because everybody would
   get in? - A. No, I didn't.

Q. Did any of the Police Officers that you saw try to
   indicate either by what they were saying or by what
   they were doing that they did not want people to
   push? - A. Not really.  The only thing was the one
   Police Officer on horseback who was telling everyone
   to get to the right and that was it.

Q. That was some effort although you thought that was
   doomed to failure because there was only one of them?
   - A. Yes.

Q. I do not imagine for a moment at all that you were
   doing any pushing? - A. Probably the person in front
   of me thought I was pushing but I wasn't.  It was
   just the sheer pressure.

Q. Because you were being pressed from behind? - A. Yes.

Q. When you came up on to the back of the queue there
   was a moment when, if you like, you were the last
   person in the queue? - A. I don't think so. There
   was always, someone behind me.

Q. Was there a moment that you stopped and thought,
   "That is as far as we can go at the moment" as the
   shuffling forward continued? - A. Yes, sometimes you
   were just in a bunch and it wasn't moving but there
   was always people all around you, behind you, in
   front of you.

Q. The pressure at that time was coming from behind you?
   - A. Yes.

Q. That was the pressure of people trying to get closer
   to the entrance points? - A. I presume so.

Q. After that when you got into the ground itself from
   thereon into the tunnel, through the tunnel and on to
   the terrace, all of that is something that you would
   put under the word "normal". What you saw in the
   tunnel, although it is pretty despicable, was
   something you had seen before at football matches? -
   A. I wouldn't call it despicable really.
                                                                31

Q. yYou have seen it before and you were         notsurprised    to
    8ee it again? - A. No.

Q.   When you got onto the terrace itself, it seemed to you
     that that was a normal scene thatyou were seeing in
     front of you? - A. To begin with.

Q.   Until the pushing started? - A. Well, until the crowd
     came up.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q.   Miss Jones, I was interested in your answer that the
     person in front of you might have thought you were
     pushing, but you weren't;  it was because of the
     pressure behind you? - A. Yes.

Q.   I want you, if you can, to give some idea to the Jury
      of what it is like being in a crowd.  I am sure we
     have all had that experience, but you had that
      particular experience that day. Do you know what I
     mean by an involuntary movement? I will explain what
      I mean by that. That is a movement of somebody who
     hasn't said to himself, 'I'm going to make a
     movement1, but somebody who is carried along by the
     momentum of everyone else around them. Do you
     understand? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is that what you were trying to explain to us of being
      in that crowd, that that crowd had a momentum and you
     were being carried along with it? - A. That is right.
     You have got no choice of where you are going.   It is
      just the way the movement carries you.  If you want to
     go one way and the crowd is going the other way, you
     have got no chance of going that way.

Q.   If somebody had put the finger on you and said, "Miss
     Jones, wait a minute, what do you think you are doing
     pushing forward?" what would you have said to them? -
     A. "I'm not pushing".

Q.   What was happening to you? - A.  It is just everyone
     behind me, and it is just the sheer pressure of the
     amount of people.

Q.   You described the police officer on the horseback, and
     you were asked very properly by the Coroner about
     obeying what he was trying to do, and.you gave this
     answer, that you yourself tried to get over to the
     right, but couldn't. Why was it that you couldn't? -
     A. Because of all the people on the right and all the
     people on the left, and just can't move like that.
     You would very- much like to if it means getting out of
      the way, and also the horses coming near you. You
                                                                 32

      don't want to be trampled on but you haven't got much
      choice.

Q.   At that stage when the man on the horseback was -there,
     what was the depth of the crowd around the horse?
     What was it like around the horse? - A. There was
     just no room at all. The horse was just enveloped.

Q*            been y°urself to a football match, perhaps at
     Anfield, when you have seen a mounted police officer
     putting people into queues? - A. Yes, there are
     always mounted police at Anfield.

Q.   On those occasions is there space        forthe people to
     move into? - A . Yes, the queues.

Q.   So on this occasion - I am not criticising the
     °5?*cer*    was doing his best, I am sure - that
     officer on that horse was in the middle of a mass of
     people? - A. Yes.

Q.   Do you think that one police officer on that horse
     could really do anything about what was happening
     around him? - A. No, he couldn't have done anything,
     he couldn't.                                       6

Q.   At that stage when you were there, you are in this
     crowd with its momentum.  I just want to pursue the
     same theory as Mr. Manning about the gates.  I just .
     want to show you, if I may, 258 which is in the
     bundle, C258.

Q.          THE CORONER:   Can you find it? - A.        Yes, I have
     it*

Q*        MR* KING: Do you see, Stephanie, that before you
     get into the area in front of the turnstiles you have
     to go through what we call blue perimeter gates, do
     you see that? - A. Yes.

Q.   Do    you seethey have gateposts? - A. That is right.

Q.   Do you see there is a sort of wall or          fence on the
     left which seems to cut the turnstile          area into two.
     do you see that? - A. Yes.

Q.   When you were describing before - and I know you have
     described on another occasion what was happening to
     you at the time, and this is the statement which you
     gave to the Police not long afterwards and, in fact,
     you have been very good, you know, you have said
     almost word for word what was in your statement so it
     is not a question of anybody saying that you have not
     been getting it right, you have been doing very well

     7 indeed after this length of time. But I was
       interested in something you said you could see.

           HR. KING: Can I just remind you. sir. it is on
      page 3 of her statement.
Q.    This is before you had got through the blue gates, and
      you say this:

           "I could see some fans sitting on top of the wall
           behind the gates inside the ground."

      Do you remember seeing fans sitting on the wall inside
      the ground? - A. Yes.

Q.    Which wall do you think you were referring to? - A. I
      really don't know.

Q.   If you go back to the photograph which is up and have
     a look at that, and then let us go back to the one
     which has you on it, C.295, do you see that behind you
     are those blue gates I have been pointing out to you?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   People are coming through, and do you see to the
     right, as you look at the photograph, a lot of people
     sitting on that dividing wall or fence which is
     between the two halves of the turnstile area, the one
     I pointed out to you when we were outside the
     perimeter gates on that first photograph? Do you
     think those are the fans you could see inside the
     ground sitting on the wall? - A. Possibly.

Q.   To help you, there is no mystery, so that the Coroner
     knows, there was a time on the evidence when those
     perimeter gates were also closed for a short time.

          THE CORONER:   Yes, we know that.

          MR. KING: Then they were opened and people came
     through.
Q.   I wondered whether you were one of those who was in
     that group immediately pressed against the perimeter
     gates which had been closed at a certain stage and
     then you had got through? — A. But the tunnel is not
     right in front of those perimeter gates, is it?

Q.   No. - A. That is why I am sure it must be the other
     8ate» because when we came out of the other gates the
     tunnel was right in front.  That is the only*-way I can
     think of it because I am not sure of the layout.

          THE CORONER:  So be it, that is right. It is very
     firm in her recollection.
                              S. L. JONES

      MR. KING:    Indeed.
     ? h . Jn ? L 80 baJ k 3 l l *h t l y i n   * 0 again ve can
p.. 5       Picture when you arrive, because you are
talking about choices the whole time, about the choice
Sfai!??6??6 arrlvln8 at the ground.           In your original
description, again I say it is so very close to what
you have told us today, you have said this on the
second page:

      "We got to the ground together and I think the
      ground was on our right-hand side."

That would-be correct because you were coming from the
direction Mr. Payne was talking about. You said:

      "We turned into the entrance to the ground and I
      was quite surprised to see such a large crowd of
      people standing at the front of the ground".
A.   Yes.

Was that the impression you had, that you were coming
so that the ground was on your right and you turned
into the entrance? - A. Yes.

Because if we look on our model, you would be coming,
with the help of our friend with the pointer, not from
Leppings Lane, but from the opposite direction. The
ground would be on your right and you would turn into
the entrance, would you not? - A. Yes.

You probably came over a bridge but you probably would
not remember that. - A. Right.

Because, as the Jury will know, you could come from
two directions.  There were people coming down
Leppings Lane from one direction and people were
coming from your direction and everybody converging
from two directions to the entrance to the turnstiles,
do you see? - A. Yes.

When you arrived, was the picture of a great mass of
people? - A. Yes, just as we came down, yes.

The moment you joined it, from that moment onwards did
you really find that events had really taken over from
you after that? - A. Yes, because we didn't give our
tickets in, we didn't go through any turnstiles.

No, and you have already described the police officers
you had seen, which to you were few in number at that
stage? - A. Yes.
                              S. L. JONES


 Now let    me take you      through ontothe concourse, and
 you got    through the big gate and you are relieved and
 you see    the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Did you on that concourse area, that is the large area
behind the turnstiles when you got through, see
anybody, be it a policeman or a steward, directing you
in any way? - A. No, I didn't see anyone of that
nature.

Did you see any signs indicating where you should go?
" A* rio •

So you made     for the tunnel as the natural way to go?       -
A. That was     the only way I could see.

through    the tunnel, and you are someone who has been
to many crowds by the sound of it, were those terraces
to you empty-looking, the terraces you were going
into/ - A. No, they weren't empty-looking.             They lust
looked as they normally do.                          8    7 J

You know what I mean by swaying, don't you? - A. Yes.

You go back and you go forward, back and forward? - A.


You have described to us a number of what you have
described as surges? - A. Yes.

^  L rl8?i ±n sayin« that that is not a sway? A surge
         !?e C »°wd goes forward and does not go back
again. - A. Just gradually forward all the time.

Because you talked about first it was a gradual
movement of people coming on from behind, and then
more and more surges? - A. Yes.

And the surges are the movement of people forward and
then stopping? - A. Yes.

And you were being propelled forward from the pressure
from behind, and that is what was happening more and
 ? !* yes.
right,  7°U as you were on the terraces? - A. That is

                               S. L. JONES


Q.' Miss Jones, please understand I am not at all
    suggesting there is anything wrong with your evidence.
    I think I speak for all of us that we are
    exceptionally impressed with the way you have given
    your evidence today. I just want to focus on that
    photograph that is behind you.

          THE CORONER:   It is the one, I think, in front of
     you as well.

Q*        MR. CATCHPOLE: Do you remember that there was a
     Preliminary Inquest into Richard and Tracy’s death,
     and I believe the family may have viewed some video
     evidence and some photographic evidence, and you
                yourself on that photograph, and then
     Richard was identified inside the ground on a video?
     Do you have any recollection of that? - A. No.   I am
     not quite sure which one you are talking about. We
     saw that many photographs and videos looking for them.

Q*      I could just read you a passage from the evidence
     that was given by Inspector Layton at Richard's
     Inquest. For your note, sir, it is page 1,150, and it
     just says:

          "On a BBC video tape, reference MAPI, timed at
          14.56, 3104, Richard was shown alive in Enclosure
                , m a t la insiae cne ground at n minutes to


     Do you have any recollection of that? - A.    Not
     really, no.

Q.   It does not matter, but if that is right, you would
     agree with me, I presume that whatever gate you were
     up against, it looks likely that you were in the
     ground along with Richard at 4 minutes to 3, if that
     video reference is right, do you agree? - A.  I d o n ’t
     think it can be, because we were seen outside at 4
     minutes to 3, weren’t we?

Q.   No, that is 6 minutes to 3. So it looks as if it took
     2 minutes from when we see you on that photograph for
     you to get down into the tunnel onto the terraces, or
     at least it took Richard that long, and we presume
     that you were with him throughout that time? - A.
     Well, I would presume so.

                               Q.   Please understand
                                                               37

|0. Please understand, everyone here has seen enough
    witnesses to know that things get very confused,
    particularly when you go through something like that.'
    Tnere is -absolutely no criticisjn at all - we all know
    you are trying to help us as best you can, but it does
    seem tnat aicnard was inside the ground, and I am right
    1?.understanding that as far as you remember you were
    with him rignt the way into the terraces? - A. Yes.

|Q. Thank you. Just one other small point that I should
    raise witn you. Can I remind you of the evidence you
    gave in answer to the Coroner on the question of once
    you were inside the ground? You actually said you
    could only see the tunnel, and that Richard saitS, "Just
    go down the tunnel", and you went down and it was
    reasonaolv clear.  Is that, in fact, what happened? -
   A# 10s «

Q. Thank you very much.

              Cross-Examined by MRS. Me BRIE?!

Q. Stephanie, I ani trying to unravel this nvstery about
   when you actually went in there, and this is how I see
   it. You say when you were in the crowd, wnen there
   were a lot of people around you, that you did see a
   large metal gate, a concertina gate? - A. Yes.

Q. So there is no confusion about the perimeter gates and
   that gate, that does seem to be the concertina gate.
        Wne2 y°U VeCe there y°u saw U opening once, you
   said, and you were too far away at.the tiiae to go
   tnrougn it, but you did mention that it wasn't opened
   very wide at the time? - A. No, it wasn't.

0. Just a few feet? - A. Just a few incnes really.

        MRS. McBRIEH:     From evidence tnat we have it
   ie!E!!«i0 *5? Jhat U ?as the 2 -48 opening, tnat, because
   i don t think tne other openings, it was opened wide
   the next time, wasn't it, sir?

        Ttic. CORONER:    You are quite right. 2.43 was a
   partial opening, more than a few inches out it wasn't
   opened very wid eb a n d then at 2.52 it was ooened
   widely, /ou are quite correct in your recollection.

             M c BRIEN: S o it seeras to rae that tnat was
   tne first opening that you saw. Mow, when you saw that
   you said^tnat Richard said, "If it opens again we're
   going m , that is correct, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. And of course it was opened like you said, and you do
   reme-nber going through it with the crowd. Froa what I

       can work out it seems that you went through on the
       second opening, and uaybe the photograph has got the .
       wrong tiae on it.

            HRS. McBRIErl:  That is the only thing I can think
       of, if you don't aind ray saying so. I think Stephanie
       has given very good evidence, absolutely --- it is so
       clear, and yet we have got this aystery here. That is
       the only way I can work it out.

            THE COROIIER: Well, Stephanie can't answer that
       question. In fact, I can't answer it either.

            MRS. McBRIEN:   It is just a real puzzle.
       Everything seemed so clear, sir, apart from that.

            THE CORONER:    It is highly unlikely actually that
       the ticies are wrong except for this minute, because
       there is a photograph, and that is why one knows the
       tiae, where the tirae is printed on it and the clock is
       on it as well, so you can time it twice by the nu&ber
       printed and by the clock face, and it is a rainute out,
       that is where this minute is coaing fro%a. 'It is an
       interesting thought, I agree, but I'don't'think it
       works.

            MRS. McBRIEH:   I think it is a aystery because
       Stephanie did say that when she went down the tunnel
       and got to the terrace end of the tunnel it wasn't
       crowded. If she had gone in the final tiae it would
       have been. It is not really adding up properly.

        THE CORONER:  I think that we can't take it any
  -further. 1 can see that there is a problem here.

Q.          MRS. McBRIEM:             Thank you very much, Stephanie.

            THE CORONER:         Yes, Mr. Hale.

            MR. HALE:   1 an sorry, a crucial point, which
       this witness has to bear because it has been put to
       her, and 1 would like to ask her about the crowd
       pressure.

                    Further Cross-Exaained by MR. HALE

Q. It has been put to you that with crowd pressure you had
   no_£hoice, that is right, isn't it? - A. That is ri-^ht.

Q. But is it right that a croud like tnat is not like a
   river, is it? A river only goes one way, doesn't it?
   If you were in a river in those circumstances, a strong
   current, you could only go the way the river takes you,
   that is right, isn't it
                                                         S. L. JONES




Q. But that crowd was made up of individuals like
   yourself, that is right? - A. Yes.

Q. .All iiaving a thinking brain, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Suppose fire had suddenly broken out in front of you,
   which way do you think the crowd would have gone then?
   “ A. It is difficult to say, because the people at the
   front who are by the fire are going to*want to go back,
   but the people at the back who maybe can't see the fire


Q. Wo, the people at the back can see the fire, see the
   danger. - A. Well, you are all going to go the other
   way if everyone can see the fire.

Q* ^ou are all going to go the other way, that's right.
   So the way in which a crowd moves depends upon the
   individual will of the people who make it up? - A. It
   depends on everyone if it is a large crowd.

Q. That's right, but if everybody in the crowd .... - A.
   You can't have half and half though.
                                            •   .   ./


Q. Well if you had half and half you might have a
   stalemate, neither going forward nor going backward? -
   A. Exactly.

  That is right. - .A. And   with the large amount of people
  you find you are having    problems.

Q. In the circumstances there were more people wanting to
   continue pressing forward than there were who were
   afraid for their lives like you, and would have liked
   to stand still or hold back a bit, is that right? - A.
   Everyone was there for the one reason, to go and see a
   match, so everyone wants to go forward.

Q. Yes, but some of you were getting rather concerned
   - A. At tnat time I was slightly worried but I didn't
   think that anyone was going to get killed.

Q. Yes. He have heard from other witnesses who would have
   liked to have stopped and to have got out but they
   couldn't. - A. Yes.

Q. That is because there were more wanting to go forward
   than^were wanting to stop and coae back? - A. Yes.

Q* The problem it is not that anybody is disbelieving you

                   entered at 14.59, isn't it, because that is three
                   minutes earlier? - A. I think that oust be wrong, the
                   picture, to be honest with you. I think the picture
                   oust be wrong.

                Q. Which picture? - A. Of Richard on the terraces.

                            TilE CORONER:  That is something that I think
                       we will have to get the family to review that bit of
                       evidence because it would obviously be helpful. Ladies
                       and gentleaen, Mr. Catchpole knows this because he was
                       there, and indeed Mrs. HcBrien was - the problem of
                       identification is a very major problem.  It isn't half
                       as easy as we think and I know that many families spent
                       hours and hours and hours trying to do it, and
                       sometimes they succeeded, sometimes they have done an
                       identification and then sometimes they have .reviewed it
                       at a later date. In fact, I think Mr. Traynor was
                       mentioned on the first day — we haven't yet corrected
                       that - so it is a difficult problem.

                       Don't worry. The fact that one has to look at it again
                       is neither here nor there, all I am concerned about and
                       interested in, if you like, is to try and get the facts
                       as near as we can. Uhat you are saying is you are sure
                       that you were pressed against the concertina gate,
                       right? - A. Well, yes.

                Q. And you based it, because you know that once you got
                   through that gate you were in the concourse area? - A.
                   Yes, the tunnel was in front.

                Q. The tunnel was in front of you, and not 20 or 30 yards
                   awa^ and negotiate another huge crowd, that is rignt,
                   isn t it? - A. Yes.   I agree about the fans on the
                   wall, it may have been by the perimeter gate, but I can
                   only assume that I meant that before, about seeing the
                   fans on the wall.

                 Q. That was, in fact, how I read your statement, that
                    there was pressure before, tnat you saw the fans, that
                    you then moved in - and in fact, I asked you this, "Did
                    you~see the gate open", and Richard then said, "iJext
                    time it opens we are going in"? - A. Yes.

                 Q. And you gradually got nearer to the gate and then it
                    opened and you went through, that is right, isn't it?
                    A. Yes.

  Sorry, I haven't quite finished. There is sozaething
  else I wanted to ask. Mr. Hale to a certain extent has
  dealt witn the point, but it is right, isn't it,
  Stephanie, you nave explained to ae that you couldn't
  do anytning about it because people were pressing
  benind? • A. No, you couldn't.

  That is right, but you would accept, wouldn't you. that
  a crowd is made up of individuals, isn't it? - A. Yes.

  And if each individual person had stood still - if, I
  aa not saying that they did - if they had stood still
  outside the gates, you too would not have been pushed
  forward, that is right, isn't it? - A. Yes, but that is
  just not going to happen, is it?

  0|cay, that is fair enough, but I aa just asking you
  whether that is correct? - A. Yes.

Q. This is a question which we haven't broached yet and I
   just want to ask you this, did you know, and would it
   have aade any difference to you if you had known, that
   the ground had a licence to hold football Batches? - A.
   Had a ...?

Q. A licence, that it had been licensed for football
   matches. - A. It wouldn't have made any difference.

Q. You didn't know it? - A. What do you mean?

Q. That is all right, you have answered my question. I am
   trying to find out - this ground was licensed, there is
   a procedure for licensing football grounds, and what I
   am trying to find out from a few of the fans is whether
   the fans knew this, and I haven't found one yet who
   did, and you didn't know it either? - A. Ho.

        THE CORONER:      Hr. King, yes.

        MR. KING:      Might I ask a question arising out of
   your question?

        THE CORONER:   Which one, the momentum one? Yes.
   I aa not trying to undermine you, Mr. King, at all;

        MR. KING:    No, no. It is an important, not only
   interesting but an important point on crowd behaviour
   and expectations.

Q. Stephanie, you were asked "If everybody had stood
   still, clearly the crowd would have stopped", and the
   answer to that has to be yes, but then you gave this

  answer, "It is just not going to happen". Could you
  explain why you say that? - A. When you want to go
  somewhere you are not going to get anywhere if you
  stand still, are you?

  YeSi« T?U ?aVf been to raany f°°tball matches. How
  realistic is it, from your experience, to put forward

  to stop still? How realistic does that seem to you? -
  A. It is stupid. It is not going to happen.

            Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. This is probably unfair, but if you had been in charge
   yourself, given the task of preparing for a big fo.otball
   match and you were having to say to yourself, What can I
   expect?" - you haven't been yet and you have got to try
   and think what it is going to be like.   Do you think it
   would be sensible to go to the cinema and say to
   yourself, "Well, I will go to the local cinema.   If I
   was in London I would go to Covent Garden, because we are
    oing to find a situation which is roughly the same as a

   ?ootball match."   In other words, from your experience
    is it a fair comparison - a football crowd and a football
    match on the one hand and a queue of people waiting to go
   into the cinema - is it the same thing? - A. No, it
   isn t.   It's not a comparison at all, I don't think,
   sorry.

Q. Let me explore this slightly. At a cinema, is it right
   you have a queue, often just one queue coming out of the
   cinema going along the pavement? - A. Yes, normally.

Q. Have you ever known in a cinema 4,000 or 5,000 people all
   being asked to go through the same small number of
   entrances? - A. No.
                                            /
                                      *
        MR. KING:      I could develop it, but I won't:

Q. The point being made - and I am not being rude to the
   learned Coroner, it is an important point - is is it
   sensible -to view matters by reference to a cinema crowd
   or a football crowd? - A. No, it isn't.

        THE CORONER:      I think we will leave this point.

            Further Cross-Examined by MR. HALE:

Q. What if the Rolling Stones were performing at the
   Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground? - A. I really don't
   know.   I wouldn't go and see them anyway!

Q. But that would be a more apt comparison, wouldn't it? -
   A. Perhaps.   I don't know how many fans they have.   Not
   as many as Liverpool Football Club have.

         THE CORONER:   This is a very difficult problem, Mr.
   King, because the problem is sorting out whether football
  crowds are intrinsically different.     You.know, are they
  made up of a different category of person from other
  Jtiumans beings and, of course, there are implications
  whichever way you answer that.

        MR. KING:      It is very important when one...

           THE CORONER:   This is what I was trying...   I took
      the opportunity because we had a charming witness and I
      thought we would just explore it a little bit.

          MR. KING:   I agree, sir, because it goes very
     importantly to natters as to what one should expect.' what
     one should anticipate.

          MR. PAYNE:   I am not going to intervene in this
     discussion, but if that kind of illustration is going to
     be put to witnesses, then it ought not to be confined to
     cinemas, but it could be applied, for example, to rugby
     league matches or to rugby union matches.

          THE CORONER:   Indeed, we could go on, and I suppose
     you could criticise me for having put it to the witness
     and it may not have been entirely fair, but she has given
     quite a good account of herself on it.

            Further Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Hale mentioned that if you had known there was a fire
   in front of you, or thecrowd with you that day had seen
   * tire, they would have done something about it.    Now,
   Stephanie, you would not think there was danger ahead,
   would you, that day? - A. Well, if you could not have
   seen it.   He said I could though.

           waS only a hidden danger ahead, wasn't there?    A
     hidden one? - A. I suppose so.

Q. There has been a lot said about the behaviour of the fans
   waiting to go into the football ground.   Now it was
   close to kick-off time, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. And it was a semi-final match? - A. Yes.

Q. It could not be compared with a queue at a cinema, could
   it?    It was a different thing altogether?   A bie
   occasion? - A. Yes.

Q. Now the crowd as far as I can make    out were not doing
   anything unusual really, they just wanted to get in to
   see the match.   Would it have made a difference to the
   crowd if someone had announced that.the game        was goingto
   be delayed? - A. I don't think so.     I mean, it wouldn't
   nave mattered really.    It would have given everyone a
   lot more time to get in.

Q.    You still- think they would have pushed forward even
     though they had half an hour, for instance, to wait? -A.
     Well, no.

                                           S. L. JONES


Q. If you had more time - I was thinking maybe the fans were
   arfxious to get in because they were running out of time.
   That was the reason for their behaviour, not just because
   they wanted to push each other?    Oo you agree? - A.
   Well, yes.    It s a difficult question to answer.  .1
   mean, if the match had been put back a bit more it would
   have given more time to filter people off to different
   sections perhaps. As it was the bulk of the crowd went
   in all at once and that just was no good, was it?

Q. So all they needed was time really? - A. Well, more time
   would have helped a great deal I should imagine.

                     Further by THE CORONER:

Q. Stephanie, I need to ask you this.   You have already
   told me but I need to be absolutely sure about this.
   You did not hear any announcements made? - A. No.

Q. You didn't see a loud speaker van or anything like, or a
   Land Rover? - A. No.

Q. You heard nothing? - A. Definitely not.

Q. Definitely not.      You are absolutely sure?,- A. Yes.

          THE CORONER:   Thank you very-'much. ' Now then,
     Stephanie, you have already been complimented up and down
     dale, and I am very very grateful to you for coming and
     for being here and for yesterday as well.    I am sorry
     about that. I think you have quitted yourself well.
     You are a credit to your mum and dad.    I am sure they
     were proud of you this afternoon.

 _        I think we will arrange for this video to be re­
     viewed, if you and the family are happy, to see whether
     the identification on the terrace is confirmed. We will
     just have a think about it.   OK?

         THE WITNESS:    OK.

          THE CORONER:   It is up to you, of course, and your
     mum and dad.   It is not for me to say that they must.
     It is just a matter of trying to sort it out:

Q. Oh, Stephanie, we want you to put a cross on the little
    plan.    Show Stephanie which is enclosure 3.   I want you
    to put a cross where you first exited on to the terrace
 .. where in fact you were, and you were in.fact aiming to go
    forward?    In other words, before you felt the - I think
    we-have used the word "shove'* - from behind.   Can you
    put a cross there? - A. I can't honestly say.

Q. Can you remember where you finished up after the first
   big shove? - A. No.   The only time I can remember, it
   was just a constant shove right the way down. I didn t
   really stop.
Q. -You "really only remember yourself at the gate, is that
    right?    I'm sorry, what were you going to say? - A. The
    only time I really know is when I was at the bottom by
    the gate before I got out.

Q. Put your cross down there.   So just inside by the gate,
   is that right? - A. Yes, when I came out of the gate I
   came out to the right of the goal post.
Q. Yes, that is right, I remember that.     Thank you.    We
   will give it a "CM number.   (C.302)
        THE CORONER:    Stephanie, thank you very much.        We
   have finished.
        Ladies and gentlemen, we have finished today.
   Before I let you go we have been thinking about the times
   for starting and stopping on Monday and Fridays, not the
   other days.    If I were   to say to you that we would start
   on Monday at 10.30 instead of 10.00 and on Friday we will
   start at 9.30 and aim to finish at 3.30," you will
   realise that "aim" is not quite the same thing as
   achievement — but aim to finish at 3.30, would that sound
   acceptable to you?    If   it sounds acceptable to you, then
   I will sort out whether it sounds acceptable to the
   lawyers.    We think   it might be easier because-a lot of
   people have to travel, including me as well. You
   wouldn't mind if I made those changes.

                 (In the absence of the jury)

        THE CORONER:   You heard what I said to the jury.
   We thought that might be a bit easier if we start on
   Monday at 10.30.
         MR. KING:   I have not canvassed it yet with my
    colleagues, but certainly I would have thought that was a
    sensible idea.
            THE CORONER:   Is there anybody who feels   very
    strongly that would be jolly inconvenient?      If we start
    at 10.00 on Friday and finish at 3.30 we have actually
    lost a whole hour and I thought if we started at 9.30 on
    Friday we are only sacrificing half an hour, and aim to
    finish at 3.30 rather than 4.00.     Whether we make it is
    m o t h e r matter.  Are you happy with that 33 well*

         MR. KING:   Sir, I haven't consulted any of my
    friends on this idea which I am merely floating, sir.

     caused the body to be removed to the Medico Legal
     Centre and there he identified it to Detective
     Constable Simon Weigold who s u b s e q u e n t ly .identified the
     same body to Prof. Usher and DI Timms.            It is the
     family wish that the body should be cremated.*5

Just bear with me for one moment.   Simon Weigold did not as
such identify the body to 01 Timms.   I think they were
probably together at the same time but that is not strictly __
right as I have read it out to you.   In fact, Dr. Clark, who
is the Pathologist, was present when Prof- Usher was there
and Dr. Clark, perhaps you will deal with the identification^
in a little bit more detail on this occasion,

     I wrote to Stephen Paul Kelly.' Is that you?
(indicating agreement) On 13th May you signed a form w h i c h "
I sent to you and, in fact, you confirmed that the
information that we had was correct with regard to name,
address, age, date of birth, occupation and that is*still
so, isn’t it? Dr. Forrest did the blood alcohol levels in
the case of Michael and gave us the evidence on the first
day, on the Wednesday, and in fact in the case of Michael
none was detected.  It was negative.  Dr- Clark.

     MR. FRASER:   Just before you call Dr. Clark there is a
question which may not matter for your records but the
family are keen to clarify it and that is the question ot
the legal next of kin.
     THE CORONER:   Yes, we sent you.'a copy of that sheet
but we aren't using it.  It is really a summary sheet for me
but I understand technically the next of kin is Joanne
Kelly, isn‘t it, the daughter?
     MR. FRASER: ‘ Michael*s daughter. S t r i c t ly speaking,
yes. She is a minor but she is the legal next of kin.

     THE CORONER:   I quite accept that.  It isn't relevant
to my proceedings but I do know if there was a child she
would take precedence over the mother.

     MR. FRASER:     Thank you.
     THE CORONER:      You are happy for me to record that,
aren't you?

     MR. FRASER:     Yes.
     THE CORONER: ... I believe you represent that firm on an
agency basis?
     MR. FRASER:      It is a bit complicated but, yes.

     THE CORONER:      Right.     Are you happy now if we go on to
Dr. Clark?

                    DR. JOHN CLARK - Called

                        Bv THE C ORON ER:

Yes. - A. Dr. John Clark, Forensic Pathologist, University
of Glasgow.

Dr. Clark, can you just tell me how this lad was identified^;
Kell, he isn't a lad he was 39.  We will call him gentleman-
I think? - A. As I recall he was identified to me by Police
Officers of South Yorkshire Police whose names I don't know
at the moment but also with certain information which was . .
with the body, a name with the body and a number. „

In fact, the serial number was 72 I believe? - A. Yes, 72.

You are quite satisfied you are telling me about Hichael
David Kelly, aren't you? - A. Yes.

On that basis can you tell me what your findings were?
Cause of death was crush asphyxia.  This was based on
finding signs of asphyxia in his face.  His^face was rather
congested and had a bluish discoloration. rThese changes,^ I
have to say, were fairly mild in comparison to a lot of the
other people and one of the other features of asphyxia is to
find little haemorrhages on the skin.  These weren't in fact
present.
Were not present? - A. Were not present on the skin. They
were present internally. So really what I am saying is that
there were signs of asphyxia but it was really relatively
mild in comparison to other people but it would nevertheless
be consistent with pressure on his chest preventing him
breathing and thereby being able to get air into the body.
There was no.other obvious cause of death*  He hadn't
inhaled vomit and he had not suffered any internal or severe
injuries and there was no natural disease to account for his
death and so I still think he died 6f crush asphyxia and for
some reason the signs of that were rather mild-

     It may be with some people who die an asphyxial dea«.h
there is an additional element in that there can be pressure
on nerves, particularly in the neck, which can stop the
heart very quickly and it may be an element.  It is
something which is impossible to prove but it may be his
heart stopped for some particular reason very very quickly
and he died.  In any event there was nothing to indicate he
suffered for any great length of time-  He probably 1°**
consciousness within a short period of time, ten or fifteen
                                                    PR. JOHN CLARK



seconds or so, and Chen knew nothing about It after that.
As I said, there wasn't any major Injuries Internally.

     He did have a number of grazes and bruises on his body,
his face, his arms and his legs, some caused by fingers, by
people gripping his arm., and the other is probably caused
by pressure against other people or some surface
cround.   Again these may well have occurred after he los
consciousness.   So the cause of death, as I said, was crus
asphyxia.
     The only other finding was evidence of a past
operation, probably an ulcer operation on his                         1
don't know but I suspect that is what it was. Tha
bearing at all on his death.
     MR. FRASER:       The family have no questions.          Thank you.
Doctor.
     THE CORONER:   I'believe this is, in fact, the last
Inquest you are giving..evidence at, isn t it?   •   a
right.               .' .
It is right you have given evidence at 20 Inquests and have
done 20 post mortems? - A. Yes, that is right.

I know and we all know that you come from Glasgow. People
might wonder why you were here but, in fact* you were on
private visit last April? - A. That weekend, yes.

You very kindly agreed to help and, in fact, you did a great
deal of work and if I may say so you have given
evidence in a most admirable manner clearly “2 ? ? ™ vou
the Jury and also by the families and also Ibel      * lld
have done it in a compassionate and helptul way.
1 ike to thank you very much indeed both for Y°u^ a®
at the time and since, and in particular at these Inquests.
Thank you very much indeed. - A. Can I say in turn
someone dealing with this sort of work ^ d investigation of
death very regularly how impressea I have been with the
professionalifm and sensitivity with which the Proceedings
have been carried out here, in particular your hanoling and
explanations to the relatives of the ber*av*      f     *
think it has given comfort to everyone who has worked here
and I felt it a very appropriate atmosphere.

     MR. FRASER:     Could I add my thanks on behalf of my
             ,      ..       .... Those words you have expressed
STr^cTa"       ” l lilt l e A T i n l r s ^ k e n t o ^ a n y families »ho
have spoken to Dr. Clark and they have very much

appreciated.
      THE WITNESS:       Thank you very much.
     THE CORONER:    Mr. Fraser, is it likely the family will
want to speak -to Dr. Clark?

     HR. FRASER:      They may do, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Dr. Clark, will you stay? Once you have
spoken to the family, should they wish to do so, then of
course feel entirely free to leave us. Thank you again,
take it none of you have questions of Dr. Clark.

     POLICE INSPECTOR MATTHEW ROBERT SAWERS - Called

                          -•1

Yes, Hr. Sawers. - A. Matthew Robert Sawers, Inspectpr, West
Midlands Police.  I am already sworn,'sir.

Would you take me through the summary please when you are
ready? - A. On Saturday, 15th April 1989, Michael David ^
Kelly travelled to Sheffield on the Avon, South W e s t a n a
South Wales Liverpool Supporters Club coach.  He met Dean
William Macey and a number of other supporters on the coac .
It was their intention to watch the FA Cup Semi Final
football match at the Hillsborough Stadium. 0

     The coach party arrived in Sheffield at about 1400
hours.  Michael made his way towards the ground together
with Alan Warden, Karl Thomas and Dean Hacey.  With the
exception of Hichael the others stopped at a shop and
Michael continued to the ground alone.

     Paul Kelly, a Liverpool supporter, entered the
Hillsborough football ground through Gate C. He stood n
the concourse waiting to meet friends and whilst standing
there saw Michael, whom he knew, and he saw him enter the
ground through a turnstile. The two men spoke briefly
Hichael stated he was going to the terracing.

     At about 1535 hours Police Constable Wilmott made his
way on to the Spion Kop end of the ground.   There he saw a
man whom he now knows to be Michael .lyin«_on the^_pi
his back. Michael appeared to be unconscious.     Togeth
with Police Constable Lally the Officer checked for vital
signs of life but could not find any.   Michael was P l*cea ®n
to a temporary stretcher and carried to the
a temporary mortuary had been set up.   Police Constable
Wilmott remained with Michael.
     At about 1559 hours. Dr. Andrew Byrne examined Michael
in thS" temporary mortuary and certified life .extinct.

     At about 0530 hours on Sunday, 16th April, Police
Constable Wilmott escorted Michael's body here to the Medico
Leeal Centre where he confirmed the identification by
reference to Detective Constable Heigold.  At th.s time
Michael had not been identified by name.                   .

     At about 2110 hours on Sunday, 16th April, Stephen Paul
Kelly  attended at the Medico Legal Centre where he
identified the body of his brother to Detective Inspector^ ,
Timms.                                                    4
     On Monday. 17th April 1989, following identification‘by-
DC Weigold. Dr. John Clark carried out an autopsy and       w
submitted a report giving cause of death.               ;(£

     No match ticket was found in Michael's personal effec^I
but Paul Kelly saw him enter via a turnstile.           sl r *.
I would add that Michael's jacket has never been Sound   ^ -
despite exhaustive enquiries to trace it «no of c°“rse it
is possible that the match ticket could have been containeo
in that jacket.
As we have already said on many occasions in ■      c ircumstances ^
like this the presence or absence of the ticket
d o e s n t prove ? well . it m*Y help in « r ^ i n c a ^ s but you
can't draw too many conclusions from it, particula Y
case like this.      Now. Paul Kelly whom we are talking about,
that is no relation, is it? - A. N o n e whatsoever, sir.

It is just coincidence he happens to have the same name?
A complete coincidence, sir, yes.
Paul had an unfortunate encounter with a h o r s e , is that
ri*ht? - A. Certainly he had an injury to his right foot and
toe which he attributes to the actions ot a horse.

From our point of view we are not too concerned with how he
eot the injury but it meant he wanteo to get into the groun
rat her more qu ick 1y and rather more comfortably than going
through the turnstile? - A. That is so, sir, y

That is page 15. isn't it? Paul Kelly i n      here, i* •>«? *
He refers t o it first on page 1 3 and oescr.be. the s-me
injury on page 15 with the horse-

In effect. »hat he .ays is that he »as told
going to be o p e n e d which w e talte it to be the.c°"=*r' ‘n
fate? or one of the big gates, and he “oul^ b* ^ * 1 '°
in? - A- He does refer specifically, sir,
Yes that is right, he does. - A. It was certainly brought
to iis attention he may be admitted through that gate.
                                    P. I. MATTHEW ROBERT SAWERS



I think he says, " I walked in the £ateM , d oesn’t he, on page
15? - A. Yes, sir, he does.
He says, " I walked in the gate and I walked behind
turnstiles and I saw Michael David Kelly come through the
turnstile? - A. He does, sir, yes.
You have not got it in front of you but we have.  Op to now
we have only referred to three gate openings, the earliest
being the 1443 opening? - A. Yes.

You can remember that, can't you? - A. Yes.

Mould I be right In thinking that these gates were °P^n«d on
earlier occasions as well for short periods of time.   a   .
That is true, sir, yes.
We don't know which opening Paul refers to, do we.         A
have no precise information.

He gives no time? - A. He gives no time that we can
attribute to the opening of the gate.
     THE CORONER:   Can you deal with the openings of the
gate, Inspector Layton, or not?
     INSPECTOR LAYTON:       Only in general terms.

     THE CORONER:     Yes, Mr- Fraser.
     HR. FRASER:     Would you give me a moment please?

     THE CORONER.:    Yes.
               Cross-Examined bv H R . FRASER:

Just to deal very quietly with the question of the fact .t*at
there wasn't a ticket with Michael, you say he was *«en
g o ! « through the turnstile which is suggestive of the fact
he almost cfrtainly had a ticket.    Correct - ^ I "
b u t i Selleve it ii the practice of this particular coach
operator, you may not know, not to-allow any o y
c H c h who hasn't got a ticket of the l*M ;                     has
behind that are fairly obvious.    Is          ~
come up in your Investigations.       •              v , on behalf
my knowledge that the coach                      are quite strictly

     THE CORONER:   Can I just explain this to you because
it is obviously a matter which concetns you?- These Officers
can only say what is in the statements.  They car guess like
all of us can but it would be unfair to expect an Officer to
hazard a guess on Oath. So he can only say what is in the
siacement ana if there is nobody there who saw him hold a
ticket and can say, "I saw him hold a ticket" and if we have
not found it, he can?t say somebody saw it or that we found
it because both of those things would be guesses but that
doesn't mean to say you need to be too concerned.  I am not
particularly concerned about this point, not with regard to
Hichael.  All right..
     THE WITNESS:   It might be helpful, sir, if I make one
comment.  There are statements in the file which I have seen
from three supporters who travelled on the same        *    -
each supoorter refers specifically to being in posses*,
their own ticket.  It is an assumption that the s^me applies
in Hichael Kelly’s case but that, taken together with the
evidence of Paul Kelly through the turnstiles, leaves us no
reason to suppose he didn't have a ticket.

                 Cross-Examined by HR. LIHB:

Paul Kelly states he went through Gate C but he is
as to time.  Does he give any evidence as to
part of a crowd or a party of people going through Gate C or
he found himself on his own In the .end?
     THE CORONER;      1 think you will find it on page 15.

     THE WITNESS:     Yes.   Would it assist you, sir, if I set
this in context?
Yes, go ahead. - A. Briefly. Paul Kelly I.as made two
statements and refers to this incident in both f ir* He
refers to having acquired an injury to his foo    n
vicinity of the enclosure between the outside         °n
Leppings Lane and the turnstile entrances.   He refers to
speaking to a Policeman and being led to
may be opened at some time in the future.   He r    officer
witness whom he was standing with who spo*e            *"Can
and said words to the effect that the gate is opened     <Un
you get this person in because he has injured his foo
does not refe? specifically to how many other *eopl. entered
through the gate at the time he entereo through uave C-

     HR. LIHB:      Thank you.
     t h e CORONER*   You will see in a moment why we are
,tr.s“ n “ S E e c a u ~ it comas up in the visual evidence.
We can come back to it if necessary.
                                       P. I. MICHAEL LAYTON



     MR. CATCHPOLE:    3ir, 1 only rise as a matter of
clarification.    Idon't think we have got the wrong
impression but   Itwould be right to say 1 think that the
only two openings of the gate, in which a substantial number
of people went through, were those you have referred to
previously.  If there were any earlier openings for a very
short period of time, If there Is any evidence of people
going through,   it is only one or may be two people.

     THE CORONER:    Yes, that Is a very good point.  We
haven't mentioned any of the earlier part because what was
happening was that the gate, I was going to say,
continuously being opened. That Is not true but Itj«as
being opened Intermittently, usually to throw P*°P          -
not to allow them in. For example, one is timed at 143®. an
opening, and there Is another one timed at 1439 where, in
fact somebody was actually taken In on that one, on
on the picture. There werJ other openings but ^
been terribly relevant until this particular Inquest and you
will see in a minute why it Is relevant.    Shall weJ-e^ e It
at this stage with the gates and we can come back
minute when we have heard Inspector Layton:* Any more
questions?

     MR. LIMB:   No thank you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   In fact, it is only fair
Paul Keily does mention a time, I have just notice »
first time he mentions is that he says it is after
o'clock and then he gives a supplemental statement when
says that can't possibly right or words to that etfeet.
That is true, sir, yes.
His timings can't be relied on? - A. His timings ®*n *
relied on.  I am satisfied the witness is doing his bes. to
recollect but certainly his information about timing c
be relied on, sir.
There is an interesting sentence here.  Turn to PaSe      .
because this may actually help. The last paragraph Paul
Kelly says. "Once I was inside the ground I s*w      gate
open again.  This was about five minutes after I entered the
ground.  This was the last time the gate opened an<d
everybody came in and went down the tunne •     o
gate was opened at this time about 1450." - A. Yes.

As I say, I wouldn't be too reliant on his tim.-ngs but tha
is what he says? - A. He does say that, sir, yes.

         DETECTIVE INSPECTOR MICHAEL LAYTON ~ Called

                     Rv THE CORONER:

Mr. Layton. - A. Sir, Michael Layton. Detective Inspector.
                                         D.I. MICHAEL LAYTQfst



West Midlands Police.  Sir, an examination has been made of
video film and photographic evidence and Michael has been
identified alive in Enclosure No. 3-  Stephen Kelly,
Michael's brother, as you have heard is in Court, has viewed
visual evidence and identified his brother alive in
Enclosure No. 3 on a number of photographs.

     Photograph referenced DB16/30 is timed at 1445 and
that, sir, is in Enclosure No. 3.  I wonder, sir, at that
point whether you wish me to elaborate slightly in relation
to Paul Kelly's evidence.                                 v -vi

Yes, please. - A. As I have said, that photograph is timed
at 1445.  Paul Kelly is seen in a BBC video tape outside the
ground which was taken between 1437 and 1450. As you have
already heard, he cannot be specific and his description is
he is entering via Gate C and from my knowledge of^the gates
doesn't accord with the two openings at 2.43 and £.52.  So
we can be sure he was*outside the grouna between those two
times but we can't be sure at what time he actually entered.

This is? - A. Paul Kelly, sir.   Sir, on a photograph
referenced PR2/21 which is timed at 1508 that shows Michael
in Enclosure No. 3 and whilst the detail again is not great
it appears to show him certainly alive at that time but I
can't say at what stage of the process medically "nts is at.
1 -.hink it is fair to say at that point as well that        c-
Michael's sister has also viewed that visual evidence and
so, in fact, both brother and sister agree that the
photographs show Michael.

He looked a bit distressed you think in that? - A. That is
my impression.
You can't say whether he is conscious or unconscious, alive
or dead, at that particular point? - A. It is-difficult. I
would say he is probably still alivet sir, but certainly in
distress.  In respect of tne pnotograpn at I445_he is
certainly alive and there are no problems at tii«t stage.
The later photograph does show hfiJT.

That is the one, yes. - A. Yes.  PC"Wilmott has viewed
visual evidence and he was unable to identify himself

    /All those are matters ....
  .        *        are •'natters which I nave to say to you,
      **
ani woul*
                 2: of those I.cearasanr, I would want to
               submit I should, be antitied to investigate
   you .call then.  I would be failing in my duty if I
acquiesced in a ruling which you have indicated vou
would oe minded to give, that if you did call then,
sir, you would restrict then in the way you have
described, because they are giving factual evidence on
patters vhich the Jury h3Ve to determine and, indaed,
aaal with quite vital matters relating to the
behaviour df -It. DucJcenfiild.

     In those circumstances, sir, I in fact hive two
applications. One is to frnvite you to call then, in
yonr discretion, and to invite you, sir, to take this
stance, that if you do call tha^i you should allow
questionin’ on all the natters to which I have
referred.

     Sir, if your ruling is th.it in your discretion
you will call them but restrict the:n to only the
matters you have referred-to, in ray submission thit
would be the worst of both worlds and, in fact, one
would be giving a false picture to -the Jury rather
than no picture at all, and,a false picture and a
misleading picture can be worse than no picture.

     THE CORONER: That, of course, is the last thing I
want to do.
                                                *


     HR. KING: Of course,: sir. But ny strong
submission to you is notwithstanding the time problem
we have, these are witnesses of substance on the vital
events which this Jury are particularly concerned
with, which are the events leading to and then
immediately following the decision to open the gates
at the Lepoin^s Lane end, rand it is hard to see a
rationale for having included so many other witnesses
who do not go to such vital events in the overall
picture and not to call these witnesses.

     If it be, sir, a matter of convenience because of
time, and I am not so insensitive as not to appreciate
that problem, all I can say on behalf of those I
represent is - this is not' meant facetiously at all,
sir - 'rather like the argument that kick-off should
not be delayed merely because of a reason, if, in
fact, they are witnesses of substance then they ought
to be called as full witnesses, even if we have to
recognise, and I am sure I play a role in the blame
for this as much as anybody else, that our time­
tabling has gone awry in this Inquest.   I say that
without meaning any disrespect to you, sir, at all
because I mean what I say about my role at all tines*
     THE C0a0riER: Did you want to say-something, :ir.
Payne?

      1R. PAYNI:    Sir, a lot of what Hr. King has said,
 I think I would a^rae with, that once the witness has
 bean called then he is at large, and it is difficult
 really to 3 3 3 any legitimate basis on which
 examination can ba restricted, but I think our
.position would he to invite 70a to adhere to the
 original approach that you intended to follow, namely
 that on balance, having heard the evidence of tha
 principal occupants of the Control Box, you will
 probably not naed to recall the other people.

      I am only goin* to add this because I did not
mention it before the adjournment, but I am slightly
concerned abo-.it the sequence of witnesses.  Mr. Xin?
has very fairly indicated the lines of cross-
exanination which he would intend to open up with
these witnesses and, of course, one cannot pce-judje
what they would say or how it would come out, but ona
cannot help feeling that these could be points which,
in fairness, ought to have been put, or at least they
ought to have had the oooortunity to deal with it when
the other occupants, Messrs. Duckenfield and Hurray,
were giving their evidence.     It would be very
unfortunate if the Inquest, got into the stage of
leaving matters in the air which could perhaps be
dealt with by those other witnesses who night then
h3ve to be recalled. This is a ghastly prospect which
certainly I think we would wish to avoid, but in the
interests of fairness one can see that if particular
points were to be made, or evidence were to be given,
tn®n this is the kind of thinjj which Messrs.
Duckenfield and Hurray ought to have a chance to deal
with.

     THE COROUER: I think that Chat goes without
saying, but if matters were to be raised     where Hr.
Isaacs and Hr. Hanning were to say to me, "Hang on, we
want ilr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray to have an
opportunity to answer", I would certainly not raise
any objection if I were to call these witnesses.     I
think that point goes without saying,, whatever the
effect on timing, I am not really interested.     It
does not matter to me.   I want to finish this montn if
I can, but if we do not, we do not, we adjourn it to a
convenient time.

      HR. PAYUE: I think we would be at one with Hr.
 King on this, that one recognises.that time pressures
 do not really have any input into this decision at
 all, it has to be taken on its merits.  That is wny
 think our oosition would be that we would invite
                                                         30



to adhere to the original .aooroach that you had,
namely that having heard Che evidence of Che principal
people, and cheir evidence having baan thoroughly aid
lengthily gone into by all interested parties, it
would not be necessary to take the natter further.

     T12 COROI-.’S'l: ’
                      .Je are .loin* to have a coffea break
in a minute.     Yes, Mr. lussell?

      MU. R'JSSZLL: Sir, I have not risen to 33y
anythin*; in this particular debate.   I an alnost
exclusively on the sidelines in resoect of these
witnesses who are to be called, save for one very
•ninor natter.   But perhaps I could coae to your
assistance to thi3 extent,    "e anpaar here with your
l»ava, va ask questions of witnesses with your leave.
They are your witnesses and you call then for the
purposes tnat you see fit for the purposes of these
Iniuasts.

      You indicated at one sta^e that it was your
purpose to call the Officer who was responsible for
operating the video camera, or tne console of video
caneras, to be in a position to explain to the Jury
tne technical capabilities of those cameras.    That, it
saeas to me, is a wholly different area of evidence
from tne factual recollection of those Officers,
either the person operating the camera or the person
operating the radio on that day.    Inasmuch as with
30.ne of the witnesses we .have had today you have 3aid,
"Ihase witnesses are going to deal with a very limited
aran of evidence and nothing else", and we have
niiared to that, I do not see why there is a problem
in you dealing with these witnesses, these two Police
Officers, in that same restricted manner.

      Certainly Inspector Jlemmingway, as you will
np.iraciate, could h3ve dealt with all sorts of matters
relating to the conduct of' the afternoon in question,
not least the rescue and the role of my client in it.
I did not seek to ask him those questions because I
u.nlerstood the very limited ambit and the very limited
purposes for which you wanted those witnesses called.

     But,,, sir, if you seek to elicit matters of fact
and natters of recollection of these witnesses as to
what they saw on the day, then of course I can
understand the position that ay learned friend. Mr.
Xing is in and, no doubt, my learned friend Mr.
Isaacs, and Hr. Manning as well, as to what evidence
they might wish to elicit once you go down that road.
But it does appear that there is a very clear and
obvious cut-off point in their evidence whereby you
can limit the evidence of these witnesses to the
   technical       capabilities         of   the    ?ara :>he-nalia        m*-

so.

PETER TOOTLE



1.   Peter Tootle, the son of the Applicants Peter and Joan

      Tootle,     attended    the   match     with   a    friend,     Colin

      Frodsham.     They were both in enclosure 3.



2.   At the mini     inquest Dr. David Slater            put forward his

     view that the      cause of death was        traumatic asphyxia.

     The rest of the      evidence was given by Police Sergeant

     John Killock      and Detective        Inspector Michael        Layton

     which,     when taken     together,      produced the     following

     chronological account.          Colin Frodsham        was separated

     from Mr. Tootle when the crowd in the enclosure surged

     forward, after     which he      fell unconscious.         When     he

     came round he      saw Mr. Tootle lying on the           ground.     A

     police officer      then attempted to resuscitate              him for

     about 10 - 20 seconds

     3.40 p.m.     Police Constable         Friend saw Mr.     Tootle at

     the end      of the ground     opposite to the        Leppings Lane

     end where he examined him and then with P.C. Griffith,

     carried him into the temporary mortuary.               At 3.54 p.m.

     Peter Tootle was        certified dead by Dr.         Matthew Eull,

     who   certified dead       a   total     of thirty     Hillsborough

     victims in a period of twenty minutes.



3.   At the main inquest no evidence whatsoever was adduced

     which related to Peter Tootle.            His name was mentioned




ANtTAAD
only when the verdicts were returned.                  Yet the purpose

of the main        inquest was to deal with            the question of

how Mr. Tootle met his death.



The complaint of the           Applicants therefore extends far

beyond one levelled at          the decision of the coroner to

disallow      evidence relating        to   events that          occurred

after 3.15 p.m.           More fundamentally it concerns their

belief that there has been no inquest at all, into the

most important          question concerning their             sons death,

namely how he came to die.



This is so        not merely because no         evidence concerning

this     issue was      heard at     the main        inquest but       also

because the issue         of lack of care was not             put to the

jury     as   a    possible     inference       to     draw     from   the

evidence.         The   Applicants     submit        that the    minimum

requirements for a fair and proper hearing at the main

inquest required         the following      to be put         before the

jury:    a    summary of the evidence that             had been heard

at     the mini     inquest and      the evidence       of Dr.     Glynn

Phillips, Dr. John         Ashton and Mr. F.          Eccleston.       The

jury should        then have    been informed         that a     finding

that death was aggravated by            lack of care was open to

them.

                          THE CORONER:       Good morning, Mr. an d Mrs. Tootle and .
                   ev ery bod y else.   Which is mum and d ad ?         Yes. Betore we take
                   the evide nce 1 am just going to d e s c r i b e to y ou the
                   procedure so that y o u can follow and so that y o u know what
                   comes next, so to speak, because it is e a s i e r tor you to
                   follow if I do that, I think.          What we are g o i n g to co in
                   the first instance is I am going to read to you what
                   happened on 19th A p r i 1 1989 which is w h e n I w a s in this
                   Court and I dealt with the initial e v i d e n c e so that I could
                   allow the body to come home for the funeral and when I have
                   done that, if there are any e r r o r s in that, we will trv and
                   correct them.      I d o n ’t think t he re are in t h i s particular
                   case and t hen I will teli you about the b l o o d alcohols.
                   When I have c omo le ted that* Dr. Slater, w h o is sitting up
             D     there and who is a Pa :hologi s          will give h i a svicar.ce

                         On co mpl et ion of that the West M i d l a n d s Police Ciiicer
                   who has prep ar ed a summary for me will p r e s en t the summary
                   and when he has com p le te d it, Inspector L a y t o n will deal
                   with the visual evidence-         We start o ve r there, Inspector
                   Layton r e c o u n t s it verbally and t e l l s me all about : t . He
                   gives us all the references, the plan n u m b e r s and one thing
                   and ano ther so the shorthand w r i t e r can get it ail cown so
                   that we all know what we are t a l k i n g about-        I >- i s ® •1 ' ^ lc
                   confusing at that point but then he wa lk s r o u n d here anc on
                   his big pla ns he will snow us what he has b e e n talking
                   about.   So it does become cl e ar as you will find out in a
                   moment.    When ttiat is finished that is all the evidence we
                   are dealing with at that stage.           Is that re a s o n a b l y clear sc
                   that you know what the format is g o i n g to oe - It wiil n»aiw«

KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS



     Kevin Daniel Williams the son      of the Applicants James

    Stephen and Anne Williams was born on 27th May, 1973,

    and was 15 years old when he died at Hillsborough

    football ground on 15th April, 1989.



    He went to the stadium with friends but became

    separated from all but one, Andrew Duncan.        Together

    they took up positions in enclosure 4 at 1.30 p.m.,

    but some time before 2.45 p.m. they moved into

    enclosure 3.



    During the course of Kevin's mini inquest on 2nd May, 1990

    the following evidence was put before the jury through

    the witnesses Detective Sergeant John Killoch,

    D r . David Slater, Detective Inspector Michael Layton,

    and Andrew Duncan:-     Andrew Duncan lost sight of Kevin

    Williams immediately after the first surge in

    enclosure 3.    At about 3.28 p.m., P.C. Michael Craighiil

    went into enclosure 3 and carried Kevin onto the pitch

    where he attempted unsuccessfully to resuscitate him.

    Derek Bruder, an off duty Police Constable saw Kevin

    lying on the pitch near the Spion Kop, North stand of the

    ground.   He stated that Kevin was having convulsions.

    Mr. Bruder, on seeing Kevin went on to the pitch

   where he gave mouth to mouth resuscitation and an

    ambulanceman carried out cardiac massage.       They were

    later joined by an ambulance woman who took over from

   Mr. Bruder.     After a short time the St. Johns :Amh-ulfr>,cema?j/
 Some time later special Constable Debra Martin assisted

 in carrying Kevin from the pitch to the temporary

mortuary.    She claimed that when they reached the

mortuary he stopped breathing.     She then gave him

mouth to mouth resuscitation and did some heart massage,

after which he opened his eyes, said the word "mum" and

then died.   At 4.06 p.m. Dr. Curpen examined Kevin and

certified him dead.



Dr. David Slater, stated in evidence that Kevin died of

traumatic asphyxia.   His case was one of the worst of

those he dealt with from the Hillsborough incident.        In

his opinion Kevin would have fallen unconscious within

3 to 5 seconds of being crushed.     He stated that persons

suffering from asphyxia can have fits.     He was not of

the view, however, as SC Martin had suggested, that

Kevin could have spoken.   The autopsy showed that Kevin

had four fractures of his voice box and irreversible

brain damage, both of which he believed, would on their

own have prohibited communication.    Any sound that might

have emerged he put down to the expulsion of air from

Kevin's stomach but stated that this would not explain

the opening of Kevin's eyes.   He believed that because

of the seriousness of Kevin's case, he would have suffered

irrecoverable brain damage and brain death within 3 to 6

minutes.
    \
    ♦




                                      3




             The mini inquest into Kevin was then adjourned until

             a date to be fixed.



             On 3rd May, 1990, an officer from the West Midlands

             Police Force, visited the Applicants at their home.

             The officer stated that Mr. Bruder had now changed his

             statement as he realised he must have been mistaken.
m
             Mr. Bruder was now saying that there was no vomit near

             to Kevin that it could have been mucous.   Mr. Bruder

             was also saying that Kevin wasn't convulsing when he

             attended him, that it must have been body twitches.

             The police officer told Kevin's parents that it would

             be better if the family did not speak to Mr. Bruder.

             He said that Special Constable Martin was still

             sticking to her original statement but that she was

             young and inexperienced and that she had undergone a

m            traumatic experience.   In the circumstances, he said

             her statement would be discounted.   He then stated

             that there would be another inquest into Kevin the

             following day but that the Applicants need not attend,

             as the purpose of the inquest was to prove to the jury
                                                           /

             that Kevin could not have been alive.



        8.   On 4th May, 1990, the coroner returned to Kevin's mini

             inquest and further evidence was put to the jury by

             Sergeant John Killoch, Inspector Matthew Robert Sawers,

             Dr. David Slater and Doctor Ernest John Wallace Gumpert,
          which, when taken together produced the following account

          of events:       When Mr. bruder made his first statement he

          stated that he came across Kevin at the Spion Kop end

          having convulsions.      This happened after 3.32.   He also

          said he could feel a pulse.       He referred to Kevin vomiting

          and being sick.      Mr. Bruder gave mouth to mouth resuscitation

          and an ambulanceman carried out cardiac massage.         After 7

          minutes they swapped roles.      About 6 minutes later an

          ambulancewoman took over from Mr. Bruder.      Whilst

          Mr. Bruder was attempting to resuscitate Kevin he observed

          an ambulance entering the stadium.      He asked the St. Johns

          Ambulance colleague who was assisting him to stop the

          ambulance as he was considering utilising it.

          During resuscitation efforts he noticed Kevin's face

          going grey and withdrawn.



          In his evidence Inspector Matthew Robert Sawers of the
•   9 '
          West Midlands Police confirmed that he had visited

          mr. Bruder the previous day.      He stated that Mr. Bruder

          on reflection thought that the word 'convulsions' was

          not applicable, that twitching was a more appropriate

          term to describe Kevin's condition and that if he had

          seen any part of the body move, it was the head.         He

          reported that Mr. Bruder said that he may well have been

          mistaken about feeling a pulse.      He added that, in

          contrast to his original statement, he could no longer

          say that he definitely saw Kevin's skin colour change



                       /
                          5 -




     from normal to grey; nor did he now think Kevin had

     vomited, but that the fluid he saw coming from Kevin's

     mouth might have been spittle or phlegm.     Mr. Bruder

     had confirmed that he attempted to resuscitate Kevin

     for a period of time of between 10 and 15 minutes and

     that the ambulance he saw was definitely entering the

     stadium and not exiting.



10 . In his further evidence Dr. Slater stated that Kevin

     would have suffered irrecoverable brain damage and

     death within 3 to 6 minutes, that is, by the time

    Mr. Bruder reached him, and that although he was brain

     dead his heart may have gone on beating for a short

    while longer, and his nerves may have lived on thus

    causing the twitching.      He brain had died near to the

    time of the crushing, but his whole body died at the

    time that P.C. Bruder was with him and saw him turn

    grey.



11 . Dr. Ernest Gumpert was of the view that Kevin was

    probably dead before he was even removed from enclosure 4,

    in the sense that he was brain dead and was going to die.

    He also thought it conceivable that his heart continued

    to operate for a time as did his peripheral nervous

    system.   But after Kevin had suffered brain death the

    only way to keep him alive would have been by artificial

    means.
On 15th December, 1991, the Applicant Ann Williams met

with mr. Bruder.     A note of this meeting is exhibited

                                      From those notes

it would appear that Mr. Bruder refutes the interpretation

placed by D.I.     Robert Sawers upon the statement made by

Mr. Bruder on 3rd May, 1990.



From November 1991 the Applicants made repeated requests

to South Yorkshire Police to release copies of the statements

made by Special Constable Martin and Mr. Bruder.

The Applicants eventually received the said statements

from the Coroner's office on 19th February, 1992.        In

relation to Mr. Bruder's initial statement made on 27th

April, 1989, the following matter caused grave concern

to the Applicants

(a)   Mr. Bruder describes seeing a police cordon in front

      of the North stand.    Kevin was lying on the ground

      behind the police cordon having convulsions.       None

      of the police officers left the cordon to assist

      people who were lying on the pitch.      {See Page*2^S).


(b)   Shortly after Mr. Bruder began resuscitation attempts

      on Kevin an ambulance entered the ground and drove

      towards the Lapping Lane end.     He told the St. Johns

      man to try and stop it.     He tried to flage it down

      but it continued on as if it had been ordered not

      to stop.   (See Page*?.^t-£).
                                  -     7 -


         Details of the aforementioned matters were not referred

         to in the police summary of evidence presented at the

         inquest.     The Applicants feel that such omissions
                                               of
         illustrate the shortcomingsf'presenting evidence in
                                    A
         summary form. A copy of Mr. Bruder's first statement

         and the West Midland's Police Summary of Evidence is

         annexed hereto.



14.      In relation to mr. Bruder's second statement made on

         3rd May, 1990, he states in the first paragraph thereof

         that he had "been asked to think about a number of points

         which are raised in the statement I made nearly a

         fortnight after the Hillsborough Stadium disaster".

         See Page^^./.hereof).        In the Applicants' view, this

         remark, taken together with the notes of the meeting held

         with Mr. Bruder on 15th December, 1991, indicate that

         improper pressure was indeed exerted upon Mr. Bruder

         to retract or qualify in part his previous statement.

         Further, since receiving the copy statements the

         Applicants have viewed a BBC video of events as they

         unfolded on the day of the disaster.        It is evident from

         the video that a SYMAS Ambulance entered the Spion Kop

         end of the pitch at 3.36 p.m. at which time it has been

         established that Mr. Bruder was attempting to resuscitate

         Kevin.     The Applicants are concerned that despite its

         availability this evidence was not put before the jury.

         Rather, Mr. Bruder was asked to consider whether the

         ambulance he had originally referred to as entering the

         stadium was in fact exiting.

    15.    At the same time as efforts were being made to

           secure copies of witness statements attempts were made to

           contact Special Constable Martin.      On 20th February 1992

           the Applicant Ann Williams received a phone call from

           the Special Constable which culminated in a meeting

           at the Applicants home on 22nd February 1992.      At that
m         meeting Special Constable Martin confirmed the contents

          of her first statement made on 8th May 1989 wherein she

          described the events set out in paragraph 4 hereof.

          She stated that this statement was made up from notes which

          she had made in her pocketbook immediately after the disaste

          She explained that her later statement dated 17th March

          1990 was compiled by an officer from the West Midlands

          Police Force who visited her at her home.       This officer

          tried to convince Special Constable Martin that her

          original statement was untrue.       The Special Constable

          signed the statement prepared by this officer without

          reading it.   She was unable to read it due to the state

          of distress brought on by the officer's behaviour.       She '

          signed the statement because of the pressure exerted by the

          officer and because she wanted to put Hillsborough behind
          her.



          Special Constable Martin has now signed a statement, in

          the presence of a solicitor, confirming the truth of her

          original statement dated 8th May 1989, and explaining the

          circumstances relating to the compilation of the later

          statem erA ||2^d^7% h"fexich 1990.
A copy of this statement is appended hereto at Page .e?.'r5r.


The Applicants firmly believe that the statement dated

17th March 1990 led to the undermining of Special

Constable Martin's statement at the mini inquest on 2nd

May 1990 (see in particular page 7, para D.E. of transcript

proceedings).


Subsequent to the meeting with Special Constable Martin

the Applicants sought the advice of their general

practitioner as to the contents of Kevin's autopsy report.


In his view the injuries to Kevins larynx would not have

prevented him from speaking.   A copy of this opinion

is appended hereto at page


Now in receipt of most of the evidence relating to

Kevin's death, the Applicants contend that the inquest

proceedings into Kevin's death and the result and verdict

of accidental death are highly unsatisfactory by reason

of the following matters

(a)   The jury never heard from Mr.Bruder himself,

      nor did they hear from Special Constable

      Debra Martin.   The jury were merely presented

      with excerpts from their respective statements.

      The Applicants contend that the evidence

      relating to Kevin was presented to the jury

      in a confusing and incoherent fashion.

(b)   They are particulary concerned at the inactivity

      of the police officers in the cordon whilst
      Kevin was convulslijffl^and the unsuccessful attempt
                                -    10   -


                  to flag down an ambulance.          In their view both

                  these matters indicate a lack of response on the

                  part of the emergency services.

           (c)    Notwithstanding the evidence of Dr.David Slater

                  and Dr.Ernest Gumpert they believe that Kevin

                  was alive for some time after 3.32 and hence

                  for some time after the 3.15 p.m, cut off time.

                 This belief is heightened by a recent article in
#                the British Medical          Journal dated 30th November 1991.

                 This article       states that the accident and emergency

                 departments of the Northern General and Royal

                 Hallamshire Hospitals, Sheffield, were never

                 formally told to implement the major disaster

                 plan.   Further, the article states that most of

                 the seriously injured arrived at hospital between

                 3.30 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.         Nine of those injured were

                 convulsing upon admission.          A further 6 were confused

                 upon arrival and then began having severe convulsions.

                 It is known that some of these people survived with

                 no long term physical effects.

          (d)    The further evidence which has come to light since

                 the inquest indicates in particular a suppression

                 of evidence, irregularity of proceedings and

                 discovery of new evidence.


    19.   The Applicants submit that in the light of these matters

          and had Mr.Bruder and Debra Martin been called as

          witnesses there may have been sufficient evidence for
          the jury to conclude that Kevin's death was due to or

          aggravated by lack of care.         ' *v   *   -   *, * -
 MEETING BETWEEN ANNE WILLIAMS AMD P.C. BRUDER -
 15TH DECEMBER. 19Q1



 P.C. Bruder     made his original statement             approximately ten
 days after the disaster.



 At that time he asked the West Midlands Police for the name

 of   the boy    he had    attempted to        resuscitate (i.e.       Kevin
 Williams).     This was refused.



At the meeting with P.C.           Bruder on 15th December, 1991, he

 stated that    he came        across Kevin     on the     pitch and    that

Kevin     was either     convulsing or        twitching.      Kevin had     a

pulse and there was vomit in Kevin's mouth.                As he tried to

resuscitate Kevin an ambulance approached going towards the

Leppings    Lane end      of    the   ground.      He    shouted for      the

ambulance to stop in order to put             Kevin in it, but it went
straight past.



On 3rd May, 1990, P.C. Bruder was             visited in his home by a

West Midlands Police Officer          who asked him to 'reconsider'

his statement.      He    was asked if        he was mistaken        when he

stated that     Kevin was       convulsing and had        a pulse.      P.C.

Bruder stated that he was not mistaken.

      NJL.     It    was cniy at this         time (i.e. 3rd May,               1990) that

      P.C.     Bruder learnt        for the         first       time the     name of     the
      person he had zzia c. to help.



     At      the    same    time    as    the       West       Midlands      Officer    was

     interviewing him in his             home, the Coroner rang P.C. Bruder

     and tried to          persuade him that the facts                 of his statement

     were incorrect in          particular that the ambulance                    could not

W    have     been    driving onto       the        pitch       but might       have   beer,

     driving off it.          Again, P.C. Bruder refused                    to admit that

     he had been mistaken and was adamant that the ambulance had
     been driving onto the pitch.



     The     West    Midlands      Officer         was       with    P.C.   Bruder     from

    approximately 10.00 a.m. - 4.00 p.m. on 3rd May.



    P.C. Bruder        told the     Officer that he                 didn't want    tc see

^ p K e v m 's parents but if they wished to meet with him then he

    would be        prepared to meet      them anywhere.                (H.B.    When the

    West Midlands          Officer visited          Mr. and         Mrs. Williams      the

    same day        he informed them      that P.C. Bruder would                  not see
    them).



    P.C. Bruder       stated the      reasons behind                the West    Midlands

    Officer visiting him           when he stated "when he                  came ccwn to

    see me it was with a brief - to get me to change my mind."




    ANNAAJ
                                        -    3   -




     In response to whether or not           he would be prepared to make

    another statement,     P.C. Bruder           replied that    he would    be

    prepared to     stand up     in Court        and state   that Kevin     was

    convulsing,     that there    was       a pulse    and   that there     was
    vomit in his mcuth.



    Asked whether    or not Kevin was            alive when he got    to him,

    P.C. Bruder replied "there was a pulse and if that means he
    was alive then he was alive."



    When P.C.    Bruder left     Kevin he        was certain     that he    was

    dead.    He himself vomited and then went home.              He destroyed

    all the clothes he was wearing on that day.                He stated that

    he has   never received any      counselling and.has          dealt with

    the disaster "in his own way."

BLOOD ALCOHOL ANALYSIS BY DR FORREST - RESULT:

___________________________________________________________________                             -_
 IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE:                On the morning of Sunday    16     April   1989,   j

James Stephen WILLIAMS identified the body of his step son, Kevin Daniel                    j

WILLIAMS, to PC    1269   GLAVE in the Temporary M o r tu ar y at Hillsborough Stadium.
       CIRCUMSTANCES


 1.    At about 0700 hours on Saturday, 15 April
       1989, Mr Janies Stephen WILLIAMS saw his son,
      Kevin Darnel WILLIAMS, deceased, leave the
      family home with the intention of travelling
      to Sheffield. He was to travel by train with
      a number of his friends to watch the F.A. Cup
      Semi Final football match at Hillsborough
      Stadium. Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS had a ticket
      for the match.

2.    Andrew DUNCAN travelled to Sheffield with
      Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, Thomas James NICKSON
      and Gregory FAGEN by train arriving at
      Sheffield at about 1040 hours. Gregory FAGEN
      left the others at the station. T'ne other
      three youths caught a bus from the station to
      Hillsborough Stadium where Thomas NICKS0N
      left them.

3.    Andrew DUNCAN entered the stadium with Kevin
      Daniel WILLIAMS at about 1330 hours via the
      Leppings Lane turnstiles. They initially
      stood together in Pen 4 but after c she-:
      time moved into Pen 3 . At about 1445 hours
      Andrew DUNCAN saw other friends or. the
      terraces including Anthony Maxwell G3IE- and
      Stuart THOMPSON (Deceased Reference Number
      53).
  At about 1455 hours Andrew DUNCAN was still
 with Kevin WILLIAMS and although the crowd in
 the pen was t i gh tl y packed he was not too
 concerned at that time. As the match started
 he was pushed forwards down the terrace and
 did not see Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS again.

 Following the severe crushing in.the West
 Stand terracing Police Constable l7Qfi M i r h ^ i
John CRAIGHILL went into Pen 3 and assisted a
number of casualties. Police Constable
CRAIGHILL assisted to carry a youth, he now
believes to be Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, from
the gate in the perimeter fencing of Pen 3
onto the pitch. The officer attempted
resuscitation but without success.

Derek William BRUDER is a Police Constable
with Merseyside Police and was at the match
as a spectator in the North Stand. He
recalls seeing a person lying on the pitch
near the Spion Kop/North Stand having
convulsions. M r BRUDER went onto the pitch
and gave mouth to mouth resuscitation aided
by a St Johns Ambulanceman who carried out
cardiac massage. Mr BRUDER recalls tnat a
friend of the casualty was with him on the
pitch. Resuscitation was continued and they
  were joined by a St Johns Amoulance woman who
  took over from Mr BRUDER. After a short time
  the St Johns Ambulanceman said that the
  casualty was dead.      Mr BRUDER then left the
  scene.


 Neither of the St Johns Ambulance personnel
 or the 'friend' of the casualty have been
 identified. The person Mr BRUDER tried to
 resuscitate is now known to be Kevin Daniel
 WILLIAMS.


  Special C o n stable 221 Debra Jane m a r t i n went
 onto the pitch to assist and helped to carrv
 several deceased and also many injured to the
 gymnasium. She assisted to carry one youno
 boy, now known to be Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS,
 into the gymnasium and remained with him.

At 1606 hours Doctor Nadersssen Carpoosamv
CURPEN examined Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS in the
gymnasium which had been established as a
temporary m o rt ua ry and certified life
extinct.


Special Constable MARTIN later escorted the
body of Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS tc the Medico
Legal Centre and confirmed the identification
by Reference Number to Detective Constable
638 Simon WEIGOLD.
   On Sunday, 16 April 1989 Mr James Sr>ni,BH_
        AMS identified the body of his son to
   Police C o n stable 1269 Scott d avr

   On Sunday, 16 April 1989 following
   identification by Detective Constable
  WEIG0LD« Doctor David si atfp carried out an
  autopsy and submitted a report giving cause
  of death.

  BLOOD ETHANOL AWAt YCTC


  Evidence is included regarding the analysis
 of the blood sample from the deceased where
 the presence of ethanol was detected. The
 witnesses proving continuity of the blood
 sample are Detective Constable in 7fi
 Michael GREEN, Detective Sergeant 7616 John
 Albert TURNER and Detective Seroeant lQCP.
 James Norman FLETCHER. Doctor Aleyanri^
 Robert FORREST carried out the analysis.


Found in the personal effects of Kevin Daniel
WILLIAMS was a ticket counterfoil which
confirms his entry to the stadium via a

An examination of video film and pnotocrcpnic
evidence has been made by Police Inspector
   U Y J O N and Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS has been
   identified in Pen 3 . being carried across the
   pitch and at the Spion Kop end of the pitch.

  Photograph R eference DAC 3/1 shows Kevin
  Daniel WILLIAMS apparently unconscious near
  the perimeter fencing in Pen 3. Video
  Reference MAP 7, 1528:33:?? shows him being
  removed from the terraces via Gate 3.

   Police Constable CRAIGHTII has signed a Plan
  of the pitch showing where he first came into
  contact with Kevin WILLIAMS and where he laid
  him on the ground. The officer identified
 •himself on Video Reference MAP 7. 1528:43:24
  carrying a youth now known to be Keith
 WILLIAMS from gate 3 and onto the pitch. The
 officer did not know the identity of the
 youth and first believed it to be another
 deceased.


Photographs Reference PR5/3? and PR5/33 timed
at 1532 hours, show Kevin WILLIAMS being
carried across the pitch on a temporary
stretcher by a number of spectators and two
police officers. Police Constable 437 Sarrv
HAYES has confirmed his identification on the
photographs. The officer assisted to carry
two deceased persons on temporary stretchers
but could not recall any further details. He
did net know the identity of the persons he
carried, he merely assisted to carry the
temporary stretcher.
 A number of photographs including Photooraph
 Reference TT1/3Q. show Kevin WILLIAMS
 being given mouth to mouth on the pitch by Mr
IPUPER who has confirmed this identification.

The parents of Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS have
viewed visual evidence and confirm the
identifications of their son.

                       INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS

                      MR. FRASER:   Sir, you will now hear evidence relating
                 to Kevin Daniel tfilliams. Kevin's mum and dad are in Court
                 with the social worker from Merseyside who has been
                 assisting them.  The solicitors for Kevin's mum and dad are
                 members of my Group and I therefore appear in the usual
           B     guise as their agent to the Steering Committee-

                      THE CORONER:    Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Hilliams.
                Before we begin I am going to explain to you the general
                format of the Inquest because you weren't here a fortnight
                ago, were you, and even if you were you might have
                forgotten.   bfe will start in a moment or two by me reading
                to you what was said on 18th April 1989 which is when I
                opened the Inquest in this very room. Then if there are any
                amendments which need to be made, if we have got some of the
                facts wrong, we will sort that out.     I will then tell you
                what the blood alcohol levels were, as measured by
                Dr- Forrest, and then we will turn to Dr. Slater, who is the
                Pathologist sitting up there behind you.     He will give us
                the pathological evidence.    I think I can safely say that
                if, after this Inquest over, you feel you would like to talk
                to Dr. Slater privately he is quite happy to do that if it
                would be-of any help to you. Uhen Dr- Slater has finished
                the West Midlands Police Officers have prepared a summary
                for me and he will deal with that and tell me about it.

                     Then we will hear from Inspector Layton, another Uest
                Midlands Police Officer, who will deal with the visual
           E    evidence.  He will first of all tell me all about the plans
                and so on and that is sometimes a bit confusing because
                there are a lot of references given but when he has finished
                talking about it he comes over and shows us on these big
                plans so that all of us, that is me, you, the Jury and
                everybody else can follow it. Then when that is done we
                conclude and take no further evidence at this stage.   Is
                that reasonably clear? I like to tell you so that you know
                what to expect.  Otherwise you don't know what is coming.

                     This then is the resumed Inquest which was opened on
                18th April 1989 and on that occasion Neil Anthony Parkin,
                Acting Coroner's Officer, said:

                      "The body which is the subject of this Inquest has been
                      identifled.to PC 1269 Glave of the South Yorkshire
                      Police as that of Kevin Daniel Uilliams by James
                      Stephen Uilliams, his father.  He was 15 years of age
                      having been born on 27th May 1973 at Southport.  He
                      1 ived at                                           He
                      was a schoolboy by occupation.  He died at Hillsborough
                      Football Ground following an incident there on            &

          Saturday, 15th April 1989.  PC Glave caused the body to
          be removed to the Medico Legal Centre and there he
          identified it to Detective Constable Simon Weigold who
          subsequently identified the same body to Dr- Slater.
          It is the family wish that the body should be
          cremated."

          I adjourned the Inquest at that point.   I wrote to you
     shortly afterwards and you, Mr. tfilliams, very kindly signed
     it on 1st May 1989 and I checked with you the details and
     you confirmed the name, that we had got it right, date of
     birth 27.5.73, that is right, isn't it, and the place of
     birth which was Southport wasn't it? We typed it into the
     wrong spot in your case but you spotted that.

          Dr. Forrest did the alcohol levels for many of the
     people who died, including Kevin, and the level in respect
     of Kevin was 56 milligrammes per 100 mils.

                  DR. DAVID NEIL SLATER - Called

                           Bv THE CORONER:

Q. Dr. Slater. - A. Sir, my name is Dr. David Neil Slater.  I
   am a Consultant Histopathologist and a Fellow of the Royal
   College of Pathologists.

          THE CORONER:   Before I go o n , Mr. Williams, you are
     true dad of this lad.

          MR. WILLIAMS:   Stepfather.

          THE CORONER:   Thank you very much. You are mum, yes.
     Mr. Fraser, so that we get the record right.  Is this an
     informal or a proper adoption because obviously the lad
     carries the same surname?

          MR. FRASER:   There is no formal adoption but it is a
     twelve years plus.

          THE CORONER:    Pardon?

          MR. FRASER:   There has been no formal adoption by
     Mr. Uilliams as such but the relationship is more than
     twelve years old.

Q.        THE CORONER:   I am very sorry, Dr. Slater, to have
     interrupted you.  Just remind us of your name because I have
     forgotten where.we were up to? Just start again? _ A. My
     name is Dr. David Neil Slater, Consultant Histopathologist,
     sir.

Q. Dr. Slater, in the usual way you are satisfied that the
   evidence you are going to give me in this case relates to




                                                               1010

     Kevin Daniel Uilliams who was also identified as No. 51, is
     chat right? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Ident i-ficat ion was done by Inspector Timms so far as you are
   concerned? - A. That was the initial identification.

Q. But there is no doubt in your mind about the identity.-*
A. No.
Q. There were various marks on the body itself to identify it?
A . Sir, Kevin was clearly labelled both by number and by name.

Q. Dr. Slater, would you be kind enough then to take me through
   the post mortem? - A. My examination of Kevin showed that
   the main finding was that of asphyxia.  This opinion was
   formed through the extensive blueness on the face and upper
   part of the chest-  In addition there were small
   haemorrhages in both the face and internal organs including
   the brain, heart and lungs. This asphyxia had clearly
   resulted from compression of the neck and chest and this
   opinion was supported by the presence of three smail
   scratches over the left side of the neck and also over the
   front of the voice box. This had also resulted in tour
   fractures to the small bones in the actual voice box.  In
   addition there was evidence of bruising to the lungs, agair.
   supporting compression of the chest.

          My autopsy showed that Kevin was a normally developed,
     fit, healthy, young male with no evidence of any natural
     disease which could have contributed towards death and it
     was my opinion that Kevin had a normal life expectancy.   Ir.
     terms of the mode of death the compression of the neck or
     chest has occurred here and unconsc iousness occurs very
     rapidly, certainly within a few seconds, and there is one
     reported case of it occurring apparently instantaneously.
     Following unconsciousness then there is no discomfort and n.
     pain. Death then occurs after approximately three to five
     minutes, sir.
Q. So because when we say asphyxia people think of agony for
   ages and ages-  Uhat you are saying is that the perso.i
   himself would very rapidly not know anything at all ®bout
   what was happening? - A. I should say the word "asphyxia" :=
   unfortunate in that scientifically it partly includes simp-;
   that there is not enough oxygen in the blood.  It doesn t
   imply actual suffocation and prolonged death.

Q. Did you say there were four fractures to the voice box?
A. Yes, there are two bones in the voice box, as you know, si.
   and both these showed two fractures each.

q   . Now the reason why I asked you was this, and I want to put
      this to you because I would like to get your view on it, or.s
      Officer will be dealing with the value of this evidence in .=.

    moment but she says that at a point when this lad was in the
    gymnasium, in other words he had already been moved across
    the pitch, she says she helped him into the gym from the
    pitch, presumably she carrie'd him.  He stopped breathing.
    She gave him the kiss of life, did some heart massage, he
   opened his eyes said a word and died.    Now in the light of
   your pathological findings, is that in fact a possibility,
   do you think? - A. Well, sir, I was aware of this statement
   and therefore I have clearly given this matter considerable
   thought, sir.    I think there are several comments to make
   but the moderately large number of autopsies I did from this
   incident, sir, this was certainly the most severe case of
   traumatic asphyxia that I actually dealt with.    This was
   both in terms of blueness of the face and also the area of
   pallor of whiteness around the mouth.    Sir, it was a very
   very severe form of asphyxia and I do not think that
   unconsciousness would have been quicker than "hree or five
   seconds.   I have no reason to alter what I have already said
   on that aspect.

        The other very significant thing about this, and it alsc
   supports the severity of this case, is that again of the
   autopsies I did approximately 15 per cent had some sort of
   fracture to the voice box, the larynx. This case was highly
   unusual in that in fact it had four fractures to the larynx.
   It was by far the most severe case of voice box fractures.
   Not only does this indicate the severity of the traumatic
   asphyxia at the time but it also in fact makes it virtually
   impossible for the person to have spoken by virtue of the
   fact that there were fractures to the voice box, sir. So
   all I can say, sir, that scientifically and medically I find
   that inconceivable that the person could have spoken.

Q. The other thing I notice is that you show in this particular
   case extensive congestion of the cerebral veins and
   cereballum and cortical coning and if a person speaks his
   neurons are working, aren't they? - A. That is right.

Q. That evidence would indicate there had been extensive brain
   damage and he couldn't really communicate.  Uould that be
   right? I don't want to put words in your mouth but I want
   to be sure about that? - A. The coning indicates the
   severity of the asphyxia and again that would have resulted
   in irreversible brain damage which again would totally
   prohibit any form of communication.

Q. I have thought about this comment as well, of course, and
   there are several explanations (1) that it didn't occur and
   that the observer is mistaken but another possibility that
   has occurred to me and I want to put it to you and please
   disagree if it is not either right or you don't accept it;
   it is possible, is it not, that if a person having died is
   moved air or stomach contents might be expelled and might
   make a sound as it escapes, so to speak? Is that a
                                                    P S-   JOHN Kl^LOCH-^



       possibility? - A. It is an interesting comment, sir, because
       it is a possibility I considered also myself and that is
       certainly an explanation to the noise which coula have been
       made which may have mimicked,the word "mum" but it would not
       explain the opening of the eyes, sir.

    Q. No. - A. Eut it would explain the noise.

            MR. FRASER:     No questions, sir, but thank you very
       much, Dr. Slater,   for that sympathetic and detailed
B      explanation.

                THE CORONER:     Any other questions for Dr. Slater?
       T h a n k y o u very much. Dr. Slater.  We spent a lot of time
       thinking about this sentence because it was difficult.         I
       didn't think it was possible from what I knew of the
       evidence but, on the other hand, we didn ’t want you to feel
       that we weren1^ telling you what w p « in the statements.       We
       felt it was better for you to hear it and have it explained
       rather than for us to keep it under wraps, so to speak, and
       you might possibly find out some other time.        I hope I have
       taken the right decision.        I don't know.  The only person
       who knows that is you.        We did spend a lot of time thinking
       about it wondering what to do for the best.

D                 POLICE SERGEANT JOHN ffLLLOCH '•“ ■Cal led

                              By THE CORONER:

    Q. Yes. - A. Police Sergeant John Killocht,;- sir, of the West
       Midlands Police.  I have previousTy"taken the Oath.

    Q. Could you then please, if you would, take me through the
       statement? - A. At 0700 hours on Saturday, 15th April 1939,
       Mr. James Stephen Williams saw his son, Kevin Daniel
       Williams, leave the family home with the intention of
       travelling to Sheffield.  He was to travel by train w i t h a
       number of friends to watch the Semi Final football match at
       Hillsborough Stadium.  Kevin had a ticket for the match.

           Andrew Duncan travelled to Sheffield with Kevin, Thomas
      James Nickson and Gregory Fagen.  They travelled by train,
      arriving at Sheffield at 1040 hours.  Gregory Fagen left the
      others at the station-  The other three youths caught a bus
      from the station to Hillsborough Stadium where Thomas
      Nickson left them.

            Andrew Duncan entered the stadium with Kevin at about
      1330 hours via the Leppings Lane turnstiles.   They initially
      stood together in Enclosure 4 but shortly after they moved
      to Enclosure 3. At about 1445 hours Andrew Duncan saw other
      friends on the terraces, including Anthony Maxwell Grier and
      Stuart Thompson.   Stuart, of course, also lost his life at
      Hi 1lsborough-

     Ac about 1455 hours Andrew Duncan was still with Kevin
and although the crowd in the enclosure was tightly packed
he was not too concerned at that stage.  As the match
started he was pushed forward down the terrace and did not
see Kevin again.

     Following the severe crushing in the West Stand
terracing Police Constable Michael John Craighill went into
Enclosure 3 and assisted a number of casualties.  Police
Constable Craighill assisted to carry a youth, he now
believes to be Kevin, from the gate in the perimeter fence
of Enclosure 3 and on to the pitch-  The Officer attempted
resuscitation but without success.

     Derek William Bruder, an off-duty Police Constable from
the Merseyside Police who was a spectator at the match,
recalls seeing a person lying on the pitch near the Spion
Kop/North Stand of the ground.  The person as having
convu1sions. Mr. Bruder went on to the pitch anc gave mouth
to mouth resuscitation aided by a St. Johns Arnbul snceman who
carried out cardiac massage• Mr- Bruder recalls that a
friend of the casualty was with him on the pitch.
Resuscitation was continued and they were joined by a St.
Johns Ambulancewoman who took over from Mr. Bruder.    Aiter a
short time the St. Johns Ambulanceman said that the casualty
was dead.  Mr. Bruder then left the scene.

     Neither of the St. Johns Ambulance personnel or the
friend of the casualty have been identified.  The person
Mr. Bruder tried to resuscitate is now known to be Kevin-

     Special Constable Debra Martin went on to the pitch to
assist and she helped to carry several deceased persons and
many injured persons to the. gymnasium. She assisted to
carry one youth who she now knows to be Kevin into the
gymnasium where she remained with him.

     At 1606 hours Dr. Curpen examined Kevin in the
gymnasium which had been established as a temporary
mortuary.  Dr. Curpen certified life extinct.

     Special Constable Martin later escorted K evin’s body to
the Medico Legal Centre and she confirmed the identification
by reference number to DC Weigold.

     On Sunday, 16th April 1989, Mr- James Stephen Wi11iams
identified the body of his son to Police Constable Scott
Glave.
     On Sunday, loth April, following identification by
Detective Constable Weigold, Dr- David Slater carried out an
autopsy and submitted a report giving the cause or death-
r                                                            JOHN .KlLLO.fH



                 Evidence is included regarding the analysis of a blood
            sample taken from Kevin where the presence of ethanol was
            detected.  The witnesses proving continuity of the blood
            sample are Detective Constable Green, Detective Sergeant
            Turner and Detective Sergeant Fletcher.  Dr. Alexander
            Robert Forrest carried out the analysis.

                 Found in Kevin's personal effects was a ticket
            counterfoil which is consistent with his entry to the
    B       stadium via a turnstile.  That concludes my evidence, sir.
            There is visual evidence.

        Q. I think I am right in saying, am I not, that Mr. Bruder (I
           am looking at page 47) identifies Kevin from clothing, is
           that right? - A. He has been shown photographs which show
           Kevin which Mr. Layton will deal with later and one of the
           photographs I believe does show Mr. Bruder actually giving
           first aid.

        Q. So there is no doubt about it that Mr. Bruder was involved?
        A. Ho.

        Q   His personal recollection isn't as strong? - A. No, but vha:
            he does recollect is corroborated by the visual evidence.

    D   Q   We have already mentioned the evidence of Special Constable
            Martin who said about the lad speaking.  In no way do I wan:
            to run poor Special Constable Martin down because she hsc a
            very hard day but it is right she was obviously from her
            statements very distressed? - A. I also wouldn't want to
            criticise WPC Martin in any way but I have interviewed her
            twice, sir, and she was particularly upset as indeed many
            people were but it affected her particularly badly the
            events of that day.

                 THE CORONER:   Well,   I wo n ’t ask you to draw a
            conclusion.  Mr. Fraser-

                 i1R. FRASER:  There is a matter arising out of wha t the
            Officer says which may perhaps leave a doubt in Kevin's
            parents' minds. Can I ask you to ask Dr- Slater to deal
            with the point that was made in paragraph six of the
            summary, sir?

                 THE CORONER:    About the convulsions?

                 MR- FRASER     Yes, sir-

                 THE CORONER:   Yes, I will do that.      I will ask
            Dr. Slater to come down in a moment.

                 MR. FRASER:    Thank you, sir-

                 THE CORONER:    Is there anything else you want to ask?
                                           DR. DAVID NEIL SLATER
                                           D.I. MICHAEL LAYTON



        MR. FRASER:    Mo, thank you, sir.

        THE CORONER:    I will recall Dr. Slater-

               DR. DAVID NEIL SLATER - Recalled

                         Bv THE CORONER;

Q- Dr- Slater, the point that is being made, of course, you
   have got to remember that Mr. Bruder was at theSpion     Hop
   end, the bottom end and not the top, and he says,    "Isaw
   this man lying on the floor having convulsions” - Can you
   help us about that? What does that add or not to your
   pathological opinion? - A. It is obviously very distressing.
   Unfortunately when people have not got enough oxygen in the
   brain, as I said in my earlier evidence, which is really
   what the word ‘'asphyxia'* means, individuals can in fact have
   fits.   This is one of the mechanisms that leads towards
   death and makes the asphyxia worse.    This does, however,
   only occur when the individual is totally unconscious.     It
   does not mean there will *be any pain or discomfort. The
   pe rson will not know they are fitting and actually 1 have tc
   accept that some individuals do have convulsions and it is
   one of the mechanising leading to death in traumatic
   asphyx ia , sir-

Q. Does it make you feel the other evidence about the lad
   breathing and speaking either more or less likely because
   obviously this would be much closer in time to Special
   Constable Martin's evidence than what had happened on the
   terrace? - A. Yes.  For somebody to have convulsions, this
   would imply that the amount of asphyxia is such that there
   must be virtually irreversible brain damage present and
   again this would fully support the concept that the evidence
   of opening eyes and speaking is not really conceivable, sir-

        THE CORONER:   Does that help, Mr- Fraser-

                 Cross-Examined bv MR- FRASER:

        MR. FRASER:   I am sure it does, Dr. Slater.  It is
   difficult to find the phrase to sum the situation up. Kevir.
   at that stage was beyond help. He was as good as dead? - A.
   Yes, that is right, absolutely.

Q. And would feel nothing and know nothing? - A. Absolutely.
   He would know nothing.

          DETECTIVE INSPECTOR MICHAEL LAYTON - Called

                        By THE CORONER:

Q. Inspector Layton. - A. Sir, Michael Layton, Detective
   Inspector in the West Midlands Police.




                                                            i'046
                                       D .I . MIC HA EL LAYTON



         Sir, -an examination has been made of video filn and
  photographic evidence and Kevin has been identiiied in^
  Enclosure No. 3, also, sir, being carried across the pitch
  •and at. T h e Spion Kop end of the ground.

       On a photograph referenced DAC3/1 Kevin is shown
  apparently unconscious near the perimeter fencing in
  Enclosure No- 3. On a BBC video tape, referenced HAP 7,
  timed at 1528:33:22 this shows him being removed from the
  terraces via Gate No. 3.

       PC Craighill has signed a plan of the pitch showing
  where he first came into contact with Kevin and where in
  fact he laid him on the ground and that plan, sir, is
  referenced MJC2.  The Officer has identified himself on
  video, again a BBC video tape, WAP 7, timed at 1528:4j.:24
  carrying a youth who he knows to be Kevin - that is a typing
  error there.  It says Keith in the summary but it should be
  Kevin - from Gate 3 and on to the pitch. The Officer did
  not know the identity of the youth and at first in fact
  believed it to be another of the deceased but that has been
  clarified.

       Photograph referenced PR5/32 and PR5/33 which are both
  timed at 1532 show Kevin being carried across the pitch on a
  temporary stretcher by a number of spectators and two Police
  Officers.  PC Hayes has confirmed his identification on
  those photographs.  The Officer assisted to carry two people
  on temporary stretchers, both of whom were deceased, but he
  couldn't recall any other details and he didn't know the
  identity of the persons he carried.  He merely L as it were,
  assisted in carrying.  Me have mentioned that before.   It is
  not an unusual feature that people's recollections weren >.
  exacc.
       A number of photographs, including a photograph
  referenced TT1/30 show Kevin being given mouth to mouth
  resuscitation on the pitch by PC Bruder who confirmed hi&
  identification.  Sir, you mentioned this Officer earlier.
  In fact, it is true to say Mr. and Mrs. Williams have
  previously seen visual evidence. They have in fact seen
  some of that visual evidence again today and I think I
  right in saying they have confirmed that Kevin is shown on
  that photograph so, as it were, PC Bruder is confirmed as
  having given mouth to mouth resuscitation to Kevin-

Q. The reason I asked is because it refers to a friend^and
   there doesn't seem to be any other evidence of that?
A. No, that is right.  It is true to say the initial
   identification was from clothing but it has subsequently
   been confirmed.
        Sir, can I refer you to a plan which has been given the
   referenca I1WJL40 which is a plan of the terraces?
                                                                   D .I . MICHAEL LAYTON




                        Q.    Yes, C201 . - And MWJL41 which is a. plan of the pitch-

                        Q.    MJC2 are they the same markings? - A- I would say, sir, that
                             in fact although there are two markings the reference to MAP
                             7 on the previous planactually would deal with PC Craighill
                             on that occasion.

                        Q- So I1WJL41 we make C202 - Let us include that one as well
                    B      I1JC2 will be C203. - A. Which is PC Craighil]‘s plan.
                           (moved to plan) Sir, if we can deal with the plan MWJL40,
                           which is the plan of the terraces, the first photograph
                           DAC3/1 referred to in this summary indicates the position
                           here (indicat ing) and this indicates Enclosure No- 3 and it
                           is at this point here (indicat ing) that Kevin is shown quite
                           close to the perimeter fence.

                                  the second identification, MAP 7, the BBC tape, refers
                             to the identification by PC Craighill and the point at which
                             we see Kevin is approximately here (indicat ing) and it is
                             prior to his removal via Gate 3.

                                  Then, sir, in respect of PC Craighill‘s plan, MJC2, it
                                a terrace plan he refers to but he actually indicates a
                    D        position here (indicat ing) in front of Gate 3 and a further
                             position which is shown just off the plan but it is here-
                             It is just on to the pitch-

                        Q. It is diagrammatic? - A. Yes.

                        Q. Certainly the second location can't be taken as giving us
                           any sense of distance? - A. No, but factually the next plan
                           will do that.  I think, sir, just to correct myself I should
                           have been pointing there.

                        Q. Yes. - A. Sir in respect of MWJL41, the video reference on
   %                       BBC tape, MAP 7, indicates a position here (indicating)
                           which accords with PC Craighill’s recollection.  There is
                           also photographic identification on PR5/32 which is where
                           Kevin is being carried across the pitch and the location
                           referred to is there (indi cat ing).

                        Q. Remind me, do we know the time for that one? - A. Yes, I
                           think it is 1532, sir. Yes, 1532.   A further photograph,
                           sir, TT1/30, which I think refers to PC Brucer, the location
                           of that is approximately this position here (indicating)
                           which is towards the Spion Kop end of the pitch.

                                 THE CORONER:    Mr. Fraser

                                 MR- FRASER:    No questions.

H a r o h a m Ltd
                  Cross-Examined by HR. LIME;

Q. Has the photograph with the reference DAC3/1 a timed
   photograph? - A- No, sir-

               Cross-Examined bv MR. CATCHPOLE:

Q. Andrew Duncan, did he show any visual evidence or did he
   give a plan showing where he last saw Kevin, when they
   parted company? - A. I do n ’t believe so. Can you just give
   me a moment? The answer is we don't have a plan from
   Mr- Duncan.

       THE CORONER:   If I can help you a little bit on that
  one, what Andrew Duncan says is, "We stood up and were
  standing about two to two and a quarter yards from the
  perimeter fence around the pitch-  We were waiting for the
  game to start.  At about 1445 or so a group of friends were
  standing behind me, Stuart Thompson and Tony Grier.   I was
  standing with Kevin Williams".  Then he describes the people
  coming out and he says, "When the game kicked off I was
  pushed forward down the terrace about two yards. After this
  push I lost Kevin and did not see him again". His final
  remark is that he saw Kevin for the last time on the terrace
  just before the crush started.  "The last time I saw Kevin
  was on the terrace just before the crush started.   After
  this I did not see him again".  That is his statement, jusc
  so that we know what it is which one we are talking about,
  dated 17-5-89.  Anything else, Mr. Fraser, you want to asK.J

       MR. FRASER:    No, sir.

       THE CORONER:   Mr. and Mrs- Williams, that is the
  evidence we are going to take.  As I said to you in the
  middle of the hearing we spent quite a lot of time wondering
  what we should do for the best-  Obviously we knew Kevin
  lost his life and we were worried about upsetting you in
  Court but I think on balance we have done the right thing
  because you have heard within the limits of what we are
  doing and summarising the evidence what happened and what
  went on. Fortunately, Dr. Slater has been able to be here
  and he has been able to give you his opinion as to what
  happened in his view and what in his view is possible and I
  think I am sure that will help you - not to come to terms
  with the loss of your son but it is very difficult to come
  to terms with that loss at all but just to appreciate in the
  stress situation in which people found themselves
  reco11ections tend sometimes to be mistaken and indeed there
  are lots of mistaken recollections not only in relation to
  Kevin but also in relation to many of the other people of
  which we have heard. That is not at all uncommon and occurs
  in normal fatal incidents as well.  It is exceedingly
  difficult when you are suddenly confronted with a situation
  to then recount exactly what happened.




                                                           1019
                            I realise Kevin was a young boy, just fifteen, which is
                      very very young of course and I would like you to know how
                      very sorry we are that he should have lost his life at such
                      an early age in this tragedy.   The Jury have had to deal
                      with many cases but today, at this moment, ve are just
                      dealing with yours and so far as we are able we would like
                      you to know we are conscious of that. Thank you for being
                      here.
                  B
                           Ladies and gentlemen, we rise for a moment or two and
                      then we proceed to deal with our next Inquest.

                        (The Inquest into the death of Kevin Daniel Williams
                               was adjourned until a date to be fixed)

Kevin.
    A   He goes on then, sir, to deal with specific matters
        that I referred him to in his original statement.
        Specifically, sir, from the transcript and police file
        he deals with page 41 of the police file statements,
        which is oaee 6 of his original statement in April last
        year.   He reters and confirms seeing Kevin a quarter
        of the length of the pitch.from the Spion Kop end of
        the ground.   He refers to his being on the floor and
    B   clarifies that as on the grass surface of the pitch.

        He has given very careful consideration, sir, to the
        expression that he used of having convulsions and in
        the light of his further training and what he now knows
        and thinks about the incident was that "convulsions"
        was not the word that was applicable to these
•   €   circumstances.   He refers specifically to having seen
        epileptic fits and says that what he originally
        described as a convulsion was not anything like an
        epileptic fit.   He goes on to say later, sir, that if
        there was a part of the body that he saw move it was
        his head and that the word that he best thinks
        describes this movement is that of a twitch.

    D   lie refers to comments he made originally about
        approaching the body, the body that was convulsing.
        Having specifically considered it again, sir, he does
        say that the body was not convulsing as he approached
        it.    He referred originally, sir, to feeling for a
        carotid pulse and originally he thought he had detected
        a slight pulse.    On reflection, sir, he feels he would
        be much more skilful if he were required to perform
    E   this action again and he cannot discount the
        possibility that he did not feel immediately in the
        right place for the carotid artery.    He certainly felt
        in the neck region where he thought he would find the
        artery but he cannot say he would have gone to it
        directly.

        I put to him, sir, the specific point I believe Dr.
    F   Slater made in his evidence about this inquest a couple
        of days ago and PC Bruder specifically discounts having
        felt for the carotid artery with his thumb.    He refers
        to the first two fingers of his left hand.

        He says in dealing with the carotid pulse that   he may
        have touched other areas around the neck region,
        including the Adam's apple and that whatever he felt
    G   there he cannot be categoric it was a pulse.     He feels
        he may well be mistaken in that matter, sir.

        Later in his statement of April last year, sir, he
        referred to the face of Kevin Williams going grey and
        being withdrawn.   He wanted you to know, sir, that he
        cannot specifically say he saw the face change from a
    H
                                                        6

normal pallor, or colour, to grey.   He mentioned it in
his statement, sir, in the sequence that it occurred to
him that he was now noticing that he was grey.   He may
have been grey as he approached him before he mentioned
it, or it may have occurred as he noticed it.

In his original statement he referred to vomiting and
thinking that Kevin had been sick.   fie has given this
matter some further thought and he is absolutely
satisfied that Kevin was not sick.   He did not see
Kevin vomiting and he did not see vomit on the ground
or on his clothing.

Does he still confirm that there was a distinctive
smell? - A. Yes, he does, sir.

To finish with the vomiting aspect of his original
statement, he does have a clear impression in his mind,
sir, of a fluid of some sort in the mouth, but he
cannot discount that that could be spittle or phlegm of
some sort.

He referred in his original statement to the original
resuscitation attempts whereby he gave mouth to mouth
resuscitation and the St. John's Ambulanceman commenced
heart compressions.   His original thought, sir, was
that that was for approximately seven minutes and, give
or take, he is happy with that time and thinks it is
reasonably accurate.    He then later referred to
swopping over with the St. John's Ambulanceman and PC
Derek Bruder was then involved in external heart
compressions and this was when he noticed the unusual
rib cage and he had earlier referred, sir, to
unbuttoning his shirt, I believe.    He referred to
unzipping his trousers and noticing some striped boxer
shorts that you will see in the photographs that have
been referred to, TT.1/31 and 32 respectively.

I h av e put to him the apparent difficulties in the time
sequence of the action that he describes near the Spion
Kop end of the ground and his specific reference to am
ambulance and asking the St. Jphn's Ambulance colleague
whp w a s assisting nim and who has n u c b een identif Lecf,
t.o stop c n e a m o u l a n c e D e c a u s e he was considering
utilising it, sir.

I have drawn his attention to the problems in relation
to the known timing of ambulances arriving on the
pitch, both of St. John's and of the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service and I have drawn his
attention to the apparent discrepancy in relation to
the time shown on photographs PR.5/ a .32 and 3, sir.
. The point is that the ambulances were known to arrive
  at about 1515 and 1517 or thereabouts? - A. Yes, sir.

. And the photograph, PR.5/A/32 and so on, is timed at
  1532? - A. That is correct, sir.

. We are saying he was dealing with this young boy after
  that? - A. That is correct.

.    In fact I put the wrong times to you.  It is 1515 on
    the pitch for the St. John's Ambulance and 1520 for the
    first South Yorkshire... - A. That is correct, sir,
    irrespective of which...

. It is still earlier... - A. It is still earlier than
  1532, sir, and that point has been put specifically to
  Hr. Bruder and try as he may he is simply ur sble to
  reconcile those differences.   I have put to him, sir,
  was it for instance a question of one of those
  ambulances actually exiting the stadium across the
  pitch rather than entering the stadium.   He has
  considered that point and try as he may his
  recollection is still of it being an ambulance that
  entered the stadium.

    He refers then to being joined by the woman St. John's
    Ambulance Officer, who he refers to pushing him out of
    the way to become involved as a trained first aider and
    recollects this was approximately six minutes after he
    changed places with the male ambulance officer.    for
    that reason, with the original seven minutes mouth to
    mouth resuscitation, PC Bruder feels that that total of
    thirteen minutes he could amend to a period of tirce of
    between ten and fifteen minutes of sustained attempts
    to resuscitate Kevin.

    It was at this point, sir, that after approximately two
    minutes of the involvement of the woman St. John's
    Ambulance Officer, that the male St. John's Ambulance
    Officer stood up and said, "He's gone."    Ke referred
    to the expression being completely grey and would seek
    to reaffirm that choice of words as his description of
    Kevin at that particular moment in time.   lie says,
    sir, and I quote:

        "There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, both new
        and with the benefit of further training, that
        then at the moment the youth I had tried to save
        was dead, certainly dead, and beyond any further
        help.   I and St. John's Ambulance personnel would
        not have stopped if there had been any glimmer of
        hope at all.   There was none."




                                                              1030
He refers to the personal description of Kevin again,
sir, and refers to the fact he is r-bsolutely s a t i s f i e d
it was Kevin Williams that he was attempting to
resuscitate.

     THE CORONER:   I just want to make it crystal
clear that there is no suggestion in any of this of any
criticism of PC Bruder.   I think he did absolutely
valiantly and did his best.   Not only did he do his
best on the day, he is doing his best today as well,
through Inspector Sawers, to try and help us understand
what he remembers and I want that clearly understood by
everybody.   I don't want you to think w e are knocking
him.  We are not.  All I am trying to do is finding out
what happened.

      Mr. Fraser, any questions of this officer on this
part?    I had better tell you who else I am going to be
calling.    Dr. Slater and Dr. Gumpert, whom I will tell
you about when he comes.    He is a neuro physiologist,
a clinician, and an expert on this sort of thing.

     MR. FRASER:    No, sir, I have no specific
questions, save to say that I understand, Officer, you
have spoken to Mr. and Mrs. Williams, having spoken to
the officer?    I rise because I appear for Mr. and Mrs.
Williams and obviously have their interests at heart.

     THE WITNESS:   I did go and visit Mr. and Mrs.
Williams, sir, yesterday evening, having seen PC Bruder
and I have outlined briefly to them the contents of PC
Bruder's further thoughts and recollections for Kevin
on the day.

     MR. FRASER:   Sir, I understand they are
appreciative, both of the efforts the officer has made
and of his visit and they have n o questions.  They
have decided not to come today, sir, for reasons which
I am sure you will understand but they are fully aware
of exactly what is going on on their behalf.

     THE CORONER:       Thank you.     Have you got any
questions?

      MR. LIMB:     No, thank you.

      MR. CATCHPOLE:      No, thank you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   When we have heard the rest of the
evidence I am quite prepared to recall any of these
officers, or, indeed, any of these witnesses because I
want us to understand it.

      Dr. Slater.

                                                                  1031
              DR.   DAVID SLATER R e c a l l e d

                     By THE CORONER:

Dr. Slater, you have, of course, already dealt with
this case a couple of days ago.    If I remember rightly
you said, among other things, that (a) this lad had a
broken voice box.    It was broken in four places.
Also (b) he was, of all the cases you dealt with,
perhaps the most asphyxiated, if one can judge that by
cyanosis and so on.    Would that be a correct
recollection? - A. That is absolutely correct, sir.    Of
all the cases I dealt with Kevin showed really the
worst injuries to the neck in that there were four
fractures to the voice box.    In addition there were
three very large scratches; to the neck.   In addition
to cne normal signs ot asphyxia, the blueness and the
hemorrhages i^hich were /ery marked, there is no doubt
this was a very, very severe case of asphyxia and
probably the worst one I dealt with, sir.

We established to everybody's satisfaction what had
happened in the gymnasium and the account, we dealt
with that as to whether this lad could have spoken and
so on, so we don't need to be concerned about that.
What we are interested in this afternoon is the
evidence relating to Hr. Bruder.   I will also remind
you that in general that what has been said is that a
person becomes unconscious in an asphyxial situation
within anything from zero to twenty to thirty seconds.
There is a slight variation amongst pathologists, but
quickly.   Then that death usual supervenes within four
to six minutes or thereabouts.   The problem is, as you
have already heard, that whichever way you look at it,
Mr. Bruder was dealing with this young man quite a few
minutes after he had been taken out from the Leppings
Lane terraces.

In the light of the evidence can you help us as to what
you think was going on on? - A. Yes, sir.   I will deal
with this in three general areas and then Dr. Gumpert
certainly will come and enlarge on these and nelp us
out further.

Firstly, and I apologise if this is an emotive area, I
think I need just to spend thirty seconds in explaining
what death is.-  Death is a sequence of events.    It is
not one set event and the sequence I will put^ to you is
an individual becoming unconscious;  whilst they are
unconscious they quickly lose all sensation o: pain and
discomfort;  then there is a period of various tissues
in the body which are susceptible to a lack or oxygen,
dying.   The most important one of these is, of course,
the brain, and after about three to six minutes the
brain undergoes irreversible brain damage.    There is
then a point which we call brain death.    This is a
difficult concept, but by this I am implying that the
brain is irreversibly damaged.   The brain is no longer
able to control respiration and in fact that person,
for effective purposes, is dead, irreversibly.    That
is a medico legal definition, at least one medico legal
definition, of death.

The problem now comes that I have not mentioned other
tissues in the body.   For example, the heart, a very
emotive organ.   When somebody is brain dead it is
quite possible that the heart is still alive and still
beating and this can go on for a few minutes or longer,
perhaps even half an hour.

Then we come to the point where the brain is dead, not
controlling respiration, and finally the heart stops
and that is really the point of whole body death and
that is really what the lay person understands by
death.  A doctor going up, putting the stethoscope on
the chest, no heart beat, no respiration, then that
person is unequivocally dead.

I hasten to add there that although the person is truly
medico legally dead, in fact even then there are
tissues in the body that are still alive.     The skin is
still living.    The kidneys are still living.    This is
how we can then transplant them.      In fact it is an
emotive area and although that person is dead, there
are still tissues living.     It then takes another six
to twelve hours for all the tissues in the body to die.

Really, when we use the word "death" we have to be
very, very careful we are not talking about one set
event at one point in time.    We are talking about a
whole continuum of events that go on.

I mentioned that some tissues do not die as rapidly as
the brain and this includes both nerves and muscle.
In fact one can have a situation of somebody being
brain dead but the muscles and the nerves in what we
call the peripheral nervous system - not the brain -
are still living and in fact these can occasionally
function in some way.

Sir, that is a -general comment on death.

In relation to the Hillsborough incident, the sequence
that myself has given, and although I have not heard
the other pathologists I understand they have given a
very similar sequence of events, has been a rapid loss
of consciousness, perhaps five to ten seconds.   I
understand I have been the nearest by quoting a paper
    t




    A           where unconsciousness can be instantaneous.   That is
                the rapid loss of consciousness.

                As soon as that person becomes unconscious I have said
                several times that pain modalities, discomfort, again
                disappear very, very quickly, perhaps within a second
                or five seconds.

    B           In very general terms, certainly myself - and I have
                tried to keep it general - I then said that death - and
                I have used the word very broadly, as you will
                appreciate in my previous evidence - that death occurs
                five, ten perhaps fifteen minutes after.   I purposely
                kept that very open because human beings are very
                variable.   You cannot say that somebody is going to
                die in fifteen minutes, and not in fifteen minutes.
*   c
                I am trying to put the concept that although I have
                talked about averages, very occasionally you are going
                to have additional extremes.   I think Kevin was one of
                these extremes that did not fall into this five, ten or
                fifteen minute sequence of somatic death, whole bcdv
                death, but in fact this was extended.
    D
                Having said that, Kevin had extremely severe asphyxia.
                I have no doubt in my own mind that he had suffered
                irrecoverable brain damage and death within the three
                to six minutes that I said.   Therefore, I am quite
                confident at that cime cnat Kevin was dead and there is
                nothing that anybody on this earth could have done for
                him after that time, including PC Bruder and any
    E           ambulance people who arrived.

                Again, you will appreciate from what I have said to you
                that although Kevin was brain dead I have not said that
                other tissues in the body may not have been living -
                the heart, muscles, nerves.    In fact I know Dr-
                Gumpert will explain in a minute that in fact there are
                mechanisms whereby wTien aomeDody is brain dead in fac;
        F       the muscles in the body can twitch.    This will ccme as
                a surprise, and I apologise if it is emotive, this car.
                even happen to somebody who hasn't got a heaa.     ihat
                person is clearly dead, they haven't got a head, cut
                those persons can actually have twitches in their
                muscles.    This is what happened to Kevin.   He died
                early - brain death - but unfortunately in this
                particular instance we are talking about an extrerr.e^
    G           case where perhaps the heart beating went on for a bit
                 longer and we noticed these twitches, at least PC.
                 Bruder noticed these twitches in the body.
            t
            I   I feel this is what happened in the case of Kevin.



                                                                           1034
From the description - in fact it is only fair to say
von also had a word with PC Bruder because you were
concerned, you wanted to be quite sure that you
understood his evidence personally, so to speak? - A.
Yes, sir.

In the light of what you heard and what we have heard
now, do you feel that this lad died, if you like, in
the totality sense, I don't meant that his skin was
dead, but in lay terms at the point in time when Mr.
Bruder was with him? - A. Yes, sir, I am quite
confident of that.    When one speaks to lay people who
have experienced people dying, a word which is
recurrent in these descriptions of death is the way
that individuals turn grey.    In fact I was very
impressed by the content in PC Bruder's statement of
the word "grey", recurring several times.    To me as a
doctor that implied that that was the point of whole
body death.    In fact I feel that it was probably
around that time that Kevin's whole body died.     His
brain had died tventv/twenty five minutes before that
at the time of' the crushing, but his whoie body died at
the time PC Bruder was with him.

We have mentioned these twitches and I think sometimes
they are referred to as spinal reflexes? - A. that is
correct, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Now, Mr. Fraser, is that reasonably
clear?

     MR. FRASER:   Even to me, sir, thank you, and I am
sure it will be clear to the family.

     THE CORONER:   Any questions?

            Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:

Doctor, it is an emotive subject.   I remember in your
evidence about Kevin you described death in terms of a
process rather than as a moment? - A. Yes.

I would like to ask you a few questions about the
process following unconsciousness.   As I understand
it, in the cases of these victims, unconsciousness has
come ten to twenty seconds after compression of the
chest? - A. Yes.--.

That is as a result of oxygen to blood mix leading to
unconsciousness? - A. Yes.   There are various...    We
are now not talking about the actual cause of death,
but mechanisms.   One very profound view that has been
put forward of crush asphyxia, traumatic asphyxia, it
is not simply only the reduction of oxygen going to the
brain, but the fact that in fact there cannot be
circulation through the brain.   The pressure from the
chest is reflected up into the brain so in fact
effectively the cerebral circulation stops, so it comes
up against a dead end and it cannot circulate round.
But, yes, your concept then is right.

Following unconsciousness, that is to say, twentv
seconds^ say, after the start of the crush becoming^
       is the body capable of facial expressions or
uoes it have a neutral expression? - A. First of all
the word "unconscious" itself is a very vague term, as
you probably appreciate.    There are varying degrees of
unconsciousness - superficial unconsciousness, perhaps
a sort of sleeping...    You are unconscious, really,
when you are sleeping, and then, of course,
unconsciousness becomes deeper and deeper and deeper.
The deeper bit is when one truly loses pain sensations
and in fact in this particular instance having spoken
both to Dr. Gumpert and, indeed, a consultant
anaesthetist, everybody I have spoken to is confident
that pain modalities have disappeared very quickly,
perhaps within one or two seconds, five seconds is the
longest I have heard somebody express.

As I understand your evidence, following that short
period of five, ten, twenty seconds at the most, there
is profound unconsciousness rather than, say, the
unconsciousness of sleep.   Is the face then of the
unconscious person, the profoundly unconscious person,
capable of expression of any sort, or is there a
neutral expression? - A. I think I prefer to leave that
to Dr. Gumpert because you are into a clinical area
there of what we call reflexes.   I am not trying to
avoid the question.   I think he will be able to give
you a very expert professional witness reply to that.
Would that be reasonable to you?

     HR. LIMB:   Certainly.    Sir, may I pursue that
matter with Mr. Gumpert?

      THE CORONER:  Certainly.    I want to be as
helpful as I can.   It is a difficult subject and in a
sense we are slotting it into the inau.e_s.t of this poor
boy, but it is a more general topic and it wilij ot
cuui.se, apply in a sense to everybody, but i don^t see
how we can avoid doing it.    Please do pursue it with
Dr. Gumpert.

     Thank you, Dr. Slater.




                                                            1036
        DR. ERNEST JOHN WALLACE GUMPERT Sworn

                    By THE CORONER:

Dr. Gumpert, could you first of all give us your full
names, qualifications and appointment? - A. Ernest John
Wallace Gumpert.   I am a Bachelor of Medicine of the
University at Cambridge, Bachelor of Surgery of the
University of Cambridge.   A Member of the Royal
College of Surgeons and a Fellow of the Royal College
of Physicians of London.   I am consulting clinical
neuro physiologist and consulting neurologist to the
Sheffield Area Health Authority, Teaching.

Dr. Gumpert, although you are a Sheffield man^
professionally, I dragged you bacK rrom Cambridge
today? - A. Yes, sir.

Where I tracked you down!    I very much appreciate the
fact you dropped all your other arrangements in order
to be here.    Thank you very much.      Dr. Gutnpert, you,
of course, had nothing whatever to do with this case.
I think you dealt with quite a lot of the injured
following. Hillsborough ana m u e e a you may well know one
or two people I will be referring to later, but this
particular case was not one you came across.        You have
heard the evidence which has been put regarding this
young man.    What I would like you to do now is to give
us a short explanation, as you see death, in the first
instance and then we will try and relate it to this
young man and particularly Mr. Bruder's evidence
relating to him. - A. In about 1979 or 1980 when it
became possible to carry out renal transplantations or
kidney transplantations, it became very important that
the supply of kidneys of people who had died acutely,
usually in accidents, could be increased because the
life of a patient who has had a kidney transplant is
completely different to the life of a patient who has
to have dialysis three times a week.       They can go back
 to normal life.

A hypothesis of brain death was then discussed, agreed
and published.    This consisted of certain examinations
of the back part of the brain, the part we call the
brain stem.    If you imagine the brain as being like a
walnut, and it is., it is like having a carrot stuck
underneath the walnut, and it is the carrot that
matters.    This is where blood pressure, pulse,
respiration and a whole variety of other functions are
controlled.    Once this part of the brain is dead, and
this death occurs, as you heard from Dr. Slater, in
between four and six minutes after deprivation of
oxygen, then the person is going to die.    They can be
  kept alive by artificial means and some of you may
  remember the case in America which was kept alive tor
  thirteen and a half years.

 Some of us were concerned that the guidelines that were
 drawn up were not strict enough and that there was no
 call for them to be repeated after a passage of time.
 Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted in a
 BBC "Panorama" programme one night at ten o'clock when
 the medical profession for once actually debated it,
 eight of us.    As a result of that debate the
 regulations were hardened.    They had to be carried out
 by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
 to be repeated.    A satisfactory outcome from my
 personal point of view, although I don't know whether
 the anguish was worth it really.

 As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
 years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
 procedure many times.   It was part of my professional
 duty but still to this day I cannot certify someone
 dead without being disturbed by it still.

  From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
  experience of brain death and brain damage.     It seems
  clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
  grobablv dead before he was .got out of. the area in
  which he was standing.   I would agree with Dr. Slater.
  I would think consciousness was lost probably within
  ten seconds.   I would say loss of pain would be almost
  instantaneous - not quite, but almost.

  I cannot explain the. Liverpool Police Constable's term
  "convulsion ' because to me a convulsion is a major
  epileptic attack and he has quite clearly said he does
  not mean that, so I don't know what he does mean.    I
  think it would be wrong for me to try and guess what he
  means.   I think we could accept that he does not mean
  any significant movement.

  Unfortunately, after people are brain stem dead, they
  can twitch and very unnerving it is too.   This is
  really due to a spinal reflex.  What we think happens
  in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the brain stem
  dies first.   The cortex, that is the thinking part of
  the brain, your walnut, probably goes on quite a bit
  longer and the-peripheral nervous system probably quite
  a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
  what has been described by the Liverpool officer.

. I know the Liverpool officer in his supplemental
  statement when he was discussing the question of a
  pulse says he may have been mistaken, but let us
  h y p o t h e s i s e that in f a c t he w a s n ' t and he had felt a



                                                                           1038
pulse when he approached this young man on the pitch,
would that fit in with your understanding...    Is that
a possibility? - A. It is a..possibility, sir.   I would
like just to observe that feeling the carotid pulse is
quite difficult in somebody who has got a low blood
pressure, as would have been here.    In fact it can be
so difficult it is impossible and you have to put an
electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
stopped or not.

I would also like to say something about resuscitation.
I was very fortunate when I qualified that I became
house surgeon of a famous heart surgeon called Lord
Brock at Guy's Hospital.   That was in the days when we
did open cardiac massage.   In other words, if somebody
died you opened their chest and you massaged their
heart between your hands.   A terrifying experience.
It was while I was working for him that one day three
of us were doing it one morning, that he stopped it,
and that was the start of external cardiac massage.
Even to somebody like me who has been doing it for
twenty-five years, it is still very difficult.    The
last time I tried to do it I failed completely.    Even
to a trained person it is difficult.   Indeed, when
junior doctors are examined for this now, as they are,
a significant number fail rather than pass.    It is
quite difficult and for the lay person it must be
incredibly difficult.

You heard Dr. Slater's account of death, shall we say.
Would you go along with that? - A. I thought it was
eloquent.   I felt quite nervous!

You mentioned this point about unconsciousness and the
loss of pain and I think you distinguish slightly
there.  Can you give me any idea that if a person
becomes unconscious, can he feel pain, and for how long
can he feel pain, in your judgment? - A. Again, Dr.
Slater put it very clearly.    You all read in the
newspapers about patients - particularly when they have
had caesarean sections, the ladies as usual - being
able to tell what the doctors were talking about during
the operation.    Again I have experienced this at first
hand when I was doing heart surgery because then it was
often very important not to depress the state of
consciousness too far because things were pretty tricky
anyhow.   Whetv we used to resuscitate the patients we
used to give them an electric shock.    Lord Brock used
to always shout, "Give it two fast ones."    The patient
would then ask you the following morning two fast ones
were.   Then you would ask, "Did you hear anything
else?" and they didn't, so it is all very much a
question of degree.



                                                           1039
I think slipping from slight unconsciousness to deep
unconsciousness in this circumstance, one, because of
the compression and two because of the asphyxia and
three because as Dr. Slater again explained everything
is shoved up into the head and so there is nothing
moving around, it would have been very quick, almost as
quick as a rabbit punch I would have thought.

     THE CORONER:     Mr. Fraser?

     MR. FRASER:     No questions,   sir.

            Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB :

Dr. Gumpert you have spoken in terms of passing in a
very quick space of time from slight unconsciousness to
deep unconsciousness.   Following deep unconsciousness,
do the eyelids remain open or are they closed? - A.
Either may occur.  There is no particular rule.   The
thing we all see on the cinema of the person going to
close the dead person's eyes.   I don't think I have
had to do that more than two or three times in my lif®«
Most of the people I have seen die have died with their
eyes shut.

Deep unconsciousness is associated with no longer
feeling any p^in or discomfort^   Is then the face of
the person who is profoundly unconscious capable of
grimaces or expressions which might be taken as showing-
pain or discomfort? - A. Not in my view, sir.

Is it in fact capable of any facial expression? - A.
Hot in my view.

Following profound unconsciousness, is it right that
the face will become discoloured towards the next stage
of the sequence of events, namely, brain damage and
thereafter brain death?

     THE CORONER:     Could you repeat that question?

     MR. LIMB:    I am referring back to the process, or
the sequences of events as outlined by Dr. Slater, sir.
Firstly, unconsciousness, thereafter brain damage and
thereafter again brain death.    The nature of my
inquiry was as to whether following profound
unconsciousness r although there may be no outward
expressions there is this change that the face becomes
discoloured?

     THE CORONER:     The greyness you are driving at?

     MR. LIMB:      Sir, that is right.
     THE WITNESS:   Are you asking me to say when I
think the greyness came on or just the way it changed?I
cannot tell you when it came on.   I think probably j.t
came on during the unconscious stage and I don t think
the Face would change when the moment of death came,
total somatic death, I don't think there would be any
change.

     MR. LIMB:   Doctor, I am asking whether it happens
following the entry into unconsciousness towards the
next stage in the sequence, namely, brain damage? - A.
I don't think there is a change of facial expression at
the time of brain damage necessarily.   This change of
expression will be a gradually evolving process from
the minute the crush started.

        MR. LIMB:      Thank you, sir.

     THE WITNESS:   Sir, you cannot tell by looking at
a person that they are dead or unconscious, at least I
can't.   You can by feeling them but you can't by
looking at them.

                    Further by THE CORONER:

If a person has been, shall we say, somatically dead
for long enough, would you accept or would you agree
that sometimes the face goes paler? - A. Oh, it goes
paler, and becomes rigid and takes on a stare.   Yes,
that is quite different.

        THE CORONER:      Anything else you wanted to ask on
that?

        MR. LIMB:      No, thank you, sir.

        MR. CATCHPOLE:      No questions,    sir.

     THE CORONER:         Is there anything else we want to
ask Dr. Slater?         (No)

     Ladies and gentlemen, I will give you a chance.
It is emotive but it is also very interesting.   Is
there anything else while we have two experts here?
You have understood it as far as one is able to
understand it?

        THE FOREMAN:      Yes.

     THE CORONER:   Dr. Gumpert and Dr. Slater, may I
say to both of you, you have done remarkably well in
explaining what is clearly a very (a) emotive and (b)
difficult subject, succinctly and clearly to all of us
and I very much appreciate your help.   Dr. Slater has
  »




had to come as well, but not quite so far, and I am
very grateful to you for taking the trouble and the
time to come and I am sure it will be of benefit not
just to Kevin's family, but to other people who of
course are involved in this tragedy as well.   Thank
you very much indeed.

     MR. FRASER:    Sir, I will certainly make sure that
Kevin's family have the opportunity to see the
transcript of what the doctors have said and I am sure
they will feel some benefit from that when they feel
able to look at it.    Thank you, sir.

How come you were steered towards the coaches to take you
to the ground?   Did you ask or did they just say, Young
man, are you going to the match?*'   What happened?   - A.
There were people getting off the train who obviously
weren't going to the match.    If you were like a lad they
asked, they said, "Are you going to the match.      If you
said, "Yes , they said, "Go that way.

Did they check your tickets or anything at all that you
can remember? - A. No. The train tickets?

No, the match ticket? - A. Oh, no.

 So you then got on to the coach? - A. Yes.

That brought you to Hillsborough? - A. Yes.

 You got to the ground at about 11.30? - A. Yes.

 Did you go straight in or did you do a bit of shopping? -
 A. Well, the ground wasn't open so we walked round for
 bit.   We went to the shops and just walked round until

Q. You saw    the tunnel and you went down it?   - A. Yes.

Q. Had you    been to the ground before? - A. No.

Q. Were there people going down the tunnel at that time
    already or... - A. There were a few, but there wasn't
    many people.
  «
Q. It wasn't too bad anyway? - A. No.

Q. You came out of the tunnel and you entered the terracing?
   - A. Yes.

Q.   You just thought that would be better? - A. fes.

Q. There wasn't any other reason for changing at that point?
   - A. No.

Q.    Do you know what time it was when you got into the right

     to two.

Q.    How would you describe it at that time? - A. Well,     it was
     pretty empty because we actually sat down on the
     terracing.

Q. With the passage of time of course it started filling up?
   - A. Yes.
Q. You were standing fairly near to the perimeter fence, is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q.    Fairly near to the front?   In line with the goal,     or a
     bit further? - A. Just right of the goal.

Q. You were just talking anc waiting         ne x.at        start?
   - A. Yes.

                                       r,cerr.ec ycu, apart rrom
     the fact that Liverpool shouldn't lose? - A. Yes.

Q. It happened that you actually saw two of your friends,
   Stuart Thompson and Tony Grier, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. I know what time you said in your statement, but do you
   remember about what time you saw them? -A. Well, it was
   pretty full then so we didn't speak to them, we just saw
   them.   They were further up.

Q. They were behind you, were they? - A. Yes.

0. when you saw them can you remember Tony climbing up on to
   a barrier? - A. No.

Q. You don't remember that? -A. No.

0. It doesn't matter, you may not have been watching him at
   that particular moment.   Do you remember a beach ball
   being knocked about? - A. Yes.

0. Was that at about the same time as you saw Tony or was it
   earlier or later? - A. I can't remember.

Q. Can you remember the players coming on to the pitch,
   pre kick-off? - A. Yes.

0.   Were you still in the same position? - A. Yes.

0.    At that point, what was it like? - A. Just like a normal
     game, really.   A bit of pushing and that but net bad.

0. Nothing that concerned you at that stage? - A. No.

0. You of course were excited, the match was going to^ o e g m
   soon, you hoped.  Did you see the kick-off? - A. They
   were about to kick-off - I didn't actually see it oec3use
   of people pushing about.   You were sort of moving round
   everywhere.

0. So when the players came out pre kick-off, it was still
   like a normal match as far as you were concerned? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Just before kick-off something had happened.   Tell me
   what had happened in that period between the players
   coming out and kick-off? - A. Well, there was^a bit of
   pushing and moving round and that, then I don't know.   I
   just don't remember actually seeing any of the game, so I
   obviously can't remember seeing the kick-off.

You   say   y o u ccr.' z   remsrr/oer the   aam.e at   all?   - A.    Not


when the players cams cut, which you do remember, was
Kevin still witn ycu? - A. Yes.

What happened to Kevin?   when did you last catch a
glinpse of him? - A. Well, there was a big push forward
and he went off to the right a   bit. He said something,
"It's a bit packed, isn't it?"  Then I didn't see him
after that.

Are you saying you felt a big push then? - A. Yes.

Where did that push take you?   Did it leave you.in the
position that ycu were in, but mors squashed/or'did it
move you? - A. It moved you forward anc you were
squashed, but normally what would happen is it would go
back.   You know, people would   pushback.

That’s what didn't happen? - A. Mo.

We have tended to use the word "surge", but you can use
"push", it doesn't matter.   How many of these pushes did
you feel, just the one or more than one? - A. Well, there
was the first one and then it didn't move back and then
another one came, a bigger one.

There was a bigger one after the first one.   Did the
first one move back or not? - A. It did slightly.  It
eased off slightly.

Not as much as you would expect? - A. No.

Then the second one was much stronger? - A. Yes.

But you don't know what was haoDenins with the game? - A. .
No.

You were fairly near the front. Had ycu seen                     tr.e gats
which is in the fence? - A. Yes.

You had seen that.   Could ycu see what happenec to that
gate? - A. Well, there were people shouting :sr tne
Police or stewards or whatever on the ether sics or the
fence, for them to open it because they were getting
crushed.   No-one opened it and then I think some or tne
crowd who were in front of it started pushing on it to
get it open and it came open.   Then a few Policemen ran
over and shut it again and were leaning on it. After
about five minutes or so - I think they got it locked
again, and then after about five minutes or so one of
them opened it.

after kic.k-cff cr just a“ kicx-cif cr heicra kick-
off? - A. It was       after the kick-crf.

You think it   was   after? - A. Yes.

You are saying it was opened by seme fans who pushed
it open? - A. Yes.

Did ycu see any of them run on to the field? - A- A
few ran out and then when the Police had seen them
run out they ran    over and shut it,   leanedacainst it.

Did they get them back in, can you     remember?-A.
They tried to. I.am not sure whether they ran off in
another direction, I am not sura.

I cannot hear you? - A. I am net sura whether they
ran off in a different direction cr the Pclice could
not get them.

We have heard from several young men who were
standing at the gate   and who ran out into the field.
What I am trying to find out is what you remember.
You remember this happening. You remember the gate
being shut? - A. Yes.

How confident are you about your timings? - A. I
could not really tell ycu. I am net too cartain.

Do you know how long the match played frcm iecir.ninc

heard since.

Pardon? - A. I have heard sinca but I didn't knew a-

What I am trying to find out is whether you ara
saying tbe gate was shut for the whole of the
duration of the match because the match cnly played
for five minutes? - A. I do net thinic sc.

Did you see a Police Officer cpen the gata or was it
the fans that opened it the second time that ycu
noticed? - A. I could not raaliy be certain.  It was
either a Policeman or an ambulanceman, I think. One
of the St. John Ambulance or what have you.

You were standing in the crowd and there was a man in
front of you who was not very well, is that right?
A. Yes-
Somebody shouted to you and said, "Try and revive

Q. He told ycu to do that? - A. Yes.

Q. How did you get out? - A. I was there for a bit and
   eventually I suppose I get on to my side.

                 A. Yes.
              Q. And surging, as you have told us, with people ccming
                 dcwn and people going back up again? - A. Yes.

              Q. You said that you started to feel, and I am

                 tail*me if I am wrong about this or if I am right.
                 It started to get bad when this first big surge came
                 just when they were about to kick off? - A. Yes.

              Q. I wanted to ask you about that because you were asked
                 by the Coroner whether you actually saw the kick-off
                 and you said you had not. By that you meant you did
                 not actually see someone kicking the ball? Ycu did
                 not see Rush kicking the ball? - A. No.

              Q. When you say they were just about to kick off, do ycu
                 mean they were standing in the centre circle ready to
                 kick off? - A. Yes.

To whom it may concern


Dear Sir/Madam

Re Mrs Anne Williams,


I have been asked by my patient, Mrs Anne Williams, to
give my opinion concerning the death of her son Kevin at
the Hillsbrough disaster in 1989.  I can confirm that I
have read the report of the autopsy dated 16 April 1989

Mrs Williams has been able to interview witnesses at the scene
of Kevin's death only two weeks ago and was able co discuss with
a Mrs Deborah Margin in detail she final few minutes of Kevin's
life. I have been asked to give my opinion on whether or not
Kevin was able to utter the word "Mum" following attempted
resuscitation by Mrs Martin of Kevin.  It is my opinion that frozi
the given information from Mrs Williams and the detailed report of
the autopsy, it would not be impossible for Kevin to have uttered the
word "Mum" and I have informed Mrs Williams accordingly.


Yours faithfully




Or S J Crosby

    I a.u a serving Police Officer with Msrseyside Police, on Saturday 15th

    April 1989 (150489) I was off duty and went to support Liverpool in

    the match against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Football Ground.

    North Stand for #14.00, fran Liverpool football club supporters club I

    think.

    We drove to the around via
                    and then carried on to Hillsborough.   On the way to the

    ground there was a short delay at the Manchester Interchange on the

    M62 with roadworks.

    After we arrived at Sheffield I vent witr____________ to the Gateway

    stcre on the continuation of Halifax Poad.   This being were v*? parxed

    the car at about 1.10pm (1310).   At the Gateway store there were

    between 200-300 Liverocol fans. We stayed with them and were allowed

    into the store in small numbers to buy drinks. ______ and I bought

    four cans of lacer between us and then went outside and sat on a

    grass verge together with the other 200-300 fans and we drank two cans

 each.    The group of fans was well behaved and I didn't see any

 drunkeness.   We were supervised by a Merseyside and South Yorkshire

 Folice Officer who were sat on two horses outside the Canet

 Superstore.

 Whilst I was sat on this verge everyone was happy and amenable and at

 one point I saw a uniform Superintendent and Chief Inspector WALK past

us. Between 1.45pm and 2pm     (1345)(1400) the two mounted police

officers came over and told us it was getting on and time to make our

way to the ground.    The whole crowd moved on without any problems at

^pl. I renember it was the Merseyside Officer who actually spoke to

the crowd.

We walked to the ground and when we got into Leppings Lane itself it

was packed with people even half a mile from the ground itself.

Because of the crowd my friend asked a policeman for directions to

the ground, he was manning a junction either two or three roads up

from the ground off Leppings Lane.     He then directed us to go back the

wav we had come and round to the Spion Kop end.    I didn't think that

was right tut followed his directions and walked back the way we had

ccrre and to the Spion Kcp.   This was about 2.20pm (1420).

    then went to the Spion Kcp but three quarters of the way round on

Per.istone Read I realised we were going totally the wrong way and we

walked back.

The time was getting on now and the walk round was long because a lot

of the connecting roads betv^en Leppincs Lane and Fenistone Road were

bicoked by Police.    Because of the time I approached a police officer

cn one of the barriers and he allowed us to take this short cut when I

explained what had happened and shewed him my police warrant card.      We

arrived back at Lecpincs Lane at 2.30pm (1430).    When        and I

arrived back at the turnstiles there were no queues whatsoever and a
EncD£R                  DEREK   WILLIAM                                    -


large mass of people all trying to get through the turnstiles and into

the ground.     It had reached the point of every man for themselves in

orcar to get to the turnstiles.

I it      for and entered the far left hand side turnstile of turnstiles

1-15.     There was no police officer by ny turnstile.   Over to nty far

right I saw a number of police officers on horses.       I cculd not see

any police officers on foot but could not say whether this was

because there were none or they were blocked from my view by the

crori.

Outside the ground .my friend had both our tickets and to try and stay ^

together I had hold of his jeans, •However, the pushing of the

people was that much that we were pushed apart and separated.

Onca we were apart I decided to make for the turnstile on ny cwn.

         had got in before me and once I reached the turnstile he handed

my ticket out to me and I was allowed inside.     I handed ny ticket into

the turnstile operator and retained the stub of the ticket.

I had difficulty in finding the entry point only by the misdirection

of the police officer, but once I got back into Leppir.cs Lane, I found

the turnstile but had difficulties getting in because of the sheer

nvaccer of people.   At the time of my entry I saw no cates open other

than the turnstiles.     I did not see any of the gates cpen.

As I was trying to get to the turnstiles I saw abcut five or six

tesnacers climb over a concertina gate immediately to the lefi_ of t.ie

turnstiles.    After the first five or six went ever I saw a number of

cthsrs clink to the tcp of this gate but then drop back into the cro*i

cutsice as if there was scmeone in authority cn the inside telling

then to get back.

One3          land I had got into the ground I saw a police sergeant and

four constables inmsdiately behind the concertina gate where I had

    e^-t the teenagers climb over-    I approached the sergeant and said

    cctr=>china along the lines of "I am a Police Officer from Merseyside,

    theres a huge crowd outside and they're pushing to get in, can ycu do

   sarathing about it or get semething done?"-      At this time, I was with

             but I did not produce my warrant card or formally identify

   mysslf - He made no reply to me and by this time it was close to

   kick off time so I left it at tha*i.

   Qncs inside the ground I saw no direction signs to ny seat in the

   North stand and had difficulty in finding it because the sections of

   seating were given letters of the alphabet, however, the letters did

   not follow alphabetical order ie ABFDGCM, though I can't remember the

   exart order.

   I entered the North Stand through a tunnel, there was no crowd within

   this tunnel and no problems at all. I saw no Police within the

   tunnel and only a few stewards right at the beginning.

   Once inside the ground I saw no alcohol being drunk at all.

    I tcck my seat along with         just as the two teams came out onto

    the pitch.    This was about 2.57 pm (1457).   Ones through the

^ t u n n e l and up the stairs, I went to the section of my seats where two

    stewards directed us to our particular seats. These were right by the

   entrance to this section of seating.     People continued to enter after

   me and after about ten minutes between ten and twenty people arrived

    at this entrance and didn't appear to have tickets for this stand.       I

    actually saw two people holding tickets which were for the West

    Stand.    This was after the incident in pens 3 and 4 and people had

    started to core cut onto the pitch.     Everyone started to discuss what

    was goina on and these two men said that they should be in these pens

    and shewed the tickets which were complete without the counterfoil

   .being removed.

 r <={ceri.er.ced no personal crowd crush within the ground only that

cue   jice which was about 2.45 pn (1445).   I did not see any crowd

surge within the ground and was not injured.

At about the time these men had appeared at the entrance to ny section

of seating which was three quarters of the way along the North Stand

nearest to the Spion Kop about ten rows from the front/ I saw people

clinbing over the fences from pens three and four of the Leppings lane

stand fron kick off but initially they were directed behind hoardings

and sat near to the pitch.     I could not see whether they were directed

by stewards or Police.

After about five minutes a Police officer ran on to the pitch and

stepped the game.     People then began to climb over the front fencing

onto the pitch at will and I could also see people pulled up into the

seating area above.     At no point did I see any gates opened to allow

escape from the pens.

One2 plav had been stopped the Nottingham Forest fans in the Spion Kcp

began to taunt the Liverpool Supporters.

A fan then ran onto the pitch and then ran up to the Spion Kcp and

bee an shouting and iraking 'V' signs with two fingers at the Forest

supporters.    Myself and other fans in the North stand began to shcut

telling him to go away because we could see there was sanethine wrong

in the Lecoings Lane end.     This man who was in his early twenties wich

long hair ana a black capped sleeve T shirt was then turned back by

either stewards or Police and ran back towards Lecpings Lane but was

detained fcv Police before he got back.

Ancther older man then ran up to the Spion Kcp and then began to wave

his hands at the Forest fans.     Ke wasn't taunting, he was signalling

for then to calm dewn and trying to tell them there was something

wrong. Shortly after this the Police formed a cordon across the
                               DEREK WILLIAM

        i-’=vay line.    I'm not sure if this was after the first cr second man.

    p^r-cle ift the Leppings Lane end then ripped down advertising hoardings

    and becan to carry people on them up towards the comer formed by the

    cpi^n Kcp and the North Stand.       I could see that seme of then were

    presumed            as they had coats over their faces and one man in

                  had a jumper pulled back to cover his face.     These people

    were then rolled onto the pitch and the carriers went, beck for more

    pecole or bodies.

    The police then formed a further cordon in front of the North stand.

    Arcund the same time a number of people rearing tracksuit trousers arid

    sweatshirts came fran the direction of the players tunnel and went to

    the Spion Kcp end.       They then pulled down more hoardings here and went

    to help carry more people up fran Leppings Lane.

    A number of people were also carried up to the c o m e r in front of me

    bodily.    There were a large number of people in this comer either

    laid out behind the police on the pitch or sitting with their heads in

    their hands.
    I cid not see any of the Police in the cordon in front of the North

    Stand break ranks to assist these people.

/   1   saw one person on the pitch about a quarter of the pitch length away

    frc:n the Scion Kcp abcut twenty feet from the hoardings in front of

    the North stand.        I distinctly remember this because later cn as I

    will describe an ambulance drcve directly past us and a St John's

    Ambulance nen who was with me tried to flag it dewn but it carr_ed cn.

    I a.-n not sure if this man had been carried cn a hoarding or by his

    friend who was with him.        I saw this man lying cn the flcor having

    convulsions.

for then to go and help the people on the pitch.     None of the Police

officers left the cordon.

I was very close to the pitch so I went down the aisle, over a small

fiva foot wall with hoardings on, I walked through the cordon without

being challenged at all and then went to the man having convulsions.

Alirsst imnediatsly I was joined by a St John's Ambulance man.     I

identified myself to the St Johns ma n as an off duty Police Officer.

H e then said to m s " You do mouth to mouth and I'll d o heart mas:;ace ”-

I then took his pulse in his neck.     I could feel a slight pulse.    I

then commenced mouth to mouth resuscitation and the St John's man

started heart irassage.   I undid two buttons o n the top of the man s

shirt.    If I remember rightly the bottan of the shirt appeared

ripped.

Wfe continued to work o n the man but after about five minutes he went

grey and his face was withdrawn.     As I had approached the m a n his head

had moved as if he was being sick.     When I got to him I cleared his

mouth and the back of his threat              before ccrmencing mcuth to

                                                          “After about

                                                                 ______
fiva minutes when the ma n vent grey,




Aftar about seven minutes I swapped places with the St John's

Ambulance man and he commenced ncuth to mcuth and I heart massage.         As

I cid heart massage his ribs were unnaturally praninent in the whole

of nis rib cage e/en thcuch he was only thinly built.      His stanaca

was decressed and abnormally lower than his ribcage.

Aftar a short time I undid the button o n his trousers and ripped open

the zip.    I then continued heart massage.

Shortly afterwards an ambulance entered the ground.      It appeared to

a Health Authority ambulance as opposed to St Johns.       It began to

drive down towards Leppings Lane.     I then told the St John's man to

try and step it.     He tried to flag it dewn but it continued on as if

it had been ordered not to stop in the top corner but to go to the '

Leppings Lane end.

The St John's man then rejoined me and continued to give mouth to

m o uth resuscitation.

Shortly after this v e were joined b y one of the m e n I described

earlier in the tracksuit trousers and I think green sweatshirt.       He

asked me if I was all right and knew what I was doing.                     * *

I said "I'm an off duty bobby, i'm all right", with that he left as if

to go somewhere where he could be of more use with other injured

persons.

Shortly after this man, which must have been about six minutes since I

had changed places with the St Johns man, a fenale St Johns Ambulance

officer cane over and pushed me out of the way and took over from me.

I then steed up and watched as she was obviously better trained in

First Aid than me.

I then stcod by the injured man together with his friend who had been

there all along, telling us to keep going and not to let his mate die.

Within two minutes of this, the St Johns Ambulance ma n told the St

Johns Ambulance weman, "He's gene", and steed up.     I locked at the

man's friend who was standing b y his head, he was completely grey.

B y this time, I felt ill myself and just turned away as there was

nothing else I could do.

I would describe the man who    died as:- between 17 and   20 years of age,

approx 5'8 - 5'9 tall, short    sandy o r reddish coloured hair, slim

build, no facial hair, white    eurcpean, I cculd see no cuts or

abrasions cn him.    I seem to rensmber freckles o n his   cneeks, but I m

•gpLOEF

ncc sure                                   I'm almost positive it was

freckles.    As I said previously he had an unusually prominent rib cage

and depressed stomach.

He was wearing a light, possibly white button up shirt, light grey or

beige cotton trousers,                     boxer shorts.       I noticed no

jewellery o r footwear.

His friend I would describe as 21 or 22 years of age, dark brown hair,

shortish hair, about 5'9 tall.       I cannot remember much of his clothing

but he appeared quite plump with a slight beer belly.            H e had no

facial hair nor glasses.

The St John's ma n was in uniform, the only thing I can renercer was

that he had dark hair and was thirty plus years of age.

The St John's wcman was in uniform again very slimly built and no

older than 18 years of a g e / ^ ^

Aftar the St John's man had said the man was dead I'd seen enough,

I fait ill and had to get out of the ground.           I k n e v _______would have

stayed where he was because he knows no First Aid.            I went ever to the

wall where I had climbed in.     As I cot there I saw a pnctcgracner

kneeling down with an orance tabard he was taking phctccracns of the

injured and dying.

A fan who was already on the pitch went ever to him and said "Pack

off, you're taking pictures of m y injured mates".

The photographer carried on taking pictures so the fan started pushing

hiir.   The photographer stood up and the fan then pushed him back to

the wall and tried to take the camera fran him.           The camera then swung

anc smashed into the wall.      I then climbed over the wail using the

photographers case as a step.        I then rejoinec

He said to me “Come on we're goi ng ”, and        both then lef-.        I cannot

say what time this was.

Whilst at Hillsborough the only criminal offences vere of a minor

public order nature ie, the fans climbing over the gates etc.       After

the disaster within the stand, I saw a number of instances such as

the photographer's camera and sausage rolls thrown at the cordon in

front of the North Stand and one old man who threw a cup of tea at an

officer in the cordon.

This was caused purely b y agitation amongst the crowd by the apparent

callousness of the photographer and apparent inactivity of the police

with regard to the injured a nd dying.

I witnessed no serious offences.

There were a number of factors which I believe contributed to the

num'oer of deaths and injuries.

Outside the ground there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

between the mounted and foot police officers.     The approach roads to

the around were well manned w i t h Police officers at junctions and

outside pubs and off licences.     However, I made a cornent about being

misdirected by the police officer to another officer and he said it

was understandable because a let of the officers were drafted in frcm

outside stations and had peer lccal knowledge of the area.       This ma y

have contributed to the build up outside the ground which caused the

initial crash outside.

Insice the ground once the disaster had occurred there appeared a lack

of rc-ordination between senior police officers and lewer ranks o n the

pitch.   The actual scale of the incident wasn't appreciated

imr-ediatelv which resulted in a delay in the response and personnel

being despatched to deal w i t h it.

Fre-n ny cwn personal experience I and mcst Police officers have only

basic First Aid knowledge.    W h e n I administered first aid to the m a n I

felt totally inadequate c n reflection.    However with that particular

        mar, I dcn't think mere knowledge would have helped but it might have

        in others.

        I would also like to add that though the Folice in the cordon did not

       assist the injured and dying I saw a number of other officers who did.

       In particular t>ro small policewomen who tried to help a very large man

       but couldn't carry him until helped b y fans.

I will now deal with a number cf specific points frcm my original statement

(27.4.8?) using the pare numoers of that statement.                                                   I understand that the

numbers I will use in brack'*tc are these of the file cf statements

contained in respect of Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, prepared by West Midlands

Police under the deceased reference number 51.
                                                                                                                                                  !i

                                                                                                                                                  e


On Page 6 (File page 41) I first refer to the ycuth I new knew to be Kevin

Daniel WILLIAMS lying a                  1/4     length cf the pitch frcm the Scion Kcp.                                          I

refer tc him being "on the fleer", meaning the pitch surface, and "having
                                                                                                                                                 •r

convulsions".           I have thought accut this carefully tccay and with the acdec

benefit of my training I can say that this was net a process that lastec

for any time.           It certianiy wasn't anything similar tc an eci.eptic fit,

for example.           It was an impression that I had which I originally associates

with the lad vomit ting.                  I will say that I did net see the casualty vomit

nor did I see any sick cn the body cr grassed area around him.                                                             I will

correct further references to vcnit as thsv occur in my o n g m a _                                                        statement.

accurately straight to the carotid artery.




Fcr all those reasons, I car. say that I felt                                         for a pulse m tne                  region c:

a pulse but may have beer, mistaken.



I refer to the face going "grey" and "his face was withdrawn",                                                           j.   car.r.ct

 I cannot rsccncils the time sequences and I am still sure that I did see ar.

 acculsncs, distinguish in my own mind that it was net of St J e m s but

 Health Authority and that I told the St Johns man with me to step the

 anbulancs.         I have considered that what I referred to may have been this

 ambular.es exiting from the staciun but I don't think it was.                                                            My

 recollection is still that it was entering the stadium.




I re 1 sr to being joined by a woman St Johns Ambulance Officer who pushed me

out 01 the way.             I recollected this to have been about 6 minutes after I

had changed places with the male St Johns Officer.                                                   That makes a total,

from recollection, of 13 minutes joint resuscitation with the St Johns

male.      I would standby these estimates only in as much as I feel we

attempted resuscitation for between 10 and 15 minutes. Within a further two

minutes of both St Johns people wcrkins toesther the man declared "He's

gene" and stccc up.               I referred to ar.c re-affira that he was "cerpletely

grey" and there is absolutely no doubt in my mind, both new with the

benefit of further training, and then at that moment. that the youth I had

tried to save was dead; certainly cead and beyend any further help.                                                              I ar.c

the St Johns personnel would not have stepped if there had ceer. any

gliscer of here at ail - there was n o n e .

            Constable number 221 based at WDCDSEAIS (E2 Sub-divisicn) of South

            Yorkshire Police.

            C n Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I paraded for duty at 9.00am

            (0900) at HJLLSBCKCUGi Football stadium where there was a briefing for

            all officers involved in the semi-final between LI7EHPCCL and

            NCll'INSiAM FCREST.     The briefing was at 9.45am (0945) •

            A t 10.20am (1020) I returned tc the gym at the football ground for a

            separate briefing for special constables.

            A t 10.35am (1035) I left HTTLS5CPCUC5i stadium to pazroi KERRIES PCAD

            SCUIH to step the parking of cars b y fans cn the hard snculce=3.         I

            did this with|                    W e continued tc patrol KEHRIES RCAD

fans and Notts Forest, who were obviously drunk, although at this

stage they were behaving reasonably.
At about 2.45pm (1445) I started to make m y w a y to the LEFPINks LANE_

entrance, as I passed what I think is the main entrance to the SPICN

HOF, the turnstiles were shut dcwn.

At abcut 2.50pm (1450) there was trouble at these turnstiles wnen the

Notts Forest fans, realising they were being locked out, were trying

any w ay they could to get in, this included paying money to the

turnstiles stewards and trying to buy tickets fran the touts.                       The

crowd became very abusive and angry and I had to assist in the

removal of fans fran the ground.. . I was on the road sice and the

police inside were passing fans back out over the turnstiles and

there was a very large number of fans trying to get in still, so mucn

that mounted officers and their horses were being poshed up against

the wall.     The next thing I know is a large blue gate was opened and

 a large majority of the crowd pushed their w ay into the ground.                       I

 found myself being carried along with the crowd unable to resist.                          A

 refused, it was only when a mounted officer, the same one who hac

 triad to help m e a fa* moments earlier, put his horse up again-.- the

 gata, he opened it a short way and let me out.

 Onca outside I found myself surrounded b y dranken fans, screaming

 abuse, and the area covered by police.               An officer used m y radio to

 full of static.     M y radio was handed back to me and I ran to the

 Lefpings Lane end of the ground.       Ambulances and police cars were
                                                                                       ./
 rushina to that end of the ground.       When I got to the lappings Lane'

 end of the around I saw a vast crowd outside the turnstiles trying                K
 to cet in, it most have been abcut four times larger than the crcwd               /        \
 I lsft at the other end, so that would mean the crcwi at the Spicn

Kcp end numbered abcut 1000 plus and I would estimate about 4000

outside Leppings Lane end.

 I can't really renember how, but somehow I got inside the ground,           •
                                                                             ;
through the large blue gate which was open, and I ended up on the            \ .

pitch.   I did not go through the tunnel.

Onca on the pitch I saw a lot of people who were obviously injured

and I can ranenber a man caning up to me shouting,       "THERE'S TWD DEAD

YOU BASTARD”.      I then saw people who appeared to b e dead.   People

wera screaming and shouting and ambulances were driving onto the pitch

 I assisted other police officers with dead and injured people and

helped to take then on stretchers to the gym, a n d I can renemfcer

seeing officers fran E2 (WXDSEATS) everywhere.

 I took abcut 6 dead to the gym, as well as m a n y injured and whilst I

was trying to revive a young bey I renamber something hitting me on

the back of mv head, but I didn't really notice until much later when

 I fcund a larce swelling.       I could see many bodies being put cn the

 pitch, sane of them appeared to be dying.       I lost count of the number

 of bodies I helped carry into the gym.
                                                                                   I
 I halted carry a young bey into the gym fran the pitch nearby.         Ke

 stooped breaching so I gave him the kiss of life, and heart massage

 and a doctor also helped.       He started breathing an d opened his eyes,

 his only word was    "M3r and then he died.
. A t 4.06pm (1606) Dr CURFEN certified death and I stayed with him.         I

        Further to my previous statements I would like to acd the following,

        C n Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I worked in the capacity of

        Special Constable at the F.A. Seni-Final football match between

        Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. which was being played at

        the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.

        M y recollection of the events of that day are vague and confused.

        As a result of the disaster I was prescribed medication b y m y Doctor




        V
                                                                      I felt like

        a 'Zombie.'

        As a result cf this I feel that my memory, m y recollection of that day

        is pcssibly inaccurate.      I am unsure cf what time I arrived at the

        Lecpir.cs Lane entrance to the ground cr e/en hew I came to be cn the

        pitch but I did.

        B y time I got onto the pitch it seemed to be mass confusion, there

        wers police officers and supporters all over the place.      I could see

        people who appeared to be injured and pcssibly dead, lying cn the

              r was in a state of shock.   I didn't knew what to do but m y
    pi--*1’
        »-al instinct was to help these people in the best w a y that I could.

    X can't   describe to you in any detail m y exact movements over the neax.

    half an hour or so .   I knew that I approached several people lying on

    the pitch and assisted if possible.     I did not give any of these

    pecole itDuth-to-nouth or heart massage.

    I decided that there were enough people dealing with the situation

    at the Lepoings Lane end of the around and made m y w a y to the Spicn

    Rep end of the ground.

^   I could see that bodies vrere being carried fran the lappings Lane end^

    to the Spion Kcp end of the ground and then being placed o n the pitcn.

    I assisted to carry a number of dead and injured people fran the Spicn

    Kdp e n d of the pitch, into the gymnasium where a terccrary mortuary

    had been set up.    I was talking to sane of these people, conforming

    then and trying to reassure then.      I a m unable to describe any of

    these people in the detail.

    By this time I really was in a state of shock, I couldn't believe wnat

    I was seeing.    I seened to be o n automatic pilot.   M y menori.es are

    very confused and distorted.

    I can recall carrying a youth who I new know to be,      Kevin Daniel

    WILLIAMS from the pitch to the gymnasium.      He was the last person that

    I assisted in carrying.     I first saw Kevin WILLIAMS lying c n the pitcn

    near to the goal area at the Spion Kcp end of the ground.        A t that

    stage he wasn't on a hoarding or a stretcher.

     I rsmenber that there were several p=cple around where he was lying.

     I can't recall anyone giving him mcuth to mouth.      W i t h the help of

    other people, who I can't recall, Kevin WILLIAMS was placed onto a

     hoarding   and carried into the gymnasium.    Someone instructed me to


     stay with the body.



                                                                                     5
 I cicn't knew what tc do.    I didn't want to believe the boy was dead.

I didn't knew if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to

attampt to revive him.     I started to give him mouth-to-mouth but

sareone, I dcn't knew who, touched ms cn the shoulder and told me he

was dead.     By this time m y head had gone, I wasn't aware of what I was

doing or what was really happening.

At 16.06 hcurs (1606) Doctor CURPEN examined Kevin WILLIAMS and

certified him dead.

I rHnember a detective officer,                     helping me to

carolete the GEN 18 form (sudden death form).

I s caved with the body until the early hours of Sunday 16 th April

(160489)   when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not

been identified, to the Medico Legal Centre.

I identified the body b y the number allocated, which in the case was

Nunroer 51.   I had no further dealings with Kevin WILLIAMS.

This statement is made to the best of m y recollection and I believe it

to be the truth.    However, under the circumstances I cannot be

positive that the details are accurate.




I have marked on a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M.l) the

approximate location where I first came into contact with the

deceased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS.

       any party in either the inquest or any of the various proceedings which arose
        from the Hillsborough Disaster of 15th April                    1989.

BECK cont:                   <5 iv©s th.6 CoiroriGir so much. d.i_so3TGtion to
define the parameters of the investigation.  The real question
for the coroners     is why they use their discretion so
conservatively.   In theory at least, their unique remit would
seem to allow them to take the investigation where they want.
So what's holding them back? Dr Stefan Popper was a coroner for
six years. He retired last year after conducting the country's
longest inquests into the deaths at Hillsborough. He argues that
Coroners Courts need to be conservative in their remit, because
they must avoid influencing what happens in other courts, either
civil or criminal.      Dr Popper says (inquests are not about
apportioning blame or liability.

 POPPER:                      If the purpose of the inquest is to
 establish the four factors, who, when, where and how, then the
 inquest does actually have a part to play and fits in to the
 other jurisdictions.     But X think in many cases, what people are
 actually looking for isn't the establishment of those facts, what
 happened? what they sore trying to establish is liability or
 blameworthiness, and X don't think that as the law stands, the
 inquest is the right place for that.               The civil court ought to
 be concerned with aspects of negligence and compensation - has
 somebody done something for which a sum of.- money ought to be paid
  to compensate the injured?         And the criminal court is to be
                                                       \

  concerned,    or should be concerned with the question of, has
  somebody done something for which a punishment should be exacted?
  So those are the two venues where the issues of people liability,
  one civil, one criminal,       ought to be dealt with, not by some
  circuitoils means of dealing with it through the coronal Court.

  BECK:                         And the law makes clear that inquests
  must not stray into the territory of apportioning blame.                It was
  changed in 1977 after an inquest jury named Lord Lucan as the
  killer of his children's nanny.          Today, if an inquest begins to
   point the finger of blame, the Coroner is legally obliged to stop
   it.     But the barrister, Ed Fitzgerald, argues that coroners are
   mistaken in making an assumption that deaths in contentious

BECK cont:                 Donna,   Paul's   sister   and   his   mother
Sandra, heard his name mentioned only once in the entire 80 day
main inquest.

HRS STRINGER:              When I asked the clerk, I was told that
the witnesses I had requested to be brought in were after quarter
past: three, and I couldn't have them brought in.
   t


BECK:                      Why?

MRS STRINGER:              Because Dr Popper had decided on cutting
the inquest's time for quarter past three, and he told*me the
damage was already done then, that there was no need to bring
witnesses after quarter.past three.      I kept asking why Paul was
never taken in an ambulance to a hospital.      I'm still waiting for
that question to be answered.       I still don't know why he was
 left; he was first to be taken from the terraces, at 3.15 - I was
 told that by a West Midlands police officer.


 SISTER:                    Because Paul died together with 94 other
 people, it was just like some sort of conveyor belt.         The times
 from quarter past three to 4.35 ,we don't know anything about;
 what time he was taken to the temporary mortuary, how long he was
 left there, who he was with, and it's just torment.              All the
 time.     You lie awake thinking who was he with, did anyone help
 him?      It's just torture all the time because you don't stop
 asking the questions.

 BECK:                       There is no doubt that the 3.15 cut off
  point caused more dispute than any other single decision at the
  inquest.    Professor Phil Scraton is a lecturer in criminology at
  Edge Hill College.     His department is conducting a long term
  study into the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster and whilst
  he accepts that Dr Popper was completely within his powers to
  implement the cut off point, he thinks it was a wrong decision.
                                          - 14 -


  SCRATON:                          I feel that it was a profound mistake
  that the coroner ruled that there should be a 3.15 cut off.                         I
  feel that a lot of evidence that came after 3.15 should have been
  heard.      I think it is an absolutely crucial issue, because what
  we're dealing with here is not the immediate moment at which
  death is invoked.        I understand the logistical problem of calling
  all   those people       to    give evidence,       and how much       longer the
  procedure would have gone on, but let me just put it this way.
  The reason that most families are upset over the 3 .15 cut off is
  because there is crucial evidence that they know exists about
  people trying to revive and resuscitate their loved ones which
 _ ^ as never heard before the court. Now they have a right to hear
^ t h a t evidence heard, because it could be that in that situation,
  not. enough was done or too much of the wrong thing was given or
  whatever; I'm not in any way trying to assume guilt as to what
  happened after 3.15, but there is a right to investigate it and
  there is a right to make an informed judgement on it.                   That right
  has been completely abolished in this case.                    I just find it one
  of    the   saddest     aspects    of    the     Hillsborough     disaster;    it's
  certainly the one that has had the most profound effect on the
  families.


  BECK:                     Dr Popper accepts that the cut off point
  caused distress at the time of the inquest. But he believes that
     stemmed mainly from a mismatch between the expectations of the
  families and his remit as Coroner.


  POPPER:                           j know           caused a lot Qf a ^ e t y to
  families, but I think it is misunderstanding of the duties and
  the powers that the Coroner has got.                     Had people felt really
  strongly that I was making a mistake,                    they were all advised,
  legally advised I mean, there was opportunity for appeal and
  judicial review.         I made it quite plain right from the beginning
  what I was intending to do; I gave my reasons for what they were
  worth,      and it was open to people to challenge them,                    and they
  should have challenged them if they really felt strongly then.
  That's      not   to   say    that somebody       else   may   not   have   taken   a
                                                             \




                                          - 15    -


POPPER cont:                       different view; I'm not saying                  that I'm
infallibly right. What          I am saying is, that was the view I took,
and I did it to the best of my ability at the time.


BECK*                              Although the Coroner appears                    to have
great discretion to conduct broad or narrow investigations of
contentious deaths, in practice the pressure is mostly in the
direction of conservatism.                Better to be safe than sorry.                  But
barrister Tim Owen argues that the system can no longer afford
to rely on its inquisitorial purity.                     Controversial deaths, by
their very nature, beg to be looked at in a wider context.
•
OWEN:                               In controversial cases, the idea that
you can avoid, if you like, an adversarial contest or conflict
is absurd.         There plainly are frequently different views about
culpability, whether proper care was given, and it's absurd to
think that an inquest process                    can be shorn of              that type of
controversy.         And once you accept that the controversy exists,
then        the   current    procedure      is    not    a       satisfactory      one    for
resolving it, because it leaves too much discretion in the hands
of coroners, it keeps too much information back from people who
have        a   legitimate   interest      in     knowing        about    it    before    the
    inquest, and it leaves the jury and the Coroner with too narrow
(Q}     function, if you like, in returning the verdict, because the
verdicts,         as they are now returned,             are simply too brief and
    don't disclose in clear terms                the full circumstances                in how
    somebody died, and what measures are necessary to prevent death
    in the future.


    BECK:                           21 years ago, the Brodrick Report looked
    at all aspects of the Coroners c o urt and made its recommendations
    -   advance disclosure,        legal    aid       and wider      rights       of   appeal
    against verdicts were all put                forward as ways              of making the
    system more acceptable to both sides.               They were largely ignored,
    as were the recommendations of a committee in 1986 which looked
    at the      inquest   system    and    suggested         a way       of    dealing   with
    controversial deaths.          Evan Stone, QC was the chairman of that
                                 - 17 -


SCRATON cont:              much of the work of the coroner can be
done   efficiently     and  effectively   through   the   present
inquisitorial   system.    The   investigation    work   is   okay,   the
inquest work is okay and the outcome is generally satisfactory.
However, in these high profile cases where clearly liability is
a contradictory construct, then it's important that another tier
exists,   and I think what we need is a tier which is openly
adversarial, where cross-examination is as thorough as it needs
to be, where rules that we would accept in other courts, more
normal courtroom rules, apply; where families are actually legal
aided so they have a right of representation,            and where the
person who is presiding over it has experience of working in
high-profile adversarial circumstances       - in other words,        I'm
thinking of a judge.


BECK;                    We have been told that the idea of
inquests becoming more like public inquiries, at least for deaths
in contentious circumstances, is now being seriously discussed
by coroners.    The Coroners Society, however, refuses to comment
on it publicly.    It's perhaps no surprise that those who seem
especially interested in the new system are coroners who've had
to conduct inquests after major disasters.        Dr Stefan Popper's
experience at the Hillsborough inquest has convinced him that it
is now time to grasp the nettle of reform.


POPPER:                   x   think that there is a dichotomy in
expectation.    It seems to me that the legislature has tended to
limit the powers of coroners whereas the public, certainly at the
moment,   is expanding their expectations.       And I think what is
needed is either the coroners should be more given more teeth, so
that they can actually do and say things which carry true weight.
Or, and this may possibly be a better solution, that coroners
inquests should be turned into fact finding exercises, and the
conclusions and verdicts should be deleted altogether from their
power, so that their power is to establish the facts, and for
others, civil or criminal courts, to draw whatever conclusions
need to be drawn from a particular event.     Somebody, and by that
                                   - 18 -


POPPER cont:              I mean parliament, has got to make up
their mind what they want. Do they want inquests to carry on as
they are, or do they want them restricted, or do they want them
expanded?     I don't think that carrying on as we are is the best
way forward.     And as I say, the public expectation seems to me
that they want more from Coroners Court, and they want more power
there.   if that's what the public want, in a democracy,                  then
there's no reason they shouldn't have it .


BECK‘                   Inquests were once regarded as a legal
backwater.   But a series of major public disasters and the
controversy surrounding individual cases has changed all that.
The   weaknesses    of   the     system     are   being     highlighted     by
dissatisfied families and lawyers who Recognise that deaths in
controversial circumstances can't be examined in the same way as
others.     But as yet, there are few signs that t h e ’legislators
have recognised the problems.         It's significant,          for example,
that the Royal Commission, which is examining all aspects of the
legal system,    is not investigating inquests.            To barrister Ed
Fitzgerald, what is at stake is the credibility of the inquest
system in the eyes of the public.


FITZGERALD:                    If We don,t reform the system now, there
will be a great injustice to the families of the deceased.                They
will continue to be left with a sense of real grievance,                  that
they haven't had proper inquests, that they haven't been able to
participate in inquests on a basis of equality with those in
authority who may have been responsible for the deaths of their
relatives.     if we don't reform the system, the worst result of
all will be that families will continue to have to live with a
lifetime    of bitterness,     that the questions         that   they   really
needed answered were not answered at the inquest.

       Dear Sirs,

       PETER     TOOLE     and       KEVIN     WILLIAMS

       IMPLICATION— UNDER             SECTION       13    OF    THE   CORONERS          ACT      1988)


       Further to ray letter of 21 April 1992, the Law Officers have now
       given very careful consideration to the application made by your
       clients for authority under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988
       to apply to the High Court for an order directing a fresh inquest
       in relation to the above named persons who died in the Hills­
       borough disaster on the 15 April 1989.     The material submitted
        under cover of your letter of 3 June 1992 has also been taken
  •    into account together with representations received on behalf of
       some of your clients from Members of Parliament with Merseyside
       constituencies and a letter received direct from Mrs Teresa
       Glover.

       As you will know section 13 of the Act applies when an inquest
       has been held and, "by reason of fraud, rejection of evidence,
       irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry, the
       discovery of new facts or otherwise, it is necessary or desirable
       in the interests of justice that another inquest should be held."

       The Law Officers have considered the matter very carefully but
       they have come to the conclusion that there is nothing which
       would justify authorising an application to the High Court for
       a new inquest in any of the above cases.

       They have reached this decision on the grounds that the applica­
       tion would have no reasonable prospect of establishing that it
       is necessary or desirable in the interests of justice for a fresh
       inquest to be held.
The Law Officers recognise the importance to the families of the
deceased of having the fullest possible information about the
precise circumstances of the deaths and have taken that carefully
into account when considering the sufficiency of the inquiry made
by the Coroner and his directions to the jury.   All these issues
must, however, be considered in the context of the statutory
framework within which Coroners are required to work and the
questions required to be answered on the inquisition.   It is not
appropriate, therefore, that they authorise an application to .the
High Court under section 13 unless it could be said, with
reasonable confidence, that further information would be likely
to be elicited which would have a bearing on the issues to be
considered at any such further inquest.

The Law Officers recognise that this decision will be deeply
disappointing to your clients. They are aware of the strength of
the continuing feeling on the part of those whose friends and
relatives died or were -injured , in the tragic eventSr -at
Hillsborough but their task has been to evaluate the application
objectively against the statutory criteria. Their decision does
not indicate any lack of feeling for the families of those who
died at Hillsborough for whom they have the deepest sympathy, c

Yours faithfully,

 I have studied the papers that you have submitted to me regarding the
 tragic deaths of these young people.       They include the post mortem
 reports on Paul Carlisle, Gary Church, Ian Glover, Richard Jones, Michael
 David Kelly, Peter Tootle, Kevin Daniel Williams and Philip Hammond. I
 have also studied the relevant extract from the inquest, the overview
   epared by Professor Usher, the report prepared by Dr. Burns and the
f  ounds on which applications are to be made to set aside the original
   inquest.

 I have experience of a substantial number of deaths from traumatic
 asphyxia, including victims of the Clapham Rail distaster and explosion
 at the Grand Hotel, Brighton.

 It is clear from post mortem appearances that we are dealing with two
 different patterns of injury, namely a number of victims who showed the
 classic appearances of traumatic asphyxia and other where the classic
 signs of traumatic asphyxia were absent or slight.   The difference is,
 I think, relevant in respect of the precise mechanism by which each
 individual died. It may well be that some confusion has developed over
 the use of the term traumatic asphyxia.

 In the classic sense traumatic asphyxia is taken to imply injuries caused
 by the application of mechanical pressure to the chest and, in some
 Instances, the abdomen, so that death results from asphyxiation.      The
t^Kchanism of asphyxiation in the classic case is thought to be twofold.
 jFirst there is a mechanical impedence of the movement of the chest wall
 and diaphragm, thereby severely restricting inspiratory       respiratory
 movements.   The second mechanism and one which accounts for the most
 striking findings found in cases of traumatic asphyxiqa is compression
 of the chest and abdomen resulting in direct compression         over the
 superior vena cava, thereby causing a sudden and dramatic rise in the
 pressure within the superior vena cava resulting in engorgement of the
 blood vessels in the head and neck.     It is this displacementof blood
 into the superior vena cava and the failure to drain blood       from the
 superior vena cava which accounts for the swelling of the facial features
 and the gross petechial haemorrhages so regularly seen in the face, neck
 and chest above the level of constriction.

  Where no obstruction to the venous circulation occurs then the usual
  signs of asphyxia are present but not those of the classic traumatic
  asphyxial death. The face may be suffused and cyanosed and there may be
  fine petechial haemorrhages, in some instances scanty or even absent. The
  facial features do not appear strikingly swollen and the coarse petechial
  haemorrhages are not apparent.

 Unfortunately it has become a habit for pathologists to call all such
 deaths traumatic asphyxia and it may well be correct in one sense in as
 much as trauma to the chest has resulted in the mechanical obstruction
 of respiration. In pathological terms there is probably little relevance
 in distinguishing between the two mechanisms as the term merely implies
 that death has resulted from a mechanical obstruction to respiration
 resulting from pressure being applied to the torso.

 ]£k:linical terms however there does seem to be a difference in the two
 dflrferent types of traumatic asphyxia with a much graver prognosis being
 present in those where there has been evidence of a sudden and acute
 severe rise in the venous pressure in the upper part of the body. In fact
 most of the individuals who suffer from this classic form of traumatic
 asphyxia do not survive if they are severely affected and not rescued
 rapidly.
 Where the individual suffers primarily an obstruction to his movements
 of respiration death will occur as the result of hypoxic damage to the
 brain.  This may take a much longer time than in individuals who have
 been crushed so impedence of the venous return to the heart occurred.
 Indeed   some  individuals   will   survive  but   remain  permanently
 neurologically damaged as a result of suffering severe anoxic cerebral
 injury.

  It is probable that a period of at least some 10 minutes or so would be
  necessary before one would be able to state categorically that absent
  respiratory movement would lead to death. Consciousness may be lost quite
  jApidly but where the obstruction has not been complete consciousness may
  SGce a considerable time to be lost. I have experience of cases where
  individuals have died through anaesthetic accidents whereby no oxygen was
  being supplied to the lungs whilst they were paralysed during surgery.
  In two of the cases in excess of 10 minutes elapsed before the surgeon
  noticed that the heart action was in the terminal stages of failure.

  It is also known that individuals who have suffered severe hypoxic damage
  may not die immediately.     They may be recovered unconscious with an
  active circulation but the circulation rapidly fails despite all attempts
  at resuscitation. This may well represent concomitant damage to the heart
  muscle leading to what is in effect a heart attack (anoxic myocardial
  infarction).    Severe hypoxia of several minutes duration would be
  necessary for this to occur. It is therefore possible that a young man
  who had been asphyxiated by being crushed, would be capable, after being
  removed from danger, of some conscious activity but could still die as
  a result of hypoxia in the ensuing minutes.

 Anoxic brain damage could also be aggravated by the failure to maintain
 a patent airway in individuals who were unconscious but still capable of
 respiration when retrieved from the crowd.    The failure to place the
 individual in the recovery position, for instance, could lead to
 subsequent respiratory obstruction.

 Experience from a number of instances where individuals have died from
 ta^umatic asphyxia has also demonstrated that not all individuals appear
 tflpiave been effected at the same time. Some could have been effected by
 movement of the crowd in the minutes after the disaster occurred. Others
 c°uld have had only partial or incomplete respiratory obstruction
 initially and then either suffered complete mechanical obstruction of
 respiration or died as the result of prolonged incomplete respiratory
 obstruction. This could take many minutes to cause death and it is
 entirely possible that death would occur more than 15 minutes after the
 incident began.

 I have not seen the post mortem photographs and therefore am having to
 rely solely on the description provided in the post mortem reports. I
 will deal with each case individually.

 1.       Paul Carlisle - He was examined by Professor Usher who describes
          suffusion of the upper body and petechial haemorrhages on the
          forehead, eyelids and within the conjunctivae.     These would be
          consistent with the classic traumatic asphyxia whereby there has
          been a mechanical obstruction and mechanical interference with the
          circulation.

 2.       Richard Jones - He was examined by Professor Usher who again found
          signs which would be consistent with the classic features of
          traumatic asphyxia. The petechial haemorrhages noted in his loins
          are probably the result of pressure causing local obstruction to the
          circulation in that area.

 3.      Ian Glover - Again examined by Professor Usher. The examination
          revealed changes of asphyxia, ie the cyanosis and visceral
          haemorrhages.   The signs of venous obstruction were relatively
          slight and in the form of small petechial haemorrhages in the upper
          eyelids and conjunctiva of the left eye.        There were scanty
          petechiae also found in the larynx.     In my opinion he has died
          primarily as the result of impedence of respiration and any
          interference with his venous circulation was minimal.

 4.      Peter Tootle - Was examined by Dr. Slater. Dr. Slater described
          changes in Mr. Tootle which are consistent with a degree of classic
          traumatic asphyxia but I suspect that the main reason for death has
          been compression of the chest resulting in impedence of respiratory

          movement. Without the post mortem photographs I am not clear as to
          why Dr. Slater feels that there has been intensive blunt compression
          of the right side of his face.

 5.       Kevin Williams    - Was examined by Dr. Slater who describes the
           external features of classic traumatic asphyxia with cyanosis of the
          face extending onto the chest with numerous petechial arid larger
  •        haemorrhages on the face and neck. He found bilateral fractures of
           the hyoid bone and of the superior horns of the thyroid cartilage
           on both sides of the larynx^ These appear related to a number of
           linear abrasions over the front of his neck and on the undersurface
           of the chin. There appears to have been local pressure to his neck.
           It was possible that when he was crushed in the crowd, the front of
           his neck was pushed against some rigid structure.        It is also
           possible that, for instance, he could have been trodden on during
           the panic subsequent to the incident occurring.

           I do not believe it is possible to say how long consciousness would
           have been retained but he certainly would not have become
           unconscious between 3 and 5 seconds of being crushed. Again I would
           not agree with Dr. Slater in estimating how long the deceased would
           have survived. Although he has suffered injuries to the neck these
           are by no means invariably fatal and can be seen in those surviving,
           strangulation and quite striking signs of classic traumatic asphyxia
           can be seen in individuals who survive crush incidents because they
           are removed from danger in time to prevent death. As I have already
  •        indicated he could well have survived for a considerable period,
           well beyond 3.15 pm.

           He suffered convulsions as the result of anoxic brain damage.
           Whether Mr. Brooder saw convulsions or twitching is irrelevant.
           A dead body neither convulses or twitches. Dr. Gompert's point that
           bodies may twitch after brain stem death, has taken place is, of
           course, correct and to some degree reflects the dilemma over
           precisely defining death.     One sees it in individuals who are
           maintained on a respirator but whose heart is still functioning.
           One also may see it during the process of dying as the heart is
           stopping and for a very short period after the heart stops. This
           phenomenon only occurs for a very short period after death unless
           muscles are electrically stimulated. Twitching movements, however,
           suggest that one is much more likely to be dealing with a live body
           than with a dead one.

            The evidence of Special Constable Martin is difficult to refute in
            some respects. Whilst it is possible for an individual examining a
            dead body to mistakenly feel an apparent pulse it is usually
            difficult to be mistaken over whether somebody is making breathing

                The enclosed letter from the South Yorkshire Police Authority is
                forwarded for your information, please.

                You will see that Mr Alderman is still of the opinion that the
                South Yorkshire Police should not become involved in the
                application, but is taking further advice from the Authority's
                Insurers.    I understand from informal discussions with oar
                Insurers that their advice will be not to become involve.},
                although that advice may alter when they are approached formally
                by the Joint Secretariat. Perhaps you would note the contents of
                this letter and return it to this Department for filing purposes.
                Obviously, I will keep you informed as matters progress.

                You may also wish to inform Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Jackson
                of ongoing events.

     Dear Sir,
     RE:HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS
     I write with reference to the application for leave to apply for judicial review
     of the inquests conducted into the deaths arising out of the Hillsborough
     Disaster which it appears was granted when it came before the Divisional Court
     on the 6th instant.
    I confirm that the view taken with regard to the application when notice of this
    was served upon you in June of last year was that this concerned the Coroner and
    not South Yorkshire Police or for that matter the other services criticised in
    the Memorials and that South Yorkshire Police should not become involved in the
    application for leave. This view was shared by Chief Superintendent Mole and
    the Authority's insurers.
     I must confess I am surprised that leave has been granted to make the
     application for judicial review following, presumably, the Attorney General's
     refusal to grant leave for an application to be made to the High Court for an
     order quashing the inquests. However, consideration will now have to be given
     to the question of whether South Yorkshire Police should become involved in the
     application, service of which will no doubt be effected upon you in the near
     future. I am making enquiries of the Authority's insurers to ascertain their
     intentions in this respect and will write you further in due course.

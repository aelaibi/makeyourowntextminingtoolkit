                                     *<3444^
                On Saturday,         9th April        1988,    (090488)        I was    on duty at the Liverpool

                 versus N o t t i n g h am Forest?       Semi-Final,           at Hillsborough,            S h e f f i e l d with

                about      twenty other        officers,       our duties was           to Police /he Lappi n g s LN

                 entrances     prior     to the game and exits after                    the game,



                 In immediate        command of this area was                  Inspector Gordon SYKES                   It

                 would     be about     11.30 am       <1130),      we took        up position,        with officers

                 at the turnstiles,            I was    positioned with about                 three officers,          at the

                 m o u t h of the entrances           on the       pavement,       at the bottom of the bridge.



                 Our     duties were,     to search for waapons and drink,                        when the turnstile

                 opened     (about     12.30    pm)    (1230)       the objective        from there         on in, was         to

                 advise     people with tickets           for the Lappings              LN to enter         the ground.
                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                  S 2572



              A'l no time ware          lines      of Police,     to each turnsli l e , to act as a

              funnel.     To do that w ould mean a large amount                        of Police,       there      for

              taking    up space at          the    entrances.



              I would     say that        I heard about       six    people wanting          to sell       the    odd

              ticket    or t w o »      No   person were      buying    them,.        At 3 pm     (1300)     (kick.

              off)    I was    handed a ticket            bv a person from Liverpool,                 Tnera were

              about    twenty to thirty             people   outside,    just     hanging around..               I picked

              a man about       thirty years and gave               him the    ticket,.



              Overall,    there was          little      problem with the Li ve r poo A contingent,                     into

              Leppi ngs LN,         so therefore we ex p e r i e n c e d      no trouble..



              On seeing       the    t e l ev is io n   coverage,    regarding        the   events    at. L a p p i n g s

              LN,    on Saturday,         15th April       1989   (150489),      at    no stage      the    previous

              year,    did we have to deal with               such a mass        of    people..




                                                                                                  € H o b s o n SI G N E D

Dear Mr Walker
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
Thank you for your letter of 15 January asking whether in the
event of compensation being made by your authority on a more
generous basis than that statutorily provided for, the
expenditure would be eligible for police grant.
We are looking into the matter and we will reply to you as
soon as possible.

                                                 Yours sincerely




                                                 FI Division

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


Thank you for your letter of 9 October to Lord Justice Taylor in
which you raise two issues. The first concerns the request which
the Police Federation made to have separate representation at the
oral hearings in Sheffield.

As you rightly say, Mr Browne's application to that effect was
refused by Lord Justice Taylor on 15 May 1989. Both Mr Browne
and Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police, however, accepted
that there was at that stage no conflict of interest, and it was
on that basis that Lord Justice Taylor reached his decision. In
doing so, he emphasised that, should any conflict of interest
emerge subsequently, it would be open to those acting for the
Federation to make a further application for representation. He
said:-

     "You are free to come back at any time and, of course, there
     is nothing to stop the Federation from having someone here
     with a watching brief ..." (Transcript Day 1 15 May 1989 p.
     7 - copy attached).

No such application was made to Lord Justice Taylor during the
remainder of the oral hearings.

Your second point concerns evidence relating to the behaviour of
Liverpool fans which you say has been overlooked. Lord Justice
Taylor finds this assertion surprising. Throughout the course of
the oral hearings, he made clear that every opportunity would be
afforded to any of the represented parties to have any witness
called whom they wished. He expressed that view at the outset of
the hearings on 15 May (Transcript Day 1, 15 May 1989 p.11 F-H)
and it was reiterated on a number of occasions right to the end
of the oral hearings.  If such evidence existed, it should have
been brought to the Inquiry1s attention at that stage.

Lord Justice Taylor feels that ample opportunity has already been
given to present all relevant evidence, and is not prepared at
this stage to consider the matter further.

M-j Lord,

re:         HILLSBOROUGH                                     INQUIRY

We are instructed by the Police Federation of England and Wales in connection
with all legal issues arising out of the events at Hillsborough on April 15th
1989 which relate to members of the Federated Ranks.    The Federated Ranks are
those below the Rank of S u p e r i n t e n d e j ^ ^ ^
On the 15th May 1989, through Mr. S£eVen Brown of Counsel, the Police Federa-
tion applied to be aranted the riaht for the Federated Ranks to be represented
by Counsel at the Hillsborough Inquiry.
Mr. Brown indicated that there was a potential conflict of interest between
Senior Ranks and Federated Ranks who were at that stage principally represented
at the Inquiry through the auspices of those representing the South Yorkshire
Council.
It had also become apparent following the disaster, that members of the Federa­
ted Ranks might be subjected to some criticisms during the Inquiry.    Separate
representation of the Federated Ranks was refused.
We remain instructed by the Police Federation on behalf of all those members
of the Federated Ranks who may now be subjected to disciplinary or criminal
investigations arising out of the incident, and thereafter in connection with
any Inquest that may be convened.
On the 15th May, when the application was made to you by Mr. Steven Brown, the
necessity for detailed representation of individual officers in potential
criminal or disciplinary proceedings had not been identified.     However, the
position has become substantially more clear since the perameters of the
wide-ranging inquiry being conducted by the West Midlands Police Force have
been clarified.
In particular it has been indicated to us that inter alia, consideration will
be given to any common law criminal offence which might be considered on the
basis of "failure to do one's duty".
                                                                                                       T elephone

 We are of the view that had this position been made clear prior to the commence­
 ment of the Inquiry, that Counsel appearing for the officers would have pursued
 the question of separate representation further.
  In the course of our general preliminary discussions with officers of the
  Federated Ranks of the South Yorkshire Police, several officers have drawn our
  attention to certain aspects of the preliminary conclusions of the Interim
  Report, particularly those relating to the behaviour of the visiting Liverpool
I fans.      There is a considerable weight of evidence available which they believe
| shows a level of behaviour less acceptable than that referred to in the Interim
| Report.     The concern relates specifically to the extreme behaviour of certain
  numbers of fans during the morning and early afternoon of the 15th April, and
  the way in which this behaviour affected normal policing metnods in a variety
  of situations in the vicinity of Hillsborough.       There is considerable concern
  that the unique problems associated with excess drinking and aggressive behav­
  iour experienced on the 15th April, and that the manner ir> which this behaviour
  caused or contributed to the disaster, have been overlooked.
                                         V


 It is the wish of the Police Federation that we write to you requesting a
 review or reconsideration of aspects of the evidence which relate to these
 matters.



 Yours /aithfully,

      HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY                                                          ■%      i


      Thank you for your letter of 9 October to Lord Justice Taylor in
      which you raise two issues.                           The first concerns the request-fev Vv/Wwv_
                                                         to H
      the Police Federation-that Limy be ^ranked separate
      representation at the oral hearings in Sheffield.


      As you rightly say, Mr Browne's application to that effect was
      refused by Lord Justice Taylor on 15 May 1989.^ In doing so,
      howevoa?, he emphasised that, should any conflict of interest
      emerge subsequently, it would be open to those acting for the
      Federation to make a further application for representation.
      Indeed., ^je spooifically— yfcafced that:-


               "You are free to come back at any time and, of course, there
               is nothing to stop the Federation from having someone here
jv             with a watching brief ..." (Transcript Day 1 15 May 1989 p.
       "X      7))                                                          -

      Your second point concerns evidence relating to the behaviour of
      Liverpool fans which you say has been overlooked.                                                     I have- to oay

that. Lord Justice Taylor finds yo w r assertion surprising.
Throughout the course of the oral hearings, he made clear that
every opportunity would be afforded to any of the represented
parties to have any witness called whom they wished.     He
expressed that view at the outset of the hearings on 15 May
(Transcript Day 1, 15 May 1989 p.11 F-H) and it was reiterated on
a number                If such evidence existed, then it should
have been brought to the Inquiry's attention at that stage.


Lord Justice Taylor feels that ample opportunity has already been
given to present all relevant evidence, and is not prepared at
this stage to consider the matter further.

                 I reported on duty at Rawrnarsh Police S t a t i o n at 080 0 hours                                  on

                Saturday        15-th April        1989      ( 150489) .      At that     time     I was       inyful 1 Police

                uniform,       consisting          of a tunic as opposed to the Poli ce/issue anorak.


                                                        X                                        fc fo /b W
                 I was      part of Serial          56 under         the   command of       Inspec/or N EW EY and we

                t r a v e ll e d from R a w m a r s h Police Stat ion to the Hi|l ^ b o r o u g h F o o t b all*,

                G r o u n d by Force        coach.



                The       b riefing   took      place       seated    in the N o r t h Stand and the e v ac ua ti on

                 procedure       explained.          The      individual        duties were e xp lained by

                 Inspector N E W E Y .



                We were       de pi oyed as a Serial             at R aw s o n Spring             at       11 15   hours    that

                                                                                                                82279

           date.       I took up my          position to direct           the N ot ti n g h a m Forest

           cont ingent         to suitable       parking    places       on the    Industrial       estate.



           The    fans     that     I saw were       good natured,        a large     proportion of which

           a p p e a r e d to have        been drinking.



           We were        to have taken a meal           on commencement           of the match at           1500

           hours and at that              time   our Serial       were    standing at the          corner     of

           P e n i s to n e Rd and Herries Rd outside                 the C harlie Browns Shop.               At    that

           time     Inspector N EWEY was m o n it or in g             the Police      radio and told us of

           some     form of trouble           in the g r o u n d .



           At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   15Q5 hours,    that d a t e , a S up er in t e n d e n t a p p r o a c h e d

           our Serial         and we were        ordered    into the ground.



           As we en te red the ground through the entrance                          between the N or th S ta nd

           and the S pion K o p , I was              unaware    of what was happening,              but    saw to my

           left     the N o tt i n g h a m Forest      p l a y e r s , numbered six and t h r e e , 1eaving

           the    pitch and others            going    down the       tunnel.



           On    looking      to the Leppi ng s Ln end of the ground                    I saw a large         crowd of

           s pe ct at or s    on the      pitch.      I thought at that           time that there          had been a

           pitch      invasion.

           as a Serial          to the      crowd.     It was     only on reachirj# the goal area                   that

           I realised that a serious                  incident       had taken j/Lace.          I saw a large man

           ob vi o us l y dead        crushed against       the      perirnj       fence.       I saw that         fans

           were     all    crushed together and            people were asking            for help

          The actual      sequence       of events       that    f ol lowed are     not   clear     in my min d

          but my r ec ol lection         is as follows.



          I stood on the fencing            shouting       to fans       to move    back,    it did not have

          a ny effect,      in fact a group of about               four    fans were swearing             back at

          me and g esti cu la ti ng with their             hands    the    *V*   sign.      I was    shouting        to

          them and telling         them that       people were getting             hurt at the front.             It

          had no effect.         I remember        pulling at       least two       people    over the fence

          but    these were     not     really    injured ones.           They had o bviously         clambered

          over   the trapped       people at the front.



            went                          and with other O ff icers              pulled bodies       through.          I

                tinea at t r m     gate    for some time.           The    gateway was       small    and    it was

          d i fficult    to pull      people     through.        I thought at that time             that    the

          pitch su rround and the           entrance       through the gate were on the same

          level.     It was     only after        some    time    that    I realised that         in fact we

          had a pile of bodies.



          One man    in particular was            very heavy,       he a p p e a r e d dead and took

          several    Officers      to    pull    him out.



          At some    stage     I reached through           the gate as         I could see a boy face

    ' A   down but with no one            on top of him/'          The    boy as    I recall      had jeans and

J     x   a belt a nd was       light     coloured        iir.     I took      hold of the     lad's belt and

          was able      to lift him m ys e l f / w i t h    one hand and          pass him backwards

          do not    recall     how ojr why/But       I remember walking with a body on a

          s tretcher     to the m a k V s n i f t area     between the N orth Stand.                The    body was

          of a m a 1e .     I also a ss i s t e d with taking            the   body of a w o ma n     in jeans

          who was    face    down,      to that area.

                                                                                                     S2 2 7 9

At    several       points     during    that       period    I fait    unable    to breath myself

an d had to stop what             I was       doing.       At some     point   I did     remove my tunic

and    lost my Police           tie.



I saw a youth on the              pitch who was            in some     distress,    he told me that

his    chest was hurting.               He a pp ea re d      in shock.     He also       told me that he

was a s t h ma ti c and did not have m e d i c a t i o n with him.



I tried to walk           calmly wit h the youth to the N orth Stand are a and

han de d him to a mbulance              staff.



I did a p p ro ac h a number            of    people      on the    pitch and a sked them            if they

were alright.            The m aj o r i t y stated they were             looking for either

friends       or    relatives.         I did ask       them to keep off the            pitch    if

possible as          they w ou ld only get asked agai n by a^rfier Officers.                           11

appeared       to have        no effect.



The only time during              the    inciyfent tjrfat I was aware             of being      ordered to

do an yt hi ng was        by Chief S u p e r in te nd en t NES8IT who was at gate                    three

and was       shouting,        "Get    them O TT "     and he himself was          pulling wit h us.

Later    that      day   I was    part       of the    line of O ff icers across          the    pitch.         I

a m unable         to say to who m       I passed the dead bodies                other    than say they             _

were all       passed backwards              onto   the    pitch.



At    1630 hours , that date,                I returned wit h my Serial            to Ra ws on Spring

Rd    to assist       in the safe        passage       of .Nottingham Forest           fans.    That

duty    complete,        we    returned to Clayw he el s Ln and then to Rawmarsh.                           I

went    off    duty at 2000 hours.



The    incident at H i l l s b o r o u g h      has    left me w ith a general            feeling      of
                                                                                                PAGE       5

             guilt    in that        I feel   that more should have   been done - What      I do not

             know»

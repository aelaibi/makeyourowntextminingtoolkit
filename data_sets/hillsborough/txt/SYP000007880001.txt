              Serge a n t    stopped all           the    traffic and went            to assist          his    colle ague          in

              eventually          did.     1 did not         see anym o r e       because     the bus          began    to move

              on.     I did not see a n y b o d y a r r e s t e d and              I could not           see any       scarves

              had flags and banners w ith                    them.        They were     singing and             cheering        but       I

              did not       see any trouble.               I would say they were                  just    in high

To g ether with the            lads,
                         I went b^tXk to the First Aid Roo m and we were

I think       is                  At    this       point we had             no stre t c h e r s     but we each had

our    individual          first       aid kits.            My    personal         kit     c o nsisted of a water

until    the    players    came       out    onto    the       pitch and         kicked off at 3                pm

Almost       straight away a group of Police                        Officers        walked       past us

towards       the West Stand.           At    this       stage,         I thought        the L i v e r p o o l       fans

were    just    being    rowdy and the             police were            going     to    put    them back

behind the fence.           W i t h i n minutes another                   g roup of       police       officers

instructed us to follow them down as we were warfked in the West

this    point and we wa l k e d along               the tou c h l i n e a l o n g s i d e        the N o r t h

As we got       closer    I could see          people          in pen 4 ar o u n d          theN^rea       I have

see    people    being    crushed a g a i n s t N t h e         fencing.

Before       I got to the       terracing          I saw an a m b u l a n c e m a n with a casualty.

He a sked me for a s s i s t a n c e         and    I helped            him strap the m a n ’s legs

together as he was           c o m p l aining       of      pain    in one       of his       legs.       The man,

who was       in his early       forties,          was      then    put     into amb u l a n c e       chair and,

together with the a m b u l a n c e man,                 I pushed         hirn to the First             Aid Room

where we       handed him over          to female            nursing        staff     in there.

I then went       straight       back       onto    the      pitch.        The    game was         still        being

played and,       as    1 got    closer       up to the West Stand,                      I could see a lot

more    people    on the     pitch,         some of them            layed      out a l o n g s i d e    the

told us       it was    no good,         that    the    lad was       dead.         The     policewoman               I was

the m a n ’s ai r w a y but,        as    I opened       it,    his    throat was               full     of fluid

strongly of beer,             out   of his m outh and            throat.           A second            pol i c e m a n

then    came and helped and we                  continued       one inflation                to five

compressions         until     a man,      who    said he       was a surgeon, came                over           and

checked       the m a n ’s pulse and eyes.                He told us there was                      nothing more

we    could do and so s o m e b o d y           covered his       face and we               left him.             I

w o u l d describe the man as white, in his late t h i r t i e s / e a r l y forties.

(Ref No              (Exh No                    )„     There was a crowd of                  people     standing

a r o u n d a man who was         layed out on the                  floor.     I knelt        down and

exami n e d    the man who was            not    breathing           and had no pulse.               I cleared

his ai r w a y and gave          him the        first       two     inhalations.           I then started

We h a d n ’t been going          very     long w hen the              same man who          had said       he was

a surg e o n    came over,        e x a m i n e d the man and,              again,     told us there was

nothing       else we     could     do and       that he           ’had gone*.         The    people       standing

ar o u n d him were       obviously        his       friends as they were                 crying and        very

distressed.          I would describe                the man as white,              in his        twenties,

a l t h o u g h he was    bald on top,           with       fair     hair at the sides,,              I c a n ’t

remember what          he was wearing.

The    surgeon told me to go back                     to the a rea behind the goal                    and help

people     still     being    brought       out.           As    I was     going    back     I saw a St

J o h n ’s ambulance       coming along              the    pitch from the North S t a n d and a

police     officer       told me    to go and fetch                  it.     I ran across          and .jumped

into    the? a m bulance and d i r e c t e d the                 driver     around     the outside          of    the

pitch,     through all        the    people,         and told him to stop                  just     past    the     goal

m o u t h nearest      to the S o u t h Stand.                  T h a t ’s where    the    police     officer

ha d t oId me to f e t ch it to.

As    1 jumped out of         the amb u l a n c e          there were a crowd of                  people

standing around anot h e r man                  lying       on the grass who              I had seen        just

brought       out of     pen 3.      I could now see                 that    the    gate     to    pen 3 had been

opened but       I d o n ’t know whether               the man was           passed thro u g h        the    gate       or

over    the    fence.      The    people with              him a s k e d me    to help and           I got

straight       down and e x a m i n e d him.               AgasLn,    he was       not bre a t h i n g and

there was       no   pulse.       I cleared his a i r w a y and began m outh                         to m o u t h

and heart massage.               I was     then joined by Pfrle w E c L S who                     had an o x y g e n

s o m e b o d y else.       One    of the       fans with the m a n said he was a first

aider    and took        over      the m o u t h to mouth.             We     continued working             until a

rnan, in a blue blazer, who I r ecognised as one of the people who said

they were a doctor earlier, came over and e x a m i n e d the man. A g a i n he

told us       it was     no good and            the man     'had gone'.              His    friends    a ro u n d

him were       begging       the doctor          to let me         carry on but            I did as    the doctor

told me and stopped.                 I w ould describe              the man as white,              early

twenties.           He was w e a r i n g a denim jacket,                 a    light    blue    shirt and blue

denim jeans.            I left      this man w i t h his           friends and turned               round.

I saw another man on the ground w i t h a pol i c e m a n at the side                                      of him,,

He was       lying on the          grass    behind the goal.                  I e x a m i n e d him and      found

he was       not    br eathi ng and had no            p u 1s e „      Tha     p o 1 i c eman s tarted       do ing

the m outh to mouth and                  1 did the      compressions.               We wor k e d   on him for

about a minute when a fire                      brigade     officer          came over       and a ske d    us      if

we had got a pulse.                 The    policeman       felt       the     carotid       pulse and said           it

was    faint       so the   fire m a n     put a mask       over       his m outh w hich was

connected          to a machine          that    pumped out air.               We stop p e d the

compressions and             left    the machine          on but a doctor              who was wit h         us

told    us    it was    doing       no good and to           leave       him.        Two    firemen    then

covered him over with a coat                      I think.         I can only describe                this man

as whiite and         in his       forties.

By this       time    I was       just    going    from one        body to a n o t h e r and giving

them m outh to m outh and                 heart massage.              I honestly           c a n ’t say how many

people       I tried to help or describe                    them at all.

By now the a d v e r t i s i n g         boards were        being      ripped down           and thrown

around.        Whilst       I was    giving       resusc i t a t i o n       I was    being    knoc k e d    by the

boards,       stood on and ki c k e d by             people     a r o u n d me.        This was       not

deliberate,          it was       just    so busy around           the area          behind    the goals.            I

c a n ’t say       if I was       successful       on a n y b o d y    I attempted, to r esuscitate
                                                                                                                PAGE

because       they were        being      placed on boards and                  stretchers          even whilst          I

was working         on them and           carried away.

The    next    thing       I remember          is I was       trying      to    resuscitate a man who

was    not    breathing when             someb o d y    in a medical            unif o r m told me          to get

him onto a board and,                 after      doing    this,      I helped             carry him to       the

gym.      I only just          got    thro u g h the      door      into       the    gym and       could see

numbers       of bodies        laid out and            covered      over.        We       put the man on the

board down onto             the    floor.        As far as         I could see he was                still      not

breathing.          I can only describe                 him as white,            about 6*          tall   and    in

his    late    thirties.           I think       he was w e a r i n g a light               coloured      shirt

that was       ripped.        We a s k e d a police            officer         if there was a n y t h i n g we

could do and he               told us to go back out                onto       the     pitch.

I went       straight         ha c k a nt o the p i t c h a n d , by t h i s t im e , mos t of                  t he

bodies       had been taken away                but    there were         lots       of    people    very

d i s t r e s s e d and    crying.        I saw a y outh who was                 bleeding          from his      nose

and mouth.          1 tried to get              him to sit         down or onto a str e t c h e r               but he

wa n t e d me to go           and help more serious                people..          I told him they            were

all    being     looked after and               he    then    let me assist him                 into the First

Aid Roo m where            I handed him over             to

I then       returned       to the       pitch and was a p p r o a c h e d            by a pol i c e m a n who

told me to get a stretcher.                          I fetched a metal               s t r etcher w h i c h was

against       the wall        under      the West Stand.             I followed             the    police    officer

to the S pion Hop end where                     there was a man            lying          on the    pitch.       There

was a man standing                over    him who       told me the man on the                     ground    had

twisted his         knee and also              suffered       from epilepsy.                I e x a m i n e d the

man,    who a p p e a r e d    to be s e m i - c o n s c i o u s    and    b r eathing          normally.        He

had a bandage             on his     knee and         I was    told he had just                 had an

operation.          I s t r apped        his    legs together w ith              triangular          b a n dages       and

put him on a stretcher.                    We started          carrying         him to the          first    aid

room but were met              bv an a m b u l a n c e    on the way and                  the   driver    told us

to    put him        in the a m b u l a n c e w hich we did.                At    this    time     I was      with

                 cin ca

I then went           back      onto       the    pitch and just          comforted       people who were                 in

shock and depression.                       The    last    person    I treated was a young                    lad who

said his arm had been                      crushed.        I took    him to the First              Aid R oo m and

handed him to

I spent a short                time    talking       to a man sat          outside       the First       Aid Room

but he didn't appear                   injured and the           police       told me not to bother

wit h    hirn.

I then went           back onto            the    pitch w hich had almost             cleared a part            from a

few fans and              co l l e c t e d up     items    of first aid kit and stretches                       that

were     lying around.                I took       them back     to the First            Aid Roo m and,

whilst     looking           for     the    kit,    I had met       back    up with I                  [and

and so the          three       of us wa i t e d until          there was         nothing       else we        could

do and were           told we         could go home.

A l t h o u g h during         the    disaster       I totally       lost     track      of time       I think        it

must    of been about 6 .3 0                 pm    (1830)     when we      eventually          left   the     ground.

Although         I have        only been          in St Johns       for    e i g h t e e n months      I have       been

doing     first aid with the Red Cross                         since about         1964.

I have     never          e x p e r i e n c e d a n y thing   like the      events       of the       15th April

(150489)         and obv i o u s l y        it has                                                       I n my

The     first     time       I heard an a n n o u n c e m e n t      on the       loud speaker          was     when

s o m ebody a n n o u n c e d what           had happened and a s k e d            p e o p 1e to      clear     the

wouldn't         like to say what                 time    it was.

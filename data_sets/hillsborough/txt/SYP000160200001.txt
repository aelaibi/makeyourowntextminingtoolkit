COMPLAINT 8/89

The complainant alleged in a written statement th a t:

   â€¢   That he saw a uniformed police officer assault an unknown young man by punching
       him in the face.

This assault allegedly took place when supporters went through the Perimeter gates on to
the pitch from pens 3 and 4 in the West stand terrace.

The complainant was later shown video of events that took place that day. He was unable to
identify on video the incident that he was referring to.

The complainant attended the match with two relatives. The complainant requested that his
son was not interviewed. The other relative concurred with the account supplied by the
complainant although the description of the officer involved differed.

Extensive enquiries by West Midlands Police involved the examination of photographs and
video available. The videos and photographs recorded no such assault but did indicate the
confusion, the large amount of activity at that location and that this involved numerous police
officers. No further witnesses were found.

OUTCOME

Enquiries failed to identify the police officer involved.

The Taylor enquiry established there were 1122 officers deployed for the match.

The young man allegedly assaulted did not come forward.

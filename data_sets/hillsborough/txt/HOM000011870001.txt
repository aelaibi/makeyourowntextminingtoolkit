 Dear Tony


MEETING 14 FEBRUARY 1990 RE ISSUES ARISING FROM THE
HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY FINAL REPORT

I mentioned to Tom Ellingford that r felt one- or two DOints
FetoirJ did n o f n??e tatea 26 February of the, meeting of 14
            *     reflect accurately our position. I thought I
doni in u      &       °ut that Position as we see it- r have

Paragraph 3 M )

b .. We fecognise that it is for- us to take the lead on
rnqiirv   S ^'recommendations o f the Final Report of the
inquiry. in so doing we are content to answer: enquiries about
fmancing^some of the recommendations (particularly all seated
accommodation) along the common line which o S t ™ department

the schedule to the Home Secretary's statement.

5.   The lead department on hooliganism is a matter between
you and F8 Division. I would have thought it would be more
accurate to say that DOE continues to be the lead department
on any work associated with the need for and introduction of
any football membership scheme in order to help combat soccer
hooliganism.

6.   I hope this clarifies the situation as we see it and I am
sorry if there has been any misunderstanding.

                                       Yours sincerely

                                INTRODUCTION




The information shown on the attached plans has been compiled by the West

Midlands Police Video/Photographic Section of the Hillsborough Judicial

Inquiry for the purposes of assisting the work of the section.



The coloured and numbered stickers indicate, what are believed to be the

position of deceased either prior to, or following their death as seen on

either video footage or photographs.



In some instances people have been seen in different locations ie pen or

pitch and as such may have more than one identifying sticker shown.



The plan showing stickers which are all the same colour is drawn up from

information contained in statements only and at this stage does not

differentiate as to whether alive or dead. These are additional identifications

to the above.



It should be stressed that the identifications are based on the opinion of

officers researching the material available to them as at the 6.6.89.



The plans should be treated as a GUIDE to movements of persons at this stage

and not a completed document.

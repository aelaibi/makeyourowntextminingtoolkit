              I am Special Constable              serving   in the S Yorkshire Police.     I have

              been a Special since September,          1988 (000988) and am attached to F 1

              Division Hammerton Rd Sheffield.



              During the period I have been a Special Constable            I have performed

              duty at most Sheffield Wednesday football matches and am familiar

              with the ground.



              On Saturday 15th April,          1989 I paraded for 9.30 am (0930 h r s ) at

              Sheffield Wednesday football          ground in preparation for the Liverpool         v

              Notts Forest semi final.



              I sat in the t^orth Stand together with other           regular Officers and
                                                                                        PAGE       2
                                                                                        S I 829

Special Officers.            We were briefed by various Regular Officers,                and

covered emergency procedures and evacuation plans,                       I was not at the

•1988 semi final.

                                         \/ lJi \.
Myself and Special Constable                              we/e   posted together to cover

^traffic on Langsett R d, this was to cover/pafrkino^and also to try and

keep most of the Li ver poo L/suppo rte rs t<# tnat dx cfe of the ground.

There was six Officer^/in our sect ion/uryaer/ahe/ supervision of
                    t i                                    „
Section O f f i c e r P b h o          was in p/fsseas/on qrf a personal           radio,



After the briefing           I went to the gym at the ground where I had a meal

and drink before starting             pat/rol in Langsett Rd,          it was now between

ten thirty and eleven o'\l<yck (1Q3Q hrs -11QQ hrs).



At this time Langsett Rd was pretty quiet and I did not see anyone

drinking from cans or any trouble.                    At about   12 o'clock     (12QQ h r s ) we

moved into Holme Ln w here we had seen numbers of supporters walking.

In Holme Ln I saw a few noisy groups of supporters making their way to

Hillsborough Centre and the pubs.                    Although they were noisy L^did not

see anyone     causing any trouble.             I made my way to the Y^g T rejs, Public

House whi ch is in Ho lme Ln and this was very q u i e t , but thefts wffre

still supporters making their way along Holme Ln towards the ground,
                                                                          i
these were mainly Liverpool              supporters.       From there we made our way,

sc.          and myself to the Hillsborough C e ^ r e                 and into the shopping

precinct.     As          we made our way to the shopping area we passed the

Public H o u s e.          I think   is called Thdjy/l o r i     ,^   lis was very busy and a

.lot of people were stood outside in the bg«T garden drinking.                        The

fans were not             causing any trouble they were Liverpool             supporters and

it was just before one o'clock               (13QQ hrs).
                                                                                              PAGE       3
                                                                                              S I 829

                 We walked through the Hillsborough shopping precinct and it was full

                 of shoppers and no fans that        X saw.   Regular Officers were stationed

                 either end of the shopping precinct.          We then returned to Langsett Rd

                 and I saw t h a t , The Shakespe^^/f^d^l i c House was open a nd very busy

                 inside but no one drinking outside.          Th e Blue Buily^ffubli c House in

  v              Bradfield was    cl ose d.   I saw that it was very b^^/*o(utside the Owl

  V/ x.          Public House near P^^ji^^ne^Rd I was         1ooking   from a distance and could

                 not   be sure which supporters were     using this     pub,   but I could see red

                 and white clothing.



  ^          fo) We continued to patrol Langsett Rd which remained pretty quiet and I
      clf7
       * *       saw   no trouble.    At about 2.45 pm (1445 hrs)       we decided to make our

        0*       way   to the ground for a meal, and     in Middlewood Rd I met a regular
             a
                 Of f i ce r who told me there had been some trouble with a gate in

                 Leppings Ln area.      When I was told this SC                and m y s e lf made our

                 way towards Leppings Ln when I saw and heard Police cars and

^/S^^^ambulances               going towards the ground,      but because we did not have a

                 radio we did not know what had gone off.          We walked towards Leppings

                 Ln turnstiles and looking at them from a distance             it^looked all quiet
                 ------------------
                 there at this stage.         It was now after three oMrTock      (15QQ hrs) and

                 from the cheering     I had heard it was obvious the game had started.



                 We walked along Parkside Rd because we could see people standing on

                 walls,    a Police Box and other things from where you could see a little

                 bit of the pitch.      We tried to get the fans down some got down some

                 didn't.    We then made our way to the ground and walked around the

                 outside of the ground from Penistone Rd towards Leppings L n ,



                 As we reached Leppings Ln                        about quarter to twenty past

                 three    (1515 - 1520 hrs) and I saw/some bodies        laid out on the floor
                                                                         PAGE    4
                                                                         S1829

outside the turnstiles towards the directors        car park.   This was the

first I knew there had been any problems.         I think there was six

bodies   lying there,   together with people that were injured.        There

were   regular Officers in attendance, keeping people away from the dead
                                     /
and injured.    Myself and SC         a s s y ^ e d several people who were

injured a nd clear the road tq/^nable /aj}>ffula;ftces to reach the injured.

We assisted in this area frfr about ten to f4-4Heen minutes and I saw

that the bodies lying on the floor were a blue green colour, most of

them did not have shirts on and most were without shoes.



As more and more injured people came to us for assistance we moved

along to behind the South stand w here I came across a young        lady and

her friend.     I do not know their names but they appeared to be in

their mid twenties.       Both girls were   injured but one appeared worse

than the other and she was lying on a hoarding board and was wearing a

pink track suit.     This girl   complained of no feeling in her legs and

pins and needles    in her arms.    Eventually we stopped a passing

ambulance and the men got out and started to attend to the girl and at

the same time a Doctor arrived.       The girls were attended to and taken

away in the ambulance which drove away towards Leppings Ln I have no

idea how the girls got to the back of the South Stand.



At this time I think      it was about 3.30 pm (1530 hrs) a nd a lot of

people were milling around,      I was unable to tell them what the

position was because      I did not have a radio.    I later asked a regular

Officer with a radio and he told me that the game had been cancelled.

After this    I told people the situation and suggested they made their

way home,    these were Nottingham Forest supporters     leaving the    'Spion

Kop"   end of the ground.

I continued the task      in clearing the area and I then heard a publi c

announcement that the qjrfffg^had been cancelled.      After most of the

people had left K-nrtade my way into the Kop and with SC                  ,it was

then I realised what had gone on in the ground.             The pitch was

littered with hoardings and paper cups and other bits and pieces.                 We

cleared the people out of the Kop and then made our way to behind the

North Stand.    We had a drink and then sat in the North Stand w here

we had a little de brief w ere dismissed and went home.              It was now 6.

30 pm (1830 hrs).
                                                                 /

At 9.30 pm (2130 hrs)      I again went to Hammerton Rd/Police Station for
                1                                 /'    /
my regular patrol d u t y . On reaching H a m m e d o n £ra I was teamed up with
      *iu  O >28!^                            /
PC408        and were directed to the Bo^s cMib at the junction of

Hammer ton Rd and Infirmary Rd where     rd 1a t i vfejs-^of yhe dead and injured

were meeting.       We were there for about 20 minute^ and then went to

Forbes Rd community centre w here/again families/were meeting and being

counselled by Social W o r k e r s , >finisters, Salava\ion Army and other

helpers.   My duties were        keep people out who should not be there

and also to help record details of persons reported missing to the

Social workers.^- I/remained at this 1o cat ion lentil 4.30 am          (0430

hrs) when I came home.



I could not identify any of the dead bodies or injured as I did not

deal with them apart from seeing the dead lying on the floor near

Leppings Ln end and assisting the injured into ambulances.

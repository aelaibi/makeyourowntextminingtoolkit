     Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

     Dear Lord Justice Taylor

                     INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

     Our membership of 247 consists primarily of representatives of
     the governing bodies of all the principal sports practised in
     this country.   Our functions include inter alia the bringing
     together of these as a forum for the exchange of information
     and views.    Most of such meetings are in six Divisions
     according to the nature of the activities.

     Our Major Spectator Sports Division,      comprising the top
     sixteen sports, is ideally placed to discuss spectator aspects
     of sports facilities.

     The Division was deeply concerned at the Hillsborough tragedy
     and would go to any lengths to assist in the identification of
     causes and the implementation of protective measures, but in
     fact little has come out of our meetings which the Football
     Association is not putting forward itself and I would say that
     although the submission from the Football Association is not
     yet ready, we have great confidence that in due course it will
     be reliable and constructive.  We are also in close touch with
     the Sports Council, whose submission you already have and we
     support its general tenor, with only the slight reservation of
     the next paragraph.

     Our members from other sports have a major anxiety that any
     legislation or changes of practice that may be recommended in
     regard to safety certificates etc should be very carefully
     watched to ensure that there is due consideration of the very
     differing features of different sports.

                                                                                                                    From/...

The Right Honourable Lord Justice Taylor




From a crowd control point of view there are indeed vast
differences.     While football normally has a single match
taking a couple of hours or so with most spectators arriving
just before it, leaving just after it and not needing to move
around the ground in between, cricket takes much longer, so
introducing a desire to move around from time to time even if
only to visit toilet or catering facilities.   Racing (horse,
greyhound,   rowing,  motor)  has a succession of events at
intervals of half an hour or so with spectators wanting to
move to different vantage points and to visit bookmakers and
paddocks etc.     Athletics has various events spread around
while lawn tennis (other than the Davis Cup) has many matches
at the same time with long undetermined hours and with
spectators,   even if holding reserved seat tickets for a
principal court, wanting to visit other courts, refreshment
areas, toilets, and so on.

It would be misleadingly easy, following a desperate situation
such as we     had  at Hillsborough,   to   rush   into  blanket
regulations or extension of controls with insufficient regard
for the differing types of set-up.     And if we may quote an
example, the famous "Green Guide", althoxigh stating clearly in
Section l that it is a voluntary code without legal force and
in Section 5 that "the measures may not always be necessary
      at  other   types of   sport"   (ie   besides   football),
nevertheless on the back cover it says "it can be applied to
all types of sports grounds where spectators are likely to be
present".

Past experience of such documents suggests the risk of local
authorities and fire officers from time to time seeking to
enforce provisions otherwise than where they are appropriate.
Subject to that proviso we could support the extension of the
Green Guide, and/or indeed legislation, in a manner to assist
sports organisers and at the same time local authorities with
their unenviable task of supervising safety provisions without
enforcing arrangements which in individual circumstances, to
which   they  might  not   be  appropriate,  can   only  cause
aggravation.

We will, of course, be delighted to give oral evidence should
you feel that such a contribution would be helpful.

Yours sincerely




R G ROBINSON
Chairman
Major Spectator Sports Division

Thank you for your letter o f .......................[to Michael Howard], enclosing one from Mr Phil
Hammond, Secretary of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

As you and Mr Hammond are aware, the Home Secretary has undertaken to consider carefully
the points which were made in the programme Hillsborough, and the representations which
have been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has emphasised that he
would not take the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it
would be in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance of providing a better
understanding than there is at present of what happened on that terrible day.


In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether there is any new evidence;
he will also consider whether that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor inquiry or the
verdict of the jury would have been different.


The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the Home Secretary with a
detailed report of all the points raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised
that he will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as he has been able to
consider all the issues.

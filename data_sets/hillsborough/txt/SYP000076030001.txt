              the     sides.                I m an a g e d     to turn      round and       I saw    people       o b v iously    in a

              their         pain            I began to try to               push them backwards away from the

              barrier,              but the force was too                     strong and          I was unsuccessful.             The

              match         had by now star t e d                    but    I wasn't aware          of any goings          on on the

        iKfr/fhalfway         line of the        pitch.   Th/s    initially          proved useful       in stopping,

                but after       that     isolated /incident           the    line was of      little     effect.I     asked

                one    of the Police Offic e r s          standing          on the    line,   "Why the gates at         the

                back    of the        tunnel   w e r e n ’t open,"      He    replied,    "Why who wants         to

                leave?" This           implies    to me that a          lot of Police Officers w e r e n ’taware

                of the extent           of the    problem,    w hich was        confirmed to me when             I later

                a s k e d a P o li ce ma n what, was      going       to happen and he did not know.

                Earlier       on I had     pulled an ad v e r t i s i n g      board off from the outskirts                of

                the    pitch and w a l k ed towards          the goal m o u t h        intending    to help with

                the    injured and the deceased.              However         I stopped short       of    completing

                this and        c o u l d n ’t bring myself      to     help due      to my shocked state.

                At about        1605hrs    <1603)      I finally        left   the    ground on the d i r e c t i o n   of

                an a n n o uncement,       finally after         being       given wrong      direction     by a Police

                O ffi c e r    I made my way home.

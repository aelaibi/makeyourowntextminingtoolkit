Dear Sgt

Thank you for your letter of 13 June and for the postal order
for £17,25.

I enclose a VHS cassette of our programme "FOOTBALL: THE FINAL
WHISTLE?".

As I mentioned when we spoke, I would be grateful if you could
let us know of any developments that may arise as a result of
the viewing.

Yours sincerely




Keri Lewis
Production Manager

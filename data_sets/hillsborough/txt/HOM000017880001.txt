                The R t . Hon. Lord Justice Taylor
                Royal Courts of Justice
                The Strand
                LONDON     WC2A 2CC



                Dear Lord Justice,

                If I may introduce myself, my other consuming
                interest in life is as Vice Chairman of Millwall
                Football Club.

                In the course of your assessment of the
                Hillsborough tragedy, we understand that you
                will be evaluating the implications of the
                Football Spectators Bill for crowd control and
                safety.

                Even before Hillsborough there was sufficient
                evidence to suggest that the Bill was
                unworkable, even as an "enabling" measure.

                The enclosed document, designed as a submission
                to Government and presented to Colin Moynihan in
                January 1989, was intended to help break the
                deadlock between Government and Football.

                It preserves the objectives of the Bill (which
                Football welcomes) but proposes an alternative
                strategy for meeting them, capable of receiving
                the common consent of football, police,
                local and central government alike.

                We feel that this proposal will be helpful to             C b n i r r n an

                you in your enquiry, since it also contains an            Davie! A b b o t t

I hope you will understand that my objective is
not to minimise football's problems but rather
to open up debate and look for long term
solutions. Obviously, if I can be of any
assistance in your deliberations, I would be
only too happy to talk to you.

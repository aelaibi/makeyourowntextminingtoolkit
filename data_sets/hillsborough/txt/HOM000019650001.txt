HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

I am grateful to you for confirming the arrangements for Lord
Justice Taylor's visit to Maine Road on Friday 6 October. As you
suggested, he will arrive accompanied by Mr Whalley at 2.30 pm at
main reception, where you will meet him.

In the meantime, Lord Justice Taylor was interested to read press
reports of crowd disturbances and ticket allocation difficulties
at last weekend's game with Manchester United. He would like
further details of the problems which occurred and wonders
whether you could provide a full report of the da y 's events. He
would be grateful to receive this as soon as possible.

At his request, I am writing in similar terms to the Club
Secretary at Manchester United.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                        JONATHAN SWEET

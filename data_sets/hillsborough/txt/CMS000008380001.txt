         Dear                            &


                          We wish to* state (as lifelong Conservative
          supprters) that we are entirely opposed to any suggestion
         that alterations to football club property ( for "safety"
         or any other reason) he funded, even partially, hy the
         Government.
                          We do not, and would not, ask ANYONE to fund
         our interests (even though the latter have never killed
         anybody) so we are not willing to; pay for someone else's.
         The clubs             must fund any such alterations , or go down.

                          Yours sincerely,

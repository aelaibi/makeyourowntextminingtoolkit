   -     “H o m e Office so u rces d is­
       closed that three new offences
        are likely to be created in the
       next Parliamentary session.
           They all stem from Lord J u s ­
       tice Taylor’s report into last
       year’s Hillsborough disaster.
       He called for a series of spe­
       cific new offences to be created
       in th e r e p o r t, w hich cam e

       ments, ministers were cooler
       regarding some of his propos­
       als for changes in the law.

       doubts about the practicality of
       enforcing the three offences
       have been overcome.

       Parliament.
          But Lord Ju stice T aylor’s
       call for a crackdown on ticket

          Despite a drive against ticket
       touts in Scotland, officials and
       ministers have serious doubts
       whether laws to drive them off
       the streets could be effective.

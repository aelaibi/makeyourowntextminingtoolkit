              I w a s ^ l ^ w l y moving             along       the wall        towards      one of the turnstiles.

              At    the actual             tur n s t i l e    I was about          to enter       I saw a u n i formed

              po l i c e m a n     come     the wrong way out of                   it and      shout     repeatedly at           the

              crowd         to    push back.             I think         he    lost his    helmet.        The    people at          the

              front         could not             push back       because        of the    people at the back.

              I got        into      the    turnstile and handed the a t t endant my ticket which he

              checked,           ripped his           portion off and              returned       the    remainder        to rne.           1

              do    recall         that     the fans who             entered before me also went                     through        the

              same        p rocedure.

              Once        through the             t urnstiles        I hung on for my brother who                      came    in

              behind me.

              I saw         to the         right     of the turnstiles 1 had just                       entered      through        a

against        the horizontal           bar.     The    breath was       taken out of me and                I

thought        I was       blacking     out.     I remember          thinking      “I ’m a goner        here."

The    pressure went           on for several           minutes       unlike      the usual     ten seconds

or so,         I was moaning and              I saw two skinheads             behind me telling             people

that     I was       dying.     All     I could hear was             groans and      cries and        people

saying        "There's       someone     dead h e r e . ”

A gap a p p e ar ed         on the other’ side          of the barrier in front of me ana                        I

managed        to get       under      the   barrier    into the       gap.

While        I was    in    this      gap 1 saw directly          in front of me agai n s t a

barrier        a white       lad age d about 23 years wit h short brown hair.                               He was

m o t i o nl es s    and his head was           tilted to one          side.       I suspect     he was         dead.

                      That this House is profoundly disturbed by the appallingly distasteful publication of
                   photographs of those suffering and dying against the wire fencing during the disaster at
                   Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April; feels deeply for the additional distress caused to the
                   relatives and friends of those in extremis; and supports the Press Council’s intention to
                   examine this issue.

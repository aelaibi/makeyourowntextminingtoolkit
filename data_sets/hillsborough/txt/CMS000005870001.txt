    IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL-SEATED SPECTATOR ACCOMMODATION AT                      DESIGNATED
    SPORTS GROUNDS OTHER THAN SOCCER STADIA

    Thank you for your letter of 24 September. We have previously
    consulted our Minister who was content that, subject to the views of
    your Ministers, Government should rely on the voluntary approach and
    not take forward the Taylor recommendation to extend mandatory allÂ­
    seated accommodation to sports other than associated football. I have
    no doubt that our Minister will welcome the clarification contained in
    your draft PQ reply. I note that as I suggested in my letter of 5 July
    the matter is to be kept under review.

    I have no other comments but I would be grateful if you could let me
    know whether the submission in its final form differs in any way from
    the draft and when the PQ answer is to be made. I understand that you
    propose to wait until the Rugby World Cup is over which seems to me
    sensible.

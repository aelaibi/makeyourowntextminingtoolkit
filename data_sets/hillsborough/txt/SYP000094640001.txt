              Further       to my (Sues n o nnai re                  I arrived            in my seat          in the West Stand

              overlooking          the West            Terrace about               1501     hrs    <1 S 0 1 ).     The m a t c h had

              just      started        I   know.           1 was     seated        just to the         right      of the goals             and

              o v e r l o o k e d 'the     front          of Pen 3.

              W i t h i n a few m i n u t e s          of taking my seat                  it was apparent            to me       that

              people were             in trouble           at    the front           of the       terraces.         Peo p l e were

              going      blue and          others were             shouting and s c reaming                   to the be let out of

              the      pens.      I heard one man shout                       to     the P o l i c e m a n    at the front         of      the

              pen,      “Open     the      gate you fucking               bastard.u

              A lmost     at about            the
                                    same time as the man was s h o u t i n g , the gate, at the

              ma n on the gate                trying       to    climb over           the     perimeter          fence.     There were

              about      three Pol icemen at                    the gate at           this     time and one          of these

                g r ab b e d the ma n on the gate and                                       pulled him off.            He    than pushed        this

                ma n     back    into          the                   crowd    in Pen 3.        The    gate was        then    closed    but     1 am

                unable       to say e xa c t l y who                              closed     it,,    That     is wh et he r    it was    the one

                who      pushed     the man                           back    in or    if    it was     one of the others.

                W h e n this      took              place                  it must    have    been before B e a r d s l e y hit          the

                crossbar and just at about                                           the    time     that    people were       trying to get out

                of the       pen.         The                 p ol ic e m e n        obviously        didn't       realise at       this time the

                true      sit u a t i o n w i t h i n the                         pen and the        fact     that    the    people were        being

                seriously         crushed.

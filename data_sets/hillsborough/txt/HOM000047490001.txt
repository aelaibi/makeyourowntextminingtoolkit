i nesitate to add to your burdens. But

        a) could you or Mr Greenway please let me know when we will have a response to
           Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s letter of 13 October, about videos?

        b) could we have a copy of the exhibit lists for Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and the
           Inquests?

        c) we already have a copy from you of video C539, which consists o f extracts
           copied from video TB/2 showing scenes on the terraces shot from camera 5. I
           understand that the Coroners Inquest was videotaped, and that there is a tape in
           existence which shows C539 being played in its entirety to the jury. Can we
           have that tape o f the Inquest, please?

           I am a Detective Constable         presently stat^Bifed at Hammerton Rd Police

           Station.    Sheffield.

           At 9 am <0900)       on Saturday      ,h April     1989 (150489)    I commenced duty

           at Hammerton Rd Pol ijyr^Btat ion in connection with the FA Cup semi

           final football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at

           Hillsborough.        At 9.45 am (0945)        I attended the briefing a t ,the

           football stadium with ot h stf uniform and CID officers by Chief

           Superintendent Duckjmfield.    At about 11.30 am J 1130) I went with DS
            80                          So           S^bl
                   DS Sm/lh (F2) , DC Law   nee, DC L O ^ i y , DC Li^yfsay (F2) and DC

                  to the Leppings Ln end off the ground to take part in

           observations for a team of pick pockets.                During the corresponding

           fixture between the two sides          last year numerous thefts from the

           person had been reported at the Leppings Ln end of the ground and
                                                                                            ?
                                                                               S28S7

these reports had prompted the observations at the repeat fixture.                     DC

H a l Ijm    had in his rear trouser pot-^x a wallet alarm and my duties

together with the other CID officers was to keep observations on DC

H a 11am and obviously respond to any attempt to steal the wallet.

On taking up position outside the Leppings Ln turnstiles the situation

was quiet and the crowd sparse.             Uniform officers had taken up their

position on the tu rn st i1e s y m d      there were numerous officers under

the command of I n s p e c ^ f Sykes      <F 2 ) on duty in Leppings Ln itself

awaiting the arrival           of supporters   coaches.   At this stage the

Policing of the game was much the same as any other match, all the

serials were in their           correct positions   ready for a build up of

Liverpool supporters.

As the day progressed the crowd in Leppings Ln increased, DC Hal lam

wandered around the area outside the turnstiles and CID officers took

up positions           in and around the area trying to identify potential

o ff e n d e r s .

Uniform officers relayed reports of ticket touts which we gave

attention because           in the past pick pockets have operated where small

crowds have gathered around touts and on some occasions touts have,

acted as diversions for the thieves.             BetweEn 1 pm (JSSQQ) and j j r 5m

(1400)               crowd strengthened and there were nj      rous fans      hout

t i ctg^fs ’milling around'        the Leppings Ln end trying to buy ’s p a r e s . ’

During this time I went with DC Lawrence up Leppings Ln towards the

junction with Catchbar Ln in response to a call that touts were active

in that area.           We also followed DC Hallam down Leppings Ln to the fish

and chip shop at the end of Fielding Rd.              At this stage I began to

notice that many of the Liverpool supporters had been drinking

heavily.         Empty beer    cans littered the streets and many supporters

were boisterous.           However,   such an atmosphere was to be expected at

such a match and has been a common feature in previous big games
                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                            S2S57

involving other big clubs.                 Whilst I was stood in Leppings Ln near to

the fish and chip shop I was approached by many fans asking for

spares.       The fans without tickets were loitering outside the ground in

the hope of obtaining a ticket.

Because of the flow of supporters                    in Leppings Ln coming from Wadsley

Bridge our observations became centred around the area adjacent to the

’c o rn er ’ shop at the side of the Leppings Ln and in front of the metal

fences in front of the turnstiles.                      Whilst we were stood J m        this area

our group was constantly being                    ’moved o n ’ by of f i c e r s / p ja-d'rseback.    A

Merseyside mounted officer became prominent                        in keeping the crowd

moving,     frequently assisted by a female South Yorkshire Officer.                             At

some stage 1 also saw two Mounted Sergeants.   It became obvious that

congesj>fon a nd increasing             problems for the mounted officers.                 The

action of the mounted officers also disrupted our observations which

became     increasingly centred around a small area in front of the

fence beneath the large sign because of the large c ^ w d .                          By about

£.20    pm (1420)      the crowd^jwas                dense.      DS J^raloy reported seeing an

process.       Thi s man was wear i ng ' ' p a s s e s      and a dark co lourejl^shee psk i n

coat.     Most of the team began to keep a look out for these men who

were sus pected of pi ckjjfg po ckets as they followed the crowd in

towards the turnstiles.               At this stage hundreds of fans were still

outside the ground with no tickets.                      I was    constantly asked if I had

any spares and when a spare ticket did become available a crowd

would immediately gather around the seller as fans became desperate to

buy one.       I actually stood in front of one Liverpool                      supporter who was

trying to sell a spare ticket for £60.00.                         A number of fans declined

to buy the ticket because the price was too high.

At around 2.30 pm <1430)        I walked the length of Leppings Ln with DS

McSloy and DC Askew who had joined the team after dealing with a

prisoner at F.1 to look         for the suspects that DS McSloy had seen. I

noticed that the crowd in Leppings Ln was particularly dense                  in view

of the time and I remember thinking that many of the fans would not

get in for the start,

Whilst walking back along Leppiaffs Ln towards the ground PC

drove past in the Police Lajrotrover with the horn blaring,

towards the turnstiles       iJn Leppings Ln.        When we arrived back at our

original   positions PC B u x t o n ’s Landrover was       parked in the carriageway

at the edge of the large crowd trying to gain access to the ground.

The crowd ufas extremely dense and I remember            commenting to DCs AjfKew

and ya w o l n c e with whom I had worked numerous         previous matches    in

uniform at this location that the crowd appeared beyond control.

There were still thousands        of fans still walking to this area from

both ends of Leppings Ln and joining the packed mass of fans.                   The

fans walking down Leppings Ln from the direction of the Catchbar Ln

were singing and jostling and this section appeared to have been

drinking heavily.

There was no chance of gaining access to the crowd and our operation

was abandoned and with other CID officers I stood in the carriageway

watching the situation deteriorate.               The fans coming down Leppings Ln

had obviously just left public                     and they were f rust rated when

they saw the depth of the crtofad/ Me tween themselves and the turnstiles,

The time now was about 2.40 pjr (1440) and the mood of the crowd became

desperate as kick off a p p ^ a c h e d .       The frustration of the crowd
                                           y
turned to anger and several f^rf^ demanded that PC Buxton in his
                                  ft
Landrover and a unif o rmed^fnyjSector who I have never seej*'' before do

something to ease \ h e y i i t uat ion.       These officers dicj/%j*lfir best by

shouting to Liverpool      fans over the vehicle          1ou^gyeaker to stop

pushing because people were getting cpiMrfied at the front.             At this^,,

stage the re was no obvious fnapjxfwer available tp~ make any imprj

and totalizer 4 to form a line across the crowd to stem the flow of

fans       iving.    The mounted officers tried in vain to do as he

instructed but their efforts didn't seem to alleviate the situation.

By this time the crowd was so dense that the turnstiles or constables

on duty at them could not be seen and so it is possible that any

uniformed presence was lost to myself in the sea of f a n s .

PC Buxton gave the crowd assurances over the loudspeaker that the

matter would be resolved and that everyone would get inside.                  He kept

repeating that the Police were currently trying to 'sort the matter

out.'     Fans were still approaching the Landrover where we were

standing and pleading with PC Buxton and the uniform Inspector to

resolve the matter.        The crowd at this point was out of control and DC

Askew,    DC Lawrence and I made comments about the situation to this

effect.     Some fans ajrthe front of the crowd began cl irobinfl^jFffto the

wall above the^^furnst-irles to escape the crush.            SomeydT these people

were being haylea up onto the wall by I ns pectqj ^Be nne tt .

At a b o u t gyfe pm <1455)   there was a roar from the crowd inside the

stadi ujj/whi ch obviously signalled the arrival of one or both of the

teams.    This roar increased the desperation of the fans waiting to get

inside.     Around this time the situation appeared to ease.            An officer

began directing the crowd over the Landrover            loudspeaker to make their

way to a point between two of the horses where access to the ground

could be gained.       It seemed as though the problem had been resolved

although I did not know if a gate had been opened,              or if so, which

one.   With the situation now apparently under some sort of control                        I

then left the scene with other CID officers and walked along Vere Rd

which runs parallel         to the North Stand.          As we walked along the road

there seemed to be some sort of dispute involving residents                      in the

Of f i cers taking reports of cr im e. J ^ m l s t        in the gymnasium a report

came in that the pitch had been inv ad ed.                Chief    Inj^ec^er Beal   then

came   into the gym and instructed us to c 1ear Vnk area of tables and

chairs to make way for incoming fatalities.                  The area was cleared and

bodies began to arrive,           some on stretchers and some on advertising

boards.     Some of the bodies were in a state of undress.                   The bodies

were grey in colour and were obviously dead.                     However,   the first body

to arrive    in the gym was        in fact alive and this man was placed in the

recovery position while others were tended to.                     The bodies were placed

in lines and sheets of paper placed over their heads.                       Instructions

were given for each i?ody to be accompanied throughout,**#!^ proceedings

arrivao and each body was placed in a,/*fag with the relevant property

to await    identification.             When all the bodies had been placed in some

sort of order I went with Detective Inspector Towell and other

officers    plus relatives of the deceased back to Hammerton Rd Police

Station where I carried out duties involving friends and relatives of

the deceased persons.

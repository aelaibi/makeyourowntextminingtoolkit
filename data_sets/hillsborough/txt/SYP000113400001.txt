During        trie c o u r s e      of the          early          afternoon,             I remember             Police          Constable

time,       but    believe          that       this          occurred about                12.30          pm.        This       m a n was        in

his      early     twenties,             tall       and       slim wit h         blonde             hair.        The       officer          took

some       discussion          took       place          with a Sheffield                      Wednesday             Football          Club

           Police Sergeant 758 Morgan *F* Division


           At 9.45 ant on Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended at Hillsborough

           Football Stadium, Sheffield, in respect of the F.A. Cup semi-final

           between Liverpool        PC and   Nottingham   Forest   PC.     The pre-match

           briefing was to be held in the North Stand adjacent to the Spion

           Kop, but before attending that location I went into the gymnasium

           where I collected a radio, meal tickets and my briefing notes.



           I was in camand of Serial 18 consisting of myself and ten other

           police officers.     I met these on row 15 of the North Stand between

           seats 167 and 178 where I carried out a check of the personnel who

           were allocated to work with me.          All were present and the officers

           in question were Police Constable 2961 JENKINSON, Police Constable

           3118 CROOKES, Police Constable 782 HEMSWORTH, Police Constable 1171

           HORSFIELD, Police Constable 513 FRANCIS, Police Constable 159 MARSH,

           Police Constable 1834 SCHOLEY, Police Constable 320 BRADSHAW, Police

           Constable    2960 ALEXANDER and Police Constable 3342 BLOUNT.             The

           briefing was carried out by a number of senior officers including

           Chief   Superintendent       DUCKENFIELD,      Superintendent    MURRAY   and

           Inspector SEWELL who all spoke on a dedicated public address system

           to the assembled duty team.       A detailed briefing took place covering

           the general aspects of crowd safety and logistical arrangements.

           Further information about individual aspects of the two groups of

           visiting    supporters    and   their   behaviour was   given by Detective

           Sergeant CHARLESWORTH, Divisional Crime Intelligence Officer.



           I have served as a Sergeant at 'F' Division for eight years and five
                                                                          (2)

 months and have attended many such occasions.          I would estimate that

  I have performed duty at the ground at well in excess of 150

 football matches during my service,           including a number cf semi­

 finals.      I have been in charge of serials engaged on various duties

 in all parts of the ground and have an overall wide and varied

 experience of all aspects of crowd control at Hillsborough Stadium.

 There is no doubt in my mind that the system of crowd control which

 has evolved over many years at the ground, is one of the most

 efficient and well tried in the country.            There have been problems

 of public disorder which I can personally remember over the years,

 but we have always coped admirably.



After the initial briefing, I collected snack meals for my serial

 frcm the gymnasium, returned to the North Stand and distributed the

meals to my officers.         At this point I liaised with my Sector

Ccnmander, Inspector SYKES and arranged to rendevouz with him in the

enclosure behind the West Stand at 11.00 am for a further more

detailed    briefing by him,      regarding    the   specific duties of my

serial.     I instructed officers under my ccrnmand regarding their

conduct and individual roles during the forthcoming afternoon.



At 11.00 am as arranged, I went with my serial to the enclosure at

the rear of the West Stand, where I met Inspector SYKES.                 The

Officer spoke to members of his sector about the task in hand,

including     evacuation   procedures   and   their search duties at the

turnstiles.     My serial were responsible for turnstiles 9 to 16 of

entrances   'A' and 'C' which provide access to the North Stand and
•   .



                                                                                       (3)

         the West Stand.      Their brief was to ensure that spectators entering

         the ground did not possess items prohibited by the ground rules,

         suer, as weapons,       banners,   missiles and alcohol.          They were to

         maintain order, ensure orderly queues were formed and give advice

         ana assistance to spectators where possible.            A11 were provided with

         labels   and    black   plastic    bin   liners   for    property    which   they

        conriscated     and   plastic dustbins      were provided     at     each of the

        turnstiles      for this purpose.         I noted that there was a police

        property post located in a caravan in the enclosure behind the West

        Stand, together with other cabins for the sale of match prograirmes,

        souvenirs and refreshments.



        Officers of Serial 18 were retained in this area initially, on

        standby, prior to the build-up of supporters.             They were instructed

        on the appearance of the tickets which would be produced at that end

        of the ground, primarily brown coloured ones for the North Stand,

        red for the West Stand seats and purple for the West Stand terraces.

        They were deployed on their points at approximately 11.30 am and all

        the turnstiles were open by 12 noon.



        There was seme activity outside with early arrivals and I saw that

        Police horses were deployed on the Leppings Lane concourse.                     I

        remember tvro coaches and a double deck South Yorkshire bus arriving

        and being off-loaded.       This was apparently contrary to the planned

        reception arrangements, because visiting coaches were to be unloaded

        on Penistone Road North and Halifax Road.                Nevertheless, further

        coaches, vans and double-deck buses continued to arrive at Leppings
•   .




                                                                                                 (4)

         Lane throughout the early afternoon.



         I remember         seeing several people who vere the worst                      for drink

         arriving early at the ground.                  Many asked for directions to the

         nearest licensed premises, several were drinking frcm cans of lager

         and beer, others frcm large plastic bottles of beer.                           I personally

         advised a number of people that they would not be admitted to the

         ground if they were considered to be intoxicated.                        The activity of

         the    Leppings       Lane    concourse        became     busier   as     the    afternoon

        progressed.           There was a lot of confusion regarding tickets and

        entry     to    the    correct     part    of    the     ground.        I was    constantly

        questioned by people throughout the afternoon about this problem.



        The weather was fine and warm with bright sunshine.                             There was a

        happy carnival atmosphere at this stage.                      People were purchasing

        programmes frcm vendors outside and numerous people were eating and

        drinking       as    they milled     about.        I noticed that          there was     an

        inordinate volume of litter scattered about at various locations,

        consisting of food wrappers,               tins and empty bottles which people

        were discarding all over the area.                 Many people were standing about

        in groups waiting to meet friends and making no effort to enter the

        ground.     These were being continually dispersed by mounted and foot

        officers.



        During    the       course    of   the    early    afternoon,       I    remember    Police

        Constable 2902 ROBERTS arresting a ticket tout.                         I am not sure of

        the correct time, but believe that this occurred about 12.30 pm.

        This man was in his early twenties, tall and slim with blonde hair.

        The officer took him through concertina gate 'A' where he detained
•   .




                                                                                      (5)

         ana spoke to him.     I joined them there prior to the officer taking

         the man to the Police Roan.        I saw that PC ROBERTS had taken a large

         amount of money     frcm him and eleven or twelve tickets for the

         Liverpool end of the ground.          These were all the purple coloured

         ones    for the   terraces   and    seme   discussion    took   place with    a

         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club official in that vicinity, as to

         whether they were forgeries.          I returned to the turnstiles and

         rejoined my serial after about ten minutes.



         I witnessed several people having intoxicating liquor confiscated

         frar. them by Inspector SYKES and other officers.           These containers

         of alcohol were placed in the dustbins adjacent to the turnstiles.

        CID officers were present on the concourse on covert observations

         for pick-pockets.



        I was approached by numerous people asking for directions.             It was

        evident that several Liverpool supporters had acquired tickets for

        the Spion Kop terrace and were asking whether they would be adnitted

        there.    It was pointed out that a section of that end of the ground

        had been reserved for that eventuality.



        The volume of people entering the ground through the turnstiles

        which I was supervising was moderate          until   approximately 2.10 pm

        when I was called away temporarily.         At that time I was approached

        by an off-duty police officer frcm Lincolnshire Constabulary and

        three friends of his, two males and a female.            That officer stated

        that his wallet, containing £40.00 cash and four football tickets,

        had been stolen frcm his rear trouser pocket.            I informed Inspector

                                                                                       (6)

         SYKES about the incident and conducted the Lincolnshire Officer to

         the   gymnasium    in order that he could report the theft to CID

         personnel.      I waited at that location until this had been aone and

         then escorted him and his friends back to the rear of the West Stand

         where I gained them admission to the terraces.



         As I walked along the corridor beneath the North Stand, making my

         way back to the West Stand and turnstiles, I distinctly remember

        hearing a message on talk-through, made by Inspector SYKES.                  There

        was a lot of background noise, but I heard him ask for more men to

        be sent to lappings Lane urgently.              I only heard the message being

        passed    once    and   there    was    other    radio   traffic   being    passed

        constantly at that tune.           I had changed my radio battery in the

        gymnasium vdiilst I was there, because I was having trouble receiving

        the signals frcm Police Control.                I believe there was a fault,

        because   I   noted     that    whenever    they   tried   to   use   the   radio

        themselves, the transmission was broken and the operator's voice was

        spasmodic.    Messages frcm officers on the ground were loud and clear

        on the talk-through         facility.      At about the same time as this

        message was      passed,    I saw Inspector WHITE and another officer

        escorting a prisoner along the corridor which I was using, back

        towards the Police Rocm and I acknowledged the officers.



        On arrival back there, at about 2.30 pm, I was confronted with an

        alarming situation.        The crowd had obviously built up and there was

        serious congestion outside the turnstiles.               I saw several youths

        climbing over the walls          into the enclosure and this was a new
                                                                     (7)

 experience which I had never before seen.         Police officers were

 attempting to discourage this and attempting to remove them frcm the

 vails.   I looked through the turnstile gates 'A' to 'G' of entrance

'B 'where I saw a crush of people outside.      Many were distressed and

 shouting for assistance.     They were screaming for help and many

 appeared to be injured, amongst them women and teenage youths.        I

 climbed onto one turnstile gate and encouraged them not to pash.      I

 remember youths having their legs pushed with considerable force

against the bars of the turnstiles and they were obviously in great

pain.     There was a pandemonium of noise and together with other

officers, amongst whom was Inspector BENNETT, I attempted to calm

the situation inside the enclosure.   I was approached by several men

who were clearly angry, they began to jostle me and grabbed hold of

my uniform anorak shouting into my face, "Do something, people are

getting crushed out there.   Qpen the gates."    As they spoke I became

aware of the concertina gate to my left being opened by stewards.

This was gate    'C1, I believe, around the side of the enclosure,

immediately adjacent to the car park driveway and river.     There were

a couple of horses outside who were attempting to regulate the flow

of people through the gate.     However, there was a sudden flow of

people being pushed through the opening.      The mood of these people

appeared to be quite aggressive and it was obvious that many were

intoxicated.   I could smell drink on their breath.     I stood in their

path and attempted to push in the opposite direction, shouting for

order and discouraging their headlong surge but without success.       I

was thrown aside and saw several people lose their feet, being

trampled by the crowd.   I do not recall any injured being left in

that location after the surge had subsided.     This was not a dramatic

influx of people but I believe no more than 200 entered at this time.

                                                                                           (8)


         I forced my way outside after the initial onslaught, where I joined

         colleagues by the side of turnstiles at entrance B.



         There was an extremely large crowd of people, densely packed into

         the area in front of the turnstiles.          I would estimate in excess of

         4,000.    This area is enclosed by railings and gates at the entrance,

         a sheet steel fence and concertina gate 'B' on the left, turnstile

        walls in front and a continuous steel bar on the right with supports

        spaced     at   regular    intervals   along   its     length.         Together with

        Inspector WHITE and Inspector PURDY, I went to the side of this bar

        and    began    pulling    people   underneath    in    order     to    relieve    the

        pressure.       I also saw Inspector DELANEY at that location.              Ke moved

        dozens of people in this manner, pushing them under the bar by their

        heads.     Women and youths in considerable distress were pulled from

        the crowd.       Some men resisted our attempts to rescue them, fearing

        that they would lose their places in the crowd and be denied entry.

        Many     were   the   worse   for   drink   and   unruly,        failing    to    obey

        instructions not to push.



        As the people repeatedly surged forwards, chanting and shouting, I

        heard cries of pain as people were crushed against the bar and walls

        of the turnstiles.        Mounted officers in the middle of this were just

        pushed about in the throng.         At one stage I saw a horse go down at

        the back end, obviously lifted from its feet by the pressure of

        bodies.     There was a very real danger of serious injury or even

        death being caused in this area.



        I recall that youths continued to climb the walls and fences, over

        into the enclosure at the back of the West Stand and at this stage I

                                                                                          (9)

         also saw Inspector BENNETT on top of one of the turnstile walls,

         trying to prevent this practice.



         I saw concertina gate          'B' being opened and after the number of

        people had built up on the driveway where I was standing, together

        with other officers I took these people through concertina gate *C'

        which was opened a second time.                I must point out that people

        appeared to be         aggressive    and    in a    state   of     haste,   obviously

        concerned that the game was about to start before they were able to

        gain entry.         I am quite satisfied that the decision to open the

        gates in order to ease the congestion outside was soundly based and

        was necessary in the circumstances.               There was imninent danger of

        serious injury to supporters throughout that time.



        As the crush of people dispersed, there was a lull in the situation

        outside and        I was able to rejoin officers             of my serial.        The

        majority of        these were distressed and hadobviously been                crushed

        against the turnstile walls            themselves by        the sudden influx of

        supporters.        There was still a great many people standing in groups

        in lappings        Lane on the bridge and at various positions                on the

        concourse.         A lot of these looked dejected as though they were

        resigned to missing the game.



        Suddenly I heard a radio message being passed by Police Control,

        which was repeated several times.             The voice on the radio was that

        of Police Sergeant GODDARD and fran his tone I gained the impression

        that   he    vas    upset    about   something.       He    said    "All    available

        assistance    onto     the   perimeter     track.    People      are   invading the

        pitch” .    I believe he repeated this message several times.
                                                                                        (10)
 I     immediately elerted members of my serial, who were all present and

 together outside the turnstiles where they had been working.                   We all ran

 inside through one of the turnstiles and made our way round to the gate

 at the rear of the Police Control Box.            I   remember     that    a    rran    had

 climbed onto this gate and he was pulled down bodily to facilitate the

opening of the gate.            He caught the sleeve of the denim jacket which he

wore, on one of the spiked railings and damaged the material, at which

point     he    began     canplaining vehemently.        He was pushed aside and

together with the other police officers, I ran down the first gangway of

the South Stand open seated section on my left.                    As I did so, I saw

Superintendent MURRAY walking towards m e . His face was ashen and he was

obviously deeply shocked, he said "Do what you can".                   I made may way

over     the   wall     onto the perimeter track in front of Leppings Lane

terraces.        I witnessed an horrific scene/ which I shall never forget.

People v^re being pressed up bodily against the netting of the pen fence

at this location.          The pen was bulging under the pressure which was

being exerted by the crush.               I could see wanen and male youths with

their eyes open, tongues extended through their mouths, their skin was

cyanosed and there were blue coloured arms, faces and necks, pressed

against the netting.        Sane had blood seeping frcm their mouths and noses

which were bubbling with mucus.             Officers were frantic in their efforts

to pull people over the fence and I saw several people escaping by this

means.     Others vrere being pulled onto the track through a small gate in

the fence.        I saw people climbing up into the West Stand seated area

above the central pen.            It was obvious to me that the people pressed

against the fence at this particular section were, in the majority of

cases,    already deceased.          Although     they apparently appeared to be

standing       against    the    fence,   their   position   was    being   maintained
•   .




                                                                                 (11)

        upright by the unrelenting pressure of the spectators behind then.

        There were numerous police officers gathered on the pitch and

        track.      Sane viere giving first aid others attempting to rescue

        spectators.        I saw sane spectators climbing over the dividing

        railings into the adjacent pens or being pulled over bodily by

        other people.      There was panic and utter chaos at that end of the

        ground.     There did not appear to be any sort of organised police

        effort.     Many officers were working on their cwn initiative.



        I remained there only a few seconds and during that time lost

        contact with members of my serial,           the majority of whcm were

        busying themselves tending the injured.         I quickly realised that I

        would be able to achieve very little if I remained on the track.

        A lot of officers were standing looking at the scene in stunned

        disbelief and I attempted to motivate sane of them.              I approached

        several and ordered them to follow me.                Roughly six or seven

        responded, although it was difficult to canmunicate above the din.

        I noted that the main crush was in the southern section of the

        central pen and I decided to enter that pen frcm the tunnel at the

        rear, in an effort to disperse the fans by that route.            I ran back

        the way      I had come and went immediately to the rear of the West

        Stand.       I saw that it was practically deserted in the enclosure

        behind the Stand at     this time and I entered the tunnel which runs

        beneath      the   Stand giving   access   to   the    central   pen   of the

        terraces.    The situation was calm inside the tunnel and there was

        no egress of people.      The ones at the back were not pushing, but

        merely trying to look over the tops of heads in front.                  Three

        police    officers were   standing at      the back of the crowd,         two

females and a male, who were totally unaware of the incident in

progress.         I shouted for them to begin evacuation as a means of

relieving the pressure on the bodies at the front.                I said "T'r.ere

are dead bodies in there".              I entered the crowd to the right of

the central dividing railings and began moving individuals beck,

down the tunnel behind.              I was obliged to grab each person and

haul them backwards,          just shouting "Get out" to each one as I

progressed towards          the    front.     Many vrere in deep      shock and

resisted me, pulling away and refusing to co-operate.                  The crowd

was not densely           packed and I was able to move quite freely.            A

large number were the worst for drink.                  I was kicked about the

legs, punched to the body and spat upon during this period of

tune.      I remember liquid being poured frcm the West Stand above

me, being showered about.             I continued to move forwards and was

aware of the other officers supporting me, also struggling with

the     crowd.      Among these were PC         1171 HORSEFIELD,      who    I saw

immediately behind me.            A number of young men were aggressive and

I remember        several    shouting    "Murderers"    and canments    such as

"You've got this one wrong you bastards", and "You've caused all

this,     it's     your    fault".      I    remember   seeing   Superintendent

GREENWOOD standing on the hoardings on the perimeter track with a

loud hailer, shouting for people to move back and giving a pushing

motion towards me with his hands over the top of the fence.



I eventually reached the front where I saw several supporters

tending     the    dead     and   injured.      I was    asked   to   help    cany

individuals by these people.            I heard shouts of "Cane on mate this

kid's dying.       Help him" and "Give us a hand here.           Do something".
                                                                            (13)

I saw a pile of bodies             lying waist deep at the bottom of the

terrace steps       against the wall. Three        or four people still alive

were trapped up to their hips in bodies.            I spent a long time with

spectators trying to free these people;            without success at first.

There was vonit and mucus in people's hair and on their clothing,

there   were    shoes,    coats,    money,    Liverpool   scarves,   hats   and

paraphernalia       scattered all around.          I gave heart massage and

mouth-to-mouth to two or           three people    on the steps, but cannot

remember any description or other details of them.             There were so

many in need of help, I felt so utterly inadequate.              I persisted

in pulling the limbs of dead and dying males and females fran the

pile,   but    it   was   just   like   tangled,    slippery   spaghetti and

difficult to get any sort of purchase.            Other police officers were

by this time climbing through the small gate, over the bodies, to

get inside.



I remember being joined by Inspector WOODWARD and others whose

identities I cannot remember.           I must emphasise that the actions

of many spectators was very heroic and sensible.                Several made

carmendable efforts to resuscitate casualties and carried the dead

and injured away.



I was concerned about one young boy with blonde hair, aged about

10   years, who was lying with his face pressed against the wall,

but who showed signs of life.                I tried to work him free and

cradled his head in my hands to prevent him grazing his face on

the wall.     He seemed to be breathing but only with shallow panting

breaths, ailthough his skin was still pink in colour.
                                                                   (14)

I tugged at belts, clothing, arms and any other -places where I

could get a firm grip.        I was assisted by other police officers

and civilians.      The bodies began caning free and I carried three

or four back down the tunnel into the rear enclosure with other

policemen.   I also carried injured back there.        I left them to

return to the terrace as there was much work to be done.         There

was a lot of jostling and confusion and I lost my footing on the

steps, tripping over people and being pushed.



As time passed there was sane success in breaking down the fence

behind   the goal    to the   left of the pile of bodies.       Police

personnel and civilians did this by kicking and pulling the wire

fran its supports.     As this opening appeared, bodies were handed

out to others on the track, with a canment as to whether I thought

they were alive or dead.        Several times I repeated "This one's

alive", "This one's dead".      I finally managed to free the 10 year

old bcr,’ and passed him through the hole.     I remember shouting to

the person I handed him to "This one's still alive".            I lost

contact with him after that.        I remember sweating and my mouth

being very   dry.     The clothing under my anorak was wet with

perspiration.



I saw an ambulance drive        round the perimeter track frcm the

direction of the gymnasium and stop on the pitch near the goal

posts at the Leppings Lane end.



Eventually the bodies wsre cleared fran the terrace and I climbed

out through the hole, where I began tending     to   people   who were
                                                                             (15)

 laying on the grass.          I attempted mouth-to-mouth and heart massage

with sane of the bodies, but without any success.                     I did not

persist with any particular one but went fran one to the other

trying to help other police officers.                   I assisted in loading

hoardings       vtfiich were    being    used as makeshift     stretchers.     I

carried three or four bodies fran that end of the field to the

other     end   where    I     laid them on the       grass   to be   tended by

ambulancemen       and firemen.         I remember one of these was a boy of

about 12 years but I cannot describe any of the people whan I

carried.



I remember several Liverpool supporters on the pitch were still

aggressive and abusive, passing canments such as "You've killed

these people".          Their aggression was also directed towards the

Nottingham Forest crowd.              Looking round the ground I saw a large

number of men and youths running towards the Spion Kop shouting

and swearing.        Others I saw climbing into the North and South

Stands off the pitch, where sporadic fighting broke out amongst

supporters.       For this reason I believe that a cordon of police

officers was formed on the half-way line by Chief Superintendent

Nesbit.



There appeared to be a lull in the activity on the field for a

short time.       I had a drink fran the groundsman who was carrying a

bucket    of water as my throat was so dry and I was sweating

profusely.       I remember speaking to Detective Constable CLARKE on

the pitch.      I also spoke to and tended a number of individuals who

were   wandering about          the    field   in a   dazed condition,   mostly

Liverpool supporters.           I put my arms around sane of them in an
                                                                          U6)

 effort to canfort them.



 I was approached by a man who identified himself as an off-duty

 police officer from Merseyside.       My recollection of his appearance

 is very poor but he said he had lost his brother (who was also an

off-duty Merseyside policeman) on the terraces.            He was extremely

worried.     I escorted him to the gymnasium.          This was, by now,

being used as a temporary mortuary.         I asked him to remain outside

whilst I went inside to make enquiries on his behalf.                    I saw

several bodies of deceased people being laid out on the floor.              It

was obvious to me that I would not be able to obtain any positive

information about his brother at this stage.          I went back to him,

explained the situation and I then obtained a hot drink for him

and sat with him for a while.



I then began to assist loading injured people from boards onto

proper cots which I carried and wheeled with ambulancemen.              I also

assisted several walking patients to the emergency vehicles which

were arriving at the scene continually.



There was a debrief in the North Stand, where I joined my serial.

I   gave   them   instructions   on   the   compilation    of   their    notes

regarding the incident and then completed my debriefing sheet

which I handed to Chief Inspector BEAL.        We were then stood down.



I remember going back to the          gymnasium and assisting several

officers with their duties.      These included PC 420 Davies, PC 1171

Horsfield, DC 1531 Pont, DC 1212 Goulding.            This concerned the

handling   of     the   corpses, loading     them   into   body   bags    and

afternoon,            I madefrequent                 excursions            around        the      ground,          ensuring

I must        stress         that     the      officers        performing              duty       on    serial             1 were

vastly        experienced             and      totally       familiar            with      their        role          at    major

football         matches.             The      majority        ha d     worked         this       detail          for       a gr eat

many     years        arid w e r e       fully       conversant            with     crowd         control             procedures           at

Hillsborough               Stadium,

Throughout            pha s e      S my       role    was    to    stand         in the m o u t h            of       the    players

tunnel,          beneath        the      S ou th Stand,           preventing             access         by    unauthorised

people        preserving            security          of    the    playing          staff,         coaching                staff,

play.         In this         situation,             I would       signal         to     other         officers             on    the

track      to     stand       and     face      the     crowd      from       the      seated          position             they

particularly              relevant            during             the     1 98 8    semi-final,              because       I remember

that       due    to     previous            misbehaviour                   by B r i a n C L O U G H ,       he w as -ordered                 by

the    Football           Association,                   not      to     sit      in the        ’d u g - o u t 9 d u r i n g    the

game,       but       t o .pos it in h i m s e l f               in the S o u t h          Stand       seats.        This

arrangement              caused a            lot       of    fuss        amongst         the     crowd w h en        he      appeared

from       the    dressing           r o o m at          the      beginning           of    the       match.        There       was       some

jeering          by L i v e r p o o l        supporters                and     cheering          by N o t t i n g h a m      Forest

fans,       which        was     all        very       light-hearted                and     good       humoured.             I recall

that       I had       some      difficulty                 controlling             the     r u s h of       photog-raphers               from

newspapers             and     television,                  who     were       eager       to    record       the    phenomenon.

Another          incident         which           I remember                quite     v i v i d l y was       the    ejection             of

two N o t t i n g h a m        Forest         supporters                 sitting         behind        the    Liverpool            ''dug-

o u t 5.     They       were       being          abusive           towards         Kenny        DALGLISH          whenever          he

stood       to    give        instructions                  from       the     sidelines.              Their       terms       of a b u s e

related          to    the     possibility                  of    people          having        sexual       relations          with        his

wife,       whilst        he wa s           watching             the     game.        I caused          Officers          in the

South Stand              to    eject         them        from       the      ground.,       but       they    re g ai ne d        eni/ry

lat e r     and       were     promptly arrested                         for      public        order       offences.

During       the       course        of      the       m at c h ,      whenever          the     b l ac k    Liverpool          player,

John       BARNES,        was      in       possession              of      the    ball,        there       were    loud       sounds

similar          to    those       made       by a n ape,                from      certain         individuals            amongst           the

Nottingham             Forest        supporters                  on the        S p i o n Hop.          This    was     accompanied

by    the    waving           of a      giant          inflatable              banana.           I considered.this                   to     ae

extremely             offensive             and    decided             to    stop     it.        I therefore           walked          to

the    K.o p e n d       of    the      ground and                entered          the     crowd,       recovering             the    giant

JOHN MORGAN

Police Sergeant 758

'F1 Division

South Yorkshire Police



Further to the evidence which I provided concerning my part in the events

of Saturday 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, I

have been instructed to document my recollections of the 1988 F.A. Cup

Semi-Final.



This event took place at the same ground on Saturday 9 April 1988 between

Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football Club.                 My memories

of the match and the Police Operation on the day are extremely vague, due

primarily to the fact that nothing remarkable happened.



I reported for duty at the ground at 9.45 am and a formal briefing was

held   in the North Stand.           Chief Superintendent MOLE was           in overall

command,    but     my   recollection   of    the   various    Sector    Carmanders    and

structure     of the Police         Operation is indistinct. I was in charge of

Serial 1,     the perimetertrack detail, the great majority of                whom were

Community     Constables     from    'Fl'    Sub-Division.       I believe    my   Sector

Carmander     was    Inspector   HOWLAND, although      I     have not   consulted    the

Operational Order.         The identities of the individual Police Constables

under my canmand,        together with their respective positions around the

perimeter track, are likewise unknown to me.



Serial 1 were deployed to their positions at 10.30 am and remained in

position throughout the three phases of the match.              Officers were released
                                                                                         (2)


at intervals throughout the event in order to take refreshments.                   Phase 1

comprised of the build-up preceding the actual game of football until 5

minutes after kick-off; phase 2 consisted of the game until 1 0 minutes

before the final whistle and phase 3 thereafter until crowd dispersal had

been achieved.



During the course of phase 1 of the Operation, I ensured that Officers

under my coranand were sufficiently aware of their responsibilities with

regard to crowd behaviour.        I confirmed that they were spaced equidistant

around the perimeter track and, during the course of the afternoon, I made

frequent   excursions   around     the     ground,   ensuring   that      there   were   no

operational difficulties.



I must stress that the officers performing duty on serial 1 were vastly

experienced    and   totally    familiar    with     their   role   at   major    football

matches.   The majority had worked this detail for a great many years and

were   fully   conversant   with    crowd    control    procedures       at   Hillsborough

Stadium.



Throughout phase 2 my role was to stand in the mouth of the players

tunnel, beneath the South Stand, preventing access by unauthorised people,

preserving security of the playing staff, coaching staff, management of

the two opposing teams, and the officials who were refereeing.                  Part of my

duties concerned supervision of the track serial regarding their response

to a stoppage or interruption of play.             In this situation, I would signal

to other officers on the track to stand and face the crowd from the seated

position they    normally      occupied,    by merely walking        forward onto the

perimeter track frcm the mouth of the players tunnel.

I was present also, to discourage disorderly behaviour by players and

management   who   occupy   the   'dug-outs'   during   the   match.   This   was

particularly relevant during the 1988 semi-final, because I remember that

due to previous misbehaviour by Brian CLOUGH, he was ordered by the

Football Association, not to sit in the 'dug-out' during the game, but to

position himself in the South Stand seats.       This arrangement caused a lot

of fuss amongst the crowd when he appeared frcm the dressing rocm at the

beginning of the match.      There was seme jeering by Liverpool supporters

and cheering by Nottingham Forest fans, which was all very light-hearted

and good humoured.     I recall that I had sane difficulty controlling the

rush of photographers frcm newspapers and television, who were eager to

record the phenomenon.



Another incident which I remember quite vividly was the ejection of two

Nottingham Forest supporters sitting behind the Liverpool 'dug-out'.          They

were being abusive towards Kenny DALGLISH whenever he             stood to give

instructions frcm the sidelines.        Their terms of abuse related to the

possibility of people having sexual relations with his wife, whilst he was

watching the game.     I caused Officers in the South Stand to eject them

frcm the ground, but they re-gained entry later and were promptly arrested

for public order offences.



During the course of the match, whenever the black Liverpool player, John

BARNES, was in possession of the ball, there were loud sounds similar to

those made by an ape, frcm certain individuals amongst the Nottingham

Forest supporters on the Spion Kop.      This was accompanied by the waving of

a giant inflatable banana.        I considered this to be extremely offensive
                                                                         (4)


and decided to stop it.     I therefore walked to the Kop end of the ground

and entered the crowd, recovering the giant banana frcm the terrace steps.

I removed it to the gymnasium where it v®s dealt with as found property.

As I walked along the track, there was a great deal of booing, whistling

and derogatory remarks by the entire crowd.    A photograph was taken by the

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club photographer, Mr ELLIS, which later

appeared in the Fruit Traders Magazine.



The only other incident which gave cause for concern was at the end of the

game, as players were leaving the pitch.      There was an invasion by large

numbers of Liverpool fans frcm the North Stand and Leppings Lane terraces.

Reserve officers frcm other serials had been deployed in the players

tunnel and various strategic points around the perimeter track, to deal

with this eventuality.    Together with members of my serial, I was involved

with sweeping the pitch clear of supporters and encouraging players and

management from Liverpool to leave the field of play.    They were intent on

receiving the accolades of the crowd and were causing seme hostility, but

this problem was resolved successfully without any serious public order

problem.



During the 1988 semi-final I was not aware of any overcrowding on the

terraces and find myself unable to ccmment about the behaviour of fans

seeking entry prior to the match.     I am aware that several arrests were

made at the event and that there was drunkenness.    I did not have cause to

visit the Leppings Lane terraces, the West Stand, or any of the concourse

leading to this area of the ground during the day.    I am unable to offer

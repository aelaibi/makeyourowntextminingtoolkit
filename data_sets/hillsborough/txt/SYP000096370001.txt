I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present

stationed at Deepcar.



During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.



My duties consist of working in the video room in company with the

Chief Security Officer, Mr. LOCK.



The video room is situated near to the Players' Entrance on the

South Stand of the ground.



In this room there are 20 T.V. monitors which are covered by

cameras which are strategically placed around the ground to cover

all 95 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be

operated by a switch which will operate and show any view by the

cameras from the main Police control point situated between the

West and South Stands.   There is also a computer which shows all

 95 turnstiles and can tell at anytime during a match how many

persons have passed through     each turnstile at any given point.

 Each section of the ground for example the Spion Kop it will give

 a figure showing the exact number of people in that area of the

 around.   These figures for that section of the ground are then

 added up to give a grand total at the end.    The computer scans all

 the turnstiles and takes approximately 2^ seconds.



 On Saturday, 15 April 1989, X was on duty for the Semi Final between

 Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10.00 a.m.
                                                                   .2 .


that date.    At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open

I switched all video recorders on to record all the fans as they

were entering the ground via the turnstiles.



During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m.

I noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the

turnstiles.    I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it

to be between 25,000 and 30,000.



At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers

the Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people

in the streets, and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000

plus, and when each area of the ground gets near to capacity the

totals start to pulsate, the total capacity for that area of the

ground being 21,000, which told me that nearly all the Nottingham

supporters were in the ground and it was near to full capacity.



I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of

fans in that area.    I could see that the fans were spread from the

turnstile entrance right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking

the road.     I would estimate that there would be between 3,000 and

5,000 fans.     I made a check of the computer and saw that the

figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to

capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of

7,000, which would be near to capacity and the computer would be at a

point ready to start pulsating.     The figures on the computer start

to pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get
in that there would not be sufficient room for all to be

accommodated.   As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd

getting larger and many at the back of the crowd were surging

forward pushing violently towards the turnstiles.   From that point

I could also see Police Officers trying to get the crowd into some

sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the

way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police.     A

large contingent of the fans were climbing onto the backs of others

and climbing the walls over the top of the turnstiles;     they were

landing onto the asbestos roofs on the inside of the ground and

jumping onto people who were on the inside of the ground to break

their fall as they landed.



On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being

pushed on his horse down towards a large double door which leads

into the rear of the West Stand.



During all this I could hear several officers including Superinten­

dent Marshall requesting further assistance in that area, for the double

doors to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a

major incident outside, also for the match to be delayed for a

 further 15 minutes.



 At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South

 side of Leppincrs Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000

 fans run into the ground.   Within a minute of this happening I

 noticed that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane

 open and again about 1,000 fans run into the ground.    I could tell

 from the noises on the radios from the officers in that area that the
                                                                  .4.

Liverpool•fans were very boisterous and excited, and appeared

to be heavily intoxicated with drink.



I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered

the area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation

was getting out of hand and people were being pushed up against the

fencing on the perimeter of the ground.



I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area

of the ground to assist with the injured and dying.



By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players'

Entrance area of the ground and I assisted in treating people in

that area and arranging for ambulances to be directed in that area

to ferry the injured to hospital.



I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the

Police personal radios were working very well, but during the day

there appeared to be seme distortion, and some messages could not

be read cleanly.



 I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of

 this major incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at

 the match too late and being under the influence of drink and trying

 to enter the ground without tickets.     It was obvious that looking

 at the crowd outside the ground prior to kick off there were several

 thousands that were attempting to enter without tickets at all cost

 to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside the ground.

HAROLD GUEST




Police Constable 1421



I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

 area than the regulations set.   If there are to inform control to arrange

 for- turnstiles to be closed and Tor the persons outside the ground to be

 moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

 This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

 are not known in advance.

 On a ticket match this rolE be'comes a watching brief with the main

 concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

 The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

 Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.    Any

 problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock
   &
       and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

 to the control room.

 in this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

 which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

  turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

  switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the m a m

Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.           There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There    are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there    is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.     The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

 date.   At about   12.45pm after the turnstiles were open 1 switched all

 video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

 via the turnstiles.

 During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

 noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow m     arriving at the turnstiles.

 I an* not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 2 p ,000 and

 30,OO U .

 At 2 . 40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in the~;

 streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus.A When

 each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

  the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

  that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

  near to full capacity.

  I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

  the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that

area.   I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.      I would estimate

that there would be between 3,000 and 5.000 fans.      I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,       The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.     From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

 get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

 side out of the way.    I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

 Police.   A large contingent of the fans were d i m Ding the walls over the

 top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

 inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.

 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

 the West Stand.

  During all this 1 '■’ould hear several officers including superintendent

  Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

  to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

  outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

  At this point 1 noticed that a large door situated on the South Side of

  Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

  the ground.    I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

  in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

   nneared to be heavily intoxicated witu drink.

I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the

area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting

out of hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the

perimeter of the ground.                                         -u/i..

At                     I tried to use my personal radio in order to contact Police
                   A
Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use i t .

I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

through.          At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

 organise some safety measures with the security personel.

 Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

 he is the person who installed all the videos and computer system.

 As he could also see what was taking place he also left the room in order

 to assist in any way he could.

 I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of

 the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

 Bv this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

 the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

 for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured lo

 hospital.

  I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

     personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

     to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

     I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

     incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

     and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground

wj thnijt tickets.    It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident           I wastrying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio       network butdid        not listento whatwas being

transmitted on the       back to back radio system owned by theclub,         as I knew

Mr Lock would deal       with any situation that had developed.

After the incident       I made a note of all the people that hadentered the

ground as shown on       the computer and they are as follows

Spion Kop                                      19,906

North Stand                                     8,109

 South Stand   Covered                          4,740

 South Stand Uncovered                          3,255

 Leppings Lane                         7 >°38

 West Stand                                     5,ol8

                     TOTAL.                    48,666

 These numbers v*ould not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

 entering the ground due tc the gates being opened and several hundreds

 entering the ground without tickets and trying uo gain access,              bj r   any

 means.

                                        Harold GUEST, Police Constable 1421
Continuation of statem e n t of
 On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between Liverppol
 and Nottingham Forest, and corrmenced my duties at 10.00 a.m. that date.....
 At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open I switched all. video
 recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground yia.
 the turnstiles.
 During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p-rn. I ncoticed
 that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.                                               I am n<ot
 sure of the size of the crowd butbelieye it to be between 25.,000 and 30,000.
 At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera * i c h covers the....
 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in the streets,
 and on checking the computer it was, shcowing 19,000 plus( and yiien each area
 of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate, the total
 capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, v^ich told ne that nearly
 all the Nottingham supporters ^re. in the ground and it .was near to .full-
 capacity. .................................................................
 I then switched to the camera that was mvering the Leppings. Lane end of .the
 ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in. that .area.
  I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance right back
  into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.                                     I would estimate that there
 would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.                                 I made a check cof the computer and
  saw that the figures for the West. Stand were pulsating and showing near.to
  capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures.were showing in excess of 7,000,
  which would be near to capacity and the cpmputer would be at, a point ready
  to start pulsating.               The figures on the ccomputer; start to pulsate, when .the
  capacities get to within 15% of the total..................................
  It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to..get in, that
  there would not be sufficient room for all to be acconmodated.                                              As .1 lopked.
  at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and.many at the back cof
  the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the turnstiles. ...
  From that ppint I could also see Police Officers trying.to.get. the crowd... .
  into some sort of order but .they;w e r e being pushed to .one. side, .out of .the. way.
  I saw several missiles being thrown towards the. Police.                                             A large contingent,
  of the fans were climbing <onto the backs cof. pthers and .climbing, the .walls. ..
  over the top of the turnstiles;                          they were landing onto the asbestos .roofs..
  on the inside of the ground m d jibing pnto people ^ o v^re. on the inside, of

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.
 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being pushed on
 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of the
 West Stand.
 During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent
 MARSHALL requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors
 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident
 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.
 At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South side of
 Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into the
 ground.       Within a minute of this happening I noticed that the large doors
 of the North side of Leppings Lane open and again about 1,000 fans run into
 the ground.         I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers in
 that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and
 appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
  I then turned to the camera that was ins ide the ground and covered the area
 of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting out of
 hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the perimeter of
  the ground.
  I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area pf the
  ground to assist with the injured and dying.
  By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players1 Entrance area
  of the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging
  for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to hospital.
  I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police
  personal radios were working very well, but during the day there appeared to
  be some distortion, and some messages could not be read clearly.
  I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of this major
  incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too.late.and
  being under the influence of drink and.trying to enter the ground without,
  tickets.       It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the ground prior
  to kick off there were several thousands that were attempting to enter with­
  out tickets at all cost to the safety of other; Liverpool supporters inside
  the ground.
  During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

HAROLD GUEST



Police Constable 1421




I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in    the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

area than the regulations set.     If there are to inform control to arrange

for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

are not known in advance.

On a ticket match this rolfiJ becomes a watching brief with the main

concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

The video room is situated near    to the players entrance on the South

Stand.   My duties are to liaise   with the club and the Police.   Any

problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock
  &
      and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

to the control room.

In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

turnstiles.    There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the main
                                  - 2 -




Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.         There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.      The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

date.     At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

via the turnstiles.

During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

3 0 ,0 0 0 .

At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in the-,

 streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 p l u s W h e n

 each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

 the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

 that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

 near to full capacity.

 I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

 the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that




                                                                              (

area.   I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.    I would estimate

that there would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.    I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,    The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15$ of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.    From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

side out of the way.    I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

Police.   A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

the ground to break their fall as they landed.

On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

the West Stand.

During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

At this point I noticed that a large door situated on the South Side of

 Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

 the ground.   I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

 in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

 appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.                             ---



                                                                          (

I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the

area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting

out of hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the

perimeter of the ground.                                                 /

At fete4r» -
           p oint- I tried to use mypersonal radio in      order to contactPolice
                A
Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use i t .

I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

through.      At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

organise some safety measures with the security personel.

Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

he is the person who           installed all the videos and computer system.

As he could also see           what was taking place healso left the room in    order

to assist in any way he could.

I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of

the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

 for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

hospital.

 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

 personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

 to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

 I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

 incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

 and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground




                                                                                  (

without tickets.     It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the      back to back radio system owned by theclub,   asI knew

Mr Lock would deal      with any situation that had developed.

After the incident      I made a note of all the people that hadentered the

ground as shown on      the computer and they are as follows

Spion Kop                             19,906

North Stand                            8,109

South Stand   Covered                  4,740

South Stand   Uncovered                3,255

Leppings Lane                          7,038

West Stand                             5,618

                   TOTAL              48,666

These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

means.

                                    W ILL STATE


My      date of birth is                                      |   1Presently Chief                     of
Security           with        Sheffield       Wednesday Football              Club        at     their
ground        at        Hillsborough.             My     employment       in        that post          is
part-time           and my main duties are on match days, but X .work on
a     part-time basis through                     thewhole year - not just                  confined
to the football season.


 My main career was in the Police Force f o r .some 30 years until
 I     retired           on    28th     February,         1985.     At    the            time    of    my
 retirement              I    had     the rank of Superintendent,                   in     the    South
 Yorkshire Police Force and I was promoted to Superintendent in
 about         1979/80              after     spending      one    year        as         an     Acting
 Superintendent.


 r     was     based at Hammerton Road Police Station, working in                                      FI
 Sub- D i v i s i o n         which    covers          the northern area            of     Sheffield,
  including          Hillsborough.             From Football Season 1982/3 until                         I
  retired           I        was,     under    the       direct   command           of     the    Chief
  Superintendent,               in charge of policing the Hillsborough Ground.
  For       the 3 seasons that I was the Superintendent in charge                                       of
  policing          the        Hillsborough Ground the Club had 1 year in                              the
    Second      Division,             1 year when they were promoted from                        Second
    Division to First Division,                    and then in 1984/5 a season in the
    First     Division.               During this period there were matches                           with
     some very big crowds, for even in the first of those years the
     Club    was        contending          for    promotion to       the       First           Division
     although ultimately it did not succeed in that year.

During     that        spell       Inspector Clive Calvert         was       my      Liaison
Officer        and     he       ana I had a good deal of         contact          with      the
Sheffield       Wednesday           Club.   Such liaison was        mainly with the
Secretary       of the Club - in the early stages Eric England                              and
latterly        Dick        Chester - and each game that the              Club          played
throughout           the        season was categorised according to the                    Gate
which     we    would           expect, not least dependent        on the           kind     of
following       that the visiting team would have.                  As I recall the
games     were categorised as A, B or C.                  A category C game would
involve        crowds        of up to say 20,000 people; category B up                       to
3 0,0 00 people? and category A where yet larger crowds would be
expected.            There would be meetings with the Club prior-to the
start     of the football season proper, when the fixtures                                would
be     known,        and the.categories for each game would be                       agreed.
Each     cateaory involved a consequent minimum level of policing
and     since the Club have to contribute to the cost of policing
they     have        a financial interest in the matter.                 I        would     say
however        that        in     my dealings with Sheffield        Wednesday              they
have     always        been        prepared to accept the level              of     policing
which     we thought proper and not tried to influence us to keep
the     numbers        of        Police Officers down for        cost        reasons.            I
should         also        add     that   even   though    the    games           would      be
categorised           at        the start of the season if, for              any        reason,
during     the        season things changed - e.g. if one of the                          Clubs
involved        had a successful run so that a larger crowd might be
expected - we could and did re-categorise matches.


Other     factors           were also involved of course in the                    level     of
policing we might require.                  We would typically liaise with the
Police      Force          for     the visiting Clubs'- home       town           for     added
intelligence from them as to the fans that might be expected.


About 2 weeks prior to each game Inspector Calvert and I would
have     meetings           with the Chief Superintendent and                 the        Deputy
Chief     Superintendent              to discuss the policing for the                    forth­
coming      match,          and then having established the contingent                       of
 Officers       recruired we would go to the Football Liaison                            Offic

at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters at Snig Hill, Sheffield
to     arrange        extra manpower from other Divisions -                    e.g.           from
Road     Traffic Division, Mounted Police, and (where                          necessary)
Dog     Handlers.           Within a week of the match we would                    normally
have     confirmation of the extra manpower available to us,                                   and
then     Clive        Calvert and I would discuss the whole matter                             and
draw     up        an operational plan to be put into operation on                             the
day     of    the match.           This operational plan would               include,           in
particular,           deployment of Police Officers within and                          outside
the Ground.


Our     policy was to use Officers from F Division in those areas
where        there was likely to be pressure or problems because                                of
their        familiarity with the Hillsborough area.                       Thus we always
tended        to     use the same group of Officers for duties                          on     the
pitch,        not least because if trouble were to arise their faces
would        be well recognised by regular fans who would perhaps be
more     readv        to    approach them and report               matters.         Officers
would        also be deployed on duty for off-loading coach loads of
visiting            fans      and     escorting       them    to    the     Ground            from
particular           areas, and likewise in relation to special trains.
When     large        crowds        of visiting fans were expected                 we        would
control        their        arrival     by   close liaison          with     the        Traffic
Division,           who would direct traffic along a particular                          route;
coaches        coming        off     the Ml would, for example, be                 asked        to
exit     at a Junction at Tankersley where there is a very                                   large
lay-by        and     they would be stopped in that lay-by and fans                             on
board        would     have        tickets checked.          Care would be         taken        to
co-ordinate           the     arrival of coaches and trains so                 that,           for
example,           if a train-load of fans was expected the arrival                             of
a     group of coaches might be delayed until those fans arriving
on     the     train had been escorted to the                   Ground.       Furthermore
coaches        were always directed to offload in a particular area,
then     to follow a particular route around the Ground and                                   park
in      Cole        Road. After the match all visiting fans would                             then
be     escorted from the Ground back via Cole Road to the coaches
or trains, as the case may be.

When       the        operational plans were drawn up copies would go                   to
each       particular              group of Officers - i.e.      Traffic      Division,
Mounted Police, etc. and they would detail the duties for each
particular section of men.                    A copy of the operational plan was
always        given to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club in advance of the match.


On     Match Day, before kick-off, I would brief all the Officers
on        duty.        Those        briefings normally took       place    within      the
Ground,           either          in the vicinity of the Police Room or in             the
gymnasium depending on how many Officers were involved.                              After
a     general briefing to all, the Inspectors and Sergeants would
then        be separately briefed in more detail, but all                     briefings
essentially broke down the operation into 3 phases


 1.        The period up to kick-off;
2.         The        period from kick-off until 10 minutes before the end
           of the match;
 3.        From 10 minutes before the end to dispersal of crowds.


 During          my     3    seasons     in   charge we never      had    a   F.A.     Cup
 semi-final             played at Hillsborough and to my recollection                  the
 largest          crowd          we had was one of about 48,000 people          for     an
 evening          match with a 7.30 p.m. kick-off.               On that occasion            I
 recall that the crowd of fans arriving was such that it became
 obvious that we could not get everyone into the Ground in time
 for kick-off.                   When that was reported to me by my Officers, we
 approached                the     Club Secretary - I believe it was          then     Dick
 Chester          - and asked him whether the start of the match                      could
 be        delayed          so     that all the fans could be brought          into     the
 ground.              We     received prompt agreement to that            request,      the
    start     was put back for 15 minutes and we announced this                        over
    the     P.A. system to the crowd.                  That relieved the pressure
    in fact by 7.35 p.m. or thereabouts all the fans were in.




                                                                                        /.

Because         of my experience of and interest in policing football
crowds,         following            my     retirement from the Force                  I        wrote         a
series         of       3    articles for a local newspaper,                     the        Sheffield
telegraph,              on    this        topic.        Subsequently I           did       appear            on
television on a couple of occasions in discussions on football
and      the football supporters' hooliganism problems and I wrote
some articles for the Police Review.


It       was       after the tragedy at the Heysel football                                stadium           in
Belgium            that I recall I was contacted by Superintendent                                      John
Freeman            of the South Yorkshire Police who told me that ha was
calling            at       the request of Dick Chester to enquire whether                                     I
might          be interested to join Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
 as      their          Security Officer.               Having retired from the Force                          I
 was      not working at that time, and I went to see Dick                                        Chester
 and          following            a      discussion         with     him    I    accepted               the

 appointment.


 Xn      my      post as Chief of Security I was involved with                                    general
 matters            of crowd safety and 1 was of course familiar with the
 Gree„         Code,         the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975,                              and         the
 recommendations                   of     the Popplewell Inquiry.                I therefore                 had
 these         matters            very     much    in    mind in performing                my     task        as
 Security Officer. . One of the early things that I did after my
  appointment                was to check         all    the gates around the stadium                        and

  to      change the padlocks on those gates to a common padlock                                               so
  that every gate could be opened with the same key.                                            The Police
  were         supplied with 2 of those keys - I gave them to Inspector
  Calvert           - so that           they   could copy as          many   as they wished.                        I
  also         provided keys to each of the stewards within the                                        Ground

  who were manning gates.

     I    also       checked in relation to fire precautions and                                  I      found
     that      a     number of alarms and extinguishers were                               not         readily
     accessible              on   match        day - the position was              that          the         Fire
     Brigade            would       inspect        the       Ground    without         a        full     crowc
     present,           and during matches certain gates may be locked whic
                                                                                                         ♦   *f *

would     otherwise               be     open    or other changes                made       which        the
Brigade       apparently               had not realised.             I arranged             for        those
matters to be put right.


All     matters          relating          to the erection of               perimeter             fences,
gates     in     the       fences, the siting of crash                       barriers             in     the
standing        areas etc,               were, I believe, dealt with between                             the
Club     and     the       Committee            set     up      by   the     Local          Authority,
pursuant        to       the       Safety of Sports Grounds Act.                        I    know         for
example        that        up      to 1985 the central pen at the                       west            stand
(Leppings        Lane)            end was not divided by the fence                          which'        now
runs     from        the        centre of the mouth of the tunnel                           under         the
stand,       down        to       the     perimeter fence.               There      was        a        crush
barrier        about           12' in from the mouth of the tunnel                            entrance,
and     my     recollection               is that the positioning of                        that        crush
barrier        relatively close to the entrance from the tunnel                                           was
capable        of        causing         a build-up of fans at the mouth                           of     the
tunnel         and        it       was    often        necessary       to        deploy       a     Police
 Constable          on     either         side of the tunnel                to     ensure          orderly
 dispersal          of the crowd within the pen.                       Subsequently                however
 that        crush        barrier         was     removed        and     the       fence          erected,
 presumably at the request of the Safety Committee.


 The     gates in the perimeter fence are                            closed, but not locked,
 during        matches            so     far    as I am aware.              The     gates          are     so
 designed        that           the latch cannot be easily opened from                              inside
 the     pen, and the position is that the gates would normally be
 manned        outside            by stewards and Police Officers.                           The        gares
 opened        outwards on to the pitch area, and to open them it was
 merely        necessary to press down on the spring-loaded latch                                          to
 release        it.           I    do     recall       that      after      my     appointment             as
 Security           Officer            I was a little concerned that some                          of     the
 advertising             boards          on     the perimeter of the               pitch          extended
 partly        across             the mouth of those gates and could                         create         an
  obstruction             and I arranged for the boards to be moved or,                                    ^
  necessary          reduced in length, to prevent any possibility of
  obstruction arising.

I     also took, steps to upgrade thePublic Address System at                                     the
Ground        and        indeed last year the                P.A. System was      completely
replaced          with         anew, more powerful, system.                      Part     of the
reason        for        this        was that I was          conscious of       the     fact the
P.A. System              was an essential part of the emergency evacuation
procedures              at the Club.        Standing rules provided for a                  coded
message           to     be announced over the P.A. and this                    announcement
would        be        an indication to Police Officers and Stewards                          that
emergency              evacuation procedures were in force.                    The     Stewards
were        then             required to take up             positions at their           exitsand
gates,        and             to    open   those gates.         I   made      sure that       this
evacuation              procedure was tested on match days to be satisfied
that        it would work efficiently in the event of an evacuation.
Indeed        in the 1988/89 season which is just drawing to a close
we        have had 2 emergency evacuation tests in which the                              Police
were also involved.                    Their part was co-ordinated via Inspector
Sewell        and             on the occasion of              these tests the coded               message
would        be broadcast and then                  we        would check quickly         round the
Ground        to see that all the gates had in fact been thrown open
and were manned by Stewards.


Following the Popplewell report the proper training of fit and
able        Stewards           was     a recommendation.            In fact     many     of           the
Stewards            at       Football Grounds are older men who                  may    perhaps
    have    retired or be approaching retirement from their                              regular
    work    so      that it is not always possible to have Stewards                                   who
    are     fully        fit from the point of view of youth                    and     fitness.
    Where    possible, however, younger candidates were recruited as
    Stewards           and     I    did take steps to ensure that               training              was
    available           to them.       Thus, at the beginning of the season, for
    the     last 3 seasons, I have had 2 training evenings                             organised
    at     the Club.           The first evening is for gatemen, catering                             and
    ground        staff, and the second evening concentrates on training
    of     Stewards.               On both evenings there are demonstrations                          and
    instructions              given on first aid; there is a talk by
                              I of the local Fire Brigade re fire precautions

                                                                                              *   •   I   •   •

and     fire duties; there is a talk by a Police Inspector                                        (this
year     Inspector Sewell) on emergency procedures; and finally I
talk to them about Ground Regulations and we finish off with a
video     of the Bradford and Heysel disasters in the context                                           of
stewarding         of        soccer        grounds,          a    video    produced          by        the
Metropolitan Police.


In     addition the Stewards are given written instructions aa to
their     duties        on    match days.            Initially these             were        printed
sheets     given to them at the beginning of each season,-but                                           of
late I have altered the system slightly so that each match day
employee is provided with a booklet at the commencement of the
season,        which     he has to sign for.                     This booklet      contains               a
separate        sheet        for     each home match,which can be used                            as      a
signed     receipt for payment of wages for match day duties.                                           In
the back of the booklet are printed the instructions for match
day staff.


I also caused to be produced a Management Information Sheet on
"Use     and     Training          of Stewards" which was given to                       all           the
administrative           staff        at the Club, to ensure that                   there              was
Management        awareness           among all of them of the functions                               and
duties of Stewards and part-time staff.


Finally,         on the'match day itself, Stewards are briefed by the
Police,        usually in groups for each of the 4 separate areas of
the Ground - north, south, east and west.


The     Officer        in overall charge of policing                       Hillsborough                for
several         seasons            until      earlier            this     year    was          Chief
Superintendent           Brian        Mole.     Mr. Mole took over these                     duties
very     shortly        after I retired, following the death                            of     Chief
Superintendent Brian Moseley.                       Mr. Mole was one of those Chief
Superintendents who took a very active or hands-on approach to
being     in       charge          of policing Hillsborough and I                 had        worke
fairly closely with him in my position as Chief of Security c
the Ground up to the point where he was transferred to anothe

                                                                                                  . •/.

Division       in     about March of this year.                 During his      apell       in
p Division          he had been xn charge of 2 F.A. Cup semi-finals at
Hillsborough          -     Coventry City v. Leeds United and in                    1987/88
Season,       Liverpool v. Notts. Forest.                  Inspector Clive          Calvert
had     worked       as     his Liaison Officer up to and               including         the
1987/88       F.A.        Cup semi-final but he was then transferred                      and
his replacement was Inspector Sewell.


When     Brian       Mole     was    transferred from            F   Division       he    was
replaced        by Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and Super­
intendent          Duckenfield'b        first match at Hillsborough-- waB                   on
Saturday,           1st     April,     1989       when    the    visiting     team       were
Millwall        F.C.       and   the crowd was relatively small                 and      well
behaved.


The     Club       was involved in an evening match on Wednesday,                           5th
April,        against       Wimbledon F.C. and again on that                  occasion        I
met      Chief       Superintendent           Duckenfield        and   also        Inspector
Sewell.        After       that match had started, at about 7.45 p.m.                        we
pulled        in    all the Chief Stewards into a meeting                     to     discuss
with      them      the     arrangements for the            forthcoming        semi-final
between        Liverpool         and Notts. Forest.             In addition to        the     4
Chief      Stewards         also     present w e r e _____________ (who             keeps     a
 running       check        on turnstiles on match days and              arranges           for
 change        to      be     available       etc.),      __________________(who             13


 responsible          for payment of Stewards), ______________ and
                   We discussed with them what extra Stewards we                         would
 require       for        the semi-final, for their differing sections                       of
 the     Ground, and we needed to have details of numbers etc.                               so
 that     special          passes could be organised for those                 additional
 Stewards.          Because each Chief Steward knows his own area                         well
 and     we knew we would have a capacity crowd for the semi-final
 their        views were very much listened to and heeded in terms of
 what extra Btewarding was required.


 On     the     day of the Cup semi-final I arrived at the Ground                            al
 approximately 9.45 a.m. and parked my car at the LeppingB Lan<

end of Fielding Road.                    I entered the Ground, and carried out a
general        tour        of    inspection around the whole Ground                       in    the
period up to about 10.45 a.m.                       I recall that Roger Houldsworth
was     at     the Ground and indeed I assisted him by                            footing       the
ladder       for him whilst he was carrying out some repairs to one
of     the Police cameras in the west stand area near the                                  Police
control        box.         I    also entered the control box and                    spoke       to
P.C. Mick           Ryan who is the regular Police Radio Operator and I
left     with        him one of the Sheffield Wednesday                      F.C.        personal
radios.        These personal radios had all been serviced prior                                 to
the     match and X distributed additional radios to each-oi                                    the
4     Head     Stewards;          1 lu                    f 1 to Craham Maokroll                and
another        to                     I, his Admin. Manager; 1 for the                     Office
staff        generally;           1   to                      , one of my        Stewards       who
performs        a flexible role at my direction;                     1 for theTurnstile
Room staff; and the 12th one I retained myself.


I     told     the     Stewards that there would be a briefing                            by    the
Police        Inspectors at 11.15 a.m., having already been informed
of that by Inspector Sewell.


I     recall        that        about 11.30 a.m. I went back                to     the     Police
control box when there were a number of other Officers present
besides        P.C.        Ryan.         One I recall was Sergeant                Goddard       but
there        were others whom I cannot now recall.                      I had a           general
chat     with        them, they had no special requests, and                         I     walked
back     from there to the offices in the south stand.                               I     recall
that when walking back briefings were then in progress in each
of the four areas of the Ground.


The     turnstiles were opened to admit ticket holders from about
11.30 a.m.           Each set of turnstiles is covered by a CCTV camera
and     there        is a facility for recording the pictures taken                              by
each     of     those cameras.              Each video tape however                lasts       only
3 hours and we discussed the position and agreed that                                    we would,
only switch on the cassettes from 12.30 p.m.

I        recall      that     at about 12 noon I checked                    on     the           computer
print-out            and at that stage there were 600 ticket holders                                         in
the        Ground.          I walked around the outside of the                             stadium           to
check          on the position, and there were at that stage a                                     number
of         fans      in     the     area     but       many       more    Nottingham               Forest
supporters            than Liverpool supporters.                        In walking around                 the
Ground          I    checked        with     all        the       Car    Park     attendants              and
reminded            them     of the arrangements for that day                          where            there
were        2 different types of car park ticket - one for those who
were        entitled to park and leave their cars, and one a                                        permit
merely          allowing          people to drop off passengers.                            I     reminded
them        also       that any vehicle not in the car park by 2.30                                      p.m.
should          be excluded until 5 minutes after kick-off - this is a
standard             procedure           on busy match days, to avoid any                          traffic
hazard          with        the     large number of fans who would                          be     in     the

vicinity.


    I    was      back      in the offices by about 12.30                       p.m.        and     having
    checked         with     the office staff I re-entered the control                                   room
    where      P.C. Harold GueBt was present for the Police,                                      together
    with       Roger Houldsworth and a representative from the                                     Company
    who had installed the CCTV system.


    At     about 1 p.m. I left the control room, which is immediately
    adjacent         to     the     players'           entrance, and went              out        to     that
    entrance         where        I.met with Superintendent Glynn Marsh                                and        a
    Police          Sergeant. , Superintendent Marsh explained that he                                       had
    come       out     to     see    the     Police           operation         generally,             having
    recently          taken over an operations' group in the Force, and                                           I
    gave       him     and        the Sergeant a tour of the                    control          room.            I
    recall          that     at     about       that time I also            had        a    visit         from
    Inspector            Calvert         who had been called in to assist                          at     this
    special          match,        and    was     in charge of the Kop                     area     of       the
    Ground.           I knew him well of course, Inspector Calvert                                      having
    been       my     Liaison Officer in the days when I was                                involved          i*
        policing the Ground.

    Sometime           between 1.35 and 1.45 p.m. the Liverpool team                              coach
    arrived, followed shortly afterwards by the Notts. Forest team
    coach.        I recall that outside the players' entrance there were
    a     number        of fans awaiting the arrival, again                    mainly         Notts.
    Forest        fans       but some Liverpool fans also.                  A number         of     the
    fans        were pressing forward at the arrival of the players, and
    a Mounted Police Officer eased his horse through the crowd and
    pushed        them       back.        I clearly recall that the Mounted Officer
    was         wearing a white shirt which would indicate to me that                                 he
    was        brought        in to assist from an outside Police Force -                           The
    South        Yorks.        Police wear regulation blue shirts.                         I ' 'recall
    this        instance          particularly for 2 reasons - in the course                          of
    the        manoeuvre the horse seemed to be a little excitable, and
    a     middle-aged man with a Liverpool accent complained that the
    horse        had     stepped          on his foot and indeed his               footwear         was
    visibly        dented.           I recall that Kenny Dalglish, the                     Liverpool
    Manager,           went       to speak to the fan, and Superintendent                         Roger
    Greenwood           waB present and I suggested to him that the                              Police
    horse        was     unnecessary for the type of duty at                       the      players'
    entrance.                He     agreed    that       South     Yorks.     Police        did     not
    normally           use        Mounted    Officers in that situation,                   and     said
    that        he would deal with the matter at the later                           de-briefing.
    Superintendent                  Greenwood        was      in   charge     of     the         Police
    contingent            on       duty     on the pitch.          I walked        down from        the
    players'             entrance through the playerB' tunnel on to                              the pitch
    with         him    and after chatting for a little while                        returned         to
    theControl Room at about 1.55 p.m.


    At           about 2 p.m. one of the employees from the Turnstile                              Room
    popped         into        the Control Room to see what the                    crowd     already
     enteringthe             Ground was like.            My recollection is              that       the
     computer                print-out       showed        that some 24,000 fans were               in,
    mostly         in     the       south stand and the Kop area               (Notts.           Forest
        supporters)          and     a lesser number in the west and north                        stand
        areas.     At regular intervals thereafter the Police Control Box
        staff     would radio in (on one occasion they used the                             internal
        land     line     telephone) to check with us what the size                          of     the

                                                                                                  . .f * .

crowd     was           as     demonstrated on the                       computer          prin.t-out,             and
generally           either           P.C. Guest or I would answer them and                                        give
them     the        figure.           It was noticeable that the                            Notts.           Forest
areas         of        the     Ground        were           filling          up     first.            This        was
demonstrated                 both     on     tha     T.V. monitors                   and        also        on     the
computer           print-out.               We have a separate monitor                            within           the
Control           Room        for     each of the CCTV cameras                           trained            on     the
various           turnstiles           and the players' entrance.                                In        addition
there        is     an        extra        monitor which is linked                         to     tha        Police
cameras           and where we do not have a recording facility but                                                 we
can     switch,              at the press of a button, from one                                  Police           T.V.
camera to another to see what pictures they are displaying.


Between            2.30        and     2.40        p.m.        it       was        noticeable              that      a
significant              number of fans were arriving at the Leppings Lane
end      of        the        Ground.         This           was        noticeable          in        particular
through           the Police monitor from the Police camera situated on
top     of        the        south west corner of the west st-ind.                                     I     recall
that     at        about 2.40 p.m. there was an announcement                                           over        the
Police        radio           (P.C. Guest had one in the Control                                  Room)           that
Leppings           Lane        was closed to traffic because of the                                     build-up
in     that        area. I looked on the monitor at the                                     Leppings              Lane
picture            and         I     recall        the        impression             I     had     was            that
immediately              outside           the turnstiles in the area of the                                     metal
gate     there           was        a very tight crush of people.                                Just        behind
them     was        an area which did not seem so densely                                        packed,           and
then     further behind again in Leppings Lane there seemed to be
a     solid        crush of people coming along.                               I cannot say                 however
that     I        noticed any evidence of misbehaviour among                                           the        fans
near     the        turnstile              area.     However there wag                      a     substantial
number        of        fans waiting to get into the ground with                                           kick-off
time approaching.


By     2.50 p.m. the computer showed that there were about 45,000
fans     in the Ground.                    I cannot recall any report of                               problems,
but     on        the        Police        monitor it was                 noticeable             that        crowds
outside           the Leppings Lane gates had increased, and they                                                 were
                                              -    14   -




pushing        forward        and there was quite a crush.                 The     computer
print-out           indicated that there were about 2,000 spaces                      still
to       be filled in the north stand area, and about 2,500 m                              the
west        stand area as I recall.               On the monitor I saw a            Mounted
Police        Officer       in the crowd at the Leppings Lane end and                       he
seemed        to be the same Officer as had earlier been involved at
the players' entrance.                From the T.V. picture his horse seemed
to        shy and slip into something of a splayed leg positron, and
then recovered and this was an indication to me that the crush
out        there was increasing.           Then suddenly Gate C opened and                    a
crowd        of spectators burst through and P.C. Harold Guest                            sard
 something like "The gate's gone".                          I immediately left the room
 in        something       of a hurry, as I was concerned that this                   could
 cause        problems       and    that   further help might              be    needed      in
 manning        that gate or indeed other gates around the Ground                            to
 which        the     problem       of fans trying to get            in    quickly        could
 spread.            Because of that, on my way out of the Control                         Room,
 I        indicated to P.C. Janet Cruttenden who was just outside the
 Directors '          entrance, that she should step inside the entrance
 if        there     were any trouble and to the 2 administrative                         staff
 who        were at the players' entrance I said that I would arrange
 for extra Stewards.    I called                □ the Senior
 Steward in the south Btand area, to join me at the Directors'
 entrance           and     I asked him to provide 2 burly Stewards at                      the
 entrance           to     reinforce the staff there, explaining                   what     had

 happened at C Gate.


  From        then       I wanted to make my way over to the C Gate and went
  down        the players' tunnel on to the pitch.                   As I walked          along
     the      side       towards the weststand area I met                 Graham    Mackrell
     about     half way between the tunnel and the Police control box.
     I     told him my concern as to what had happened at Gate C,                            and
     he     said     "Leave     it to me" and turned and went back                   in     that
     direction.          I recall looking and seeing that each of the n o r ^
     and      south       "wings"    of the       Leppings Lane terracing          were      n
     over-crowded,         but the centre pen seemed very full.
                                                 -    15   -




I       started to return, and at this stage the players from                                  both
teams        were on the pitch but the match had not started yet.                                 I
had        to w a i t , because the gangway towards the players'                         tunnel
was crowded with members of the media waiting for Brian Clougn
to        arrive.     He came down and sat in his seat, and then I                              was
able        to walk back up through the players' tunnel speaking                                 to
the        Stewards as X did so.                I went b ^ i n t o t t a     Control           Roo*
and        Harold     Guest said to me, in a                                 voice         Doug,
they have opened the gates".                         Roger Houldsworth was not there.
I        ran back through the players' tunnel shouting as I ran into
my        personal        radio calling up the Chief Steward at                      the       west
end,         Stuart           Thorpe,     asking him what is happening.                    I     ran
into        Graham        Mackrell and someone I now know as Glen                        Kirton,
a n       F.A.     official, and told them that the Police                        had      opened
the        gates      at       the Leppings Lane end of the                Ground.         Graham
    responded        to       the    effect "Can we get them in, are we                    up     to
    capacity?1’       and        I responded that we were net.               I made my           way
    down     towards the west stand and then saw people climbing over
    the     perimeter fences at that end of the pitch.                         At that point
    a     Police Officer went onto the pitch and askea tr.e Referee to

    stop the game.

    There     was a mass of people around the perimeter fence                              behind
    the     goal     area and X am not able to say whether the gates                              in
    the     perimeter fence were opened to allow people out.                             I could
    see     that     some people were being lifted over the top                          of      the
    fence,       people appeared to be lying on the ground injured, and
    many were wandering'around in a dazed condition and in obvious
    distress.             I    helped     a number of people in that              state         back
    towards        the players' tunnel area and into the south stand                                  so
    that they could be comforted and helped.                         I recall that one of
     the     Assistant          Caretakers, named)                 | said we      needed        more
        stretchers        from      the   Tea    Bar.          I went in    and    got         the ^
        stretchers        which      were stored on top of the cupboard in                       th
        Bar so that they could be used
                                               -    16    -




At       one     point I recall that Brian Clough stopped me and                              said
-Sir,          I want you to find the Directors and the F.A. Officials
and       tell them I am putting my players in the bath and                              taking
them           home."        Mr. Clough knew that I worked with the Club                       for
I        had     been introduced to him earlier that day.                       I was        aware
of        the     fact        that    there   was a           meeting   going    on     in     the
Directors'              room     to    discuss the situation, which               was        still
unclear           and I went into that room to tell the Directors                             what
Mr.        Clough had said.             The message, in effect, was that                     there
could           be no thought given to re-commencing the game when                                 the
problem           had        been dealt with - of course, at that                  time,           the
full nature of the tragedy was not known.


 It       was at about that point I realised that there had been                                    no
 announcement over the Public Address System in accordance with
 the       emergency           arrangements        and procedures laid            down.            The
 South          Yorkshire        Police are in charge of the                  Public     Address
 System           in the sense that they have an override system and the
 emergency procedures stipulated that the Police would make the
    necessary           broadcast.       I therefore used my personal radio                        and
    instructed all Stewards to unlock the gates around the ground.
    I     got replies from some of them only, and I recall I spoke to
                              and asked him to get round and ensure                    that        the
    gates were opened all the way around.


     I    recollect           that    I was also         approached      by     Superintendent
    Roger        Greenwood who said he wanted to take Kenny Dalglish and
     Brian       Clough        to the Police Control Box to broadcast                    to        the
     crowd       in the Ground and explain the position and I took                                 them
     there by a relatively unobstructed route.


     I     subsequently          had    a request over the radio from                  the         Head
     Stewards           to    allow    the men to stand down pending                   the    crowd
     eventually leaving the Ground through the gates which hadr been
     opened,        but        I refused that request on the basis                 that
        attendance was still required whilst the crowd remained.


                                                                                               *   • /   «   •

Since       the tragic      events on 15th April I have     been    able    to
watch       the video       recording of the position at    the    gates    at
Leppings Lane, through the Club's own static camera trained on
those      gates.       I    now realise that the initial event     when     a
crowd       of spectators         burst into the Ground through     Gate    C,
which      caused me to first leave the Control Room, was in             fact
subsequently        controlled       after a number of fans had gone       in.
They      apparently        got   in when the Police were   attempting      to
eject      some of the spectators inside, through Gate C.' It              was
after      that, it seems, that the order was given by the'*'Police
for Gate C to be opened to allow spectators in.


I    have read this Statement and it is true and correct to                the
best of my knowledge and b e l i e f .

I transferred to ’F ’ Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

(Admin ) .

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to   be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As   a preliminary          to the event    I received      an overview of the         planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at ^.30 p.m. on Wednesday i2 April 1989-

I did   not attend the Commander's brief on Friday lli April 1989-

On   Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground                        at

9.45 a.m.      I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

in   front of the Special Constables.

It   appeared        to me   that attention to detail was            evident in    the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

 Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

 various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                         He impressed that

 officers     must    act    in a professional       manner       which would reflect credit           on

 South Yorkshire Police.

 This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a microphone

 and amplifier.

 This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

 I   was     again    impressed with       the   standard    of   briefing,   again    attention   to

 detail such as the evacuation procedures and officers being aware of their

 indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality..

 I   particularly        recall him    saying,      "We     havefully   tried         the   evacuation

 procedures twice this season, the first time was good, the second time was
excellence;          if we       are   required    to    impliment          evacuation          today,    it must    be

excellent."

This     briefing          was    followed    by    an    up     to       date     intelligence          report    from

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Finally,       Inspector         Sewell gave general           information             about radios,       issue and

mealing arrangements.

It     was    stressed       that      all officers      must     be       on    their    respective points          by


 11. 15 a.m.
After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

 later       into    the    operation      so I left       the        stadium          to return    to my     private

 vehicle.       I was       approached on three separateoccasions                        in Penistone Road and

 asked if I had             any ticketsto sell.

 There were a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

 I went       to my        vehicle      and drove       to Hammerton            Road    Police     Station where          I

 carried out some outstanding clerical work.

 I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

 Station,           when    a    police    car offered      me        a     lift       to the    ground.          This    I

  accepted.

  I saw Policewoman                Smith   and another         officer          outside    Threshers near Holme

  Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

  I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

  officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

     I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

     and not in uniform.

     All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

     at 1.00 p.m. there were               so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

     By Hillsborough Park I                saw a group of             people sitting around, there                  was a

     white plastic carrier bag with them and                              the outline of cans could be seen.
The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were     six men and they were                  joking about       having       to drink the      lot as

they would not be allowed to             take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By Leopings     Lane    gates     were few        supporters,        road       clear, plenty       of Police

officers evident.

I went   to    the     barrier    at     Leppings       Lane/Vere        Road    where    I     spoke   to   'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                                A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I then   walked      past    Leppings      Lane       gates   and    came       to    barriers    and   Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                                    There were no

other people     near     this area.          I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell        the necessity         to provide       a sterile             area to keep opposing

 fans separate.

 I continued along          the road     beingthe South           Stand     past      the T.V.unit vans

 where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

 I produced my warrant           card,    but     I was known to one                 officer who I did not

 know.

 I went down and along Penistone Road which was b u s y .

 I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the flow of people, it was

 very busy.

 I   stopped   and     spoke     to    Police    Constable        Vallance       from     'A'    Division    and

                                       from     'A'    Division     at    separate       points but due       to

 enquiries and sheer numbers of persons it was prudent to move on, as they

 needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

 1 returned to rear of South Stand.

 About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

 There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
                                               _Z|-




awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.                          The procedure was

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this area and returned             to Penistone Road              as   I intended    to use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.          At that time about one hour to kies off.

I knew    there was    a Liverpool       train due at Wads ley Bridge around 2.05 p.m.

 but decided to go into the ground.

 I went to the main sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a special

 card   issued   to me    by Superintendent Murray.                 Both were      fully   checked    and

 examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

 I was assured no unauthorised person would gain entry at that gate.

 I went down onto the perimeter            track and was            immediately surprised by how

 full the Spion Kop was.         I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

 I made my way to the Police Control box.

 Inspector    Sewell     had   alerted    me   to     the    fact    that      inside   there   was   only

 limited space.        I intended to visit, see it operated and leave if I was in

 the way.

  I wanted    to see     the   Control   point      as   I was      at   Doncaster Rovers when         the

  camera equipment was         first   installed and operated at the beginning of the.

  present    season.     The   engineer    was      always    quoting         the Sheffield     Wednesday

  system as being excellent and holding the system as the way all grounds
should operate.

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at    the    front     and    Police     Constable       Bichard       at     the    rear    by   the     camera

operating controls.

I was       informed    by Police        Sergeant      Goddard       that    Superintendent        Murray       had

gone    to speak to          the referee       so I sat on his              seat   and was    offered a hot

drink.       It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant       Chief    Constable        (Operations)         Mr.    Jackson        came    to   the    control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw    through     the    control        room    window     Superintendent         Murray      and    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield,               m    uniform, walking along the track.                        ihey came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

 I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the Notts

 Forest      parts I could see           on the South Stand and                the Spion Kop were quite

 full.

 I recall Chief          Superintendent         Duckenfield commenting about                  there being no

 entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

 I remember       when       I was   a   child       there   always     being       a band playing         by    the

 players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

 Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

    a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                                       When

    I looked the person was jiggling around.                     I remember thinking how empty the

    area around this youth was.                 Police Constable             Bichard operated the camera

    and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super
                                                          -6-



facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was      aware      the area in Leppings             Lane       behind       the    goal was           filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was      then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warn

no.      As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

T was aware that Aian Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                            The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                                    All was good humoured.

The      area behind the goal at Leppings                       Lane     was    getting        full       out     there      was

space at the front.                 People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

wanting to maintain their best view oi the playing area.

Approx 2.30 p.m.

I       looked   on     the   left    monitor and         was      aware       there seemed              a    build     up    of

 supporters.

 1 remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

 necessary         segregation        of    fans,         access       to   the North               Stand,which           had been

 allocated         to    Liverpool        supporters,        could       only        be    done     by       Leppings        Lane

 entrances,           this    meant   that       the   entrances         on Penistone              Road      to   the     stand

 which would normally be used were unavailable.

 This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

 I recall a suggestion                that the loud hailer/tannoy should be                              used to request

 fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

 People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

 An       engineer       came      into    the     room      to    try      and       improve       transmission              and

    reception.

    I    remember       him   in   blue    under       the   control        room          bench,    I thought           it    was

    crowded as Police Sergeant Goddeard was walking round/over him.
                                                  -7-



I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

  W3.S .

I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the closure of Leppings Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                              It was not

extraordinary.           I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception,                     the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                              The

 crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

 Approx 2.45 p.m.

 The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

 on the screen.            Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

 team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

 Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

 to assist officers outside.

 Around      this   time     a radio message      was   relayed   requesting       the   gates   to be

 opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

 I remember thinking, you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

  is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

  and may      create      a difficult     public   order    situation      for   Police    inside    the

  ground.

  The      gates    were     not     authorised   to    be   opened    by    Chief    Suepnntendent

  Duckenfield       at   t hi s   time.

  I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

  be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the

Police Control.

It occurred      that some    Liverpool     supporters      were    l e v m g it late but people

often enter after the start of many games.

About this      time I can see people climbing              over the wall and point         this out

to the controllers.          I then saw the gates            displayed on the camera         which I

believe   are    the   concertina   gates    on   the   service      road    to   the   rear of the

South Stand open and a surge of people rush into the ground.                            I said,   "The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.         It seemed control was regained with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the gate .

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent Marshall        again requests         the   gates    to be opened.         This   is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

I can see by the players tunnel a semi                circle of photographers awaiting the

arrival of the two teams.

It seems     the Superintendent will have to try and prevent the start of the

 game as the fans will        not all get in but I thought there is no way anyone

 can get to the referee or team managers to do this at                     this late    stage.    As I

 was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                       I've no idea which

 team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

 I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

 At   this point Superintendent Marshall              requested      the    gates   to be opened as

 there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in                         the crush

 if they were not opened.

 There was still room on the terrace under the control.                       The South Stand was

 much fuller but not full.
Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u ck en fi el d for a decision.

It was evident there existed a tremendous problem                      for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief S up er i n t e n d e n t D uckenfield was d eeply c o n s i d e r i n g the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect                       - If there’s n k e l y    to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent        Murray    gave    the general      instruction     over   the radio to open

 the gates.

 On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

 The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.                       The play was

 at the Penistone Road end.

 I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

 onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

 direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

 The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

  Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as directed

  but then stopping and standing watching the game.

  A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was space

  but did not open i t .

  I thought she probably didn’t have a radio or handn’t sensed that she must

  open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

   I began to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of the

   control point, through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got

   the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.                         More

   and more were coming onto the track, I was ushering them to the open gate

   and the Policewoman assisted.

I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I    could   see   people   pushed   up    against      the   fence   but   not   aware   of   any

particular problems or injuries as there                is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More and more people on the          track and beginning          to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by wavin g his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run     to control    but by   the uncovered seatsi meet            Superintendent      Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.                     We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game .

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

Terrace.

 I think it is a public order situation.

 As they are Liverpool        supporters,     I run       onto the playing    area and    protect

    Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

    When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

    people spilling onto the playing area.              There is quite clearly in my mind a

    major public    order   situation     which will     need    a large    uniform presence     to

    control.

    I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

    There is nothing I can usefully do in a public oder context so I decide to

return to the Police Control point.

En    route   I am     passed        by   uniformed        reinforcements            as    I pass       through    the

uncovered seating.

On    re-entering          control    room   I     learn        that    persons      are    suspected       of being

injured.

An    ambulance       is    called    for    and    quickly        arrives      behind          the    Leppings    Lane

goal.

A message        is relayed        to Police       control        that many people               are    injured.     As

they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides to call

out Casualty Bureau staff.

I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson,                                        to call for Chief

Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

 I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

 I've no accurate             assessment     of     time,       but this call             should be recorded         on

 tape    in Force      Control.           Coins    or other            items   are   being       thrown    at Police

 Control      in large numbers.              In view of the situation unfolding,                            Operation

 Support' is authorised.

 All available personnel are deployed in area.

 I     suggest    I    go     to   Hammerton       Road     Police        Station         and    receive    Operation

 Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground Control.

 I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

 I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

 in a marked Police car.                  He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

     I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Commander.

 Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific areas in

     makeshift serials.

     I remain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

     enquiry room.

Relatives and calls are all being dealt with from Hammerton Road.

At   this   stage   there   is   little   further which   is of benefit   regarding    the

series of events under review.

Subsequent    actions   by myself     involve reception    and sympathetic   welfare    of

distressed relatives.

Liaison with Social Services and other support agencies.

Setting up of HOLMES incident room.

All non contentious but essential facilities to assist officers at scene.

I did not directly handle any injured or dead bodies.

I transferred to 'F ' Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

(Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As   a preliminary to the event I received an overview of the planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1989.

I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April 1 9 8 9 .

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

9.^-5 a.m.    I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

In front of the Special Constables.

It appeared      to me that attention to detail was evident in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                      He impressed that

officers     must    act   in a professional     manner which would reflect credit on

South Yorkshire Police

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by •

and amplifier

This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

I was    again      impressed   with   the   standard of briefinj

detail such as the evacuation procedures and officers 1

indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality.

I    particularly     recall    him    saying,   "We   have   fully

procedures twice this season, the first time was               p-nnd   th p   gppnnH   tim e   wafi
                                                        - 2 -




excellence; if we           are   required         to   impliment             evacuation today,             it must     be

excellent,"

This    briefing      was     followed        by   an     up         to    date     intelligence       report         from

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Finally,    Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios,                                          issue and

mealing arrangements.

It was     stressed       that    all    officers       must          be     on    theirrespectivepoints                by

11.15 a.m.

After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

later    into   the       operation      so   I    left     the           stadium    to return       to my     private

vehicle.     I was approached on three                  separate occasions in Penistone                       Road and

asked if I had any tickets to sell.

There were a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

I went     to my vehicle          and    drove      to Hammerton              Road       Police    Station where         I

carried out some outstanding clerical work.

I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

Station,     when     a     police      car   offered           me    a     lift    to    the     ground.      This      I

accepted.

I saw Policewoman            Smith      and   another       officer           outside      Threshers    near Holme

Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

and not in uniform.

All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

By Hillsborough Park I saw a group of people sitting around,                                           there was         a

white plastic carrier bag with them and                               the outline of cans could be seen.
                                                   -   3-



The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were    six men and they were joking about                       having       to drink the lot as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By Leppings    Lane   gates    were     few      supporters,       road       clear,    plenty    of Police

officers evident.

I went   to   the   barrier       at   Leppings Lane/Vere              Road     where    I spoke       to   'A'

Division officers, Police Constables                   Parkin and Drury.             A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I then   walked     past    Leppings      Lane    gates     and    came       to    barriers     and    Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                                  There were no

other people near      this area.          I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell      the necessity         to provide       a sterile             area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I continued along      the road being the South Stand past                           the T.V.     unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

I produced my warrant         card,     but I was known            to one officer who I did not

know.

I went down and along Penistone Road                   which was busy.

I walked towards Parkside Road and 1 was against the                               flow of people, it       was

very busy.

I   stopped   and   spoke    to    Police     Constable      Vallance          from     'A'   Division      and

                                   from     'A'   Division        at   separate points           but due     to

enquiries and sheer numbers             of persons it was prudent to move on, as they

needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

I returned to rear of South Stand.

About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
                                                -4-



awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same       for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the       Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.                   The procedure was

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this area and returned            to Penistone       Road as I intended            to use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.         At that time about one hour to kick off.

I knew there was a Liverpool train due at Wadsley Bridge around 2.05 p.m.

but decided to go into the ground.

I went to the main        sliding gate and produced my warrant                 card and a special

card   issued   to me     by Superintendent Murray.              Both werefully checked          and

examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

I was assured no unauthorised person would gain entry at that gate.

I went down onto the perimeter track and was immediately surprised by how

full the Splon Kop was.          I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

I made my way to the Police Control b o x .

Inspector    Sewell     had   alerted me    to    the     fact   that    inside    there   was   only

limited space.        I intended to visit, see it operated and leave if I was in

the way.

I wanted    to see     the    Control   point    as   I was at Doncaster Rovers when              the

camera equipment was          first   Installed and operated at the beginning of the

present    season.      The   engineer was       always    quoting      the   Sheffield    Wednesday

system as being excellent and holding the system as the way all grounds
                                                                 -   5-



should operate .

On e n t e r i n g the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard,                                       Police       Constable Ryan

at     the       front       and      Police      Con stable          Bichard          at    the     rear       by     the     camera

operating controls.

I    was     informed          by     Police     Sergeant        G o dda rd       that      Superintendent             Murray       had

gone       to    speak       to     the   referee      so    I   sat       on    his     seat     and     was    offered       a    hot

drink.          It didn't appear p a rticularly                       busy and quite              clearly        everyt h i n g was

under control.

Assistant          Chief          Constable        (Operations)             Mr.     Jackson         came        to    the     control

point,       he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw        through        the     control        room    window            S u p e rintendent        Murray        and     Chief

Superintendent               Duckenfield,          in uniform,            w a lking along           the   track.        They       came

through the uncovered seats                        in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the r o o m and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared               to leave,          but did not          appear       to be hind ering anyone and felt

I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space,                                                          the Notts

Forest          parts    I     could      see    on   the    South        Stand      and    the     Spion       Kop    were     quite

full.

I    recall       Chief        Superintendent           Duckenfield              commenting         about       there       being    no

entertainment being provided to encourage                                   the supporters to come early.

I    remember           when      I   was   a    child       there        always       being    a    band       playing       by    the

players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

Whilst I didn't                see     it, Assistant Chief Constable O perations                                 commented         that

a person          just below           the Police        control          had just dropped his trousers.                           When

I looked          the person was jiggling around.                               I remember         thinking h ow empty the

area       around       this        youth   was.       Police        Constable           Bichard        operated       the     camera

and I watche d him be able to zoom onto h i m w h i c h I thought was a super

facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was aware         the area       in Leppings            Lane    behind    the goal was             filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was     then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

up.     As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                           The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                                    All was good humoured.

The    area behind the goal at Leppings                          Lane was      getting        full       but   there was

space at the front.                People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

Approx 2.30 p.m.

I     looked   on    the    left    monitor         and    was    aware     there       seemed       a    build      up     of

supporters .

I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

necessary      segregation         of fans,         access       to     the North Stand,             which had been

allocated      to    Liverpool         supporters,          could       only     be    done    by        Leppings         Lane

entrances,      this       meant    that      the    entrances          on Penistone          Road       to    the    stand

which would normally be used were unavailable.

This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding .

People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

An     engineer      came       into    the    room        to     try    and     improve        transmission               and

reception.

I remember          him    in   blue    under       the     control       room    bench,       I     thought         it    was

crowded as Police Sergeant Godd^ard was walking round/over him.______

I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was .

I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the closure of Leppings Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                              It was not

extraordinary.          I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception,                     the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                             The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 p.m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on the screen.           Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

to assist officers outside.

Around    this    time    a radio message      was        relayed   requesting      the   gates   to be

opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

I remember thinking, you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

and may    create       a difficult   public     order       situation     for Police      inside   the

ground.

The   gates      were    not   authorised   to        be     opened   by    Chief     Sueprintendent

Duckenfield at this time.

I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the
Police Control.

It    occurred           that some             Liverpool        supporters               were leving it        late    but     people

often enter              after the start of m a n y games.

About       this    time        I   can        see    people        climbing over          the wall a nd point               this    out

to    the    controllers.                  I    then    saw     the       gates    displayed         on    the    camera w h i c h        I

believe       are         the concertina               gates        on    the     service road            to    the rear       of    the

South       Stand        open and          a surge          of people        rush        into the ground.            I said,    "The

gates have been forced".

It was       difficult          to estimate             how m a n y        entered       the    ground     but the gates were

quickly closed again.                          It seemed control was r e g ained                     with h e l p of a m o u n t e d

officer who put his horse across                               the gap in the gate .

People however are still being able                                   to climb over the              wall      into the ground.

Superintendent             Marshall             again       requests         the    gates       to   be    opened.       This       is    a

general request.

It is getting close to kick, off time.

I can       see by       the players                 tunnel    a semi           circle     of photog r a p h e r s awaiting the

arrival of the two t e a m s .

It    seems        the    Su perintendent               will        have    to     try    and   prevent        the    start    of    the

game    as    the        fans       will       not    all     get    in    but     I thought         there      is no way anyone

can get to the referee or team m a n agers                                   to do this at this late stage.                         As I

was     thinking          this       the       crowd    errupted           as a team ran on.               I've no       idea w h i c h

team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

I saw on the m o nitor control was difficult outside now.

At    this     point       Superintendent                   Marshall            requested the         gates      to be     opened        as

there was          going        to be          serious      injury        or someone        killed outside in              the crush

if they were not opened.

There was          still room on the terrace                             under     the    control.        The    South Stand was

mu c h fuller but not full.

Superintendent Murray was                  standing with a pers onal                radio    in his      hand a sking

Chief S u p e rintendent           D uckenfield for a decision.

It was   evident          there     exist ed   a   tremendous          p r oblem    for   officers       outside          the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superint endent              Duckenfield was deeply considering                     the situation.

I recall      him        thinking    aloud words          to    the    effect      - If   there's     likely         to    be

serious injury or d eath outside I have no option than to open the gates                                              - He

told Superintendent Murray,                  "Open the Gates".

Superintendent            Murray     gave   the    general        ins truction       over    the    radio       to    open

the gates .

On the m o n i t o r I saw the c oncertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the p l aying area.                                         The play was

at the Penistone Road end.

I became      aware        of   a perimeter        track       gate    being    opened    and people        being         let

onto the track out of the pen be hind the goal and usher ed and p o i n t e d in the

direction of the part where                  there was still plenty of space.

The mo vem e n t seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

Fans were going onto the track                     starting to move             in the d i r e c t i o n as directed

but then stopping and standing                     wa tching the game.

A P o licewoman was in control of the gate into the area where                                     there was space

but did not open it.

I thought          she    probably       didn't    have    a radio        or h a n d n 't sensed     that    she must

 open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

 I began      to    sense       youths    would    run    onto     the    playing     area   so    ran    out    of       the

 control point,            through    the uncovered            seats     onto   the perimeter        track and got

 the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.                                               More

 and   more    were       coming     onto   the    track,        I was    ushering them      to    the    open        gate

 and the Policewoman assisted.

I went b ehi nd a d v e r t i s i n g hoardings                  to p r event        persons       encroaching          onto    the

playing area.

I    could        see    people     pushed         up   against           the       fence       but     not    aware     of     any

particular          problems      or   injuries         as   there        is    a    steady       stream of people             onto

the perimeter track.

More       and    more    people    on      the    track     and       b e g i nning      to move       onto     the    grass    by

the goal line .

I see Superintendent G r e e n w o o d on top of the fence,                                 h avin g climbed up and he

is gesturing by w a v i n g his arms and asking for the game                                       to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves C o n trol are not u n d e r s t a n d i n g his request.

I    run    to     control    but      by    the    un covered          seats       I meet        S u p e r inten dent    Murray

with his          hat on running            the   opposite way.              We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's atten t i o n to stop the

game .

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running                                    towards      the referee.

There       are    lots    of fans     in the Liverpool goalm o u t h                     in front of Leppings Lane

Terrace.

I think it is a public order situation.

As     they      are    Liverpool      supporters,           I    run     onto      the     playing       area    and    protect

Nigel C l o u g h in case any Liverpool supporters try to a t t a c k him.

When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

people        spilling onto         the playing area.                   There       is quite          clearly in my m i n d a

major       public        order    situation        which        will     need       a    large       unifor m   presence       to

control.

I am in the centre of the playi ng area,                               in plain clothes.

There is nothing I can use fully do in a public c^ler                                       t
                                                                   - 1 1 -




return to the Police C o n trol point.

En    route       I    am       passed    by    u n i f orm ed        reinfo r c e m e n t s       as    I   pass        through       the

uncovered seating.

On    re-ent e r i n g          control       room    I    learn          that       persons       are    suspected          of    being

in j u r e d .

An    ambulance            is    called       for    and     quickly               arrives    behind         the    Leppings        Lane

goal.

A    message          is   relayed       to    Police       control            that    many       people     are        injured.       As

they are not               local people,         Chief Superinten dent                      Duckenfield decides                 to call

out C a s ualty Bureau staff.

I am     directed           by Assistant            Chief    Constable,               Mr.    Jackson,        to call        for Chief

Superintendent Addis and request he comes                                          to Hillsborough.

I make the request by telephone to Force O peratio ns                                             Room as instructed.

I've     no      accurate         assessment          of    time,            but    this    call    should         be    r e c orded    on

tape     in      Force       Control.          Coins       or      other           items    are    being      thrown       at     Police

Control          in    large      numbers.           In    vi ew     of       the    situation          unfolding,         'Operation

Support'         is authorised.

All available personnel are deployed in area.

I    suggest           I    go    to   Hammerton           Road       Police          Station       and      receive        Operation

Support personnel and deploy them from there as d i r ected by Groun d Control.

I go to Hammerton Road Police                         Station.

I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop C hief I n s p ector Shaw

in a marked Police car.                       He conveys me                  to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I change into unifor m and act at this location as Incident Commander.

Officers          are deployed as requested                        from Ground Control                   to specific         areas      in

 I remain to organise                  Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

E m m L record of evems at hillsborough football g h u p cn igm april,   1989


I am a Senior Registrar- in Diagnostic Radiolog/ in Sheffield. On the 15th April, 1989,
I attended the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough. I was at the edge
of the Kop, in the Nottingham Forest end.

Wien the match was stopped and spectators frcm the Leppings Lane end came onto the
pitch, all I saw initially were people who were limping. At this time I did not see
anybody lying on the ground. However, after what must have been probably 10 minutes,
I realised that the situation was obviously more serious and made rry way down onto
the pitch.

At approximately 3.15 p.m. I went to the Leppings Lane end of the pitch. There were
many bodies round the goal with a largp number of spectators and police. Only a anall
timber of these bodies were being administered to at this time. Having already contacted
a senior police office cn the pitch I set about examining as many of the bodies that
I could. I was then accompanied by a female psychiatric nurse frcm Liverpool, whose
name I do not know.

I examined probably up to 20 people. In nr/ opinion the majority of these were already
dead. Together with the nurse axl several other spectators I administered and organised
basic resuscative measures to approximately 6 or 7 people. This comprised of mouth
to mouth resuscitation and external cardiac massage. There was no available oxygen
equipment, airways or any means of suction.    Several,of the people whan I sav had vcmit
within their mouths and throats and would clearly have benefited from suction.

Gn only one patient did I feel that external cardiac massage and otter resuscitative
techniques had been successful. This patient was subsequently transferred to an ambulance
and taken to the hospital. The other people whan I dealt with could not be resuscitated.

There were a great many people standing around, seme of whan were extremely agitated.
This scmewhat hampered the ability to assess any patients who would have benefited
frcm immediate resuscitation. The overall situation was obviously very confused at
this point. The only physician that I was aware of at this time was Dr. Purcell, the
Sheffield Wednesday Club doctor. After approximately 20-30 minutes when it had beccme
apparent that the remaining people at the Leppings Lane end were already dead and
those which had been resuscitated had been sent to hospital, I went down to the other
end of the football pitch (the Kop end). I was accompanied by Dr. Purcell and two
nurses iron Liverpool. Between the four- of us we then attempted resuscitation cn 4
more people on the pitch. None of these attempts were successful. By this time a
great many people were being carried cn advertising hoardings off the pitch. Several
patients to my knowledge had been transferred by ambulance to the local hospitals.
There was still no oxygen available or any other aids for resuscitation, as far as
I was aware.

When it became apparent that there were no further people for resuscitation at the
Kop end, a police officer then requested that we go into the Sheffield Wednesday gymnasium
which had been converted into a temporary mortuary.

In the mortuary there were lines of people lying cn the floor. Together with a local
G.P., Dr. Redgrave, I then examined as many of these people as I could. All the people
that I examined within the g/mnasium were in my opinion already dead. I examined
approximately 20 people within the g/mnasium. No resuscitative attempts were made
within the gymnasium. In each case I certified the person to be dead and notified
the attending policeman that in my opinion the patient was dead and gave the policeman
my nane.

When we were satisfied that we had examined all the people cn the floor I waited for
further instructions frcm the police. No further duties were required of' me and at
approximatley 5.A5 p.m. I left the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground.

The points which I feel are important are as follows:

1. There were no calls via the public address system for medical and nursing staff
to help. It was cnly after 10 minutes that I realised frcm the other1 end of the ground
that the situation was so grave.

2. As far as I was aware, there were no aids for resuscitation, such as oxygen, airways,
or suction device to clear1 vomit from the mouth.

3. Assessment of patients cn the field, seme of whan may have been able to be resuscitated
was hampered by a large number of people, many of them very agitated.

 I hope this is of sane value. If further information is required I shall of course
 be willing to provide it.

       ROGER         HOULDSWORTH          of

                 WILL      STATE



;     am 4 2 years old and up to the week comm enc ing                            10th April        I

was     employed           as     Technical      Director     by        M.W.       (Technology)

Limited         of       Sheffield.        I had been employed in that                    ca pac ity

for      some        2    years until I resigned mv position.                       I     hold     an

H.U.C.       qualification               as an Electronics Engineer.                    Prior      to

workina         with       M.W.     (Technology)      Limited           I    had     previously

worked        for        more     than    10 years abroad,         in       the     electronics

fi eld .



When I returned from working abroad,                       in 198 6,        I was approached

by     the then Company Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club,        Dick        Chester,        who asked me to assist in                 relation        to

certain         problems          the     Club   were having       with           their       closed

circuit         television          systems      (CCTV).     I understand               the      CCTV

system        then installed had been put in place by Philips Alarms

in     about         1984 but that Company had subsequently gone out                               of

business.



I     did look at the system at Mr. Chester's request and as then

designed and installed it was not working properly.




                                                                                                        r
Shortly            afterwards       I   ;oined M.W.        (Technology)        Limited        and

use         rhe      computer system re la ted to i t .               I also     re-designed

-he      CCTV        system       which had seen installed by              the     Club       for

Police . use - this being a separate system from that                               operated

by the Club for its own o u r p o s e s .

This      consisted of a number of static T .V . cameras situated at

strategic                points    around    the     ground.     As     aresult     of       my

exammmu              the     system I arranged for some additional ...cameras

co     be - installed to enhance it, particularly when                            the     Spion

Kod part of the ground was re-opened in 19 8 6.



3emc        a static system the cameras                    are in a fixed position            and

entrances,                 and there was also a cameracovering the                  players'

entrance.                Within the CCTV room, situated in the south                      stand

near       the       players' entrance,          there is a bank          of     20 monitors

plus       a monitor for the computer system.                     This computer system

records            the     number of spectators            who come through the turn-

stiles            for      each    separate,     area       of the .ground.        Of         the.

The Police system

This        consisted            of     5     fully   functional          remote     controlled

cameras        - i.e.         those cameras could pan tilt through 3 60°, and

zoom     on        a     16/160 lens.           They are controlled from                 a    Police

control        box       which         is fixed in position at              the     south          west

corner        of       the    ground,         adjacent to the western              end       of      the

south         stand.             The        cameras   for     the    Polios        system            are

positioned as fo l l o w s :-



        1     on       the    upper south west corner                of     the     west

        stand;                                                                                    • •



        2     are       positioned on the top of the south                        stand,

        1 at           about its centre point and the. other to                      the.                   . ;

        eastern end of. the stand at the top;



        1 at the top (rear)                   of the roof of the Spion Kop;
              it the south '.vest corner or the ground, mounted

        in     nigh           near     the score board and close              tc     the

        2oii.cc control hex.



Within       me       Police control box there are 7 T.V. monitors.                                 5 of

them        are dedicated,             1 to each of the CCTV cameras.                    The other

2     are     connected to special time                    lapse Video      Recorders,               and

you     can       switch from camera to camera by means of                           a     passive

switch        within the control room so that the Officer in                                Charge

can     record          the         scene     being displayed on any          1      of     the        5

cameras.              The      remaining        2   monitors are used         so      that          the

Officer        can          check which of the 5 cameras are being                        recorded

at     any     given time.              ?.C. Trevor Bishop was the             Officer              who

worked        the       CCTV system for the Police but it was                       not      usual

for     him to be alone in the control room - there might perhaps

be     2 or 4 other Officers in there ’
                                      with him at any given                                     time

for     their own reasons - .e.g.                   to watch a section of the                crowd

from an elevated position.



Within        the Police control box there is also a telephone,                                 land,

line     which          is      part of Sheffield Wednesday               F.C.'s          internal

telephone             system,        and      the Police have       their     own.        separate

telephone         land lines installed also.                        ...                         .          .



The events of Saturday,                      15th April,    1989          .                     .. . .

Although          I     had previously resigned my position as                       Te ch n ic a l

Director          of        M. W.    (Technology) L i m i t e d I   was a s k e d by       Graham

Mackrel 1         to        attend      at     the ground on that day.         in        case        my
                                                         -    5    -




assistance was required.                          We knew that the F.A.                Cup semi-final

between        Liverpool                 F.C.     and        Nottingham Forest           F.C.        was     a

sell-out           all ticket match and I arrived at the ground                                      fairly

aariv         on     the Saturday morning to check that everything                                         was

in     order.        I was in fact asked to rectify a fault on 1 of the

Police        CCTV       cameras,              the one at the south west                 corner          near

the     score board.                    I checked it,             found it was not           functioning

properiv           and        I        made the necessary adjustments to                       the       iris

controls           within the camera and thereafter checked that it was

working        OK.            Late        in the morning I then went                    to     the       CCTV

control        room where P.C.                   Harold Guest was also in                    attendance,

as     usual.            In            addition         there was present Doug               Lock,         the

Security           Officer for Sheffield Wednesday F.C.                               and _____________

of     M.W.        (Technology).                 P.C.    Guest,        as a matte r      of     routine,

would     have           ensured early in the morning that cassette                                     tapes

were     inserted                 in     the     19 VCRs - 1 of course                 would       not      be

recording           a picture because the camera was out of action                                         but

P.C.     Guest           would           nevertheless routinely load all                       19.         The

authorised           crowd              capacity        figures for each section                   of      the

ground        was        part of the data stored in the computer,                               and        the

display            monitor              for     the     computer         would   show        how         many

spectators           came              through each of the turnstiles in                       operation

as     the day went on.                       The system was so designed that when the

turnstiles           for a particular area had admitted 90% capacity to

that     area, the                 total for that section would flash on the                             T.V.

screen        and if,                  for example,          one part of the ground was              being

filled        up     quickly              and there was capacity                 in     another          part

(subject           to segregation of supporters)                          that would enable                the
                                                     -    6    -




Police         to     be        aware     that       they          should     direct        re maining

supporters           to     a     different set of turnstiles.                     Each          of     the

turnstiles           was        also fitted w ith an infra-red ray sensor,                               so

that     if     spectators              tried to climb over the                  turnstiles             but

within        the     turnstile enclosure,                     that would also be            recorded

on      the         screen,           under    a     separate           heading.       I         produce

[Exhibit       1]     a copy of the print-out from the computer monit or

for      the         game        in     question.             Numbers       climbing       over         the

turnstiles          within the enclosure would be shown on the                                    column

headed        "Check        Total".           The        first      heading      "Gate"          is     the

turnstile           number        through which the fans entered,                       the           "Gate

Total”        shows        the        number who entered through each                       of        those

I     was aresent in the CCTV control room from about 11.30                                            a.m.

that     morning           when the turnstiles were opened and                          spectators

were     entering the ground.                      The Spion Kop and the south                        stand

had     been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters,                                        and the

north     stand           and     west    stand      (including Leppings               Lane)          were

reserved        for        Liverpool supporters.                    The authorised           capacity

for the various sections of the ground was as follows:-



                      Spion Kop                                     21,000

                      South Stand covered                            5,524

                      South Stand uncovered                          3,310

                      West Stand                                     4,465

                      Leppings Lane                                 10,100

                      North Stand                                    9,702

3y about 2.45 p.m. the Kop and the south stand areas were full

of     Nottingham              Forest supporters but the north stand and                      the

west     stana areas were only afiout 2/3 full at that time and it

was     noticeacle              from the static camera covering the                   Leppings

Lane     turnstiles that there was a build-up of fans outside the

turnstiles           in that area.              I produce        [Exhibit 2] a plan of the

ground     showing the Leppings Lane entrance to the west and the

turnstiles           (7        in     number)    which          admit   spectators     to     the

terraced        area of the west stand are designated A/G.                            It     will

be     seen that to the south of those turnstiles runs a concrete

path     which leads around eventually to the south stand.                                   That

path     is bounded on the one side                        (the south)   by the river         Don

and     on the north side by a high brick wail.                            Situated in that

wail     just        immediately            beyond the turnstiles           - i.e.     to     the

east     of them - was an exit gate designated Gate C which is                                  a

double     gate           of        the   concertina metal type           which      was     kept

closed.         One        of        the static cameras of the CCTV               system      was

situated        on        a post just east of that gate,                 the camera         being

positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.



It     was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that

camera     that it was possible to see the build-up of supporters

outside     the turnstiles.                  The Police had erected some barriers

across     the        pathway a short distance east of Gate C                         so    that

spectators           could not w a l k along that pathway to get access to

the south stand.                    The build-up of Liverpool supporters outside

the     Lecpings Lane entrance was such that some had been forced
bevond        the entrance to the turnstiles outside Gate C and some

of those supporters were visible within the field of vision of

the static camera.



The     cosition           was such that I recall commenting,         at     perhaps

2.50        p.m.,    "For God's     sake why don't they delay the kick-off"

and     I     made     that comment in the presence of         Doug        Lock     and

P.C. Guest.            We     were all,   as I recall,   in general        agreement

that        it would be sensible to postpone the kick-off to                  enable

people        tc get into the ground,         although I do not recall             that

anyone        in     the     CCTV control room attempted      to     contact        the

Police        by radio or telephone to suggest that.               The Police        of

course were monitoring the situation themselves                    from their own

CCTV        system,    and in particular using the camera on the                  south

west        corner     of the wes t stand roof.      We could of course             see

that        chat camera was trained on the Leppings Lane               turnstiles

because        we were able to monitor the Police pictures on one of

the     monitors           within   our control room,    although we       did      not

have the facility to record that picture.



There        came     a time when Gate C appeared to be opened,               and     a

number        of spectators rushed through into the           "reservoir" area

between        the     turnstiles and the rear of the west            stand.         An

examination           of     the video recording appears to indicate              that

this         occurred        when the Police opened the gate in an            effort

to     eject one of the spectators that way,              and a number of           the

fans        pressed through fro m the outside.           It would appear          that
                                        - 9 -



several        hundred       got     through      before    the     gates        were        again

closed.



Subsequently           the     static        camera picked up the           fact        that     a

number     of     fans       climbed up over the            structure           housing        the

turnstiles,           and    jumped down into the           reservoir area              inside.

That     is,     it     seems,        further     indication        of     the     pressures

building        up outside the turnstiles although a steady flow                                of

spectators        was coming through those turnstiles at all                             times,

in the normal way.



I     recall     that        after     the first influx        of        several        hundred

spectators        through Gate C Doug Lock left the CCTV room to                                go

outside         presumably            to     report   the   matter         to     the        Club

Secretary,        Graham Mackrell,             and/or to check the position                    for

himself on the ground.



Some     time    later,       I am unsure of the exact time,                    I heard over

the     Police        radio     (we        had one in the CCTV           room)     a     Senior

Police     Officer           make a request that a gate be opened                       at    the

Leppings        Lane        entrance.       Police control asked which gate                    he

wished     opened           and he repeated his request 2 or 3 times.                          On

about     the     fourth occasion he said "Someone is going                             to    die

here.     Open        the gate" and Police control replied "If                          someone

is going to die open the gate,                   open the gate".
                                                 -    10   -




As     appears           from the video tape recording the scene the                             gate

was     then        opened apparently by a uniformed P.C.,                      and        a     huge

nurnner of fans flooded into the area.



At     that     point in time I realised,                      from the    numbers         already

displayed           on the monitor as having entered from the                             Leppings

Lane turnstiles,               that a dangerous situation was being created,

j left the room and went down the p l a y e r s ' tunnel to the pit ch

and     just        as     I    did so the Referee stopped the                 match            as     I

recall.            I looked over to the west stand area and I saw                                fans

climbina        over the fence and my first thought at that time was

that     it was a pitch invasion,                    and the match had been                stopped

for     that reason.                 The perimeter fencing at that point is high

and     not        easy        to climb over.         I sat down in the           stand          area

behind        the        dug-out,       and watched the situation for                 a        little

time     -     perhaps 2 or 3 minutes before I realised what                                really

was      occurring.                    One   of the        Sheffield      Wednesday         ground

staff        came down the tunnel holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed

one     frcm him and ran across wit h it to help ferry the injured

people        to     the        gymnasium area where the first-aid                    room           was

situated.            It        was     in fact only after I had ferried 3                       or     4

injured        people           in that way that I then realised                  that          there

were     many people who had died as a result,                            and the gym was in

fact designated as a temporary mortuary.



After        helping           on     the    pitch as much as          possible       at        about

4.15/4.30           p.m.       I went back to the CCTV room where

and     P.C.       Guest were present,               and I had a cup of coffee and                     a


                                                                                                           i   r

cigarette.            Subsequently I took print-outs of the                           attendance

from the computer monitor, and ejected the tapes from the VCRs

leaving them in the machines in the ejected position so that I

could      later        know       exactly     which           tape     related        tc       whicn

monitor/area.



I   normally          take     3    print-outs from              the     computer         for     the

attendance        figures,          2 of which go to the                 Secretary,         Graham

Mackreil,        and        the third will normally to the                      Ticket      Office

staff.         However        on this occasion, since it was an                        F.A.       Cup

semi-final,           all     ticket,      I   did        at     first       give     the       third

print-out        to     P.C.       Guest at his request,                since he       said       his

Superior         Officers          might     want        it.         Later    however       Graham

Mackreil        said        that    he wanted to keep all 3                   in    his     secure

possession and I therefore retrieved it from P.C. Guest.



      about 6.15/6.30 p.m. Gr ah am Mac kr e 11 asked me to ensure the

video     room was properly secured.                     ____________         and     P.C. Guest

had     left     the ground at that time.                      I went to the         CCTV room,

locked     the cupboard doors where the VCRs were and                                 then locked

the     room and activated the alarm system for the room.                                   I kept

the     key in my possession overnight.                         On locking the            cupboard

doors     where        the     VCRs     were I       do        not     recall       specifically

checking that all the tapes were still in the machine but I do

recall     that        as I finally left the ground at about 7.30                                p.m.

that     night,
          I asked the Security Guard at the players'                                entrance       to




                                                                                                        Ii
                                        -    12   -




ensure    that     no-one     entered       the CCTV   room   overnight.     He

promised to do so.



I returned to the around at             9 a.m. on the Sunday morning'       and

checked     the    room     where it    was still locked      and   the   alarm

operative•        However when I opened up the room and checked the

VCRs     I found that 2 tapes were missing.            One of those was the

tape relating to the camera which looks over Gates 9 - 1 6 ,                and

the other was from the VCR which had not been activated at the

time.      I have no idea who removed the tapes - I mentioned                it

to     the Security Officer, Doug Lock, and he was surprised                and

had no knowledge of it.



I have read this Statement and it is correct to the best of my

knowledge and beliei.

a position         just above         the       turnstiles.        The    s u r v e y was     c a r r i e d out

using a hand held v i d e o c a m e r a m o u n t e d              on the p l a t f o r m of a

on a p o l e        at the       far mos t corner of the L e p p i n g s                 Lane     turnstiles

the c o u r t y a r d at the rear of the L e p p i n g s Lane                     terrace.         The    system

co m p l e t e d quick en o u g h and the p l a n n e d m o v e                 for the c a m e r a was

sus p e n d e d until the summer break.

On S a t urday       15 April        1989,       I c o m m e n c e d duty at 10 am a t t e n d i n g at

the police room at H i l l sborough,                     collecting            the hand held V H S radio

w hich I used to m o n i t o r            transmissions           via O p e r a t i o n s    Room.       On this

parti c u l a r day channel             1 had       been d e s i g n a t e d    for all V H F

t r a n s m i s s i o n r e l a t i n g to the      Semi Final.

After colle c t i n g the radio I made my way to the L e p pings                                   Lane

 terrace where            I saw that        Roger H o l d s w o r t h was w o r k i n g on cam e r a

 number      5 which overlooks              the     Leppings Lane terrace pens.                    The

 picture quality had been su b s t a n d a r d                  for a number of weeks                   and Mr

 H o l d s w o r t h was c a r r y i n g out some last mi n u t e a l t e r a t i o n s            to upgrade

 the picture.             After he had com p l e t e d the w o r k the picture was
indeed better         than it had been a l t h o u g h -not up to the c o r r e c t

standard.        I then m a d e m y w a y to the Control                    Bo x w h e r e     I met w i t h

Sergeant G o d d a r d and PC Ryan.               A f t e r a brief c o n v e r s a t i o n         I began

to c h e c k the v i d e o s y s t e m o p e r a t i n g eac h of the five c a m e r a s                  in

turn.     We were       later     joined by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y and            it was

agreed between us that S e r geant                  G o d d a r d w o u l d operate           the p e r s o n a l

radio,    PC Ryan the          tannoy and tel e p h o n e           and I in a d d i t i o n        to my

duties     as ca m e r a o p e r a t o r w o u l d m o n i t o r    the V H F    set u s i n g      it if

necessary.         These duties were no d i f f e r e n t                to what w o u l d be c a r r i e d

out on a normal m a t c h day.

A r o u n d 10.55 am that date,             Superintendent             Chapman contact              control

the    5 Arches      public      house.       There was at this time no trou b l e                           but

the    i n f o r mation was p a s s e d      just so that o f f i c e r c ould be aware                        that

groups     of suppo r t e r s     had a r r i v e d and were           intent      on g e t t i n g a drink

before     the match.          Several      other p e r s o n a l      r adio m e s s a g e s were           then

re c e i v e d r e g a r d i n g the same topic.

About     11.20 am Sergeant            G o d d a r d c a r r i e d out radio checks                some

personal       radios     did not re ply and the sector                     Insp e c t o r s were a sked

to make checks w here appro priate.                       Throu g h o u t     this    time various

 the ground,        Ml motorway,         Parkway,       etc,       d i v e r s i o n s were     in force.

This     indicated that          the N o t t i n g h a m s u p p o r t e r s were en route              in

 numbers and could be e x p e c t e d at the ground for the tur n s t i l e

Just a fter noon         I i n s e r t e d the    2 VH S v i d e o tapes           in the two v i d e o

to run at normal          speed,     my    i n tention      b eing that a r o u n d          2.30     pm the

same date     I would       inset    2 new tapes w h i c h w o u l d             then     include       the

build up to the m a t c h t h r o u g h o u t        the game and the s u p p o r t e r s

had e n t e r e d the ground.

A short    time later        it was d i s c o v e r e d that some              of the P e n i s t o n e

was c o r r e c t e d by d e p l o y i n g one of the spare serials.                       Some      time

between    1.00 pm and         2.30 pm there was conc e r n e x p r e s s e d r e g a r d i n g

the Liverpool         fans p u r c h a s i n g Kop tickets           from touts at L e p pin gs

Lane turnstiles..          This w o u l d mea n of course                 that a m i x t u r e of           fans

w ould have       to be s u p e r v i s e d w i t h i n the Kop terrace.

During this        same p e r i o d p r o blems      began aris i n g          in v a r i o u s public

houses near to the ground ones                    that spring to m i n d were                  the Horse

and Jockey and the Royal.                  The c o m p l a i n t s were        that     fans were

drinking heavily out on the street,                       urinating           in gardens           and being

a general     nuisance.         Some time betw e e n           1.30 pm and 2.00 pm I began

to notice     that on the Kop several                  Liv e r p o o l    fans had been pl a c e d

in the triangle area near to the N orth Stand end s u p e r v i s e d by

several police officers.                  I set ca m e r a     4 to m o n i t o r       the s i tuation

noticing that several             arrests were made                and that m a n p o w e r was

getting low.          I r e m e m b e r e d that there had been some trouble at last

years m a t c h    in the same location and I q u e s t i o n e d S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Murray re the number of officers ava i l a b l e                         for d e p l o y m e n t    on the

Kop.
Superintendent Murray                 then c o n t a c t e d   Inspector            Sewell    regarding          the

ma n p o w e r   si t u a t i o n and he c o n f i r m e d that        2 c o a c h e s eac h c o n t a i n i n g

40 men w o u l d be on s t a n d b y in P e n i s t o n e            Road.

Ar o u n d 2.00 pm S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y and Chief                Superintendent

D u c k e n f i e l d went    to s peak to the m a t c h referee.                     T h r o u g h the

af t ernoon c o m p l a i n t s     had been e x p r e s s e d r e g a r d i n g the          q u a l i t y of

personal         radio t r a n s m i s s i o n s    to the control          staff.

Aro u n d 2.00 pm I o v e r h e a d on V H F that                 Liv e r p o o l    s u p p o r t e r s had been

spoken to on a c oach w h i c h had d i s p l a y e d a N o t t i n g h a m Forest

supporters park i n g ticket.                      The coach and s u p p o r t e r s were            spoken       to

by traffic o f f icers             and advised.

About the same time                there was a report              of t r o u b l e s o m e   Liv e r p o o l

fans on a coach r e g i s t e r e d number                 9995    RU.      This nu m b e r was

c i r c u l a t e d and the c o a c h was chec k e d by one of the m o b i l e                       serials.

Around       2.20 pm the ACC            Jackson was         in the control             box w h e n he

noticed a man on the Leppi n g s Lane terr a c e                          south pen.           He d r o p p e d

his trousers           and began        fooling about.             His b e h a v i o u r was       such that

it was b e l i e v e d that he was drunk and the ACC a sked for s o m e t h i n g

to be done about him.                   I set the c a m e r a to m o n i t o r his behaviour.

About      2.15 pm all the control r oom staff d i s c u s s e d that                            it was

apparent         the L i veprool        fans had not begun to arrive                       as yet.        The

North Stand had vast                 spaces        a l t hough the Leppi n g s Lane            terrace was

 filling up at a normal                 rate.        Just after this the p e r sonal                  radio

t r a n smissions        became w orse and the c i v i l i a n radio repair man came

 into the control box to attempt a repair.
About    2.30 pm my a t t e n t i o n was d rawn to the                   large c r o w d o u t s i d e        the

L e p pings Lane turnstiles.                    I would estimate          around       3,000 p e o p l e       and

it was apparent            that the n umber was             i n c r e a s i n g by the v o l u m e       of

foot p a s s e n g e r s   in L e p p i n g s   Lane   itself.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it

was said that although it was more than normal,                                  it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

A bout   2.35 pm the c i v i l i a n radio repair ma n s t a t e d that he could

not   fix the p e r sonal          radio s y s t e m and        it was      n e c e s s a r y to resort            to

using the radios            on a back to back system.

About the same time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield came to the

back of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied                                   'Yes'.

A p e r sonal radio on L e p pings Lane r e q u e s t e d more m a n p o w e r                      to

Leppings       Lane    turnstiles.              Sergeant    Sorsby d e s p a t c h e d      2 horses          from

the South Stand car park.

A personal        radio m e s s a g e     then came        in stat i n g that the gates were

being forced,          they were         be nding and buckling.                 In    my m i n d I

b e l ieved that the gates               r e f e r r e d to were      'C' gate        and I kept the

L eppings      Lane camera set to that                 sort of area.

A bout    2.40 pm Chief           Superintendent           D u c k e n f i e l d and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Mu r r a y req u e s t e d that      I contact O p e r a t i o n s       Room so that a traffic

car wit h a PA sy s t e m c ould at t e n d in Leppi n g s                    Lane and a d v i s e d the

crowd w h i c h were by this time b e c oming a p p a r e n t l y more                        hostile.             I

also remember ar o u n d this time that Sergeant                            G o d d a r d p i c k e d up the

personal       radio tel e p h o n e style handset and after trying to use                                    it,

 threw it down onto the desk because                         it was not w o r k i n g and the
personal      radio -transmissions were ver y poor.                         I can r e m e m b e r   se e i n g

about    5 or 6 o f f i c e r s    s tood on b a r r i e r duty          just past       the gate       'C'

towards     the South Stand.

A bout    2.40 pm I r e m e m b e r      seeing       'C'   gate open and a nu m b e r of

s u pporters enter the            ground.         I then said w ords           like     'They've

broken down the gate'.                 At the same          time    I i n d i c a t e d to the staff

in the control         box to w a t c h the L e p p i n g s         Lane monitor.           A fter about

20 seconds       I n o t i c e d that        the gate was cl o s e d and it s e e m e d that a

m o u n t e d officer alone had p r e v e n t e d a big rush of pe o p l e                   through

the open gate.           I remember           seeing m o u n t e d o f f i c e r s   tr y i n g to clear

space     in the crowd.

The request        for a d d i t i o n a l    o f f icers   to be sent to L e p p i n g s Lane was

made     to Inspector        Sewell      and I r e m e m b e r him o f f e r i n g two Serials,

one of w h i c h was       the    'F' D i v i s i o n Crime        and Vandal,        they were

d i r e c t e d to the L e p pings Lane end of the ground.

I saw L i v erpool       fans c l i m b i n g the w a l l s of the gr o u n d onto the

t u rnstile roofs and I in p a r t i c u l a r r e m e m b e r several                 b eing sat

astride     gate     'B' w i t h police o f f icers            stood below.           I think at this

time a personal          radio m e s s a g e was sent r e g a r d i n g the c l i m b e r s          and

an offi c e r repl i e d that he could not reach them.

Around     2.45 pm I r e m ember             a personal      radio mess a g e        from

Superin t e n d e n t M a r shall      to the effect            'We must open the gates or

someone      is going to be killed,                 please open the gates.'

At this      time Chief        Inspect or M c R o b b i e      is in the control            box w e a r i n g

civilian clothing.

I r e m ember    seeing an officer on the top of the turns t i l e s                           at

Leppings      Lane end and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d made
e n quiries as to the o f f i c e r ' s         identity.        Another personal               radio

m e s s a g e was   received    fro m S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a rshall,        his v o i c e was

very d istressed,          'You must       open the gates,          open the gates'.                  Chief

Superintendent          Duckenfield        seemed to pause          for t h o u g h t and then

said    'Right      if lives are at risk,             then open the gates'.                    S e r geant

Godd a r d then t r a n s m i t t e d    'Open the gates,          open the          gates'.        Just

prior to this           I remember       seeing o f f icers      be h i n d    'A'    gate,     t h e y were

set out      in two lines       forming a funnel.              Sergeant          Higg i n s    of   'F'     C&V

tr a n s m i t t e d on p e r sonal     radio   ’There are people b e i n g c r u s h e d

outside      'A' gate we must            open   'A' gate'.

I r e m ember that about the time                the gates were o r d e r e d to be o p e n e d

m o u n t e d offic e r s outside L e p pings         Lane t u r n s t i l e s    had m a n a g e d    to

create a void between the turns t i l e s                 and the outer              perimeter

railings,       in fact,     I b e l i e v e d that at one time the o f f i c e r s m a n a g e d

to close      the outer gates,            however,     the c rowd outs i d e           forced       its w a y

through the outer gates                 and ran into the ground via                   'C'     gate at

least.       I r e m ember   seeing crowds at the rear of L e p p i n g s Lane

terrace      just behind the turnstiles,                 they were        just       stood about          not

doing a n y t h i n g    in particular.

About     2.55 pm Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    D u c k e n f i e l d told control           roo m

staff to get some m a n p o w e r to the North Stand to stop any pos si b l e

rush onto the pitch.              It was at this time that we began to notice

Liverpool       fans c l i mbing up into the West                Stand fro m the terrace

area.     They were a s s i s t e d by people           in the stand and the same

p r o b l e m had occurred the previous year.                    A short time later                 fans

were seen to climb the per i m e t e r track fence.                           O f f i c e r s on the

 track seemed to be tell i n g the fans to get down                            from the fence.               At
this    point the      staff     in the control            box and     I thought          that the

sit u a t i o n was pur e l y public         order.        No i n f o r m a t i o n was     coming      in to

the effect that people were g e t t i n g hurt.

A crowd g a t h e r e d on the          per i m e t e r t r a c k and Chief      Superintendent

D u c k e n f i e l d orde r e d that    they should be m o v e d as q u i c k l y as

po s sible to the w i n g sections              of L e p p i n g s Lane t e r r a c e where           it

could be seen that there was                   space.       Chief     Superintendent

D u c k e n f i e l d was a n g r y about    o f f icers    stood a r o u n d the         t rack near        to

the Kop and the N orth Stand.                   A personal        radio m e s s a g e was         sent      to

the officers and they were d i r e c t e d to the                     front    of the N o r t h

Stand.    Ar o u n d this time Chief            Ins p e c t o r M c R o b b i e was    sent to the

pitch to get things            sorted out.          One p r o b l e m was a WP C           s tood on the

pe r imeter track        just b e l o w the control            box.      She did not a p p e a r            to

be m o v i n g people off the            track and in fact at one stage op e n e d the

p e rimeter gate       to the track then w a l k e d off               leaving the gate open.

Chief    Inspector M c R o b b i e       took charge of the p o l i c e w o m a n and b egan

ushering people          f rom the track.           By this time there w ere peopl e                        on

the p itch and the per i m e t e r track gates were open a l l o w i n g people

out of the centre pens.                  Still at this         stage     no one       in the control

box was aware that            the p r o b l e m was more         than a pitch          invasion

situation.

Just after the m a t c h was             stopped ACC Jack s o n was            in the control               box

and he ordered me to contact O p e r a t i o n s                 R o o m and call         ope r a t i o n

support.        It was at this point that                  I d e c i d e d to c o n c e n t r a t e on

o p erating the VHF radio rather than the camera                            system.          Ver y

s u d denly it became apparent               that there were           injuries       and at that

time    I contacted Opera t i o n s          Room for ambul a n c e s         to be       sent to the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.                      There were people all over the
pitch     in front of the goal mouth,                     p e r s o n s were   laid ac r o s s      the    ..

floor wit h persons              g i v i n g m o u t h to mouth.        It was onl y then that we

began to feel that there m i g h t                   be deaths.         A personal         radio message

was    sent to control                a s k i n g for bolt   cutters an d S e r g e a n t        Goddard

con t a c t e d C l a y w h e e l s    Lane as k i n g   if the y had cutt e r s         on the br i- m a c

transporter.            The r e p l y was negative.              He tur n e d to me and             I told

him that        I w ould      contact       the fire service w h i c h            I did via

Operations         Room.        I made      it clear that we r e q u i r e d cutt i n g

equipment        for the metal             fences.       I r e m e m b e r someone      i n s t r u c t i n g PC

Ryan to use the t a n n o y t e l l i n g people                to stay calm.            I can r e m e m b e r

seeing bodies            b eing m o v e d towards the tunnel on the L e p p i n g s                      Lane

terrace       from the centre              pens.     I believe       that      it was    police

officers w h o were m o v i n g the bodies                   f rom the area.            Liverpool         fans

who were on the p i t c h started to run t o w a r d s the Kop.                              Officers

managed to stop the charge                     and split up several               groups     of fans who

were     fighting.          A line of officers were then formed across the

pitch      just the K o p side of the centre line.                          I recall       the    fire

service a r r i v i n g at L e p p i n g s Lane and their m e n r u n n i n g onto the

pitch.        I then sent a mess a g e             to O p e r a t i o n s that we did have

fatalities at the ground a l t h o u g h whe n                    I sent this m e s s a g e         no

details had been passed by personal                          radio.       It was all done             from

observation.             Further contact            from O p e r a t i o n s R o o m r e g a r d i n g the

number of a m bulance                 r e q uired and they said w o u l d          it be more         than      20

and I said s o mething to the effect that we need as m a n y as

 possible.

 Traffic m o t o r cycles were orde r e d to cover the routes to both

 hospitals and I made a request for the senior a m b ulance                                    office r to

 attend the control               box.       He did not arrive.             The    senior      fire
officer attended at the control box and liaised with senior

officers and he too asked to speak to the senior ambulance officer.

Another request was made for that officer to attend the control box

via Operations Room.

About   3.35 pm I chec k e d the v i d e o tapes and d i s c o v e r e d          that      one had

stopped and the second had been s w i t c h e d to oper a t e                in the         18 hour

mode w h i c h in effect      speeds      up the act i o n of the      scene b eing

recorded.      This   I can only think was caught by me w h i l s t                   standing

at the rear of the v i d e o control           area.     The videos are           set at knee

height and I believe          that as I leant        forw a r d this    is ho w I a l t e r e d

the time mode      setting.

I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr Clough and Mr Dalgleish entered the control box and offered

their services once they had established that the match was off.

Mr D a l g l e i s h w a n t e d to speak to the fans and he was a sked to use

the ta n n o y sys t e m in the DJs control          box b e l o w the police           control.

Superin t e n d e n t M u r r a y then later asked      for details         of t r a n s p o r t   so

that pre p a r a t i o n s could be made       for e m p t y i n g the ground.          I

remember     some time after this S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y    saying to PC

Ryan that he w a n t e d a mess a g e pass i n g over the t a n n o y t e l l i n g the

L iverpool    fans to stay calm and remain w here they were                        until the

a m bulances had left the Stadium.

Sometime     later the ground was emptied and around                   5.30 pm I removed

the v ideo tapes and m ade my way to the g y m to offer assistance.                                 I

was later sent to HQ w ith the v i d e o tapes and I there                       saw Chief

Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenfield,   Sergeant Booth,      ACC J a c k s o n and Chief

 Superintendent Denton.

About 11.00 Detective Superintendent McKay attended and he
instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes

into the property store and await the arrival of AVA,

           was to attend so that copies of the video tapes could be

made .

TREYOR BICHARD
POLICE CONSTABLE 1370

HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION
HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD.
TEL: 852211

I am a police constable with South Yorkshire police at present stationed at Hammerton
Road police station, Sheffield. I am at the present time working beat duties on »B*
group but also have resposibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough football stadium ^Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough stadium on many occasions as a spectator
standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop end of the ground and the leppings Lane terrace.
I have also worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my past 8 years
service.
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system working from the police
control box and since that time I have attended a 3 day course in relation to the use
of video systems for command and control and as a method of evidence gathering.
The original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a command and contol syatem
giving a basic all round view both inside and outside the ground. Whilst I have been invol­
ved with the duties the emphasis has shifted from command and control to evidence gathering
and with that end in mind several improvements have been made the most recent being a
survey of the Leppings Lane end camera, the intention being to move the camera from its
present position attached to the roof of the West stand bringing it down to a position
just above the turnstiles. The survey was carried out using a h a n d held video camera mount­
ed on the platform of a hydraulic lift. Two positions were considered, the first mounted
on a pole at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles the second position just
above gate ’B*. It was detided that the best position would be above *B» gate. This position
giving good all round views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and the court yard
at the rear of the Leppings Lane Terrace. The system installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to
complete a costing for the improvements and if the cash was available from the football
 trust, he would attempt to install the camera in it's new position in time for the semi­
final. Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be completed quick
 enough and the planned move for the camera was suspended untill the summer break.
On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at 10am attending at the police room at
 Hillsborough, collecting the hand held V.H.S. radio which I used to monitor transmissions
via X.S. (operations room). On this particular day channel 1 had been designat6dr,for all
V.H.P. transmission relating to the semi-final.
After collecting the radio I nade my way to the Leppings Lane terrace where I saw that
 Roger Holdsworth was working on camera number 5 which over looks the Leppings Lane terrace
 pens. The picture quality had been substanded for a number of weeks and Mr Holdsworth was
 earring out some last minute alterations to upgrade the picture. After he had completed
 the work the picture was indeed better thaa it had been although not upto the correct
 standard. I then made my way to the control box where I met with Sgt Goddard & P.C. Ryan
 afifcer a brief conversation I began to check the vidoe system operating each of the five
 cameras in turn. We were later joined by Supt Murray and it was agreed between us that
 Sgt Goddard would operate the personal radio, P.C. ftyan the tannoy & telephone and I in
 addition to my duties as camera operator would moiitor the V.K.P, set using it if necessary.
 These duties were no different to what would be carried out on a normal match day.
 Around 10.55am that date Supt Chapman contact control regarding a group of Liverpool
 supporters would were waiting outside the 5 Arches public house, there was at this time
 no trouble but the information was passed just so that officer could be aware that groups
 of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink before the match. Several
 other personal radio messages were then received regarding the same topic.
 About 11.20am Sgt Goddard carried out radio checks some P.R.’s did not reply and the sector
 Inspectors were asked to make checks where appropriate. Throughout this time various
 messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the City side of the ground, M 1 motor­
 way , Parkway etc diversions were inforce. This indicated that the Nottingham supporters
 were*on route in numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile opening time
 of 12,00 noon.
                                    -   2   -
Just after noon I inserted the 2 V.H.S. video tapes in the two video recorders. The time
and date system was checked and set possibley using the ground clock mounted above the
North stand or by a tine check with other officers in the control box. The tapes were set
to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30pm the same date I would insert
2 new tapes which would then include the build up to the match throughout the game and
the supporters leaving the ground. Around this time it was noticed that persons had entered
the ground.
A short time later it was discovered that son® of the Penistone Road turnstiles were not
manned due to an administrative error this was corrected by deploying one of the spare serial:
Some time between 1.COpm and 2.30pm there was concern expressed regarding the Liverpool fans
purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings Lane turnstiles. This would mean of course that
a mixture of fans would have to be supervised within,'the Kop terrace.
During this same period problems began arising in various public houses near to the ground
ones that spring to mind were the Horse and Jockey and the Royal. The complaints were that
fans were drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being a genral
nuisance. Some time between 1.30pm and 2.00pm I began to notice that on the Kop sereral
Liverpoolafans had been placed in the triangjle area near to the North Stand end supervised
by several police officers. I set Camera 4 to monitor the situation noticing that several
arrests were made and that manpower was getting low. I remembered that there had been
some trouble at last years match in the same location and I questioned        Supt Murray re the
number of officers available for deployment on the Kop. Supt Murray then contacted Insp
Sewell re^irding the manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing
40 men would be on stand-by in Penistone Road.
Around 2.00pm Supt M u r ^ i a n d C/supt Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee.
Through the afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quality„of P.R. trans­
missions, to the control staff.
Around 2.00pm I overheard on 7.H.P. thn.t Liverpool supporters had beea spoken to on a coach
which had displayed a Nottingham forest supports parking ticket. The coach and supporters
were spoken to by traffic officers and advised.
About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool fans on a coach registered .
number 9995 RU. This number was circulated and the coach checked by one of the mobile serials
Around 2.20pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he noticed a man on the Leppings
 Lane terrace South Pen. He dropped his trousers and began fooling about. His behaviour was
 such that it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something to be done about
 he. I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.
 About 2.15pm all the control room staff discus;:;ed that it was apparent the Liverpool fans
 had not begun to arrive as yet. The North stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane
 terrace was filling up at a normal rate. Just after this the P.R. transmissions became
 worse and the civilian radio repair man came into the control box to attempt a repair.
 About 2.30pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles
 I would estimate around 3,000 people and it was apparent that the number was increasing
 by the volume of foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.
 C/supt Duckenfield asked about the largs crowd and it was said that although it was morethan
 normal, its was no more than was expected for such a football match.
 About    2.35pm the Civilian radio repaiiman stated that he could not fix the P.R. system and it
 was necessary to resort to using the radios on a back to back systenc, *■
 About    the same time S/Duckenfield came to the back of the control box and asked       me ifthe
 crowd    scenes at the Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied ’YES*.
 A personl radio on Leppings Lane requested more man power to Leppings Lane turnstiles.
 Sgt Sorsby dispatched 2 horses from the South stand carpark.
 A P.R. message then came in stating that the gates are being forced, they were bending and
 buckling. In my mind I believed that the gates referred to were ’C ’ gate and I kept the
 Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.
 About 2.40pm S/Duckenfield & Supt Murray requested that I contact X.S. so that a traffic
  car with P.A. system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the crowd which were by
  this time becoming apparently more hostile. I also remember around this time that Sgt
  Goddard picked up the P.R. telephone style hand set and after trying to use it threw it
  down on to the desk because it was not working and the P.R. transmissions were very poor.
 1 can remember seeing about 5orb officers stood on barxier duty just pasted the gate *C*
  towards the South stand.
 About 2.40pm I remebcr seeing ’C ’ gate open and a number of supporters enter the ground
  I then said wor&s like * THEY’VE BROKEN DOWN THE GATE’. At the same time I indicated to
  the staff in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane Monitor. After about 20 seconds I
                                    -   3   -

noticed that the gate was closed and itseemed that a mounted officer alone had prevented
a big rush of people through the open gate. I remeber seeing mounted officers trying to cleax
space in the crowd .
The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was made to Inspector Sewell
and I remeber him offering two serials one of which was the ’F* Division crime and vandal
they were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground,
I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the     ground ontothe turnstile roofs and I
in particular remeber several being sat astide Gate *B' with police       officers stood below*
I think at this time a P.R. message was sent r e ^ r d i n g the climbers and an officer replied
that he could not reach them.
Around 2.45pm I remeber a P.R. message from Supt Marshall tothe effect ’ WE MUST OPEN THE
GATES OR SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED, .PLEASE OPEN THE GATES.’
At this time C/insp McRobbie is in the control box wearing civilian cldxfehing.
I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane end and C/supt
Ducenfield made enquries as to the officers identity. Another P.R. message was received
from Supt Marshall his voice was very distressed * YOU MUST OPEN THE GATES OPEN THE GATES’.
C/Supt Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then said ' 'RIGHT IP LIVES ARE AT RISK
THEN OPEN THE GATES.* Sgt Goddard then transmitted ’OPEN THE GATES OPEN THE GATES.*
Just prior to this I remeber seeing officers behand 'A' gate, they were set out in two lines
forming a funnel. Sgt Higgins of '5” C&V transmitted on P.R. ’ There are people being crushec
outside ’A ’ gate we must open 'A' gate*
I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opened mounted officers out­
side Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to create a void between the turnstiles and the
outer perimeter railings, in fact I believed that at one time the officers managed to
close the outer ^.tes, however the crowd outside forced its way through the outer gates
and ran into the ground via 'C' gate at least. I remeber seeing crowds at the rear of
Leppings Lane terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not doing
anything inparticular.
About 2.55pm C/supt Duckenfield told control room staff to get some man power to the North
stand to stop any possible rush onto the pitch. It was at this time that we began to notice
Liverpool fans climbing up into the west st;.nd from the terrace area. They were assisted
by people in the stand and the same puoblem had occured the previous year. The sole purpose
was so that fans with standing tickets could get into the seated area of the west stand.
A short tim later fan§ were seen to climb the perimeter track fence. Officers on the track
seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence. At this point the staff in the ..
 control box and I thought that the situation was purely public order, no information was
 coming in to the effect that people were getting hurt.
 A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and Q/Supt Duckenfield ordered that they should be
 moved as quickly as possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane terasace where it could be
 seen tirat there was space. C/supt Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the
 track near to the Kop and the North stand. A P.R. message was sent to the officers and they
 were directed to the front of the North stand. Around this time C/Insp Me Robbie was sent to
 the pitch to get things sorted out. One problem was a W.P.C. stood on the perimeter track
 just below the control box she did not appear to be moving people off the tracfa and in fact
   at one stage open the perimeter gate to the track then walk off leaving the gate open.
 C/Insp Me Robbie took charge of the police woman and began ushering people from the track.
 B y this time there were people on the pitch and the perimeter taack gates were open allowing
 people out of the center pens. Still at this stage no one in the control box was aware that
 the problem was more than a pitch invasion situation.
 Just after tbs match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box and he ordered me to
 contact X.S. and call operation support. It was at this point that I decieded to concentrate
 on operating the V.H.F. radio rather than the camera system. Very suddenly it became
 apparent that there were injuries and at that time I contacted X.S. for ambulances to be
 sent to the Leppings Lane end of the ground. There were people all over the pitch infront
 of the goal mouth, persons were laid across the floor with persons giving mouth to mouth
 it was only then that we began to feel that there might be deaths. A P.R. message was sent
 to control asking for bolt cutters and Sgt Goddard contacted claywheels Lane asking if they
 had cutters on the bri-mac transported. The reply was negative. He turned to me and I told
 him that I would contact the fire service which I did via X.S. I made it clear that we
 required cutting equiptment for the metal fences. I remember someone instructing P.C. Ryan
  to use the Tannoy telling people to stay calm. I can remember seeing bodies being moved
  towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane Terrace from the center pens. I believe that it was
 police officers who were moving the bodies from the area. Liverpool fans who were on the
                                  -   4   -
pitch started to run towards the K#p officers manage to stop the charge and split up
several groups of fans who were fighting. A line of officers were then formed across the
pitch just the Kop side of the center line.
I recall the fire service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the pitch
I then sefat a message; to operations that we did have fatalities at the ground although
when I sent this message no details had been passed by P.R. it was all done from observation.
Further contact from X.S. regarding the number of ambulance required and they    said would it
be more than 20 and I said something to the effect that we need asmany aspossible.
Traffic motor cycle were ordered to cover the routes to both hospitals and I made a request
for the senior ambulance officer to attend the control box. Ke did not arrive. The senior
fire officer attended at the control box and liased with senior officers and he too asked
to speak to the senior amb&lance officer. Another request was made for that officer to
attend the control box via X.S.
About 3.35pm I cheeked the video tapes and discovered that one had stopped and the second
had been switch to operate in the 18 hr mode which in effect speeds up the action of the
scene being recorded. This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing at the rear
of the video control area. The videos are set at knee h M g h t and I believe that as I learnt
forward this is how I altered the time mode setting.
I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.
    Clough and Mr Dalglesh entered the control box and offered their services once they had
established that the match was off. Mr Dalglesh wanted to speak to the fens and he was asked
to use the Tannoy system in the D.J.s control box below the police control.
Supt Murray then later asked for details of transport so that preparations could be made
for emptying the ground. I remeber some time after this Supt Murray saying to P.C. Ryan
that he wanted a message passing over the Tannoy tee ling the Liverpool fans to stay calm
and remain where they were untill the ambulances had left the stadium. Sometime later
 the ground was esnptyed and around 5.30pm I removed the video tapes and made my way to the Gyi
to offer assistance. I was later sent to H.Q. with the video tapes and I there saw C/supt
Duckenfield, Sgt Booth, ACC Jackson and C/supt Denton. About 11o00 D/supt Mckay attended
and he instructed me to return to Hamperton Road f book the video tapes into the property
store and await the arrival of AVA,|____________ pas to attend so that copies of the video
 tapes could be made.
About 11.30pm              arrived at Hammerton Roafl police station and I explained the
 faults on the video tapes. He asked if I could get hold of the video recorder used with
 the 18 hr mode setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct speed.
 I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video recorders from the police
 control box taking it to Ecclesfield training school where I handed it to[
 dy immediate supervisor would by Supt Murray. I had no contact with the fans before/
 during or after the incident. I cannot relate any information re^prding the stewarding
 of the ground, and I had no contact with the bodies.
 These 4 pages are not complete but are just a resume of the m i n points of the day.

position       attached        to the           roo f    of    the Wes t         Stand        bringing       it dow n         to

a position           just a b o v e       the    turnstiles.               The    s u r v e y was       carried        out

using a hand held video                     camera mounted                 on    the     p l a t f o r m of a

hydraulic        lift.        Twc     positions            were       considered,             the    first m o u n t e d

on a p o l e          at the       far m o s t        co r n e r    of the       Leppings           Lan e   turnstiles

the    second        position        just       above      gate       'B'.       It wa s       decided       that      the

best    position would               be    above        'B'    gate.         This       position        giving      goo d

all    around        v iews   along        Leppings           Lane,      to the         turnstiles          b e l o w and

the    courtyard         at th e      rea r      of the L e p p i n g s          Lane        t e r race.     The    system

installer        R oger H o l d s w o r t h        agreed          to c o m p l e t e    a costing          for    the

improvements            and   if     the     c a s h was       available          f r o m the        football       trust,

he w o u l d    attempt       to     install          the c a m e r a      in    it's        new position          in tim e

for the        Semi     Final.

Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be

completed quick enough and                         the planned m o v e                   for the camera was

suspended until the summer                         break.

On S a t u r d a y    15 A p r i l    .1989 , I c o m m e n c e d           duty        at   10 am a t t e n d i n g     at

the    police        r o o m at     Hillsborough,              collecting               the h a n d hel d V H S        radio

which        I used     to m o n i t o r     transmissions               via     Operations           Room.        On this

particular           day c h a n n e l     1 had        been d e s i g n a t e d         for all V H F

transmission            relating          to the        Semi       Final.

After        collecting        the    radio        I ma de my way               to the L e p p i n g s       Lane

terrace where             I s a w th at         Rog er H o l d s w o r t h was w o r k i n g            on camera

nu m b e r    5 which      overlooks            the     Leppings          L ane t e r r a c e       pens.   The

picture        quality        had    bee n      substandard             for a nu m b e r        of wee ks         and Mr

H o l d s w o r t h was    carrying          out      some     last m i n u t e         alterations          to u p g r a d e

the    pi cture.          After      he had        completed            the w o r k       the p i c t u r e was
indeed        better         than     it ha d         be en a l t h o u g h    not      up to the c o r r e c t

st a n d a r d .      I then made               m y wa y    to the C o n t r o l          Box where         I met       with

Sergeant           Goddard          and    PC     Ryan.        After a brief              conversation            I began

to c h e c k       the     video      system operating                 e ach    of      the   five c a m e r a s        in

turn.         We w e r e       later       joined        by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    M u r r a y an d      it wa s

agreed        between          us    that       Sergeant         Goddard would             operate         the    personal

radio,        PC    Ryan       the       tannoy       and t e l e p h o n e    and      I in a d d i t i o n      to m y

du t i e s    as    camera          operator          would monitor            the V H F      set u s i n g       it    if

necessary.               These       duties        were     no d i f f e r e n t     to w hat w o u l d          be    carried

out on a n o r m a l              match        day.

Around        10. 55        a m t hat      date,        Superintendent             Chapman         contact        control

regarding           a g r o u p of L i v e r p o o l           supporters          who were waiting                   outside

the     5 Arches            public        hou se .       There was         at this         tim e     no t r o u b l e       but

the     i n f o r m a t i o n was         passed        just     so that       officer        c o u l d be a w a r e         that

croups        of     supporters            had     arrived        and w e r e      int en t     on    getting          a drink

before        the m a t c h .            Several        oth er    personal         r adio m e s s a g e s w e r e           then

received           regarding             the    sam e topic.

About        11.20         am S e r g e a n t     Goddard        carried       out      radio      checks        some

 personal           radios         did    not     r e p l y and     the    se c t o r     Inspectors          wer e     asked

 to m a k e        checks         where    appropriate.               Throughout           this      time v a r i o u s

 messages           were      coming       in r e g a r d i n g t r a f f i c      problems          the    city       si de      of

 the gr oun d,             Ml m o t o r w a y ,    Par k w a y , etc,         diversions           we re in force.

 This        indicated            that    the     Nottingham supporters                    wer e     en rou te         in

 numbers           and     could      be e x p e c t e d at the g r o u n d             for    the    turnstile

 opening           tim e     of     12 noon.
Just     after        noo n    I inserted           the      2 VHS       video     tap es     in the        two v i d e o

recorders.             The t ime       an d    date        s y s t e m was      c h e c k e d and    set     possibly

using     the     around        loc k m o u n t e d        above       the N o r t h     Sta nd     or    by a ti me

c heck w i t h        o ther o f f i c e r s       in the        control        box.      The t apes         were       set

to run     at     normal        speed,        my    intention            being     that     around        2.30     pm the

same d a t e      I would        inset        2 n e w tap es           which would          then     include           the

build     up     to the m a t c h       throughout               the     gam e and       the s u p p o r t e r s

leaving        t he    ground.        Around          this       tim e    it was       noticed       tha t      persons

had e n t e r e d      the groun d.

A short        time      later     it was          discovered            that    some     of the P e n i s t o n e

Ro ad    turnstiles were               not m a n n e d        due      to an a d m i n i s t r a t i v e     error       this

was     corrected         by d e p l o y i n g      one     of    the     spare      serials .           Some     time

between        1 .00     pm and       2.30     p m t here w a s           concern        expressed          regarding

the L i v e r p o o l     fans     p u r c h a s i n g Ko p t i c k e t s        fro m touts         at L e p p i n g s

Lane     turnstiles.             This      would mean             of c o u r s e    that     a mixture            of    fans

would     have        to be s u p e r v i s e d w i t h i n           the K o p terra ce .

During     thi s       same p e r i o d       problems           b egan a r i s i n g     in v a r i o u s      public

and J o c k e y       and the      Royal.           The c o m p l a i n t s      were     that      fans     wer e

drinking         heavily        out    on the        street,           urinating         in g a r d e n s    and       b eing

a general         nui sa nc e.         Some        time     between        1.30     pm and        2.00      pm I beg an

to n o t i c e    that        on the K o p         se veral       Liverpool         fans     had     bee n p l a c e d

in the     t r i a n g l e are a       nea r to the N o r t h S t a n d en d                 supervised            by

several        p o l i c e o f ficers.             I set c a m e r a       4 to m o n i t o r      the      situation

noticing         that     se veral      arrests            wer e m a d e     and    that m a n p o w e r was

getting        low.        I remembered             that      there had          bee n    some     trouble         at    last

ye ars    match        in the      sam e      location           and     I questioned Superintendent

Murray     re     the number           of o f f i c e r s        available         for d e p l o y m e n t      on the

Kop.
                                                                  n

                                                                  b
Superintendent           Murray         then      contacted        Inspector           Sewel l      regarding            the

manpower        situation       and he         confirmed         that        2 coac h e s     eac h     containing

40 me n      would    be on s t a n d b y         in P e n i s t o n e     Road.

Around       2.00 pm S u p e r i n t e n d e n t        Murray     and Chief           Superintendent

Duckenfield          went    to s p e a k      to the m a t c h          refe re e.        Through       the

afternoon          complaints        had    bee n       expressed         r e g a r d i n g the q u a l i t y       of

personal        radio transmissions                  to the      control          staff.

Around       2.00    pm I o v e r h e a d      on V H F     that      Liverpool          supporters           had     bee n

spoken       to on a c o a c h w h i c h          had    displayed          a Nottingham Forest

supporters          parking     tick e t .         The     coach      and      supporters were             spoken          to

by t r a f f i c    officers       and     ad vised.

About     the      same time       t h e r e was        a report         of t r o u b l e s o m e   Liverpool

fans    on    a c oach r e g i s t e r e d        number       9995      RU.     This n u m b e r       was

circulated          and the c o a c h was            checked       by one of the m o b i l e               serials.

Around       2.20 pm the ACC             Jackson         was    in the         con tr ol    box w h e n       he

noticed       a ma n on the          Leppings           Lane    terrace         south      pen.       He d r o p p e d

his    trousers       and b e g a n      fooling         about.          His    b e h a v i o u r was    suc h      that

it was       believed       that     he was        drunk       and the ACC           ask ed    for      something

to be d o n e       about    him.        I set       the    c a m e r a to m o n i t o r      his     behaviour.

About     2.15      pm all     the      control         r o o m staff       discussed         that      it was

apparent        the L i v e p r o o l    fans      had not       beg un        to arrive       as yet.             The

North     Stand      had vas t       sp a c e s    although        the L e p p i n g s      L ane     t e r r a c e was

filling       up at a normal             rate.          Just   a fter       this     the p e r s o n a l      radio

transmissions           bec a m e w o r s e       and the      civilian          rad io r e p a i r      man       cam e

int o the       control      box     to a t t e m p t      a repair.
About 2.30 pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.                      I would estimate                around 3 , 0 0 0 people and

it was apparent that the number was increasing by the volume of

foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it

was said that although it was more than normal,                                       it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

About      2.35    pm the     civilian         radio       repair man          st a t e d   that    he c o u l d

not   fix the p e r s o n a l       radio      s y s t e m and     it was         necessary        to r e s o r t   to

using      the    ra dios    on a b a c k      to b ack       system.

About the same time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield came                                                to the

back of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied                                       'Yes'.

being       forced,     the y wer e         bending       and b u ckling.           In      my m i n d I

believed         that the      gates        referred       to wer e      'C'      gate      and    I ke pt the

Lepoings         Lane   camera      set      to that       sort of area.

About       2.40 pm Chi ef        Superintendent               D u c k e n f i e l d and    Superintendent

Murray       requested       that     I contact           Operations        Roo m so tha t          a traffic

car      w i t h a PA s y s t e m c o u l d    attend        in L e p p i n g s    Lan e    and    advised       the

c r o w d w h i c h wer e by this            ti me     becoming      apparently more               h o s tile.      I

al s o    remember       around     this      time      that S e r g e a n t      Goddard      picked         up the

personal         rad io t e l e p h o n e    sty le     handset      and aft er t r y i n g to use               it,

t h r e w it down o n t o the d e s k            because        it was      not w o r k i n g      and     the
personal         radio        transmissions                 wer e v e r y poor.          I can r e m e m b e r         seeing

about       5 or     6 officers            s t o o d on       barrier       duty     just     pas t       the gate           'C'

towards        the      Sou th Stand.

About       2.40     pm I r e m e m b e r         seeing        'C'    gate    ope n a n d        a number        of

supporters           enter       the     gro un d.           I then s a i d w o r d s       like         'They've

broken       down       the    gate'.            At    the    same    time     I indicated              to the        sta ff

in the       control          box    to w a t c h       the L e p p i n g s    Lan e m o n i t o r .         After      about

20    seconds        I noticed           that         the    gate was       closed      and       it    seemed        that     a

mounted        officer         a lone      had        prevented       a big      r ush of p e o p l e         through

the     open     gate.         I remember              se e i n g m o u n t e d o f f i c e r s    t r y i n g to c lear

s pace      in the       crowd.

The     request         for a d d i t i o n a l        officers       to be      sent     to L e p p i n g s      La n e was

mad e     to I n s p e c t o r      Se w e l l    and       I remember        him offering              two Se rials,

one     of w h i c h was         the     'F'      Division         Cri me     and V a n d a l ,        t h e y were

directed         to the L e p p i n g s           Lan e      end of the        ground.

I    sa w L i v e r p o o l    fans      climbing            the w alls       of the      ground         ont o the

turnstile           roofs      and     I in p a r t i c u l a r       remember        several           b eing    sat

astride        ga t e     'B' w i t h p o l i c e           officers      stood be low.                I t hink at       this

time      a personal           radio message                 was   sent     regarding         the       climbers        and

an o f f i c e r     replied         th at he          c o u l d not r each them.

Around       2.45       pm I r e m e m b e r          a personal        rad io m e s s a g e      f rom

Superintendent                Marshall           to the eff e c t         'We mus t      open          the   gat es     or

someone        is    going to be kill e d ,                   please ope n the            gates .'

At this time Chief Inspector McRobbie is in the control box wearing

civilian clothing.

I remember           seei ng an o f f i c e r               on the    top of the t u r n s t i l e s             at

Leppings         Lane end and              C hief       Superintendent            D u c k e n f i e l d mad e
enquiries          as     to the       officer's           id en tity.         Another         personal        r adio

message        was       received        from Superintendent                   Marshall,            his    v oice was

very     distressed,              'You m u s t       op en     the     ga tes,      open      the    gat es '.        Chief

Superintendent                 Duckenfield           se e m e d     to p a u s e    for     thought        a n d then

said     'Right          if    lives     are      at risk,          then    open      the     gate s' .       Sergeant

Goddard then              transmitted             'Open the          gates,        open     the     ga tes'.       Just

prior      to t h i s         I remember          see i n g    officers        behind         'A'    gate,     they w e r e

set out        in tw o         lines     forming          a funnel.           Sergeant         Higgins        of   'F'      C&V

transmitted              on p e r s o n a l    radio       'There       are    people         being       crushed

outside        ' A 1 gate we m u s t              ope n    'A'      gate'.

I remember           th at      about       the    time       the    gates     were        ordered        to be o p e n e d

mounted        officers           outside         Leppings          Lane    turnstiles            had m a n a g e d    to

c reate      a void           between       the    turnstiles           and    the     outer        perimeter

r ai l i n g s ,    in    fact,       I believed           tha t at one            tim e    the     officers managed

to c l o s e       the    outer       gates,       howe ve r,        the c r o w d     outside         forced      its wa y

through        the       o uter     g ates     and ran         into the        ground         via    'C'    gate      at

least.         I remember             seeing       crowds         at the      r ear    of L e p p i n g s     Lane

terrace        just       behind       the     turnstiles,             they w e r e        just     s t o o d abo ut       not

doing anything                 in p a r t i c u l a r .

About      2.55      p m C hief         Superintendent               Duckenfield            tol d    control       room

staff      to get         some m a n p o w e r       to the Nor th            Stand        to s t o p an y p o s s i b l e

ru sh    onto       the pitch .             It was        at this time             that we        began     to n o t i c e

Liverpool           fans       climbing        up into the West                Stand        f rom the       terr a c e

area.      T hey w e r e        assisted          by pe o p l e      in the        stand      and    the    same

p r o b l e m had        occurred        the      previous          year.      A s hort        time       l ater   fans

w ere    see n      to c l i m b      the     perimeter           track fence.              Officers        on the

track seemed               to be      t e l l i n g the       fans     to get d o w n         f rom the       fence.         At
this     point        the    staff      in the c o n t r o l         box    an d    I thought           that     the

situation         was       purely public             order.         No    information            was    co m i n g    in to

the    effect         that     pe o p l e    wer e    getting        hurt.

A crowd        gathered         on the        perimeter         track and           Chief     Superintendent

Duckenfield            ordered        that      they     should       be m o v e d     as q u i c k l y     as

possible         to the w i n g s e c t i o n s of L e p p i n g s             L ane     terrace         w here       it

c ould    be     seen       that    there w a s        space.         Chief        Superintendent

Duckenfield was                angry        abo ut    officers        stood        around     the       track     ne ar      to

the K o p and          the N o r t h        Stand.      A personal           radio message               was     sent       to

the o f f i c e r s      and    th ey wer e          directed        to the        front     of    the N o r t h

Stand.     Around           this    time C hief          Inspector McRobbie                  was    sent       to the

pitch     to get         things       s o r t e d out.         One    p r o b l e m wa s     a WP C      s tood on the

perimeter         track        just     b e l o w the     control          box.      She d i d      not a p p e a r         to

be m o v i n g    people        off the         tra ck and       in fact           at one     s tage o p e n e d           the

perimeter         gat e      to the         tra ck    then w a l k e d      off     leaving        the gate           open.

Chief     Inspector McRobbie                    took charge           of the        policewoman           and b e g a n

ushering         people        f r o m the      track.         By this       time      the re wer e p e o p l e             on

the p i t c h     and       the p e r i m e t e r     tra ck    gat es w e r e       ope n    allowing people

out of     the        centre       pens.        Still     at this          s tage    no one        in the c o n t r o l

box was a w a r e           that    the      p r o b l e m was m o r e      tha n    a pitch        invasion

situation.

Just     after        the m a t c h w a s       s t o p p e d ACC     J a c k s o n was      in the c o n t r o l           box

and he     o r d e r e d me        to c o n t a c t O p e r a t i o n s     R o o m and call            operation

su pport.         It was        at thi s po int           that       I decided         to c o n c e n t r a t e       on

operating         the V H F        r a d i o rather tha n            the c a m e r a    system.          Very

suddenly         it    became       apparent          that     th ere wer e         injuries        and at that

time     I contacted Operations                       Roo m for a m b u l a n c e s        to be sent            to the

Leppings         L ane      en d of the ground.                 There were           pe o p l e    all over        the
pitch     in    front       of the       goal mouth,            persons         were       lai d    across         the

floor     with       persons        g i v i n g m o u t h to m o u t h .         It wa s        only       then that            we

b egan    to feel          that     t here m i g h t     be deat h s .           A personal               radio m e s s a g e

was     sent    to c o n t r o l     asking        for bol t       cutters           and     Sergeant           Goddard

contacted         Clavwheels           Lan e      asking       if the y        had    cutters         on the b r i - m a c

transporter.               The    r e p l y was       n e gative.         He    turned        to me an d I tol d

him th at       I would          contact        the    fire     service         which        I did        via

Operations           Room.        I made        it c l e a r    that      we    required           cutting

equipment         for      the m e t a l    fences.            I remember            someone        instructing               PC

Ryan to use           the     tannoy       telling people               to     sta y calm.            I can r e m e m b e r

seeing       bodies        being moved            towards       the     tun ne l      on the        Leppings            La ne

terrace        f rom the         centre     pens.        I believe             that    it was         pol ic e

o f f i c e r s w h o w ere m o v i n g         the b o d i e s    f rom the area.                  Liverpool            fans

wh o w e r e    on    the p i t c h      s t a r t e d to run t o w a r d s           the Kop.             Officers

managed        to s t o p the        ch a r g e    and s plit          up seve r a l         gr o u p s    of fans w h o

wer e    fig h t i n g .      A line       of o f f i c e r s     wer e      the n    formed        a c r o s s the

pitch     just       the    Kop     side    of the c e n t r e          line.         I re c a l l        the    fire

serv i c e     a r r i v i n g at L e p p i n g s      Lan e    and t h e i r me n           running        on to the

pitch.         I then       sent     a message          to O p e r a t i o n s       that we di d have

f a t a l i t i e s at     the    ground although               when      I sent       this m e s s a g e          no

details        had    b een p a s s e d     by p e r s o n a l     radio.            It was        all     don e    from

observation.               Further       contact        from Operations                Room regarding                   the

number       of a m b u l a n c e     r e q u i r e d and      the y    said w o u l d        it be m o r e         than        20

a nd    I said       something         to the eff e c t           that we        need as m a n y            as

possible .

Traffic motor              cy c l e s w e r e     ordered       to c over        the r o u t e s          to bot h

hospitals         and      I ma de     a requ e s t       for the         senior a m b u l a n c e          officer           to

a t t e n d the      control        box.        He di d not        arrive.            Th e    senior        fire
officer attended at the control box and liaised with senior

officers and he too asked to speak to the senior ambulance offxuer.

Another request was made for that officer to attend the control box

via Operations Room.

About     3.35        pm   I checked        the v i d e o t a p e s    and d i s c o v e r e d      that      one   had

I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr Clouqh and Mr Dalgleish entered the control box and offered

■their services once they had established that the match was off.

Mr Dalgleish wanted to speak to the fans and he was asked to use

the tannoy system in the DJs control box below the police control.

Superintendent Murray then later asked for details of transport so

that preparations could be made for emptying the ground.                                                 I

remember some time after this Superintendent Murray saying to PC

Ryan that he wanted a message passing over the tannoy telling the

Liverpool fans to stay calm and remain where they were until the

ambulances had left the Stadium.

                        STATEMENT



James Wardrope will say as follows



I am a Consultant in charge of the Accident & Emergency

Department at the Northern General Hospital,      Sheffield.    I

have been a Consultant at the hospital since 1 May 1987;

prior to that I held the post of Senior Registrar at the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital,    Sheffield.    I qualified in

                       in 19    and my qualifications are




The Accident & Emergency Department is quite a busy one.            It

had 55,000 patients last year, of which 42,000 were new

patients.   In terms of medical staffing,     there are seven

Senior House Officers,    an Associate Specialist (six sessions

A & E, four sessions Fracture Clinic) and five GP Clinical

Assistant sessions.     I am the first on call, except every

other weekend when one of the Orthopaedic Consultants takes

the on call duty.



Saturday is usually a busy day for the Department,      especially

in the afternoon.     On Saturday,   15 April there were two

medical staff, of SHO grade, on duty and I was on call.         I

had been into the Department at 10.00 am on the morning of

the 15th.   The Department was fairly busy.     At about 1.00 pm

I telephoned the Department from home to let them know I was

going to be out for the afternoon as I planned to take my
family to the park.     I ascertained the waiting time in the

Department was two hours, which means it was quite busy.                I

took my wife and children to _____________      We were just

returning,   and were about 200 yards from our home in

             when my bleep which I had been carrying went off

I arrived home within about a minute and telephoned the

hospital immediately.    I spoke to Charge Nurse Batty, who

indicated he had been notified of some sort of incident at

Hillsborough and that the hospital was to stand by and to

expect to receive some crush injuries.    He gave no indication

of numbers or that a major incident had been called.         He

indicated that no patients had yet arrived and from the

details he gave me I thought perhaps the hospital would

receive half a dozen or so.    I knew the Department was fairly

busy and I decided I should go in to help out, but I did not

think it was a major emergency.



I immediately left for the hospital in my car.      The time on

the car clock, which is two minutes fast, was 3.25 pm.            The

journey was very quick as the roads were quiet and I arrived

at the hospital at 3.35 pm, according to the car clock.            I

parked my car in the Consultants'   car park.    I started

walking towards the Department, but as I approached the

entrance I saw three ambulances and I began to run.      I was

met at the door by Charge Nurse Batty who informed me three

patients were undergoing resuscitation in the Resuscitation

Room which is adjacent to the side entrance.      I asked him

whether he had implemented the Major Disaster Plan and he
replied he had.   It was obvious to me that it was necessary

to implement the Major Disaster Plan.



I went into the Resuscitation Room where there were three

patients undergoing resuscitation.   One was a ten year old

boy who was being attended by the Senior Paediatric House

Officer.   I gather she had been called when the Department

were alerted to expect a paediatric cardiac arrest.       A Senior

House Officer from Rotherham, who had just been passing the

hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one of my

SHOs was working on the third patient.




More ambulances arrived almost immediately.   I went to the

front door with Charge Nurse Batty to receive the injured,

almost all of whom were dead or dying.   Some were sent to the

Resuscitation Room and I then went to the Resuscitation Room

myself to intubate with endotracheal tubes.   I cannot now

recall how many patients were in that batch of arrivals.



I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about

5.00 pm, to triage patients as they arrived, and also to

triage Doctors so that they could be assigned to appropriate

duties.



By about 3.45 pm a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

and the Resuscitation Room was fairly well manned.    I
allocated Doctors to the Resuscitation Room initially,     and

then into Ward 60 which had been cleared and which was acting

as the receiving ward.



I realised the Resuscitation Room was becoming very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation

and I therefore sent one of the SHOs, Mr Duncan, to telephone

SYMAS Control and request cases be diverted to the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

tagging system to identify the casualties.      Because of the

volume of patients arriving staff were unable to use the

coloured labels.



At about this time I started sending the dead on arrival

direct to the Plaster Room.    Previously,   I had sent the whole

batch of casualties, including dead,     into the Resuscitation

Room to attempt resuscitation in view of their age.



Also about this time,    I received a request to send a mobile

team to the Hillsborough football ground.      The request came

via                            .   I realised everyone was very

busy and that we could not spare sufficient staff to send a

mobile team immediately and I decided it was more important

to retain the resources within the Department.      However, by

about 4.00 pm the position had eased such that I was able to

despatch two Doctors with an equipment box, in an ambulance,
to the football ground.     The staff who went were

Dr Davidson,   SHO, and an Anaesthetic Registrar.     The

Department has a specially prepared box of equipment for just

such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

only two weeks earlier.     As it transpired, when the mobile

team arrived at the ground there were sufficient medical

staff already there and the Doctors were sent back to the

hospital and only the equipment retained.



By about this time I think I was notified the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital were receiving about half the

casualties.



After 4.00 pm the situation became more controlled and less

serious injuries were arriving in the Department.      These were

sent to the Physiotherapy Department which had been cleared

to receive non-urgent casualties requiring minor treatment or

rest or awaiting transport home.     By about 4.30 pm the

Department was becoming much quieter.     I asked Dr R Elson,

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon,    and Dr D Edwards, Orthopaedic

Registrar, to attend the non-urgent casualties in the

Physiotherapy Department.



Dr Tim Shaw, Consultant Anaesthetist, was in charge of the

Resuscitation Room.



The last patient I remember receiving arrived at about 4.45

pm.   He had fainted from the exertion of carrying bodies out
of the ground.



At the time I did not know how many patients the Department

had received, although I knew at one point that about sixteen

patients were all undergoing resuscitation.      The Department

is set up for ten resuscitation patients and all the beds

were being used.



The triage area was established near the side entrance to the

A & E Department.   In a major disaster the main entrance is

closed and all casualties are brought into the side entrance

and thus through the triage point.    The Resuscitation Room is

immediately adjacent to the triage area in room 23 and beyond

that rooms 18 (Treatment),   16 (Anteroom),   14 (Plaster Room),

15 (Treatment Room),   57, 58 and 61 (Examination/Treatment

Rooms) and cubicles were used.    Any casualties who did not

require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward, ward

60, or, if they were minor casualties, to the Physiotherapy

Department.   Only one patient required surgery -

              Almost all the resuscitation patients required

intensive care and therefore were transferred from the

resuscitation areas to either the General Intensive Treatment

Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.



In the initial ten minutes the Department was overwhelmed by

the volume of patients requiring resuscitation.      I think this

is due to three factors, namely the speed of extraction of

casualties from the site, the speed of transportation to the
hospital in view of its proximity to the football ground,    and

the nature of the injuries.



I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.     I believe

at one time we ran out of oxygen flow meters, but these were

provided very quickly by the Supplies Department.     The

hospital does not have a CT scanner and one of the

ventilated casualties required a CT scan during the

afternoon.    He was transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.    A further two patients were transferred during the

evening and four patients were transferred during the night

to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.



By about 5.30 pm the Department was almost clear of

casualties.



Non-urgent casualties were directed to the General and

Maternity Wing Physiotherapy Department.    The dead were

transferred to the mortuary which had been set up temporarily

in the Orthopaedic Plaster Room.    The bodies were later

transferred to the temporary mortuary which was established

at the football ground.



The Major Disaster Plan provides for patients to be labelled

with appropriately coloured labels once they have been triaged,

so that, for example, those requiring immediate resuscitation

should receive a red label, those requiring urgent admission

and surgery should receive a blue label,   non-urgent a green
label and dead a white label.     In fact, because of the speed

of arrival of the casualties in the first twenty minutes,          it

was impossible for staff to use the coloured labels.        This

did not make any material difference as staff were writing on

to the labels the patients' destination,    once triaged.



I only had contact with the families of the patients later in

the evening.   I recall I was in the Control Room when one

woman arrived trying to find her husband and daughter.       I

recall speaking to her and telling her that her husband had

survived but that her daughter was dead.     The families

appeared to be well marshalled on Level C, which is the floor

below the A & E Department.     I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.     I think there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.     By the following morning I

was able to calculate that ninety-three patients had been

through the Department,   of whom fifty-five were admissions,

twenty-seven discharges and twelve dead.     Of the admissions

fifteen were in intensive care, although by the following

morning (Monday) that figure had dropped to eleven.     Seven

patients had been transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.



The type of injury sustained by the casualties - traumatic

asphyxia - is fairly uncommon.     In the two years I have worked

at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital I have seen only one such

case.   The most common cause of this type of crush injury is
from a car falling on top of someone who is working beneath

it.   The Department had approximately twenty-five to thirty

traumatic asphyxia cases in the space of an hour and I

believe handled the incident extremely well.

I feel' it may be helpful to give a brief summary of our experience of traumatic
asphyxia.        Traumatic asphyxia is a fairly uncommon conditionf normally occurring
in. sporadic cases, either in oar _accidents, or _heayy injury. •                                                                 There_are_a

                          STATEMENT



James Wardrope will say as follows



I am a Consultant in charge of the Accident & Emergency

Department at the Northern General Hospital,                  Sheffield.   I

have been a Consultant at the hospital since 1 Ma y 1987;

prior to that I held the post of Senior Registrar at the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital,         Sheffield.        I qualified in

MB.CHB   (Edinburgh U n i v e r s i t y )in 1978 and my qualifications

are B.SC    (Med Sci), MB.CHB,      FRCS       (Edinburgh)    (General Surgery),

FRCS (Edinburgh)     (Accident and Emergency Medicine and Surgery),

FRCS (England)    (General S u r g e r y ) .


The Accident & Emergency Department is quite a busy one.                       It

had 55,000 patients last year,          of which 42,000 were new

patients.    In terms of medical staffing, there are seven

Senior House Officers,       an Associate Specialist (six sessions

A & E, four sessions Fracture Clinic) and five GP Clinical

Assistant sessions.       I am permanently the first on call,

except every other weekend when one of the Orthopaedic

Consultants takes the on call duty.



Saturday is usually a busy day for the Department,                  especially

in the afternoon.      On Saturday,        15 April there were two

medical staff,    of SHO grade,      on duty and I was on call.            I

had been into the Department at 10.00 am on the morning of

the 15th.    The Department was fairly busy.                 At about 1.00 pm

I telephoned the Department from home to let them know I was

going to be out as I planned to take my family to the park.




                                                                                    9
I ascertained the waiting time in the Department was two hours

which means it was quite busy.    I took my wife and children

to                We were just returning,   and were about 200

yards from our home in              when my bleep which I had

been carrying went off.   I arrived home within about a minute

and telephoned the hospital immediately.     I spoke to Charge

Nurse Batty, who indicated he had been notified of some sort

of incident at Hillsborough and that the hospital was to stand

by and to expect to receive some crush injuries.     He gave no

indication of numbers or that a major incident had been called

He indicated that no patients had yet arrived and from the

details he gave me I thought perhaps the hospital would

receive half a dozen or so.   I knew the Department was fairly

busy and I decided I should go in to help out, but I did not

think it was a major emergency.



I immediately left for the hospital in my car.     The time on

the car clock, which is two minutes fast, was 3.25 pm.      (ie

the correct time was 3.23 pm).    The journey was very quick as

the roads were quiet and I arrived at the hospital at 3.35 pm,

(the correct time was 3.33 pm) according to the car clock.        I

parked my car in the Consultants'   car park.   I started

walking towards the Department,   but as I approached the

entrance I saw three ambulances and I began to run.     I was

met at the door by Charge Nurse Batty who informed me three

patients were undergoing resuscitation in the Resuscitation

Room which is adjacent to the side entrance.     I asked him

whether he had implemented the Major Disaster Plan and he

replied he had.   It was obvious to me that it was necessary
to implement the Major Disaster Plan.



I went into the Resuscitation Room where there were three

patients undergoing resuscitation.   One was a teenager

who was being attended by the Senior Paediatric House

Officer.   I gather she had been called when the Department

were alerted to expect a paediatric cardiac arrest.       A Senior

House Officer from Rotherham, who had just been passing the

hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one of my

SHOs was working on the third patient.



More ambulances arrived almost immediately.    I went to the

front door with Charge Nurse Batty to receive the injured,

almost all of whom were dead or dying.   Some were sent to the

Resuscitation Room and I then went to the Resuscitation Room

myself to intubate with endotracheal tubes.    I cannot now

recall how many patients were in that batch of arrivals.



I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about

5.00 pm, to triage patients as they arrived,   and also to

triage Doctors so that they could be assigned to appropriate

duties.



By about 3.45 pm a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

and the Resuscitation Room was fairly well manned.    I

allocated Doctors to the Resuscitation Room initially,     and

then into Ward 60 which had been cleared and which was acting

as the receiving ward.
I realised the Resuscitation Room was becoming very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation.

I therefore requested the Ambulance Liaison Officer to divert

cases to the Hallamshire.       I believe that Mr Duncan,   Senior

Registrar in Surgery,    also telephoned SYMAS at that time with

the same request.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

tagging system to identify the casualties.       Because of the

volume of patients arriving staff were unable to use the

coloured labels.



At about this time I started sending patients arriving with

no cardiac output direct to the Plaster Room (mortuary).          Up

to that point patients with no cardiac output who were having

active cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance were sent

to the Resuscitation Room to continue resuscitation,        in view of

their age and the nature of the injury.



Also about this time I received a request to send a mobile

team to the Hillsborough football ground.       The request came

to me by word of mouth but I believe that the call originated

over the direct line to the Accident & Emergency Department

from SYMAS Headquarters.      At that time there was a large number

of seriously ill patients in the Department with not sufficient

medical staff.     However,   very quickly more staff arrived and I

was able to despatch two Doctors with the Major Accident

Equipment Boxes.     The staff who went were Dr Davidson,    Senior

House Officer, and an Anaesthetic Senior House Officer.        The
Department has specially prepared boxes of equipment for just

such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

only two weeks earlier.     As it transpired, when the mobile

team arrived at the ground there were sufficient medical

staff already there and the Doctors were sent back to the

hospital and only the equipment retained.



By about this time I think I was notified the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital were receiving about half the

casualties.



After 4.00 pm the situation became more controlled and less

serious injuries were arriving in the Department.       These were

sent to the Physiotherapy Department which had been cleared

to receive non-urgent casualties requiring minor treatment or

rest or awaiting transport home.     By about 4.30 pm the

Department was becoming much quieter.     I asked Dr R Elson,

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon,    and Dr D Edwards,   Orthopaedic

Registrar, to attend the non-urgent casualties in the

Physiotherapy Department.



Dr Tim Shaw, Consultant Anaesthetist, was in charge of the

Resuscitation Room.



The last patient I remember receiving arrived at about 4.45

pm.   He had fainted from the exertion of carrying bodies out

of the ground.



At the time I did not know how many patients the Department
had received,    although I knew at one point that about sixteen

patients were all undergoing resuscitation.         The Department

is set up for ten resuscitation points and all these points

were being used with often more than one patient to each point.



The triage area was established near the side entrance to the

A & E Department.     In a major disaster the main entrance is

closed and all casualties are brought into the side entrance

and thus through the triage point.       The Resuscitation Room is

immediately adjacent to the triage area in room 23 and beyond

that rooms 18 (Treatment),      16 (Anteroom),   14 (Plaster Room),

15 (Treatment Room),    57,   58 and 61 (Examination/Treatment

Rooms) and cubicles were used.       Any casualties who did not

require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward, ward

60, or,   if they were minor casualties, to the Physiotherapy

Department.     Only one patient required surgery -|_____

                Almost all the resuscitation patients required

intensive care and therefore were transferred from the

resuscitation areas to either the General Intensive Treatment

Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.



In the initial ten minutes the Department was overwhelmed by

the volume of patients requiring resuscitation.         I think this

is due to three factors,      namely the speed of extraction of

casualties from the site,      the speed of transportation to the

hospital in view of its proximity to the football ground, and

the nature of the injuries.



I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.         I believe
at one time we ran out of oxygen flow meters, but these were

provided very quickly by the Supplies Department.         The

hospital does not have a CT scanner and one of the

ventilated casualties required a CT scan during the

afternoon.     He was transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.     A further two patients were transferred during the

evening and four patients were transferred during the night

to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.



By about 5.30 pm the Department was almost clear of

casualties.



Non-urgent casualties were directed to the General and

Maternity Wing Physiotherapy Department.       The dead were

transferred to the mortuary which had been set up temporarily

in the Orthopaedic Plaster Room.      The bodies were later

transferred to the temporary mortuary which was established

at the football ground.



The Major Disaster Plan provides for patients to be labelled

with appropriately coloured labels once they have been triaged,

so that, for example,   those requiring immediate resuscitation

should receive a red label, those requiring urgent admission

and surgery should receive a blue label, non-urgent a green

label and dead a white label.     In fact, because of the speed

of arrival of the casualties in the first twenty m i n u t e s , it

was impossible for staff to use the coloured labels.         This

did not make any material difference as staff were writing on

to the labels the patients' destination,     once triaged.
I only had contact with the families of the patients       later in

the evening.      I recall I was in the Control Room when one

woman arrived trying to find her husband and daughter.        I

recall speaking to her and telling her that her husband had

survived but that her daughter was dead.      The families

appeared to be well marshalled on Level C, which is the floor

below the A & E Department.      I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.      I think there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.      By the following morning I

was able to calculate that eighty-eight patients had been

through the Department from Hillsborough.      Fifty-five of these

were admissions,     twenty-one were discharged to home after

treatment and twelve patients were dead.      During the time of

the alert, the Department also dealt with five other patients

who were not from Hillsborough.      Of the admissions,   fifteen

were admitted to Intensive Care and two further ventilated

patients were transferred to the Hallamshire Hospital.        Later

that evening a further five patients were transferred to the

Hallamshire Hospital for CT scanning.



The type of injury sustained by the casualties - traumatic

asphyxia - is fairly uncommon.      In the two years I have worked

at the Northern General Hospital     I have only seen one such

case.      The most common cause of this type of injury is a car

falling on top of someone working beneath it, or from heavy

industry.     The Northern General Hospital treated twenty-five

cases of severe traumatic asphyxia in the space of one hour and

I believe it handled the incident extremely well.

                                        HILLSBOROUGH - 15 APRIL 1989

                               PATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISASTER




My medical qualifications are MB, BS, FRC Path, DMJ                                         (Clin et Path).     I have been

in active practice in Forensic Pathology for almost thirty years and have been

Consultant Pathologist to the Home Office for South Yorkshire and the East

Midlands for twenty-five of those years.                                          During that, time I have performed more

than twenty-six thousand post mortem examinations for Her Majesty's coroners and

have taken part In some seven hundred and sixty murder investigations.




I have been asked by Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief Constable of the West

Midlands Police m           charge of the Hillsborough Enquiry Team,                                 to provide a general

overview of the pathological aspects of the Hillsborough disaster In which some

ninety-five persons were killed on the afternoon of Saturday,                                          15 A p r i l , 1989,

during a cup semi-final match.




I took part in the investigation of the deaths myself, being present at the

request of Her Majesty's coroner at Hillsborough Stadium on the evening of 15

April,   1989, and at the Medico-Legal Centre on Sunday, 16 April and Monday,                                              1?

April.    I personally carried out nineteen of the ninety-five post mortems.                                               The

other examinations were carried out by teams of pathologists working five or six

at a time in the mortuary of the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre at Watery Street

- following the transfer of the bodies from the temporary mortuary in the
gymnasium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.                        Initially, I believe,

some thirteen bodies were taken to the mortuary of the Northern General Hospital

in Sheffield,          but later they were removed from there and brought to the

Medico-Legal Centre.            As far as I know,       the only body aufcopsied at the Northern

General Hospital was chat of a Lee NICHOL (body No 95), aged 14 years, who

survived,        under treatment, until about 2             am on Tuesday,   18 April,     and whose body

was          examined that same day     by Dr Shirley HOLT, Consultant Pathologist            at the

Northern General Hospital, Herries Road, Sheffield, S5 7AU                       (Tel: 0742 -

434343).         The work at the Medico-Legal Centre was performed by five forensic

pathologists and four clinical pathologists - all of consultant status.                          They

I can only speak in a detailed way of the nineteen examinations which I

personally carried out.    However,   having read all ninety-five post mortem

reports and seen certain statements made by witnesses,           I believe 1 can speak in

a general way about the pathological conditions which proved fatal in the total

of ninety-five cases which were examined.           The details of individual cases will

need to be obtained from the pathologists who examined them, which is why their

names and professional addresses, together with the body numbers,               have been

provided above.




                                        _   3   _
SEX

Of the ninety-five dead, eighty-eight were males and seven were females, which,

in my view, merely reflects the nature of the occasion.




AGE

Of the ninety-five who died, the youngest was a 10 year old boy and the eldest a

67 year old man.

  Thirty-eight persons (approximately 40%) were under 20 years of age

  Thirty-nine persons   (41%) were between 20 and 29 years of age

  Twelve persons (13%) were between 30 and 39 years of age

  Three persons (3%) were between 40 and 49 years of age

  One person (1%) was between 50 and 59 years

  Two persons (2%) were between 60 and 69 years old.

  Seventy-seven of the ninety-five (81%) dead were below 30 years of age.

Again, I imagine these figures probably reflect the composition of the average

soccer crowd.




CAUSE OF DEATH

In virtually every case,   the cause of death was basically compression of the

chest wall - against the bodies of the persons immediately around the deceased

or against fixed structures such as the walls of the stadium and the crash

barriers.   In the vast majority of the cases,     this pressure caused the condition

of traumatic or crush asphyxia - the two terms are synonymous.




Asphyxia pathologically means some mechanical obstruction to normal breathing.

That obstruction may be caused in a variety of ways - by a hand across the nose

and mouth   (suffocation), by a ligature tightened around the neck

(strangulation),   by a bolus of food which sticks in the airways (choking), or by




                                       -   4   -
a strong pressure upon the chest wall so that it becomes fixed and cannot move

in and out to enable the person to draw breath.          Whatever the impedance to

respiration,     the result is similar.      The oxygen in the air cannot be drawn Into

the lungs and passed into the blood to be transported to the body tissues which

require it for their normal function.          The deoxygenated blood in the tissues

turns a dark colour, giving the victim's complexion a bluish or cyanotic hue.

The heart begins to fail and the walls of the smallest vessels         (capillaries)

which are under pressure and themselves starved of oxygen, give way and allow

spurts of red cells to pass into the surrounding tissues where they show as tiny

pin-point haemorrhages      (petechiae)    in the loose skin around the eyes, on the

rorehead and behind the ears as well as on many of the internal organs.           Thus, a

somewhat bloatd cyanotic appearance with external and internal petechiae arises.

If the impediment, to breathing is not removed in some four to six minutes -

perhaps less if the victim is struggling and thus using up oxygen at a higher

rate - then the brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes and

ultimately the vital centres in the hind brain are damaged and die and then life

is no longer- possible.




Appearances such as these were seen in almost every person who died at

Hillsborough, and in all        but ninecases death was attributed solely   to traumatic

(or crush)     asphyxia.   In   one case          the force compressing the chest was

(perhaps momentarily)      so great that the rear surface of the breast bone almost

touched the anterior surface of the spine, nipping and splitting the aorta

between them so that the        man bled to death internally before he could be

asphyxiated.     In only eight other cases (Nos

were factors other than traumatic asphyxia thought to have even contributed to

the death, and in six of these eig h t, the contributory factor arose out of

trauma to the chest, neck or head.         In the remaining two cases (I          Ionly,
truly natural disease was believed to be a significant contributory factor in

the death.




-INHALATION OF VOMIT

In any form of asphyxia vomiting may occur before death and because of

unconsciousness and the lack of the protective reflex mechanism, vomitus may be

aspirated into the lungs, greatly increasing the likelihood of death.                                                             Most

pathologists regard this vomiting as merely a facet of death from asphyxia and

though recording it in their post mortem reports,                                       do not dignify it with a

separate heading in the cause of death.                                     This is my view and the one I have

adopted In compiling the simple statistics for this report.                                                    It has, however,             to

be said that for purely mechanical and obvious reasons, vomiting is more likely

'•'O occur if the stomach is distended with food and/or1 drink and is subjected to

har'd external mechanical, compression.                              Vomiting is also more likely to occur in

chose persons intoxicated with alcohol.




OTHER INJURIES

In eighteen cases bones were broken - mostly ribs (thirteen cases),                                                         but in

addition the bones and/or cartilages of the larynx (voice box) were fractured in

three cases (|_______________                  - perhaps suggesting that the throat of these

persons had been trodden on accidentally le that they were on the ground when

they sustained that injury.

    In two cases impacts to the chest, wall were so severe as to cause extensive

    bruising to the underlying lungs, affecting the victim's ability to breathe and

    in one of these the ribs were actually fractured and their ends tore the

    underlying lung allowing air r,o escape from the lung into the chest

    (pneumothorax)   and seriously adversely affect the victim's breathing.




    In one case damage to the nose with subsequent bleeding allowed the inhalation

    of blood into the lungs and this was thought to be a significant factor in the

    death.




    As one would perhaps have suspected,     a very high proportion of these bodies bore

    superficial grazes and scratches - evidence of blunt impact against all manner

    of solid objects such as walls, concrete flooring, barriers and fences. These

    injuries arc too numerous to be described or interpreted here and details should

    be obtained In each individual case from the pathologist who actually performed

    the post mortem (see above).




    ALCOHOL

    In discussing this matter, my Impression is that the dead came mostly from the

    front   (ie near to the pitch)   areas of the Leppings Lane end, from amongst

    persons who had arrived early in order to get a good view and thus their blood

    alcohols are not necessarily an indication of the alcoholic status of those who

    arrived later and were pushing to get in at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.




    No blood was taken from the victim who died last ie no 95, because of the

    interval of time which had passed between the accident and his death.

    No alcohol was found in the bodies of any of the seven female victims.

    Of the remaining eighty-seven men and boys, fifty-one (58%) were shown to have
nor more than 10 mg% in their blood, which is negligible,           but fifteen had more

than 80 mg% in their blood, which means they could not legally have driven a

car, and six had upwards of 120 mg% in their blood.           Six youths below the age of

18, who were not legally allowed to drink,          had taken drink, of which group one

boy, aged 17 years,         had a blood alcohol of 141 mg%, whilst a 15 year old had a

blood alcohol of 56 mg%.




EYE HAEMORRHAGES

I have been asked to comment on the proposition that a distinction can be made

in this case between those persons who died from traumatic asphyxia standing up

in the crowd and those dying from the same cause lying down.            The latter,   it is

said, will have petechial haemorrhages in their eyes whilst the former will not.

I have seen a very large number of cases of traumatic asphyxia and I am certain

that no such distinction can be made - both groups will in all probability have

petechial haemorrhages in their eyes.




GENERAL COMMENT

The Hillsborough disaster occurred between 3 pm and 3.30 pm on Saturday, 15

April, 1989-         By 2 pm on Monday,   17 April, ie less than forty-eight hours later,

all ninety-four of the victims who were then dead had been examined post mortem

and had a blood sample taken for analysis, so that their bodies were ready for

release to relatives.         I believe that several factors were responsible for this

f e a t :-




   1.        The excellence of Her Majesty's Coroner's arrangements and organisation.

   2.        The immediate availability of the Football C l u b ’s gymnasium, sited just a

             few yards from the pitch.    This huge room was easily compartmentalised

             into three large chambers, each invisible from the others.     One was used
       as a mortuary for temporary body storage, one as a makeshift canteen and

       the third as a reception area for relatives where they were greeted and

       assisted by padres of various denominations, social workers and

       ancillaries.

3.     The fact that the victims'    bodies were not fragmented nor greatly

       disfigured as might have happened in an explosion or an aircraft crash.

       This meant, that the initial identification was possible from polaroid

       photographs taken by the police, which made the identification process

       rapid and meant that relatives were generally required to view only one

       body and were spared the harrowing task of entering the main mortuary and

       searching for their dead.

4.     The use of the facilities available at the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre -

       the only building of its kind in the United Kingdom.        This meant that in

       one day it was possible for up to six teams of pathologists and their

       assistants to work simultaneously in excellent conditions with modern

       equipment so that they were able to perform seventy autopsies on Sunday

       alone.     This building was designed with an emergency facility to deal with

       disaster involving up to one hundred bodies, and when the disaster

       arrived,    the building worked well.     Sheffield City Council are to be

       congratulated on their provision of such a building.

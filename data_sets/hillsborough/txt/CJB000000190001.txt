RE:   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER REPORT


I have previously spoken to you on a couple of occasions  about my belief
that we still have not had a report to Committee about the way in which the
emergency procedures operated following the Hillsborough disaster.

Having checked back I can find no record of such a report and feel      that
given  the  time  lapse  since the disaster,    and the fact that Committee
specifically requested that a report be produced, that one  should n o w be
provided as a matter of urgency.

I d o n â€™t think  I have  to spell   it out but    if a further disaster or
emergency, of any kind, were to occur and procedures were     to be   found
inadequate,   which were  also found to be wanting after Hillsborough, then
the Council would, quite rightly, be the subject of considerable criticism.

I look forward to your reply indicating when the report will be produced.

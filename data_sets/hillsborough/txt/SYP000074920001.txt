                At 9 * 45am we a t t e nd ed at              the North S tand of t h e/ground for                        briefing.

                At       10.30am we were         provided with a packed                   I y rf\c h and d r i n k s .

                s i t u a t e d ourselves        outside       the      ’Thf^§she r ’ off         licence on M i d d i e w o o d

                road             From    11.30am onwards        t h e x A was a constant               stream of supporters
                                                                 - jr
                                                                                                    S1918

from both teams               entering     the shop and buying 3/4              packs of beer at a

time,      as well as bottles              of wine and        cider.

flyse 1 f and PC Enwright were also a p p r o a c h e d                on numerous        occasions      by

persons asking             the    location of the nearest              public    house,    again,

supporters            from both t e a m s .

At    1.50pm the          'Thresher*       off   licence      closed until 3pm and during               that

time a large            number       of s u pporters     constantly      came to the door,

a tt e m p t i n g    to go    in.     When    they found      it closed,       we were asked where

the    nearest         one was.

At 2 . 4 5 p m       I saw one youth a p p r o x i m a t e l y 24 yrs      in a group of 4/5 other

youths,        who were all Liverpool              supporters      making       their way up

M i d d l e w o o d Road,      towards Leppings Lane.             He was       unable    to stand on his

own,     and was being helped along                    by his friends.          It was    quite    obvious

that     his     behaviour was          caused by having         consumed vast amounts             of

alcohol.

At 3 . 0 5 p m we were           informed      by Sgt.    2 640 P erry    to    return to

H i l l s b o r o u g h football       ground for meal.          At 3 . 1 0 p m a Police     transit       van

stop p e d on M i d d l ew oo d Roa d and          informed us that            there was    some    sort      of

' t r o u b l e ’ at the ground.              Myself and PC Enwright            then got    into the

transit        van,     along with other          officers and we were            conveyed to

L ep pings Lane.

Once     at Leppings           Lane,    we were    informed by the Sgt            in the    transit      van,

to wait        inside the van,           while    he went     to see where we were           required.

He    returned a few moments                  later,    and   instructed us to          patrol    outside

the ground,            where a large amount             of s upporters     of Liverpool          were

accumulating.              Myself and PC Enwright              then began keeping          supporters

off the        road.

At this        point      1 was      not aware    of anything      u n t oward happening          inside

the ground.

After      several        minutes,      my a t te nt i o n was   drawn to several          male

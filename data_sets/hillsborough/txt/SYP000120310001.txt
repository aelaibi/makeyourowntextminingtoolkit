            Main       Street       Police        Station,          to    commence          duties        at H i l l s b o r o u g h

            regarding             the S e m i     Final       football          match       between Liverpool                    and

            Nottingham             Forest.          I was         attached       to    serial        36,       in    charge       of     this

            serial          was    Police        Sergeant          18H9 France.               1 travelled             to H i l l s b o r o u g h

            our       post    at    about        1 1 15    hours.         The    train was           not       due    until       1440       hour*

            or    there       abouts.            During       the     time      between        our      arrival           at    the    station

            fans       walking        up    the     road       (away      f r d ^ p P f n T s bo rough)         some       asked       us w h e n

            the       nearest       pub w a s       that was          open      . We    tried        to    deter          the    fans     and

            requested             they     returned          to H i l l s b o r o u g h ,    some       complied           with       this

            request          others        continued          up    the    road.        Also       l a r ge     numbers          of    fans

            were       walking        down       the      road w i t h     packs       of    beer       and     drinking          from       the

            beer       cans,-      some    were        noisy       and    in h i g h    spirits.

            About       1345 h o u r s       I was         with; PC       3183 Trcek           n ea r     to    the       station       when       I

            heard       an a s s i s t a n c e      call      coming       from a       large        Gateway Supermarket

            further          up    the     road.          We ;d^d; not a t t e n d          this     call      as we           were    too    far

away    and       shortly            afterwars               the       assistance              was    cancelled.               1 could          see

large       groups         of    fans       sat       on      the       banking           outside          the S u p e r m a r k e t .          All

the    time       the      number          of    fans         was       increasing              and       same     were       drinking          and

getting        noisier.               Numbers            of       fans      had     tried        to       gain access              to    two

public       houses         near       to       our      location,               taut t h e s e       were       boarded           up

although          so m e    people          were         gaining            access         these          being       regulars.               The

Landlords          were         turning          fans         away       from       their        premises.

About       1400     hours           the    special               train       arrived,           the       fans       who     alighted

were    very       quiet         with       no     rowdiness                at    all.          Some       were       searched           but    as

far    as     X recall           nothing           intimidating                    or     unlawful          w as      found        on

anybody.           I certainly                  did      not       discover             anything           untoward           on    the

people        I searched.                  The     f an s w e r e           asked         to    form       up    on a        piece       of

waste       ground         ne a r     to    a    public            house         (the      name       of w h i c h         1 cannot

recall).           There         was       a short            delay whilst                 all       the    f a ns      were       gathered

t o g e t h e r , the       delay was              minimal              and      then,         together          with        some       Mounted

officers          they were            escorted               to H i l l s b o r o u g h .            These        fans       were       very

orderly        and      were         not    in the            least         troublesome.                   On arrival              at    the

ground       at    about         1420 h o u r s ,             the       fans      arrived            at    the     ground and

entered        orderly.               There        being           no m o r e       special           trains          we     remained          at

this    location,               this       being         L e p p i ngs L a n e .

Lappings          Lane      at       this       t i me       was       very      busy      with       fans.           I recall          a

senior       officer            (1    d o n ’t k n o w who)                 requesting               that       due     to    pedestrian

traffic        that        Leppings             Lane         be    closed         to      traffic,          to a v o i d       any

accident.            Th e       mood       of    the         fans      at     this        time       was    that        they were             very

noics y , a       lot w e r e         drinking               from       beer      cans         and    a    lot     of      them were

asking       other         fans       if    they         had any            's p a r e s *.          I to o k      this      to m e a n

spare       tickets.             There          was      a    lot      of m i l l i n g         about       by a g r e a t          number          of

fans    near       to      the       gates.

entry       to    th e    ground         with        his    son,       he     had       hold       of his            s o n ’s h a n d          and

in his       other        he    stated          he    had     his       tickets.              He       told      me       th a t      someone

had    jostled           his    son      and        in a     reflex          action       turned           to        protect           h i m as

he    did    so    someone          else        had       stolen        the       tickets          from         his       hand.           He    di d

not    k now who          they      were,           his    son was           obviously             upset.             He       realised

there       was    nothing           I could          do a b o u t          it,    he    was       not     bitter              about        the

incident          merely        d i s a p p o i n t e d at         the       behaviour             of    the         so    called           fans.

As    time       progressed              Leppings          Lane        was    getting           more       and        more         congested

with    fans,          I noticed              that    o n l y P S V ’s w e r e           being          allowed            down Leppings

L a n e , these          making          only       slow     progress             due    to     the      amount            o+ fans.                 As

kick-off          time     approached                the     crush          seemed       to     be      getting            w o r s e , I can

recall       a Senior           Officer,             Inspector              Ellis       I th i nk ,        using           a     loudspeaker

on a P o l i c e         Landrover             making        an appeal             to    the       fans         to     stop        pushing

and    to    form        orderly          queues,          these        requests          were          being          ignored.                The

Mounted          Section        were          then    requested              to m o v e       nearer            to    th e       turnstiles

in a n a t t e m p t       to       restore          some      semblance            of     order          to     the        crowd.

Together          with     other          officers           I was          required          to       try a n d          join        the

Mounted          Section        to a s s i s t        them.            I was       aware        that       a     lot        of     the      fans

had    been       drinking           and       the    mood was              getting       decidedly                  ugly        as    kick-off

time    approached.                  I cannot             r ec a l l    seeing          any     stewards.                  Although             I had

my    radio       switched           on       I could        not       hear       a great          deal         of w h a t         wa s     being

said    due       to     the    noise          of    the     crowd who             were       getting            noisier              and

noisier.            I can       r e ca l l      seeing         a number            of    fans          climbing            u p a wall               and

gaining          access        to    the       ground        over       the       turnstiles.

As    1500       hours     c am e        I could          hear     a shout          from        inside           the        ground,

obviously           as    the       game       started,          this        caused        the         f a ns    outside              the

mood    of       the     fans       was       turning        decidedly             u g ly.         A    short          time        l a t er     a

further          shout     went          up    in the        ground          which       wa s      obviously                too m u c h         for

the    fans       outside           to    bear       and     a further             surge        was       m a de.           I do       not

recall       seeing          any    gates        being            opened.            I did          not     hear         any       order        given

to    open       the    gates       because             the       noise        where          I was       made       it a l m o s t

impossible             to    hear    the       radio.

A    short       time       later    I saw a number                       of m y         colleagues              running            towards              the

ground.           I ran       too.        I then             heard        a voice             on m y      radio          say       "every

available          officer          to    the       ground             immediately*.                   On      gaining             access           to

the    ground          1 saw a       lot       of       people           on    the       playing          area       and       what

appeared          to    be    panic       at     the Le ppi ngs L a n e                       end.        I made          my       way     to       the

perimeter          fence,          by a g a t e          to       the     right          of    the     goal         post       looking

towards          the    Hop    end.         I assisted                   some       people          out     of      this       gate.            I

then    s aw PC S c h o l e y            of F D i v i s i o n             carry          somebody           to      the       fe n c e .        I

assisted          getting          this     person            out        and       onto       the    pitch.              As     I re c a l l         it

was    a young          lad    t ha t     had       been          brought           out.        PC     Scholey            then went                 ba c k

into    the       crowd,       I followed                him        up to          the    fence        that         separated              the       two

parts       of    the       ground.         I could               see     a number             of    people          lying          in the

bottom       by    the        fence       with      other people                   treading           all           over th em.             Some

of    the    people           lying       there         were obviously                   dead        or    dying.              PC       Scholey

and    myself          then a s s i s te d          a    number           of       people       over        the      f en c e ,         some        of

the    f a ns     passing          them     over         to       us,     some       fans       on our           side         of    the     fence

also    assisted             us.     We     t o ok       a    number           of    the       bodies          to    the       gate        in the

fence       and    passed          them     through               to     other       officers.                 I do       not       know        how

many    people          I     got    over        the      fe nc e ,           I know          that     some      were already                   dead

and    t h at     some        were       injured.                 1a l s o     r ec a l l      that       on      s o m e of        my     t rips

back    to       the    fence       I was        kicked             or    punched             by s o m e       fans       who       were

directing          their       anger        at      us.           I re c a l l       people          shouting             "Its          your

fault       you    black       bastards"..                   To     be    fair       there          was     a number               of    people

assisting          us as       w e l l.        I also             r e ca l l       telling          people          to    leave          some

people       who       were    obviously                dead and              to    pick       up a n d        help       others           who

were    obviously             alive       but       injured.                  These       included             children and                 young

women.           Not    a decision             I would              ever       like       to    have        to m a k e         again,

 because        obviously           I am     not    qualified              to m a k e       such a dec i si on             from a

  distance        of     over      10     feet    away.         After       what       seemed       like         e t e r n i t y we

 appeared         to     have      got    most     people        out.         At      this     time      1 was       with      a

 Police       Sergeant          ( I do      not    know who           he    is>.        We w e r e       the      only     two

  officers        in t h i s       part     of    the    ground        as     far      as    I could         tel l .       The m o o d

  of    the    f an s    there      was     getting        extremely             ugly and          they were            (in my

  opinion)        about       to    turn     on us.         We m o v e d         onto       the    pitch.

  Once     on the        pitch      I assisted           with     first          aid    to     some      people.           I placed

 my anorak          over      one       d e a d man.       I assisted              another         officer          Cl do      not

  being       overweight           and     aged about           30.        I recall          he w a s        placed      in a St.

  Johns       Ambulance.            Eventually,            at    the       request          of C h i e f     Superintendent

  Nesbit       I assisted           in     coaxing       uninjured            fans      off       the    pitch.          I recall

  two    fans     getting          extremely        upset        at    on e      of    our     plain         clothes       video

  m e n as     he w a s      filming        th e W e s t    stand          area.        They       thought          he w a s       the

  press.        Eventually              they were        led     off       the     pitch.

  1 then       rejoined         th e      remnants       of m y       serial          in the N o r t h           stand

  Eventually            we   were       stood     down     returning             to M S P S at          1 9 00    hours.

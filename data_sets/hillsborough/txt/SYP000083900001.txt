           RECOLLECTION OF FACTS RELATING TO HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

           BY PC 1226 ELLIS




            I am a Police Constable of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary presently

           stat i oned at Ki rkby-in-Ashf ield,



           On Saturday,              13 April   1989,       I had beeen attached to the Mounted

           Section for the day to assist other members of the Section.                                  We

           travelled to Hillsborough, Sheffield, under the supervision of PS 1710
           N 13 0 5 "
           WATSON in order to assist South Yorkshire Police with public

           order duties at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final                           between Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forest.
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      S 2 8 16



          My duties at the ground were to supervise the visiting Nottingham

          Forest Supporters at Penistone Road turnstiles           in company with Notts

          and S. Yorks Officers.



S.O.£     At about 2.30 pm that day the South Yorks Mounted Officers              resumed

           rom that area leaving me to patrol that area alone.              About 20 yards
Offcuce                 N/10O3               ----------------------------
          from me was PC 459 Hi nes who was also wo rki ng a l o n e .



          Dur i ng my patrol   I found the Forest, supporters to      be of good behaviour

          and at no time was     there any public order or crowd problem.           Also

          whilst   in this position I did not see any Liverpool Supporters            prior

          to or after the game.      My patrol    covered only Penistone Road corner of

          the Forest Supporter end.



          I. was not aware of    any crowd    problems at Leppings Lane or any part,        of

          the ground and was     not aware of what had happened       until the

          postponement of the game.



          At about 3.40 pm I stood by with other Mounted Officers on Penistone

          Road.    I then assisted with the orderly disperal          of the Forest

          Supporters from the ground and at 6.20 pm we were stood down.

                T am & <=upoo rte r of the Liverpool Football Club, and a friend of

                        who is a member of the Li'veXpool Supporters Club.                                   got

               me a ticket for the FA.Cup Semi Final              between Liverpool and Nottingham

               Forest to be played at Hillsborough in Sheffield on 15th April                            1989

                (1504S9).

                I travelled with               on the train from \ t

               Sheffield.     The train arrived at about 11.33^45 am (1133) (1145)

               at the station and ws were placed on a bus to the ground.                         We walked

               around for a while then went to the Lappings Lane, Liverpool                          end of

                the ground.    In fact at the start I had been given a ticket for the

                Kop end of the ground,         but   I had swopped it for a Leppings Lane ticket

                with a Forest supporter on the train.
                                                                                   PAGE

        I suppose it would be about 1»30 pm (1330) when we got to the Lappings

        Lane,    I had seen a lot of police who were telling          people where to go,

        but I was not stopped by police outside the ground,             At the turnstiles


V-      it was not too bad it would be about         1.30 pm (1330) and I got to the

        turnstile quite early,        I handed in my ticket and got in the ground.                X

        think I was searched by the police on the inside of the turnstile.                    1

        saw no signs telling me which way to go but the tunnel which was right

        in front of me was the obvious way to go,            1 did not see any stewards

        or police officers near to the entrance to the tunnel.              It was quite

        easy to get through the tunnel and at the end 1 went slightly to the

        right into what        I now know to be pen no 3.    when we just got in the

        pen was not to full, but as time went on it got fuller and fuller and
                                                                      P®y) *
        the crush was tighter and tighter.  It would be about 1.45 pm (1345T

        when I got i K t h e     pen and I not i ce'd^-that the pen to my right was

        almost em pty
                                  S o                1    - m- S o
        At abuili^d. 15 pm (1415) as near as I ^can remember 1 was standing             in

        the middle of^M^e        pen just to the right of the goal.       It was vary

        very crushed.         I was concerned for my safety.     At about 2.50 pm (1450)

        I recall a man of 40/50 yrs who passed me from the rear of the pen.

     Q , As he wars\3^evel with me he fell to the ground.         I   remember he was

        under my feet, m y ^ e e t    were touching him,    he was not moving I ’m sure

        he was dead.      I know       had greying hair, and a beige raincoat.          The

        match started and eventually finished but 1 don't remember much about

        it.  It was just st^ tight in the pens.   I remember seeing fans
                  O f\T   ■

        climbing out of the p e X l was in both to the side and the front of the

        pen.     At first 1 saw polices, at the front stopping fans going over the

        front fence     xsKj^act they were pushing them back.

        I realised that sometmt>«L was wrong, and I just pushed my way to the

        front and by this time the fnsj\t gate was open and I got out onto the

        pitch,       was on my own ana I had lost all my mates.          On the pitch I

    I think the police handed) the incident badly, as they did not appear

    to be p r e p a i d for what happened and reacted slowly.

    I think that t h e N ^ o s s t s               of supporters should have had the different

        ind of around.          I aisSK think that there should have been more

    ambulances on duty at the g r o u n d »                             I also think that the J r o n t fences

    at ground should have been abVa to have been removed more easily.

    I also think that the match stewards should have been more concerned

    with the filling up of the pens at the Leppings Lane end of the ground

    so that the two centre pens did not get too full.

    I also think that all the fans who arrived by trains should have been

    taken direct to the around and it should have been ensured that they

    went into theNLround and did not just wander about outside.

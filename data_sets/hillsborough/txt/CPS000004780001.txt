1.   The Solicitors for the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,

Messrs Davies Arnold Cooper, have quite properly sought the

Chief Constable's views on the proposed removal, before the

start of the forthcoming football season, of the remaining

barriers and safety fence to the Leppings Lane terrace.



2.   As the Solicitors point out in their letter of 23rd May,

the Club have already agreed to the removal of a further

barrier for testing by experts, whose reports are due shortly.

For civil purposes, therefore, there is no need for the

terrace to remain in its present condition. Similar

considerations apply to the criminal investigation, as Mr

Sharp confirms.



3.   It is quite clear that all the relevant technical evidence

from these structures which might be required in any criminal

proceedings has by now been obtained, and we do not think that

the proposed removal could prejudice the investigation or any

subsequent prosecution in any way.

      Dear Mr Sharp

      Hillsborough Enquiry

      Following receipt of your letter dated 23 May 1990 I have
      referred the matters raised to Mr Gareth Williams QC and
      Mr Peter Birts QC.

      I now enclose a copy of their joint advice which I have
      recently received. You will see that their views accord with
      your own.

       If there are any matters arising please do not hesitate to
       contact me.

       Yours sincerely

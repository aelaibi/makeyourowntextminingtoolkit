p re- b o o k e d    coach to travel          to the football              ground.           Other m e m b e r s         of

the C o v en tr y S e ct io n boarded the                 coach at this              point,          although       I. do

not know their            names      but do by sight.              The     coach was about                  three

quarters         full    at the      time    of    leaving       this    pick-up        point and             I sat

about      10 seats       behind the driver               next    to a     lad named             ]              but      I

don't      know his       full    name      or address.           I believe           that                  sat     behind

me a lt h o u g h      I d i d n ’t speak     to him or anyone              else       for any            length of

time as        I listened to my             personal       stereo       t h roughout         the journey.

Ue   set off and stop p e d off at three                      other      pick-up        points,            Nuneaton,

H in kl ey and Leicester.                Several       people      got on the           coach at each

point,       again,      I d o n ’t know any by names,                  just     by their             forces.

S ince     the      events   of that        day,    I recollect          two young^raids, both                      in

their mid teens,             boarding        the    coach at Leicester.                     I did not take any

special         notice     of the     two,    other       than,    at that           time,       1 remembered

they sat         on the      coach    but I remember          that       they w a l k e d by my               seat and

must     have       sat towards       the rear      of the        coach.

On the j ou r n e y to S h e f f i el d we did not stop a n y wKere                              but were        caught

in S h e f f i e l d at about         1.30    pm (1330)          and the       coach        parked near an

Industrial Estate.                I got off         the    coach with                       and the two             of us

w a l k e d towards        the ground.            I saw just       the odd one              or two supporters

from our         coach     party walk i n g        towards       the ground           but    I did not take

any great           notice and d e f in it e l y did not             see    the two          brothers           that

later      died.

It was a         10-20 minutes         walk,       a strolling          pace,        to get          from the       coach
to the turnstile area.                     On the way        I was     stopped several                    times    by

people as k i n g        if I had any spare                tickets.       It was         easy walking

towards         the ground,         there were       no     large     crowds     formed at this time.

In fact,         when    I reached the           turnstile are a , there was only small

q u e u e s , at the most           10 people      lonq^^t           each turnstile.                     There were

police         o f f icers    by the turnstfi^es,            they were      checking                tickets and

thro u g h      clothing.          There    were   no crowd problems at this                             time,     I would

say    it was a normal              s i z e amount of people at that stage and time
before a match.                I saw no stewards             outside      the ground whatsoever.

I had no          problem      in entering         the ground.            I handed my ticket                     in and

wa l ke d through.                        walked    in behind me and we made ar r a n g e m e n t                             to

meet     up wit h each other as                 I w a n t e d to go to the toilet and he wanted

not    even know about              any tunnel       that a p p a r e n t l y    leads to the                terrace,

I took         up my viewing         point at about S . 1 0 - E . 15 pm                (1410-1415).                 There

were a l r e a d y      people      in that area but              I was   fairly         free and easy to

move    around        the area.

At    this      particular         time    it   came to my a t t e n t i o n th juti the                  pens     behind

the    goal      at the L e p p in gs Ln side were a l r e a d y .Fi/l I of fans and they

appeared         to be       packed tigh t l y together.               They were               singing at this

point,         jumping       up and down etc,         but all a p p e a r e d to move as one                            large

mass .

Leading         up towards         kick-off      time,      it became more            obvious             that     the

crowd was          becoming        thicker      and thicker.           I did not even see the m atch

kick-off,          there was a        lot happening              in the stands           behind the goal.

F r o m my      position          I    could see       p e o p le being        pushed against               the f r o n t and

side     fencing.              The     crowd had become more                tightly packed and                    it

a p p e a re d that many of those                     in the       crowd were           becoming distressed.

I saw no football                     being    played but          I heard a large              'roar'         go up from

the    crowd.          Because my a t te nt io n was                 focus s e d on those              p&'ns, I saw
what a p p e a r ed to be a               crowd        "surge"      forward.            It was       jnoX a usual

type     of     ’surge*           where it is a wave               type mo t i o n where people                  pushed

forward         can regain             their steps         rearwards,          it was a solid move                     forward

wit h no        backward m o v e m e n t whatsoever.                     It   was as though the space                           to

the    rear      of the         crowd,        whe n   pushed forward,            was      being       filled by other

people         from the              rear. There were         far     too man y         people       in      the area.

Fans       started to             climb the       fencing and spill               out     onto       the pitch.

was    chaos,         it a p p e a r e d a.s though no of f i cia 1 s realised the                               proulem

cr ow d .       However,         once     the     problem      had     been     identified,               I. b e l i e v e   all

was    done      by    those          present     t h at    they    possibly         could      qo    in      tne

c x r c u fHs t a n c e s .

Following            the a f t e r n o o n events,           I left at some              time of my own accord,

although         I cannot             recall    that       exact    time.       I went       straight            back to

the    coach.          I definitely             did not       see any other              person from our                  coach

party from the                 time     I ente red the ground,                other       than                      until       the

time       I returned to the                  coach.

Ot h e r s     returned         to the        coach and,       as we were            waiting, I heard

to a police            officer          that    two had not        returned.             I did        not      take any

not i ce of thi s and di d not make a11ernpts to f i nd out who was mi ss ing

We    eventually              left S h e f f i e l d at about 6.0 0             pm      (1800),       still         two

p a s s e n g e rs s h o r t .

It was         not    until      the M o n d a y      that     I found out that              the two           lads

missing         from our         coach        party had        died       in the tragedy.

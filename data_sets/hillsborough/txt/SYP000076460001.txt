we were       to unload all           of the         cutting      equipment.        I did not see any

we were       involved      ina m ajor          incident and          I did    not take any            particular

notice    of them.          I cannot           say at this         stage whether         or not the gates

removed       the   cutting        e qu ip m e n t   from this       locker      and held       it ready to

many     to     restrict my view towards                        the tunnel.          I then saw a number                      of

police        officers,       I cant          say    how m a n y , s t a nding aro u n d a p p r o h i m a t e 1y

twelve        bodies w hi c h were f i n             a    line on the        floor.        On        looking at these

bodies        I could see          that       they were          blue   in the      face,       their mouths              were

open and their              faces       were    covered          in vomit.         They were a p p a r e n t l y

dead.         The Police S e r g e an t             had then f i n ished his              radio        communication

and     I told him who             I was a n d a s k e d him            i n s t r uctions as to what was

I became aware            that     still      none       had made us aware              of what          our

was    happening.          He and        the driver          remained w ith the a p p l i a n c e and the

cutting        equipment was           left at the           side    of the        vehicle         (a)    because       it

is too heavy and               cumb e r s o m e    to carry about an d                <b)    because          it was with

The    three     of us then made              our way to gate B t h e                        plan.        This    gate

Li v e r p o o l     supp o r t e r s    shout at       us    "About      fucking       time" There       remarks

were     not f o l l ow ed by a n y violence                   or other a g g r e s s i v e      insults.

We made        our way t hr o u g h the               crowd,       walk i n g   along    the    left hand side          of

the    railing w h i c h s ep ar a t e s              pens 3 and 4.             We fina l l y a r r i v e d at

the    fence at the bot t o m of the                        e n closure an d saw that the            gate w hich

a llows      acess         to the       pitch was       closed but was             being ma n n e d by a police

officer.           On this       j ou r n e y thro u g h      pen 4 I was          not aware      of any bodies

on the       floor and           I did not see any broken barriers and at this stage

we were        not      in any        radio     contact wit h the officer                 on the appliance.

W he n we      reached the              gate    the Police O f f i c e r a l l o w e d us entry to the

path     su r r o u n d i n g    the     pitch.        I im m e d i a t e l y    became aware      that    the

s up p o r t e r s    both      in pens 3 and 4 and on the                       pitch were      very hostile       to

the Pol ice O f f i c e r s             and they were          being ab*reive and              insulting    towards

them.        I saw several               supp o r t e r s    pu^rfrig the*' of f i cers and one            in

particular            was    hanging        on t c y m       officer      whose     tunic      had been    ripped

I looked towards                 penjB and         I saw that          the mes h fencing          had been       ripped

I soon       realised that my ma:i.n responsibi 11y now w o u l d be that of

for us       to      cut the fence awa y as                  there was          no crush and supporters

          se n s e d    the fans were           seen to       invade      the     pitch and       I w o u l d have      been

         this      and     the a tm os p h e r e was        less       tense.          As we    ran towards           the Hop

         after      passing        the Po l i c e O f f i c e rs        on the         centre     line the         Nottingham

         he was m oa n i n g and groaning.                       As    soon j t f e    we   reached the gap between

         the stands          I saw there were a numbar                         of     people    in a t t e n d a n c e and        I

         to see what             else    I could do.

         I think         it was at        this      stage     that       I went        to the L e p p i n g s Ln end of the

         pitch and          I saw a nurse and a s u pporter a t t e n d i n g                         to a , y o u t h at       point

         As we      reached the           gap between            the stands            I tried to get            someone        to

w al k i n g a n d as    I. looked at         the young         boy    I saw his m outh move.               I let

go of the        s t retcher        and went       to this      boy.     I knelt       down by the boy and

bodies       on the     pitch were          thinning      out    considerably,          most    of them

having    been t r a n sp or te d to the other end of the qrajtaffid.

At    the end of my final jayr n e y I went into t n a s i u m         through

number       of dead bodies w hi ch had been                    laid out       in three       or four       lines.

1 saw a number           of    police       officers      taking d e s c r i p t i o n s     of the     bodies

and    I saw what        I believed          to be a senior            police       officer    in plain

clothes asking           over a loudhailer               for any officers             not    involved with

bodies       to go to hirn »

Whilst       in this     room anot h e r       fire officer            come    into the       room and

trouble       between s up p o r t e r s      left    in the      ground.

I then went         into      the    centre    section of the            g y m a n s i u m and this a r e a was

being u sed to treat                the   injured who were             on the       floor and       placed

a r o u nd   the edges        (marked HI       on the map).            There were a number of

doctors       in a t t e n da nc e    and they were          treating         the    injured.        1 felt     that

they had every t h i n g            under    control     a n d ever y t h i n g was         being    carried out

professionally.               T hey had even got           the    drips       in ope r a t i o n and      cards

were    handed to the           injured wit h their              pulse    rates etc on.

            I knelt        by one young              lad,   age d about       18 years,         who was wear i n g a green

            casual     coat.          This      boy was       concious      but he kept          blanking      out.        1 could

            not     smell any         alcohol         on this      boy and he was            e v e n t u a l l y treated

            by a female           doctor a n d         in my opin i o n       I think        this    boy w o u l d have      lived.

            I was     then i n v olved              in placing      the    injured onto the s t retche rs and

            they were          carried to the a w a i t i n g ambula n c e s .

            I subsequently              c ol le c t e d all       my gear up and         returned to the appliance.

            We    drove      form the g r o u nd at            1720 hours.

            In conc l u s i o n       I feel at all matc h e s              there    should be senior             officials

            from     the Police Fire                an d A mb ul a n c e   posit i o n e d    together an d       should an

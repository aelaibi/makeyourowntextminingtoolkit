                     "BEYOND HILLSBOROUGH"

Some of you will be aware that we have been attempting to pull
together a day where we could come together to talk about
issues related to Hillsborough, the Centre, and about finding
ways of bringing all the different groups and individuals with
connections to Hillsborough together. This would enable us all
to look at the past two years , and to see how we can move on,
in unity. It goes without saying that some have had a
considerably harder time of the past two years than others, but
we've all had our life changed by the events, in some way, so
we all have that in common, if nothing else.

The initial letter had a number of points in it that the
organising group, made up of reps from the Centres Users
meeting had identified as questions worth while asking,
initially. There has been some feed back from this initial
letter, most of it positive, some of it identifying possible
problems.

There may be some of you out there that are feeling a bit
concerned about not hearing anything about the day, maybe
wondering if you've been forgotten. While we set a date for a
meeting, 19th April, the second anniversary threw a number of
people out of whack, not least myself. So, theres been nothing
to tell anybody about the progress because theres been non.
Apologies for that, but we're only human, despite what others
might think.

A meeting on Friday 10th May, which should've been with all the
group, but wasn't (theres that humanity again), identified a
number of issues that needed addressing either on the day or as
a follow on to the day. These are relevant to everyone thats
been involved in the aftermath of Hillsborough, although
obviously some more than others.I've added a few of my own to
it, and the list , while a long one, is probably not
exhaustive.

Please look at the list, and let me know if theres anymore that
can be added to it.

I told you it was long, but I don't think it's exhaustive.

There will be a need to prioritise, to decide which are the
things that need sorting first, to enable the rest to be looked
at and dealt with constructively. I'm stuck, to be honest with
you, so other people will have to get involved with this if
it's to work.

I have an old saying I carry about with me.

               "Don't talk about me, talk to me"

It would be a good idea to keep it in mind while your with
others, and maybe we can start the ball rolling properly.

There have been none of us over the past two years that have
"walked alone" although it must have seemed like it at some
times. There's no need for any of us to "walk alone" in the
future, either, but it needs people to make the effort.

Thanks for your time.

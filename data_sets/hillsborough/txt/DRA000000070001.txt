jear Mr. Jones,

XIRD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

.
’hank you for your letter of 12th May which was received here on the 18th.   I
iompletely agree that it is important to make sure that the Inquiry receives
uiy important information so that all the circumstances of the event can be
iroperly explored.  That is the sole purpose of the City Council's Working
’arty and that will be done.

!ould you also convey, if you think it is appropriate, to Lord Justice Taylor
:he City Council's apology for any breakdown in communication that occurred in
connection with the visit that took place last Friday.  It was not of course
•he intention of any member of the City Council to do anything that would
frustrate the Inquiry or to do anything that might unwittingly constitute
jontempt. A fax was sent to you confirming the telephone conversation but it
ippears regrettably that it was not received and therefore you may have been
inaware that the visit arranged on the telephone was going ahead in accordance
rith the conversation that had earlier taken place.  Obviously that is a
latter of regret but can I repeat that there was no intention whatever to
.gnore any order made by Lord Justice Taylor.  As it happened the City Council
,as not aware that a formal order had been made. We obviously are now and we
rill respond accordingly.

-an I also confirm      for the purpose of the record as it were that the
■heffield Wednesday F.C. fully co-operated in letting the members of the Working
arty inspect the ground and that their permission was sought and obtained at
ill times and again that no property of any description was removed.

ours sincerely,




eva Coombes,
eader.

      I am grateful for the information which I have noted and also passed onto
      the Secretary of the Inquiry, Mr R M Whalley.

      In closing can I reiterate my earlier spoken and written suggestions that
      anything you learn which is material to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry can
      be forwarded to myself or Mr Whalley at the following address:-

      Room 662
      Home Office
      50 Queen Anne's Gate
      London
      SW1H 9AT

     Can I also point out that I am also carrying out the Inquiry into how
     each of the ninety five killed met with their death on behalf of Her
     Majesty's Coroner.  Regardless of what you choose to forward to Lord
      ustice Taylor's Inquiry, I will still need to be aware of all material
     facts on behalf of the Coroner.

     I am sure I can look forward to your co-operation in this matter.

     Dear Councillor Chase

     The Chief Constable has asked me to write and thank
     you for your telex message of 23 August 1989 -

     The matter that you have raised will be dealt with
     by the Divisional Commander of Coventry.  I have
     therefore forwarded your correspondence to Chief
     Superintendent Swingewood, for his attention.

     Yours sincerely

          Dear Ken

          Re:         HILLSBOROUGH

          I enclose herewith one copy of the Trial Core Bundle.

          I am sorry the volumes are rather late in arriving but this has
          been caused by the fact that parties other than ourselves have
          been adding documents at a very late stage.         We were only
          advised of the latest inclusions late last night and of course we
          have had to insert these and also deal with a revised index.

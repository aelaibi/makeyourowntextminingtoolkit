                                  COACHES

LIVERPOOL


    1     All Liverpool coaches should leave the Ml Motorway at Exit 36
           (Tankersley) and travel vie the A61 to designated parking areas.

    2     The geographical location cf Liverpool, coupled with the countrywide
           support enjoyed by the Clue, suggests that coaches could well accroach
           the stadium by other routes, particularly the A616. If this is the
           case, then they must be brcught to the designated coach parking area.
    3     The serials engaged on duty at Tankersley and Oughtibridge will
           operate selective stop and search procedures to ensure (a) passenoers
           have tickets, (b) they are not in possession of alcohol and (c)
           they are not drunk. When this has been done, each coach will teve
           an adhesive sticker placed on the nearside of the windscreen ani it
           will be allowed to proceed to the designated parking area.

    4     All coaches will be allowed to travel to the ground without specific
          escort, although mennbers of the Road Traffic Motor Cycle Wing veil
          be providing overall mobile supervision. All coaches will be directed
           to the traffic island at Leppings Lane where in the first instance,
          they will park in Claywheels Lane. Once this area is full ther.
          coaches will be directed tc park on the ’out lane’ of the Hiwi
          carriageway in Halifax Road, parking to commence at the top of the
          dual carriageway and then work towards the stadium.

    5     All coaches will park before being permitted to set down passengers
          thereby ensuring that the occupants know exactly where to returr. to
          on coupletion of the football natch.

    6    Where it is discovered that passengers on a coach are not in possession
          of tickets, or are in breach of legislation concerning alcohol £t
          Sporting Events, then Ground Control will be informed for consideration
          as to returning such vehicles out cf the Force area under escort.

    7    Where individual passengers only are involved who have oonsuriec *innhr>1
          in such amounts that they are drunk, or are in possession of alzx±ol,
          then they should be arrested and detained pending transport.
NOTTINGHftW FOREST

    8    Nottingham Forest supporters who travel by coach will be encouraged to
          use the Ml motorway leaving at Exit 34 (Tinsley). This aspect of the
          operation will be dealt with by 'D* Division Officers and is t**8-
          subject of a separate order.

    9    These coaches will be parked in the South Yorkshire Transport Garage,
          Herries Road South and, if necessary, Rawson Spring Road.

•DTE:    Item 8 above outlines the contractual agreement between the
football supporter and the Club. It does not create a power to search

Refusal is merely a bar to entering the ground and not a criminal offeice.
Wbere a search is conducted with consent, it is a search within the
meaning of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Section 3(i) cf the
Act requires an officerto make a record of the search in writing unless
it is not practicable to do so and large scale searches such as those at
football matches fall within this section. There is not therefore a

1.1
    The m a t c h will att r ac t    a     capacity   crowd    of  approximately
55,000 spectators. A large percen tage of the cr o wd will travel by
road, either by coach or priv              ate  car. Special trains will also
convey Liverpool fans to          Wadsley      Bridge   station and Nottingham
Forrest s up p o r t e r s to S he f f i e ld Midland    station.    A convoy of
buses will t ransport fans         arriving      at Shef f i e ld Midland to the
ground. The gates at the          ground will be open from 11am.

1.2
     It is t h e intention of the Road         Traffic    D i v ision to assist
the free m o v e m e n t of traffic  and   the   segregation of supporters
both  before       and    after  the  game   so as     to     cause   as little
inconvenience as p o s sible both to persons attending the match and
to the general public.



2. Method.

2   .1
    S up e r i n t e n d e n t Brougham will be     in overall command assisted
by Inspector Scholey. Chief Inspector                 Shaw will be in command of
the sector north of               the ground   i.e.   the  Liverpool  routes and
Chief Inspector Lax              will      be in command of the sector south of the
ground i.e. the No tt i n g h am Forest routes.

2.2
     Traffic Division night staff o n Friday       14th April 1989 will
remain on    duty  until 8.00am. Unless instructed otherwise the 6
- 2d staff o n 15th April and     all -officers involved on duties re
the match will work from    08.00   until   approximately     20.00. No
officer will retire   fr o m     duty   unless authorised by asupervisory
officer.

2.3
     All i n t er s e c t io n s o n the motorway and all key traffic points
will be m a n n e d from 10am. There          will    be car patrols detailed to
sections of the moto rway and              motorcycle       patrols       covering other
routes.   All      officers        must    ensure   that        football     traffic  is
correctly directed. Of f icers on             static      points        must ensure that
priority is       given      to    the    heaviest    traffic          flow  which will
obviously be the           football      traffic.   All       officers      at locations
controled by automatic traffic signals                  will be issued with a key
to turn o f f the lights as and when               n e c e s s a r y .There are bound to
be locations where traffic will               build     up and delays occur. This
could lead to frustr a t i on           particularly       by     anyone not attending
the match. O f f i c e r s     shou l d   therefore      deal       fi rmly but friendly
with any c o m p l a i n t s re traffic movement.
      T h er e are no car parking       fa c i lities at Hills boro football
ground a n d all       drivers  sh ould    be encouraged   to park up whe n
w ithin w a l k i n g distance of the ground. There will no doubt come a
stage w h e n supporters will make more progress by walking.



     E i g h t personnel carriers  have  been aquired   and will be
driven by officers sh o w n at  Appendix'B'.  These vehicles will be
used to transport officers on     static  points, delivery of packed
meals etc.



     Th e r e is a remote          possibility        that some      supporters  will
travel on the A57 from Hyde              to S h e f f i e l d via the Snake Pass. To
reduce the possibility of this,               during         the  night of 14th April
 1989, B a r n s l e y Traffic Section will collect a diversion sign from
>F1 s u b - d i v i s i o n and trans port it     to the junction of the A57 and
A628 at Hyd e where it will be p o s i t i o n e d             to divert traffic away
from the A57 and along the              A628.     The officers detailed for this
 task will inform the police at G lossop                    of their intention. After
 the kick-off, Chief Inspector             Sha w      will arrange for the sign to
 be re— c o ll e c t ed and returned to FI.



     C o a c h e s will not be searched en        route    but will    be searched
on arrival at the parking area


2.8
      A p u blic order detail will be     present at Woodhall Services
 to prevent any disorder at that location. The detail will consist
 of of f i c e r s shown at Appendix *B*.


 3.       Briefi ngst


 31   A briefing will be held at driving         school at 9.00am for all
 those o f f i c e r s on static points and all motorcycle wing officers

 3    2
      A briefing will be held at Woodhall              police  post at 8.3 0am
 for all o f ficers s h o w n on A p p e n d i x ’B ’ with  the exception of
 Inspector Walker and       the Tra n si t     drivers who    will attend the
 driving school briefing.


 4. C o m m u n i c a t i o n s :


       All mobiles equip p e d with VHF radio will operate on channel
  one. Personal radios will     not  be   issued to  those officers on
  static p o ints shown in Appendix   ’D ’ except at certain strategic
  locations, in these cases portable VHF sets will be issued.

  m i n i — buses a nd vans will         be    t u rne d   right    at Upwell Street and
  will t h e n travel via Owler Lane                to    Herries Road. These vehicles
  will th e n be parked at the H e r ri es bus depot.


 5.4
           In      the      event  of  the  primary  route  for  cars  becoming
 o v e r - c o n j e s t e d there are four secondary routes available shown at
 appen dix 'A*. Some traffic may              be  sent on the coach route. None
 of the          a lternative      routes  will  be used without consulting a
 su p e r vis ory officer.


  5.5
            Despite the   above instructions   any Nottingham  supporter
  trav ell ing by car and pa rti cularly   wishing to leave the motorway

                 service trains from Nottingham.
    (17 2       There is 1 Special Train laid on to transport supporters to
                 and from Liverpool (into Wadsley Bridge) with a capacity of
                 350. Many Liverpool supporters will travel by scheduled
                 services into and out of Sheffield Midland.
    17 3        Liverpool enjoys widespread support and supporters from
                 all over the UK can be expected to travel into Sheffield
                 Midland on service trains. The train times from destinations
                 where Liverpool are known to have a strong following
                 are shown at Appendix ”D' .
     1.7.4      Supporters traveling to and from Sheffield on the Nottingham
                 Special Trains will be using the North End Gate . All other
                 visitors will be using the normal ticket barrier gates. See
                 Appendix "E“ for plan of Sheffield Midland. Skill and tact
                 will be required to hive the Liverpool and Notts supporters
                 from the travelling public.
     1 .7 . 5    Sheffield United are playing at Northampton on 15 April 1989
                  and, although there are no special trains, it is probable that
                  a number will travel to and f r o m Northampton by rail.

     18          The major threat will be from the Liverpool supporters whose
                  hard core are well known for causing disorder and committing
                  crime (especially shoptheft) on such occasions.

     1.9         PSV ARRANGEMENTS
     1 9.1       Supporters arriving at Sheffield Midland will be transported
                  to and from the ground on a dedicated fleet of SYT buses. To
                  maintain segregation different routes will be used for each
                  group as follows;
                 HOTTINGHAM FANS Depart from North End Gate then board SYT
                 buses in Sheaf Street. Travel to SWFC via ; SHEAF SQUARE,
                 POND STREET,FLAT STREET, HIGH STREET, ANGEL STREET, WEST BAR
                 SHALESM00R, GIBRALTAR STREET, PENISTONE ROAD .
             LIVERPOOL FANS Depart from ticket barriers then board SYT
             buses parked outside South Luggage Exit and facing CROSS
             TURNER STREET. Travel to SWFC via;gates, CROSS TURNER

             MARY‘S GATE, HANOVER WAY, NETHERTHORPE ROAD, MEADOW STREET,
             UPPERTHORPE, ALBERT TERRACE ROAD,MIDDLEWOOD ROAD AND LEPPINGS
             LANE .

    1.9.2    A ‘total of 35 PSVs are available for the day. From 0930 on
             15.4.89 6 will be parked at each exit. The remainder will
             be stacked on East Bank Road and will be called up by the SYT
             Inspector on duty at the Midland Station when required.

    1.9.3    The fare is 100p return and fans will know of this before
             arriving at Sheffield. They will receive a yellow return
             ticket on boarding which will speed the return loading. Each
             vehicle will hold 80 passengers.

®1.9.4       2 officers will accompany each PSV and,     once they have
             dropped their passengers, the officers will return        to
             Sheffield Midland for another load. Officers arriving at SWFC
             after 2:45pm will not return but will report to the Gym at
             SWFC and re form into serials to act as a reserve.

    1.9.5    After the match the same procedure will be adopted      to
             return the fans to Sheffield Midland.      The serials will
             accompany the same groups as the inward journey. Once fans
             are inside the station then officers may be required     to
             return on the empty PSVs for return loads.

    1.9.6    After the match Liverpool fans will load in Penistone Road
             North from Wardsend Road North to Leppings Lane roundabout.
             Nottingham fans will load in Pensitone Road North outside the
             ground facing city.
             Buses returning with Liverpool fans will return via St Mary s
             Road,  enter the one way system and then Fornham Street.
#   110      Serials 1 - 2 will be deployed to line the parking area to
             ensure that no one dis embarks. The buses will unload one
             at^a time. SYT drivers have been briefed.

    1.11      Buses r e t u r n i n g with N o t t i n g h a m fans w i l l approach   the
              Sheffield Midland from Sheaf Street. Serials 3                         4 will be
              deployed to line the arrival area to ensure that only one PSV
              at a t i m e dis embarks. The fans will enter through the North
              End Gate.

     1.12     It is imperative that buses do not travel in convoy and that
              only one bus at a time (the lead bus) either loads or unloads.
              This will assist the searching serials at the ground and will
              assist with segregation at the Sheffield Midland.

     1. 13    Supporters (mainly from Nottingham ) will be arriving and
              departing on service coaches at Pond Street. Serials 1 -
           will be deployed in the area to instruct both groups to
           use the SYT PSV services departing for SWFC from outside
           Sheffield Midland.

  1.13.0   Opposing group's returning PSVs clash at Hoyle Street and
            Penistone Road. Serial 19 will patrol the t:ea after         the
            natch until all PSVs have passed that point.

 1.13.1    The bus station is new and the serials deployed there will
            faniliarise themselves with the layout and relevant platforms

 1.14      Mounted and dog section officers will be avail&ble at the
            Midland Station for the arrivals and departures. Their
            supervisors will liaise with A/Supt. King for deployment on
            15 April 1989 but will be at the Midland by 0830.

               SUBJECT:   INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION FOR THE FA CUP SEMI FINAL BETWEEN
                 NOTTINGHAM FOREST AND LIVERPOOL TO BE PLAYED AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL
                 GROUND SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989


                  With reference            to the       above FA Cup Semi Final,   I have   to report as
                  follows:

                  Intelligence enquiries have beer, made and reports received in respect
                  of both Nottingham Forest and Liverpool supporters which I will deal
                  with separately.

                  CLUB COLOURS

                  Both clubs colours are red and white and therefore clash on the above
                  date.   Liverpool will on the day wear all red and Nottingham Forest
                  will wear all white.

                   LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS

                  The behaviour of the Liverpool fans this year has been quite good,
                  although there have been a number of arrests which have oeen mainly for
                  drink related offences.

                  However in a recent visit to London to play against Queens Park Rangers
                  quite a number of Stanley knives and other metal weapons were found
                  discarded a snort distance from the turnstiles when it was seen that
                  Police Officers on search/reception parties were using hand operated
                  equipment to search fans for weapons.

                   In their game against Derby County at Derby small metal discs were
                   thrown at Police Officers inside the ground and they had obviously been
                   carried into the ground in the fans pockets together with coins.

                   There was also an incident in a game against Manchester United, fire
                   crackers were thrown and on exploding these gave off a loud bang
                   followed by dense smoke. Also at the end of this game as the Liverpool
                   fans were leaving the ground under Police escort about ^0 fans broke
                   away and tried to cause trouble.      This was only prevented by the
                   presence of the Mounted Section who 'rounded' them up.

                   Last Tuesday 11 April 1939, Liverpool visited Millwall and their
                   conduct was very good.     However, after the game, and whilst being
                   escorted back to their transport, one of them released a flare onto the
                   main road.  Luckily, although the roadway was crowded, no one was hurt.
                   Prior to the game all the Liverpool fans were thoroughly searched and
                   officers at the scene believe that the person responsible secreted the
                   flare outside the ground prior to entering the ground.

                   There are seven (7) Exclusion Orders for Liverpool fans and details of
                   these will be placed on the briefing board at the ground.

It is a veil kr.own fact that at all the big games that Merseyside Clubs are in,
teams of pick-pcckets and travelling thieves will be in attendance.       Recent
photographs of these are attached to this report and copies will also be
available tc supervisory officers in charge of each Serial.      The photographs
will also be displayed on the briefing board at the ground.

Albums and details of other pick-pockets will be available in the Police Room.

There is one special train arriving at Kadsley Bridge Station at 1^.02 hours
and departing at 17.05 hours or as soon as practicable afterwards.    Although
there are a r.ur.ber of service trains the main contingent will travel in
coaches, r.ini buses, vans and other types of private vehicles.        (On one
occasion, fans travelled here in an articulated trailer van) and it is
anticipated as on previous occasions these w’ill be carrying alcohol.    It is
well known to visiting fans that they will not be allowed into local pubs near
the ground so they therefore stock up from supermarkets and consume it whilst
travelling to the game.    Details of known coaches will be available for the
briefing.

On the 1 A-oril I9S9, when Liverpool played Norwich, a coach fro* 'HAN’MERS' was
checked at Norwich after information had been received that the passengers had
been causing trouble at a service area and that the coach was carrying alcchol.
It was stepped by Police but the driver had by this time confiscated the drink
and disposed of it.    This coach, registered number,           was not on the
list supplied by Merseyside Police and could well attend this Saturday.

NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUPPORTERS

The conduct of the Nottingham supporters varies from game to game away from
home.   When they played Liverpool at Hillsborough last year there were 2? of
their fans arrested. These were for offences of public order, obstruct Police,
wounding and drink related offences.     The wounding was after the gam? in
Hillsborough Park and|            "           Ia serving soldier, was arrested
for this cffer.ce.   He is still on bail to Crown Court awaiting trial and a
photograph of hie is displayed on the briefing board, together irith the otners
arrested at last years game.

 Last Sunday during the game at Wembley against Luton Town there         were    22
 Nottingham fans arrested for drink related/public order offences.

 However, the majority are well behaved but they do have their travelling
 hooligan elements who tend to seek out opposing fans prior to the game and
 cause disorder or seek confrontation after matches if not firmly supervised.
 The hooligans are known to carry Stanley knives, JIF lemons containing bleach
 and pencil flares.    One such pencil flare was recovered at the Nottingham
    1*4 April 196?

    Subject:    FA Cup Semi Final-Liverpool v Nottingham Forest


    Forest v Leeds match in February last year. It was recovered from a Nottingham
    youth and was discovered concealed in his underpants on being searched. He has
    admitted usir.g the flare at Hillsborough during the semi final last year
    between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.    When used it fires a flare 200 feet
    and produces a loud bang,   ;r fired directly at a person it will cause serious
    inj ury.

    The main football hooligan from Nottinghar.,                  | will not be
    able to attend the match this year as he is at present detained during Her
    Majesty's pleasure.

    However, 15 known hooligans have been the subject of target by spotters from
    the Nottinghamshire Constabulary who monitor the Forest gaip.es.   They include
                        |whc was charged with murder and affray after a match in
    1980 and L           ]who appears to be one of the 'ringleaders’ during the
    absence of            His hair is long at the back and tied in a pony tail.

    There are only two (2) Exclusion Orders for Nottingham Forest fans:

    Photographs of these and the targets will be displayed on the briefing boards,
    together with three photographs showing these targets at last years game.
                                      ana                and I    I

    The mode of travel by the Forest fans is by train, coach, mini buses, vans and
    private cars.   One one occasion this season mini buses were turned back when
    alcohol was fcund and the passengers were under the influence.

    There are four special trains into the Sheffield Midland Station arriving at


•
     1 2 .3 1 , 12.46, 13.02 and 13-12 and departing at 19-05, 19-15, 19-23 and 19-33
    respectively. Each train has a passenger capacity of 500.       In addition there
    are numerous service trains.

    D Division are aware of all the trains arrival and departure times.

    FURTHER INFORMATION

    Personal visits or contact has been made with licensees and managers of
    licensed precises and off licences and they have been advised accordingly.
    Those   premises    visited /contacted in   F1/F2  by myself and in Deepcar,
    Stocksbriage a n d Oughtibriage by Police Sergeant Hixl.

    All accepted the advice given with the exception of the Royal Hotel, Penistone
    Road, Hillsborough and the Cock Inn at Oughtibridge. Both will open as normal
    and are not taking any precautions whatsoever, i.e. doormen.         They will be
    allowing anyone in and it could well be that there could be a confrontation of
    fans at the Rcyal with it being near to the ground. Patrolling officers in the
    vicinity of tr.-?se premises will be well advised to monitor the situation.

    Three spotters from the Nottinghamshire Constabulary, Police Sergeant Adrian
    Brazener, Fclice Constables Brian Walton and Nick Hoad, will be working the
    match to assist ir. identifying trouble makers.

    There is no intelligence at this stage to suggest that there are any ferged
    tickets in circulation.     However, at the game against Millwall this week, a
    number of fcrged tickets from the Liverpool end of the ground were recovered.
    These had beer, copied from original tickets or. a Rank Zerox copying machine.

    At the previous cup match with Liverpool at Nillwall this year identical
    forgeries were recovered.   The recent game was not an all ticket natch and if
    the persons responsible can take the time to forge tickets for such a game they


•
     could well attempt to do the same for the semi final. There    are    three  (3)
    different  colours   of tickets,   Spion Kop, South Stand and Scuth Stand
    (uncovered) for Forest fans and three (3)for the North Stand,     West Stand and
    Leppings Lane terraces for Liverpool fans.   Copies of thesetickets showing the
    proper colour for each respective section will be displayed on the briefing
    boards.

    Attention of all officers working inside the ground is drawn to offences that
    are becoming far to prevalent i.e. theft of the cash takings frorr. kiosks and
    snack bars.    One identical  offence was committed during the semi final at
    Hillsborough last year.

    Displayed on the briefing boards for those who have not worked at Hillsborough
    recently are photographs of weapons and gas canisters recovered from football
    fans.

    The new trend by supporters      carrying inflatable mascots has       been adopted by
    both sets of supporters.

^ ^ B a n a n a ’s, flamingos (2' high) and miniature lilo’s with a palm tree by the
     Liverpool supporters and a small oak tree (20" high from the emblem of the club
     badge) plus a smattering of bananas by Nottingham Forest fans.

    Court dates    for prisoners arrested at     the game have been         obtained   from
    Inspector Liniley, Prosecutions Department, and are as follows:

    Nottingham Forest fans - Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday 25, 26, 27 and
    28 April 1989-

    Liverpool   far.s - Tuesday,   Wednesday,   Thursday   and Friday 2,   3,   4 and 5 May
    1989.

    Twelve prisoners to be bailed to each court date.

    Should it be r.ecessary to hold an emergency court on the day of the snatch, call
    out numbers for prosecutors and court house staff are in my possession.

Introduction
This background paper explains the roles of the Football Trust and Football Grounds
Improvement Trust, and describes the main objects of their grant policies.


The Appendices contain details of grants paid to League clubs and international
grounds. As will be apparent from reading the text, the Football Trust has a responsi­
bility for helping football at every level in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and as a
consequence there are well over 1,000 other schemes in respect of which the Trust
has paid or promised grants. Readers who would like further information about these
should contact:

      Dear Richard,

      Thank you for your letter dated 7th March 1988.

      I note your comments regarding the possibility of a £5,000 grant towards an
      enhancement of our CCTV facilities and I am in the process of discussing with
      the South Yorkshire police their requirements.

      With regard to the balance unspent of £1,502.03 I enclose a copy of a letter
      from my local Chief Superintendent dated 19th March 1988 which confirms that
      the work undertaken was at their request. Copies of the original
      correspondence and specifications etc. are enclosed and should you require any
      further documentation I should be grateful if you would advise me accordingly.

      Yours sincerely,

Dear Richard,

I note from your News Letter that certain Clubs have been in receipt of grant
aid to assist them in up-dating their video equipment.

^ h a v e been approached by South Yorkshire police to see if financial
 assistance can be given in enhancing the system here at Hillsborough.  I would
 ask your guidance therefore as to how you would wish any proposal to be made
 to the Football Trust.

 Further to this I would advise you that towards the end of last season, at the
 request of the Police, we up-dated certain of our close circuit television
 equipment at a cost of £6,549 + VAT and I would ask whether the Football Trust
 would consider granting us financial assistance towards this sum.

 I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

 Yours sincerely,

            SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY
            POLICE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
            AND CONTROL ROOM.




  The quality of the three existing cameras is such that they are
  totally inadequate for the job that they are supposed to do.
  The design of the cameras    if
                               of the outboard P.C.B. type. This
  means that the ciruitry and the tube has no protective case for
  weather or mechanical damage protection.
  The tube in the Leppings Lane camera is nota low light tube,
  which means that in bad light conditions the picture transmitted
  to the monitor is virtually unusable.
  The Colour camera at the Penistone Road end of the ground is of the
  same design as described above. The tube gives a good picture in
  good light conditions but in poor light there is no picture at
  all.


& MONITOR
   The control for the camera functions although adequate in themselves
   are poorly positioned and tho vid<»o tape recorders are only three
   hour r^coriii"..
   This means that it is impossible for the police to record from the
   time the system is switched onto the              time when it is shut    down.
   If an’ incident needsto be recorded, the police controllerhas to not
   only control the camera, he also has to reach down and switch the video
   play and record buttons at the sam* t.im**. As vella.® the difficulty
   'involved' in tfoig ©per«vH©f* \rh iL iqpe. f     ('’"irug t'trttftvJhiCh
   approximately four to five seconds means that the likelrhood of the
   iciHfiit being mi      d •*» tape; is g r c & H y increased*
   As you can dec* the design *ud layout    of the systeia plus the typeof
   equipment used makes the surveillance system less than adequate for
   the use for which it was intended.

   We are pleas^l therefore to submit our re-design and specifications
   of the surveillance system in ron.iunrt.ion with the police and your

       I am pleased to advise you that at their meeting on 2 July, the
       Trustees agreed to accept the recommendation from the Chairmans
       Working Party that w e "contribute a total o f £25,000 to w a r d the
       installation of closed circuit television at your ground, on the basis
       that the equipment is owned and maintained by the police.

       When you are able to confirm that you have incurred expenditure
       in excess of that amount, I should be happy to let you have our
       cheque.
       I shall incidentally be writing to the chairmen of all clubs in the
       course of the next few days outlining the national policy of the
       Trust on CCTV: we viewed your application as a special case, not
       least because it was submitted before the national policy was agreed.

      Dear Richard

      Football and the Community: Sheffield Wednesday FC

      As agreed, please find attached Sheffield Wednesday's submission for a
      Football Trust grant which we have discussed briefly.

      I support our Yorkshire and Humberside region's recommendation that a grant
      of £15,000 be made by the Trust towards this project.  I am informed by the
      region that the Club has developed community use of the facilities both at
      its training ground and at Hillsborough particularly through Keith Bannister,
      an ex-player.

      The Sports Council has previously made substantial grants to the Club -
      £49,000 in 1979 for the provision of a pavilion and floodli^iting, and
      £ 6 6 , 3 8 4 for the changing accommodation, reception area, lounge and multigjm
      at Hillsborough.        In addition, £2,250 has been made available for the equip­
      ment to be used in this current proposal.        These previous grants show the
      Sports Council's commitment.

         I would be grateful if you would let me have an early decision.

         Yours sincerely

           Football and the Community: Sheffield Wednesday FC

           As agreed, please find attached Sheffield Wednesday’s submission for a
           Football Trust grant which we have discussed briefly.

           I support our Yorkshire and Humberside region’s recommendation that a grant
           of £15,000 be made by the Trust towards this project.  I am informed by the
           region that the Club has developed community use of the facilities both at
           its training ground and at Hillsborough particularly through Keith Bannister,
           an ex-player.

           The Sports Council has previously made substantial grants to the Club -
           £49,000 in 1979 for the provision of a pavilion and floodlighting, and
           £66,384 for the changing accommodation, reception area, lounge and multigym
           at Hillsborough. In addition, £2,250 has been made available for the equip­
           ment to be used in this current proposal.  These previous grants show the
           Sports Council’s commitment.

            I would be grateful if you would let me have an early decision.

           Yours sincerely

         has been poorly received.

         I believe this to be a good scheme but there may be problems in attracting
         finanancial support to match any offer made by the Txrust.

    6.   Witton (For Aston Villa)

         Waiting for BR to respond on the matter of provision of a police control
         centre. We are still not aware of whether they are proceeding with the
         scheme.

    7.   Leicester Station

         Interest now being shown by the Department of Trade and Industry who have
         indicated they will provide some financial support for the scheme. Active
         discussions in hand with BR.

         Now looking more promising.



                                                                                     (

8.        Port Vale FC

          Grant recommended for improvements to car park.

9.        Preston North End FC

          No justification for grant for transport or public order needs.

          Any grant awarded can only be based on community or disabled persons
          considerations.

10.       Sunderland FC

          Problems with car and coach parking.

          Club now examining provision of new car park which if progressed may
          lead to grant application.

11.       Bristol City FC

          Request by club for discussions on transport problems. To be examined.

12.       Arsenal FC

          Request for discussion on proposal by club.   To be examined.

13.       Merseyside Local travel Arrangements

          Awaiting proposals from British Rail and Merseyside Passenger Transport
          Executive.

14.       Liverpool and Everton Car Parking Arrangements

          Awaiting information from Liverpool City Engineer regarding possible
          examination into traffic flows to the two grounds.

15.       Millwall Proposed New Rail Halt

          Now waiting for London Underground to provide further information on the
          possible underground extension, which if approved would provide a new
          station adjacent to the stadium.

          In the meantime BT Police propose certain alterations at New Cross Gate
          BR station. To be examined.

16.       Relocation of Walsall FC

          West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive is interested in ensuring
          suitable provision for rail passengers for the proposed new stadium.
          To be examined.

17.       Hull

          Problems with rail movements to Boothferry Halt.   To be examined.

18.       Newcastle

          BT Police have advised me that there are some problems in the Newcastle
          area and this will be examined.
19.   Leeds Proposed New Rail Halt

      Detailed discussions still taking place bec..w-.     - ^   .ity Council and
      the property developers.

      This matter is becoming very protracted but I am advised by the City Council
      that they hope to be in a position to discuss the transport arrangements
      within the next month or two.

20.   Scottish Region BR

      Awaiting proposals from BR.

21.   York City. Control of Visiting Supporters

      The suggestion for a new rail halt was not supported by either the police
      or the club itself.

      An alternative suggestion made by the police to improve the exit arrangements
      at York station had considerable merit.

      This proposal was however rejected by BR as it conflicted with plans to
      extend the car park.

22.   Wembley Stadium

      There is an ambitious plan to improve access from 'v’embley Park station
      to Wembley Stadium via Olympic Way.

      It was initially thought that these were plans by ■cembley Stadium Limited
      but after discussions with the interested parties it is now clear that
      it is a Brent Council proposal.

      Too early to comment on the proposal or to say if there would be any
      justification for a grant.

23.   Fulham Broadway (For Chelsea FC)

      Awaiting further developments in this somewhat complex situation.

Dear Mrs.   Finney,
Thank you for your letter of the 12th October, 1988.   I now have
details of the costs at Wadsley Bridge for which w e would ask you to
consider grant aid.  I have tried to contact Ron Cotton direct,
so far without success.   The items which cannot be covered by
Derelict Land Orant are:

  Renewal of basic platform lighting.                 £2700
  Tarmac on existing platform.                        £2000
  Repairs and minor work on platform.                 £2000

  20% of land reclamation costs      (not met
  by D.L.G. which covers 80%).                        £2660
                                                      £9360

    Trust's assistance in meeting these costs will be greatly
appreciated. In your letter of 16th November. 1987 you did indicate
that the Trust would complete the funding required although
stage it was estimated that this would be some £6000.

 I look forward to hearing from you   If in the " ^ i m e                 *"y
 the Trust's Officers would like either to come and v i s i t W a d s l e y
 Bridge or to discuss these items further, please do not hesitate to
 contact me.

 Yours sincerely.

 Dear Mr Jones,            WADSLEY MIDGE STATION

I was very pleased to hear that the Department of the Environment have approved
a grant of £18,000 for Wadsley Bridge and that the scheme is now fully funded.

As agreed between Mrs Marsh and Mr Cotton the Trust’s transport consultant at
their meeting in Sheffield on 4 November the Trust will now deal directly with
Mr Parkins the local BR Area Manager but I must take this opportunity of
thanking you for all the time and effort your Department have put into the
development of this scheme which has led to such a successful conclusion.

Please do not hesitate to contact me again if you feel there are any other
matters where we may be of assistance.

Dear Mr Parkins,

                             WADSLEY BRIDGE STATION


I would refer to the telephone conversation between Mr Cotton the Trust's
transport consultant and Mr Nowell your Area Passenger Manager.

As you will be aware Sheffield City Council have been discussing with us the
question of a grant towards the proposed work at Wadsley Bridge station.

We have now agreed with the Council that it would be more sensible for us
to deal directly with yourself on the matter.

In 1986 the original cost of the scheme was £20,000 but we now understand that
this has increased to £24,000. We have been advised that the Department of the
Environment have approved a grant of £18,000 towards the project. In the
circumstances the Trust will offer a grant of £6,000 to complete the full
funding required.

This grant will be paid on written confirmation from yourself that the full
work has been completed. This being the normal procedure we have established
with British Rail with the other various schemes we have supported.



Yours sincerely,
                         WADSLEY BRIDGE STATION




Background


Wadsley Bridge station is a disused passenger station on the former Great
Central Main Line from Sheffield to Manchester via the Woodhead Tunnel. This
line is now closed as a through route between Sheffield and Manchester and has
now been reduced to a single line freight route between Sheffield Woodbum
Junction and Deepcar, a few miles beyond Wadsley Bridge.

Whilst there are no regular passenger services over the line it is authorised
for the operation of special football trains to Wadsley Bridge,

Wadsley Bridge has the great advantage of being located within reasonable walking
distance of Hillsborough Stadium. A fact much appreciated by the police and
Civic Authorities.

The Operating circumstances at Wadsley Bridge are such that it is possible
to deal with a considerable number of special football trains at roughly 15
minute intervals. The trains remain at Wadsley Bridge ready for their return
services resulting in minimum delay in loading returning supporters.

The station being unstaffed and out of regular use has been subjected to a
considerable amount of local vandalism and is deteriorating fairly rapidly and
will soon become unfit to use.

British Rail decided that to allow the continued use of Wadsley Bridge for
special football trains the station buildings would need to be demolished and
the area landscaped. They costed a scheme in early 1986 at £20,000 and realising
the problem of obtaining internal BR funding for the scheme approached Sheffield
City Council to see if the City Council would provide a grant.

Sheffield City felt unable to do so but were aware of The Football Trust and
wrote to The Trust in September 1986 setting out the case and making application
for a grant. On 29 October 1986 the Trustees agreed to offer a grant of £10000
or 50% of the cost (whichever is less).

 In the meantime Sheffield City advised the local BR Area Manager to apply to
 the Department of the Environment for a Derelict Land Grant. After a considerable
 delay BR made such an application in April 1987. With the passage of time the cost
 had increased to £24,000 and this figure was used in the application to the
 Department of the Environment.


 Current Situation

 On 4 November I met representatives of Sheffield City Council and local BR
 Management took us to Wadsley Bridge to see the current situation.
 The Department of the Environment were contacted by Sheffield City and advised
 the City that a letter would be sent in the near future confirming that the
 Department would offer BR a suitable grant for the work at Wadsley Bridge.
 I agreed with the representatives of Sheffield City that they would drop out
 and The Football Trust would deal directly with the BR Area Manager on the
 further development of the matter.
                             2/


In subsequent discussions with Sheffield City and BR Area Management it has
been confirmed that a letter has been received from the Department of the
Environment containing an offer of £18,000 grant towards a total cost of
£24,000.

The scheme is now not only fully funded but overfunded, taking account of the
earlier offer from The Trust and it would be wrong for BR to obtain financial
advantage from the situation.

Since BR advised the Department of the Environment that the total cost is now
£24,000 I cannot see how they can change this figure and The Trust should work
on the basis of this being a true figure.

This means that The Trust should reduce their grant to £6,000.



Action

A letter be sent to Sheffield City Council thanking them sincerely for all the
work they have put into this matter.

The BR Area Manager should be advised that The Trust is very pleased to learn that
the Department of the Environment has given them a grant of £18,000 and in the
circumstances The Trust will modify their offer to a grant of £6,000 to ensure
full funding of the scheme.

     Dear Sir,

     Wadsley Bridge Station

A    Following my letter dated 25th November, 1986, I am writing to inform you of
     the progress made in finding additional funding to supplement your grant
     of £10,000 or 50% of the cost towards reinstatement of Wadsley Bridge Station
     for the use of football supporters. I am sorry for the delay in writing to
     you again, but the grant application process has taken some considerable time.

     I advised British Rail in November 1986 to apply for a Derelict Land Grant
     through the Department of the Environment. Initial consultations between
     B.R. and the D.o.E. commenced in December 1986, but progress has been hampered
     by vacant posts in B.R. local management. On appointment of a new Area
     Manager, B.R. submitted an application to the D.o.E. in April 1987. B.R. are
     currently waiting for a reply.

      B.R. intend to run football special trains to Wadsley Bridge on a temporary
      basis for the next season subject to the approval of their surveyor.

      I am also keeping Mr. McGee, Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
      informed of the progress.

       I will be in touch again once B.R. have heard from the D.o.E.

       Yours faithfully,




       Head of Joint Transportation Policy Unit

 Dear Sir,

 Wadsley Bridge Station

 Thank you for your letter dated 29th October, 1986 informing me that your
 Trustees have agreed to offer a grant of £10,000 or 50 percent of the cost
 (whichever is the lesser) towards the reinstatement of Wadsley Bridge Station
 for the use of football supporters.

 The City Council, together with British Rail, are currently looking into
 possible funding for the remaining cost of demolition and landscaping.

 I will be in touch again once funding for the outstanding costs have been
 decided and the detailed scheme has been costed up.

 Yours faithfully,




 Head of JoiYit T r a n s p o r t a t i o n Policy Unit

Dear Sir,

Access to Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground

A problem frequently occurs within the City of accommodating large numbers of
football supporters of away teams. As you may be aware, football supporters
visiting the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground currently travel on Football
Special Trains to Wadsley Bridge Station. This Station is not used for normal
passenger services and the line is used for freight only on one track with the
other track disused.

I am writing to inquire whether you may have any funds available to provide safe
access to Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground by rail.

British Rail inform me that the station buildings on both platforms are in a very
poor state of repair and the British Transport Police are concerned about passenger
safety. British Rail have stated that unless the buildings are demolished and
the site landscaped, they will be unable to continue to use the Station for
Football Special Trains. All Football Special Trains would then terminate at
Sheffield Midland Station in the City Centre. This would present further problems
of transport for supporters through the City by road.

British Rail are not in a position to fund the demolition and landscaping alone,
which is estimated to cost around £20,000.

I understand that some recent work on Platform 6 at Nottingham Station to allow
direct access for football supporters from a side street entrance was funded by
the Football Trust together with the City and County Council. I would, therefore,
be grateful if you could indicate as soon as possible whether the Wadsley Bridge
Scheme may be eligible for funding.

Yours faithfully,




 Head of Joint Transportation Policy Unit

•   1. INTRODUCTION

    Scope and status of the Guide
    1.   This booklet provides guidance to ground management, local
    authorities and technical specialists such as engineers on
    measures for improving spectator safety at existing sports
    grounds. It is a voluntary code and has no legal force.

    Background to the Guide
    2.     Guidelines on measures for improving the safety of
    spectators at sports grounds first became available on a more or
    less comprehensive scale when the Wheatley Report on Crowd
    Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1972. The recommen­
    dations in the appendix to that Report were extended to include
    fire precautions and means of escape from an emergency situation
    such as a fire, and then formed the basis of the Guide to Safety at
    Sports Grounds (which became known as the "Green Guide"). The
    application of those guidelines to football grounds over the few
    years which followed revealed a need for the advice to be
    amended in certain respects. Furthermore, since the safety of
    spectators can be affected when crowds are disturbed by hooligan
     elements, the recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd
     Behaviour were incorporated in a new version, published in 1976,
     which was aimed specifically at football grounds. Following the
     fire at Bradford City FC ground in 1985 in which 56 people died, a
     working party, established under the aegis of Mr Justice
     Popplewell's Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
     Grounds, reviewed the Guide and produced a series of recommen­
     dations which have been taken into account together with
     comments from others in producing this revised and expanded
     version.

     H istorical context
     3.    Serious accidents at sports grounds involving injuries on a
     large scale to spectators are fortunately few. But as demonstrated
     by those-at Ibrox and Valley Parade, and before that at Burnden
     Park, the potential scale of death and injury at a crowded sporting
     event is such that it is essential for ground management to take

such steps as are necessary to ensure reasonable safety at their         spectators in existing sports grounds and as such it attempts to

ease of maintenance. All parts of viewing areas should always
have a clear unobstructed view of the playing area and designs
should take account of the need for effective stewarding, which
can play an important role in controlling crowd movement (see
Chapter 13).

21. Although controlling crowd numbers may serve to reduce
some risks to an acceptable level, remedial work is likely to be
necessary to overcome others. Obvious defects such as trip
hazards (especially at the head of stairs or steps), loose or weak
handrails on stairs, and obstructed exits or exit routes, should be
rectified as part of the general care and maintenance of a ground.
Structures should be sound (see Chapter 3) and inspected by
suitably qualified persons (see Chapter 4). Design, layout and
signposting of exits and exit routes require particular attention to
ensure that they can safely cope with the number of spectators
who will use them at the end of an event or in an emergency (see
Chapter 6). Similarly, the condition of terraces or viewing slopes
(see Chapter 8) and presence or otherwise of crush barriers,
correctly sited and meeting the strength tests of this Guide (see
Chapter 9), are important factors. Broken, uneven terracing causes
stumbling. Barriers not only serve to break up crowd pressures but
also assist in controlling movement off the terraces by regulating
the rate of arrival at exits to suit their capacity, and encouraging
the formation of queues so that spectators arrive at exits in an
orderly fashion.

22. Proper precautions against the risk of fire are vital (see
Chapter 11). Good ground management is crucial in reducing or
eliminating the risk. Accumulation of litter is a prime potential
source of fire but can be eliminated by regular and frequent
inspections, good housekeeping, ground maintenance and by
taking particular care over the storage of flammable materials. The
nature and type of materials used in the construction of covered
areas and stands will strongly influence the safety measures

31. When walls, including perimeter walls, and fences are to
withstand crowd pressures, they should be designed to withstand
such pressures safely and allowance should be made for forces
simultaneously and independently induced by other factors eg
wind forces or attached installations.

32. All parts of the ground used by the general public, and
especially the exit routes, should have minimum headroom of not
less than 2 metres. Exit routes should wherever possible have a
headroom of 2.4 metres.

33. Precautions should be taken to prevent people from climbing
on to roofs, pylons, hoardings and other structures. Where
possible such structures should be fitted with unclimbable
devices eg stout barriers or close-boarded enclosures. Spikes,
barbed wire etc should only be installed above the minimum
headroom specified in paragraph 32 above and preferably at a
minimum height of 2.4 metres from the base.

of a suitably qualified engineer, ie a structural or civil engineer.

39. Following each event, a general visual inspection of the
ground should be made for signs of damage which might create a
potential danger to the public. Particular attention should be paid
to the condition of terraces, viewing slopes and stairways. Crush

45.   Dangerous o v e rc ro w d in g can be caused if spectators are
able to force their way into a ground already full to capacity by
scaling or breaking through boundary walls or fences or the gates
in them. To avoid this danger such walls, fences and gates should
be of appropriate height and strength, and hand- or foot--holds
which might assist climbing should be avoided. They should be
 regularly inspected.

 46 Contingency plans should be made to deal with situations
 where the available entrances at a ground have proved insufficient
 to stop unduly large crowds from gathering outside. This may, for
 example, include opening additional entrances, but local kn° wlf d9e
 of the ground, crowd patterns and advice from the police should be
 taken into account in drawing up contingency plans. Larger
  arounds should have intercommunication systems and metering
  systems at turnstiles (see Chapter 12), and installation of a
  centralised computer monitoring system may be of assistance to
  management in quickly identifying particular areas of difficulty.

  47.   The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass
  through turnstiles will depend upon a variety of factors; for
  example, the design and age of the equipment, the ability of the
  operator and the ticketing arrangements. The admission rate will
  therefore depend greatly upon local circumstances but in general.

the build up of snow or heavy rain, to which they may be subjected.
Emergency arrangements should be made for the dismantling,
either partial or total, of a tent should conditions arise that could
lead to any collapse or distortion. Where such work in any way
affects the stability of the tent or the safety of members of the
public, the work should not commence until the immediate area
 has been cleared of all but essential staff.

 necessary and correctly formed, and secure anchorages made to
 the ground to ensure that the tent is stable and maintains its
 correct shape.

     i.     There should be inter-communication between the
            central control and all turnstiles or banks of turnstiles
            and all entry and exit gates used by the public.
     ii.    Metering systems to record all admissions should be
            installed at turnstiles and, to ensure that ground
            capacities are not exceeded in any section, arrange­
            ments should be made for central control to be
            informed immediately a predetermined number of
            spectators has been admitted through each turnstile.
     iii.    Public address equipment should be installed so that
             broadcast messages can be heard under reasonable
            conditions (including emergencies) by all persons of
             normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the
            public has access. The system should be capable of
            being controlled from the central control point and
            should ideally be capable of addressing messages to
            each major section of the ground. The power supply to
            the system should be such as to enable it to continue

    196. A more detailed check list of the kind of duties which
    stewards are liable to undertake is at Annex B. It should be borne
    in mind that this is only an example and not necessarily an
    exhaustive list of duties.

    197. Stewards should be fully capable of carrying out the duties
    allocated to them. Every steward should be fully appraised in
    writing of his duties and responsibilities and should carry on him a
    general check list of them. Where a ground such as one used by
    an association football league club has a high police presence,

terrace side. This boundary wall should have gates or access points
to the pitch which could be manned by the police or stewards. A
walkway between the boundary wall and the terraces, which would
be solely occupied by the police, first aid and official club personnel,
has been found to be effective as regards safety and security. In
order to achieve this it might be necessary to remove one or two
 rows of terracing and to protect the walkway from the terrace by a
continuous line of barriers, so designed as to discourage access to
the walkway except at authorised points. The access points from
terrace to walkway should be directly linked with the access points
from the walkway to the pitch. Where a walkway system is in use,
sliding gates may be installed at the access points from the
walkway to the pitch, ie where there can be no crowd pressure
against them (see Chapter 6, paragraph 65 regarding the use of
sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the pitch is usually
 unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing area.

 as a crush barrier, or in some situations as a barrier to discourage
 or prevent access to the playing area except in an emergency.

 214. The type, strength and height of a pitch perimeter fence or
wall will vary according to its location and required function. At one
extreme, at a certain type of ground or small stadium used by very
few spectators, there may be no need for a perimeter fence or wall
at all; or if such a wall or fence exists it may need to consist of little
more than a rail to mark the playing area. At the other extreme, at
some major soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement
forms a necessary part of the safety measures, it may be necessary
to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
circumstances (see also Chapter 14, paragraph 209) but allows for
access in emergency. Even at these grounds however specification
of the pitch fence may vary for different parts of the ground.

 215. For most major stadia, whether used for association football
 or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to
 prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to
 discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates
 or other access points (minimum width 1.1 metres) should
 nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency and, at those
grounds where a perimeter track is used as part of the exit system,
for the departure of spectators at the end of an event. Provision of
such gates or access points is particularly important to allow full
access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should
be properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access
to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured.


216. If spectators can lean on the perimeter fence it should be
deemed a crush barrier and fulfil the conditions of height and

4.    The force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full
force being maintained for 5 minutes each period. The interval
between applications to be as short as possible, ie to enable
complete unloading and reloading only. A record should be kept of
any deformation during the loading periods, during the periods of
maintained loading, or during the recovery period.

5.    If on the removal of the force for the third time the recovery
of deformation is at least 75% the barrier or handrail may be
deemed to have satisfied the loading requirements.
If this requirement is not met but the recovery is more than 50%
then the test should be repeated and if on retest the recovery is at
least 75% the barrier or handrail may be deemed to have satisfied
the loading requirements.
If the recovery is less than 50% on the first test or less than 75%
on the retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have
failed to meet the loading requirements.

SUBJECT:        SAFETY A T SPORTS GROUNDS - REVISED EDITION
                OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY A T SPORTS GROUNDS



I have gone through the whole of this extremely comprehensive document
and whilst a considerable amount of the contents is applicable to management
of the club, engineering problems and fire officers, certain paragraphs
are worthy of mention in relation to Sheffield Wednesdays Football Ground
at Hillsborough.

Paragraph 16 relating to crowd pressures.  As you are aware the kop has
had a tendancy at recent matches to produce this wave effect and it is
necessary that when a large match is anticipated in the future, we should
ensure that the numbers allowed onto the kop strictly adhere to the capacity
allowed.  It is imperative therefore that the automatic counting system
is always in working order for 'A1and 'B1 category matches, such as the
visits of Manchester United, where almost capacity crowds can be expected.

Paragraph 23 onwards lays down the management responsibility very clearly
and is to be welcomed, since there have in the past, been grey areas as to
who is responsible for crowd control etc.

Paragraph 28 recommends the appointment of a safety officer and identifies
his duties.    I can only presume that the safety officer is in fact M r Lock,
although I have never heard h i m designated as such, and this should be
 clarified wit h the club.   Furthermore, in the discussion of a central
 control point being designated (other than then police control), one would
 assume that the central control point designated in respect of the Sheffield
'Wednesday ground would be the video viewing room in the south stand.

Paragraph 43 relates to records of tests kept and examination of the ground.
I am not aware that these are kept by the club.

Paragraph 199 relates to exercises of stewards regarding emergency procedures
and I am not aware that the club have ever carried out exercises in this
respect.

In conclusion, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have complied with the
guide to a very large extent, more so I would suspect, than the majority
of clubs in the country, and it is only on minor points as identified above
where improvements could be made, so far as police procedures are concerned.

        Inspections and tests should be carried out by suitably qualified persons on
        behair of Banagenent to ensure that the safety standards of the G uide are

        ■aintained.


        36.      A detailed inspection of the ground, Including all components and
        installations, should be arranged annually by the management.                                      It should be
        carried out by a person with a relevant and recognised professional
        qualification, and experience of Inspecting existing structures.

         assistance.           Hard and fast rules on the extent to which a structural appraisal
         is necessary for individual buildings are difficult to lay down: much will
         depend upon the type of installation, its size, condition, materials used in
         construction and standard of maintenance.                              A full appraisal is however unlikely
         to be necessary unless defects are Identified or in evidence from the analysis

         o f in f o r m a tio n on th e s t r u c t u r e and v i s u a l i n s p e c t i o n .


         38         Testing of crush barriers (see also Chapter 9) should be carried out in
         accordance with Annex C of this Guide.                           When the guidelines are first applied to
             a particular ground, a representative sample of barriers of all types from all
             areas of the ground should be selected for testing.                              Thereafter testing of
A            barriers should take place e v e r y 1 years unless from visual inspection doubts
             are raised as to their strength/integrity, in which case they should be
             retested.        Testing should be carried out by or under the supervision of a

             suitably qualified engineer, ie a structural or civil engineer.

              and stairways.           Crush barriers and balustrades should be examined for
              deformation or any other overt signs of weakness.                              The fire precautions measures

              should also be inspected for damage, and alarm and other electrical
              installations should be checked to ensure compliance with the relevant British

              S tandards.

10.     ROOFED STANDS WITH SEATED ACCOMMODATION


The general safety considerations for stands are similar to those for other
part, of th. ground but with the addition.1 ne.d to safeguard spectator. «aln.t

the risk of fire (see Chapter 11).


,20. Stands may consist of seated accommodation only or may contain a mixture of
both seated and standing areas.      The following advice can be applied to all
sports grounds where spectators are so accommodated.


 121. There is generally a less hurried departure fro. the seated accomodation
in stands at the end of an event.      Moreover, spectators are induced by the
 layout of the seats to for. orderly queues.      Even so, attention should be paid
 to the points below as well as the other structural considerations in respect o
 stairways, exits, egress and, where appropriate, density levels and crush

 barriers.


 ,22. Fire safety is particularly important and is dealt with in Chapter 11.
 Every stand should be provided with sufficient exits to allow for the orderly
 evacuation of all the spectators to be accomodated.         Evacuation time will
 depend to a large extent on the fire hazard present in the stand (see Chapter
  11, paragraphs 183-188).     Egress time (see Chapter 6, paragraph 56) should be no
  longer than 8 minutes using the calculations in Chapter 16, but the emergency
  evacuation time is an overriding criterion when calculating the allowable

  capacity of a stand (see Chapter 11, paragraph 183).


  ,23. Seats and gangways should be so positioned as to provide ready access to
  exits.     No person in any part of a stand should have to travel more than 30

  metres to the nearest exit from a stand.


      124. All seats should be securely fixed in position.The use of     tip-upseats
      allows more circulation space, the automatic type being preferable.



      125. The minimum area allotted to each seated person should be 460mm wide and
      610mm deep-, but for comfort these measurements should be 550mm and 760m.
      respectively.   To enable people to move freely between rows of seats, there
      should be at least 305mm between perpendiculars from the foremost projection of
      one seat and the back of the seat in front of it.      (The minimum of 305-n is
      included in the 610 mm or 760mm depth measurement of     theseating area.)
126. The number of seats in a row should not normally exceed:


       (a)     14 seats where there is a gangway at one end only; and


       (b)     28 seats where there is a gangway at both ends.


127. Gangways should be of sufficient width for the seats served, but in no case
less than 1.1 metres wide (ie 2 unit widths) without projections.


Balustrading


128. Those sections of balustrading at the foot of stairways or gangways within
stands should be as strong as orush barriers of the stronger type (see Chapter

9 )-

Temporary stands and other temporary structures
129. The nature of temporary stands and other temporary structures, whether or
not covered, used to acccommodate spectators at a sports ground is likely to
vary considerably as will the materials used in their construction.       Some may be
 erected for a single event only.       Even so there is no justification for
 accepting a lower standard of safety in such structures than elsewhere within
 the sports ground, and the design and construction of temporary structures
 should be in accordance with good engineering and building practice, should pay
 particular regard to public safety and should satisfy all relevant British

 Standards.


  130. The principles of this Guide are applicable to temporary stands and
 structures and particular attention is drawn to:
          Chapter 3   - General Fabric and Construction
          Chapter 6   - Egress
          Chapter 4    - Stairways and Ramps
          Chapter 11 - Fire Safety
          Chapter 1?. - Flow Rates                                          ^ .


   131.      All temporary stands should be oapable of withstanding any load or force to
  which they may be subjected and account should be taken of any external factors
   such as wind forces.      Failure of any one support member or connection should not
   render the structure unstable.      As far as practicable the area around supporting
   frames should be secured to prevent unauthorised access, and frames should be so
   designed that they are firmly locked into position and cannot be tampered with

   by unauthorised persons.
                                               30
132. Consultation with the local authority and building authority (if different)
should take place at an early stage prior to the erection of any temporary

stand.


1 3 3 . Siting.   Choice of location may be limited but factors which need to be
considered include: load-bearing capability of the ground, its slope or
uneveness, drainage, availability of mains services, access/egress for
spectators and for emergency vehicles, overhead power lines, and the proximity
of surrounding buildings in relation to the risk of fire.      The condition of the
site should be regularly checked to ensure its load-bearing capabilities have
not deteriorated; settlement of ground may cause instability and so require
repacking and re-levelling.      The site should be prepared and maintained so as to
provide an even surface for those parts to which the public have access.


1 3 4 . Assembly/Dismantling.   The assembling and dismantling of stands should be
carried out by or under the supervision of persons experienced and trained in
the proper performance of such work and in accordance with the manufacturers'
instructions whenever available, or in accordance with drawings and plans made

by a competent engineer.


135. Work should be carried out only where lighting is sufficient to allow it to
be safely and properly performed and checked.      No assembly or dismantling work
should be carried out to the danger of members of the public in the vicinity.


 136. The work should be carried out in a proper manner, using correct parts, and
tools of a proper size and design.       Care should be taken with the handling of
 components to avoid damage or distortion.


 137. All components should be closely examined during assembly and dismantling
 for signs of wear, deformation or other damage, and where necessary replaced by
 sound components of matching material properties and dimensions.      Temporary
 repairs using makeshift components should be avoided.


 138. Care should also be given to ensure all components are correctly aligned;
 they should not be bent, distorted or otherwise altered to force a fit.


 139. On completion, assembly work should be checked with particular attention
 given to fastenings and connections.
140. Tents/marquees and other such structures   These types of structures can
present special fire safety problems and guidance will be contained in the Home
Office/Scottish Office publication "Guide to Fire Precautions in Existing Places

of Entertainment*.


141   All tents should be capable of withstanding any forces, particularly wind
(including uplift so caused) and those caused by the build up of snow or heavy
rain, to which they may be subjected.    Emergency arrangements should be made for
the dismantling, either partial or total, of a tent should conditions arise that
could lead to any collapse or distortion.    Where such work in any way affects
the stability of the tent or the safety of members of the public, the work
should not commence until the immediate area has been cleared of all but

essential staff.


142. Supporting poles, guy ropes and stays should be used as necessary and
correctly formed, and secure anchorages made to the ground to ensure that the
tent is stable and maintains its correct shape.


 1113. The stability of the main tent poles and supporting structure should be
 independent of the sheeting fabric, ie any tearing or defect occurring in the
 fabric should not result in the collapse of all or any part of the main

 structure.


 144. Particular attention should be paid to the main supporting poles and top
 braces of large tents where they have to be raised to a considerable height.
 Damage or distortion to these members could considerably weaken the structure.
 Where such damage does occur, the members should be replaced or repairs or
 modifications carried out so as to bring them up to full working strength.
                                     /




  ,45. Where solid frames or units, eg doors, are linked to a tent structure they
  should be rigidly formed and adequately braced, and care should be taken that

  they do not overstress local areas of the tent.


  ,46. Foundations to poles or frames should be properly prepared and subjected to
  regular check as should wire bracing or guys, the tension of which should be re-

  adjusted as necessary.

    11.     FIRE SAFETY


    Safety from fire is achieved by measures which will restrict initiation, rate of
    early growth and later spread of fire; provide and protect escape routes;
    segregate higher fire risk areas; provide warning (and where necessary
    detection) of fire; and assist fire-fighting operations.


    147. The type of accommodation which represents the greatest hazard in the
    of fire is the covered stand where spectators sit or stand.       New structures will
    conform to Building Regulations requiring them to have a reasonable degree of
    structural fire protection.     Existing structures will vary considerably in age
    and materials used in construction.     The qualities of combustibility and ability
    to propagate and spread fire of the materials used in construction have an
f   important effect on the standard of fire precautions required to ensure
    reasonable safety.      It may be difficult in some cases to improve the fire
    resistance of an existing structure to any significant extent but it should be
    done wherever practicable even though in some cases substantial alterations may
    be needed to provide reasonable protection from fire.


     148.    With new stands there is much more opportunity to incorporate from the
     start comprehensive measures for fire safety, considering properly the impact of
     each measure on the others.     Design features for new stands should include the

     following:


             a.    internal finishes which have low flammability;


•            b.    seating, partitioning and any other fixed or removable contents
             including seat cushions which possess low flammability characteristics and

              fire risk potential and are limited in amount;


              c.   contents which are not capable of being easily dismantled;


              d.   no inaccessible places where litter can collect;


              e.   adequate structural resistance to fire;


              f.   fire resisting separation from any spaces below or communicating with

              the stand;


                                                 33
    g.   as far as possible, no storerooms or other spaces communicating with
    the stand.   Where this is unavoidable, storerooms or other spaces
    communicating with the stand should be provided with fixed fire
    extinguishing systems appropriate to the fire risk posed by the materials
    to be stored or contained;


    h.   escape routes which are planned to keep people well clear of the smoky
    gases produced by a fire (which in general means that initial movement of
    people should be downwards);


    i.   later stages of escape routes which are incapable of being
    significantly threatened by continuing fire;


    j.   the provision of alternative, widely separated escape routes;


    k.   a roof geometry which should restrict smoke and flame travel along the

    underside of the roof.


Minimising fire risk
149. One potential cause of fire arises from the accumulation of waste paper,
programmes, food and drink cartons etc dropped by spectators.     Such waste can be
easily set alight by smokers’ materials and the resulting fire may then spread
to the structure, especially the ones that are constructed of more combustible
materials.   Every effort should be made to reduce this hazard.    Accumulations of
litter, for example near catering facilities, should be cleared from the grounds
as quickly as possible or kept in a safe, fire resistant container or room

pending clearance.


150. All parts of buildings should be inspected before and after an event (see
also Chapter 4, paragraph 42) and any accumulation of litter cleared away as
described above.     It is particularly important to ensure that litter does not
accumulate in escape routes or under stands.


 151. Smoking should be discouraged in stands containing combustible or flammable
 products, either loose (eg cushions) or fixed (eg seating), or in the fabric of

 the building.


 152. A common feature in construction of stands which is a fire risk is the
 existence of voids under the seating and under the flooring itself.     These voids
 can become a resting place for paper, cartons and other combustible materials
 which can be ignited, unnoticed, by carelessly, discarded cigarette ends etc.
                                          34
Seating arrangements should, wherever possible, be such that floor surfaces are
accessible for the removal of litter.-   Where voids below flooring exist they
should if practicable be excluded; for example, where a stand is built into a
natural slope the underneath area can be filled in with concrete.    Where this is
not practicable they should be completely sealed off to stop litter accumulating
in them, or be entirely open to allow easy access for inspection and removal of

combustible waste.


153. Other items, such as cushions filled with cellular foams or other synthetic
materials are a fire risk because they are combustible, and when set alight can
give off large quantities of smoke and fumes.    Also, the use of large quantities
of plastics in seating should be reviewed carefully, particularly where cellular
polymers may be proposed.   The fire authority should be consulted about the fire

risk in stands.


 154. Cushions and other flammable materials represent in bulk a risk of a
 swiftly developing fire.   They should be stored in a fire-resistant container or
 room well away from spectator accommodation as should paper items such as
 programmes.   Similarly, hazardous materials, for example fuels (whether in
 containers or within fuel tanks and machinery) fertilizers, weed killers and
 paints should be kept (if at all) well away from public areas and stored in a
 room which has fire resistance of at least 1 hour.    Other high fire risk areas,
 eg enclosed or underground car parks situated under stands, should have also

 have fire resistance of at least 1 hour.


 155. Where catering facilities are provided, special care should be taken to
 ensure that any fuel or power supply used for cooking, for example LPG
 cylinders, is safely stored and used, in accordance with the advice of the
 authority responsible for enforcement of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act
  1974.   Useful guidance is given in Health and Safety Executive Guidance Notes
  CS4, "The Keeping of LPG in Cylinders and Similar Containers" and CS8 , "Small
  Scale Storage and Display of LPG at Retail Premises".


  Prevention or retardation of fire growth/spread
  156. Where, despite all precautions, a fire has started, it is vital to ensure
  that the rate of growth in its early stages is restricted to proportions which
  will not overwhelm the arrangements provided for safe escape.     This is best
  achieved by controlling the amount and nature of the materials (especially the
  combustibles) in a stand, both in terms of the contents (loose and fixed) and in
  those parts of the fabric of the stand to which a fire would have access
   (especially internal linings).   An important additional line of defence is
   prompt action by ground staff using the fire-fighting equipment available at the
                                            35
ground to tackle the fire and keep it in check ("first-aid" fire-fighting) until
the fire brigade arrives.    These measures are crucial because the quicker a fire
develops, the less time there is available to escape from it.          A fire should not
be able to develop unnoticed anywhere underneath or adjacent to the spectator
area of the stand, so that its spread would be likely to break through into the

spectator accommodation.


157. The spectator area in the stand should be separated from any other adjacent
circulation space or void by a construction having fire resistance not less than

half an hour.


158. Walls and ceiling linings within stands and ceiling linings beneath the
stand seats should have a flame   s p r e a d   classification of not less than Class 1

when tested in accordance with BS476: Part 7.


 159.   Restricting the extent and speed of the spread of fire in its later stages
is also important in order to reduce the possibility of escape time being
 further threatened.   Most measures which reduce the rate of fire growth in the
 early stages will also serve to restrict the fire spread in the later stages.
 The following measures would mainly affect the later spread.          For some roof ^
 configurations venting systems may offer a means of reducing the spread of fire
 (including movement of flames along the roof) and hot smoky gases.          The science
 of fire and smoke venting is however complex and advice from the fire authority
 should be sought on whether this would be advantageous in a particular case.


 160. Where the roofs of buildings are so connected that smoke and flame could
 travel along essentially two or more sides of the playing area, a wide break in
 the    roof should be made of sufficient width to prevent       spread from one side to
 the    other, unless the flame travel could beeliminated        by the prevention

 measures mentioned above.


  161. Use of flammable roof materials should be avoided.          Where they do exist
  they should be replaced where practicable by non-combustible materials or should

  be underdrawn with non-combustible board.


  Fire warning systems
  162. All buildings in the ground (including stands) to which public or staff
  have access should be provided with an electrical fire warning system to alert
  staff.    An indication of the warning and its location should be given to a
  central control point (see Chapter 12, paragraph 193).          The system should
conform with BS 5839: Part 1 in terms of its components, installation and
maintenance.   The central control point and, where necessary, other selective
positions in the ground should have facilities to call the fire brigade and
other emergency services.   Stewards and other officials should be trained in
what they should do if they discover a fire (see paragraphs 176-177 below).


163. The area underneath the spectator accommodation should have a system for
detecting a developing fire.   In order to give an early warning in an unoccupied
area an automatic fire detection (AFD) system should be considered, conforming
to BS5839: Part 1 in terms of its components, installation and maintenance.      It
should be connected so that any alarm will be communicated to the central

control point.


164. Any fire detection equipment should be tested regularly in accordance with
the advice given in the British Standard specification.


 165. Where areas of high fire risk such as large storerooms and enclosed or
underground car parks are situated under stands, consideration should be given
to the installation of an automatic fire extinguishing system, eg sprinklers,
instead of an AFD system.   Here again any such system should be connected so
that warning of fire is communicated to the central control point.


 Emergency lighting
 166. Emergency lighting, for use in the event of failure of the general
 lighting, should be provided in all parts of the premises accessible to the
 public and along all exit routes, with exit signs clearly illuminated.
 Installation should be in accordance with BS5266: Part 1.   The system should be
 completely separate from the general lighting system, although a one-circuit
 system incorporating staggered sub-circuits would be an acceptable alternative.
 Unless exceptionally two entirely independent supplies can be obtained from
 outside sources, the emergency circuit should be connected to a source of power
 located on the premises, for example storage batteries or a diesel generator,
 with a delay of not more than 5 seconds.


  167. The system should be capable of maintaining the necessary level of
  illumination for a period of 3 hours from the time of failure of the normal

  supply.


  168. The emergency lighting should operate automatically on the failure of the

  main lighting.
169. Emergency lighting systems should be tested regularly in accordance with

BS5266: Part 1.


Fire-fighting equipment
170. Advice should be sought from the local fire authority on the type, the
amount and siting of fire-fighting equipment. The succeeding paragraphs give

general guidelines.


171. In major grounds it may be necessary to provide a suitable water supply for

fire-fighting in the form of hydrants.


172. For "first-aid" firefighting by members of the staff, hydraulic hose-reels
should be provided to BS5306: Part 1.    These should be sufficient to provide
adequate protection to the whole floor area, and should be installed in a
suitable position by entrances, exits and stairways.


173. Where hose-reels are not provided, portable fire extinguishers should be
installed in sufficient numbers to give adequate cover.      The number and type
will depend upon the size, layout, fire separation and risk in each structure.
Fire extinguishers should conform to BS5U23 and be sited and maintained

according to BS5306: Part 3«


 174. Fire blankets and fire extinguishers of a type appropriate to the cooking
 facilities used should be kept in all catering facilites.


 V75. It should be borne in mind when considering location of fire-fighting
 equipment that it may need to be sited so that it cannot be vandalised but yet
 is readily accessible to staff in the event of fire.


 Emergency procedures and staff training
 176. It is essential that plans should be made for dealing with emergency
 situations, including fire.   The onus to do this lies with ground management.
 Joint consultation between management, police, fire, ambulance and other
 emergency services should take place in order to produce agreed plans of action
 for all forseeable types of emergency.    While the public are in the ground the
 number of staff on duty should be sufficient to cover entrances, exits and other
 strategic points and to fulfil other essential duties (see Chapter 13).


  177. All such staff should be trained in the use of the fire-fighting equipment
  provided, and in the action they should take in the event of fire.     This is
  management’s responsibility but the local fire authority*s advice should be
  sought on whether the content of the proposed training programme is adequate.
                                           38
Means of escape
178. "Means of escape" is the structural means whereby a safe route is provided
for people to travel from any point in a structure to a place of safety without
outside assistance.   In a sports ground, the means of escape in the event of an
emergency will usually be the same as the normal egress routes plus any
additional "route" of forward escape on to the playing area.     The kind of
emergency most likely to occur at a sports ground is fire but other types of
emergency, such as bomb threat, may arise which might necessitate the evacuation
of spectators from all or part of the spectator accommodation.     It is the
management's responsibility to ensure that all exit routes for use in an
emergency are capable of being safely and effectively used at all times when the

ground is occupied.


 179. It is vital that the emergency exit routes are sited so that people using
them will be least affected by the fire or its products, for example smoke,,
toxic gases, heat etc.   Initial travel should if possible be downwards.       This is
 because in the event of fire, its dangerous products will travel upwards and
 accumulate densely at the highest points.    Further stages of the exit routes
 should be so arranged as to take people progressively further away from the
 fire, along a route where they cannot be significantly affected by the fire or
 its products.   There should be more than one emergency exit route from a stand
 or a terrace in case one becomes blocked.    The emergency exits within any one
 structure should be as widely separated as practical planning considerations
 will allow, to minimise the risk of them all being blocked by the same cause.


 Fire protection for stairways and passages
 180. Where a stairway, passage or any other part of ah emergency exit route
 passes up, down or through a stand or other building used by spectators, it
 should be in a fire resistant enclosure separated from the remainder of the
  stand by a structure having fire resistance of not less than one hour.       Such
  exit routes should discharge to a place of safety in the open air (which may be

  inside or outside the ground).


  181. The surface finish of walls and ceilings of all emergency exit stairways
  should be of a standard corresponding to Class 0 (as defined in the guidance
  issued in connection with the Building Regulations 1985 for England and Wales
  and the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1981-84).


   182. Any door forming part of the enclosure to a stairway should be self closing
  and have a fire resistance of not less than half an hour.
Qnergency e v a c u a tio n time
183. The emergency evacuation time is the notional"time it would take spectators
to leave their viewing positions and reach a place of safety in the open air or
a protected stairway or emergency exit route with fire resistance in accordance
with paragraph 180 above.          It is calculated from the spectator capacity of the
accommodation (see Chapter 16) and the flow rate (see Chapter 17) through
restricting parts of the exit system used for evacuation purposes.


184. The emergency evacuation time should not be confused with the egress time
of 8 minutes (referred to in Chapter 6, paragraph 56) which is the maximum time
it should take spectators to enter into the normal exit system from their
viewing positions at the end of play.


 185. The emergency evacuation time will depend largely on the fire hazard
 present in the accommodation in question.            Any stand which has a potential for
 rapid fire spread because of its interior use and contents and/or the nature of
 its internal surfaces which would be exposed to fire should have an emergency
 evacuation time of no more than 2 \ minutes.           An increase in this time may
 however be acceptable where the interior use and contents, and the nature of the
 internal linings, are such as to eliminate the possibility of rapid fire spread,
 and the emergency exit routes are not vulnerable to a fire occurring within the
 accommodation.       In setting an emergency evacuation time longer than         minutes
 the advice of the fire authority should be sought.


  186. Where the playing area or perimeter track is accessible to spectators and
  is considered suitable as a place of safety, evacuation onto it can be taken
  into account in calculating the emergency evacuation time.           Where there is a
  pitch perimeter fence or wall it should have access points in accordance with
  Chapter 15, paragraph 215 which can serve as exits and which can be taken into
  account in the calculation of the emergency evacuation time.


   187. Where the playing surface of a pitch is made of synthetic materials, advice
   from the fire authority.should be sought to establish if it can be properly
   considered a place of safety in a fire.         This is because it is possible that
   some forms of artificial turf might in themselves constitute a hazard in the
   event of fire because of flamespread and fumes etc caused by decomposition of

   the material as a result of heat radiation.


   188. The playing area may not be a place of safety, eg if it is wholly
   surrounded by covered accommodation with no breaks in the roofing (see paragraph
    160 above) and the advice of the fire authority should be sought in such

    circumstances.
                                                 U0
Access for emergency vehicles
189. Adequate roads for emergency vehicles such as fire appliances and
ambulances should be provided so that speedy and direct access can be obtained
to all buildings within the ground; wherever possible these access routes should
be separate from those used by spectators entering and leaving the ground.


190. The local fire authority should be consulted about the width, clearance,
height and supporting strength required of these access roads.   Wherever
possible access roads should provide for the parking of emergency vehicles so
that exit routes used by crowds are not seriously obstructed.


191. Wherever practicable and where necessary roads within & of a mile of the
ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles so as not to delay or

obstruct the access of emergency vehicles.
12.    COMMUNICATIONS


There should be a communications system capable of clearly relaying essential
messages to all parts of the ground in both normal circumstances and in an
emergency situation.


192. Precise requirements for communications will depend on the sort of ground
and the numbers of people that attend there.         In general the communications;
system should be determined after consultation with the police and emegency
services.      It should be available for use and capable of coping with all

emergency situations.


193.     A central control point, preferably a room, should be set aside for the u
of the      supervising police officer and the ground safety officer.


194 . At larger grounds the following arrangements are likely to be needed:


       i.      There should be inter-communication between the central control
               and all turnstiles or banks of turnstiles and all entry and exit
               gates used by the public.


        ii.    Metering systems to record all admissions should be installed at
               turnstiles and, to ensure that ground capacities are not exceeded
               in any section, arrangements should be made for central control
               to be informed immediately a predetermined number of spectators
               has been admitted through each turnstile.


         iii. Public address equipment should be installed so that broadcast
               messages can be heard under reasonable conditions (including
                emergencies) by all persons of normal hearing in any part of the
                ground to which the public hasaccess.    The system should   be
              - capable of being controlled from the central control point and
                should ideally be capable of addressing messages to each major
                section of the ground.     The power supply to the system should be
                such as to enable it to continue to operate in an emergency such
                as fire or a failure of the mains supply.


         iv.    Loud-hailers should be available for the use of stewards and
                police in directing or instructing spectators.
                                             42
Any police radio facilities available for the maintenance of law
or order should augment and not supersede the ground
communications system.


Installation of closed circuit television is considered likely to
be of significant value in assisting emergency evacuation.
13.     STEWARDPNG
                                                    reduce the likelihood of disorder*

Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding in sections of the ground,/help
disperse spectators in such a way as to reduce crowd pressure and provide the
means to investigate, report and take early action in an emergency.


195.     Manning levels and stewarding requirements will vary depending upon the
size and configuration of the ground, the nature of the event and crowd levels,
but there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out.

These are:


        (a)    controlling or directing members of the public who are entering or
        leaving the ground, to help achieve an even flow of people to the viewing
        areas and safe dispersal of spectators on the terraces or viewing slopes;


         (b)   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies eg raising alarms

        or extinguishing fires;


         (c)   manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit
         doors and gates which are not continuously open whilst the ground is in

         TdV   assist police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; and

         (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency.


 196.     A more detailed check list of the kind of duties which stewards are liable
 to undertake is at annex B.      It should be borne in mind that this is only an
 example and not necessarily an exhaustive list of duties.


 197.     Stewards should be both physically and mentally capable of carrying out
 the duties allocated to them.      Every steward should be fully appraised in
 writing of his duties and responsibilities and should carry on him a general
 check list of them.      Where a ground such as one used by an association football
 league club has a high police presence, duties and responsibilities of stewards
 should be agreed with the police.      Stewards should attend pre-match briefing and
 should be made aware as necessary of the arrangements and any contingency plans
 to deal with the arrival of away supporters.


  198.     Proper training and supervision should be provided by management so that
 all stewards, whether regular or casual, know not only what their duties are but

  how to carry them out and why.
Pthis is especially important in emergency situations when it is essential that
 stewards and their supervisors are fully aware of the part they are to play in
 the plans drawn up with the emergency services (see Chapter 11, paragraph 176).


 199.   Exercises should be carried out so as to ensure that emergency procedures
 operate smoothly, and a record kept of the duration of the exercise, details of

 the instruction given and by whom.


 200.   Management should appoint a chief steward responsible for coordinating

 responsibilities of all stewards.    Control of stewards should be from a central
 point which contains an efficient means to communicate with the stewards (see

 also Chapter 12).


 201.   All stewards should be easily identifiable eg by the wearing of

 distinctive clothing (including armbands).
m.     CROWD CONTROL


Where there is a disorderly element among the crowd intent on violence,
additional safety measures are needed to contain and minimise the potential
disruption, to isolate quickly, identify and remove the offenders and to prevent
their re-entry on future occasions.


202.     Although the problem of crowd disorder at sporting events is one which
affects primarily professional association football, other sports are not immune
from it.     Therefore, whilst the following advice is directed mainly at those
grounds where professional association football is played, the general
principles should also be borne in mind by management at other grounds where

major spectator sports are played.


Policing
203.     The 'European Convention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour at
Sporting Events and in particular at Football Matches' (HMSO, Cmnd 96M9), which
came into force on 1 November 1985, sets out in general terms the measures to be
taken to prevent and control violence by spectators.     Additionally, some sports'
governing bodies have issued their own guidance on crowd control.     For example,
the Football Association has issued a 'Memorandum to Football League Clubs On
 Crowd Management' which sets out the measures that must be taken at all League
 grounds, and UEFA has issued binding     instructions in their document 'Order and
 Security in the Stadia' (Third Edition, 1985) which apply to matches in their
 competitions.    The following paragraphs cover some of the main areas that
 require the attention of ground management.     The advice they contain is not
 comprehensive and is intended to supplement rather than replace existing

 instructions, codes of practice etc.


 20U*     As in other areas of safety, management is responsible for the crowd
 control arrangements and ground conditions so that spectators are safe in
 circumstances where there is liable to be a build-up of tension.or excitement
 which a game can generate.     The safety measures described elsewhere in this
 Guide will help to achieve reasonable spectator safety, but for management to
 discharge its responsibility properly a special police presence inside the
  ground will be necessary to deal with any problem of disorder which may arise,
  as well as to provide support and leadership in an emergency.    The number and
  disposition of the police must be determined by Chief Constables whose sole
  responsibility it is to decide on the disposition of operational police

     resources.
                                            U6
      205.     Proper "advance planning should be formulated with police assistance to
    ' deal with potential crowd disorder.          There must be an effective liaison between
      club and police for this purpose to include not just the arrangements inside the
      ground but also the escort of visiting supporters, their likely numbers, their
      separate entry to the ground and their departure at the end of the match.               There
      should be debriefing meetings as necessary to evaluate existing arrangements and
      provide the flexibility necessary to deal with different circumstances.


      Crowd movement
      206.     Crowd movement on terraces should be strictly controlled in order to give
      the police the fullest opportunity for crowd control.          Less problems occur when
      terraces are subdivided as far as possible into sections by use of both radial
      and lateral barriers       or      railings which should comply with the strength
^     requirements set out       in   Chapter 9.    Each section should ideally be self
      contained and should       be      serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment
      facilities and toilets (in keeping with the principles of general ground
      division described in Chapter 8, paragraph 101).          Special care is needed to
      ensure that sections and subdivisions are provided with sufficient exits for use

       in an emergency.


       207.    Home and visiting soccer supporters should normally be segregated but
       segregation is not advocated for other sports where crowd disorder is not a
       problem.     This should be borne in mind when considering barriers at grounds used

       for other sports as well as association football.


       208.     Where possible a neutral or sterile zone should be provided within a
0      ground so that home and visiting supporters are not physically close to each
       other.     The arrangements for admitting spectators into the ground, whether by
       tickets purchased in advance or through payment at the tunstiles, should be
       drawn up in consultation with the police, and must be carefully controlled to
       ensure as far as possible that segregation is effective and known troublemakers

       are excluded.         _                                                            -


        209.    Access to the pitch must be made as difficult as possible in normal
        circumstances while at the same time providing the police with proper access to
        the terraces for the purpose of crowd control and enabling the pitch to be used
        in the event of serious emergency (see also Chapter 11, paragraph 186).               Where a
        pitch perimeter barrier fence is installed to keep spectators off the pitch,
        care is needed to ensure that it does not impair the visibility of the playing
        area from the terraces.       If spikes or barbed wire are installed they should if
        possible be at a height of no less than 2.4 metres (see Chapter 3, paragraph 33)-

                                                       47
15 »   PITCH PERIMETER FENCE/WALL


A pitch perimeter fence/wall may not only delineate the playing area from the
spectator accommodation but may have to serve as crush barriers, or in some
situations as a barrier to discourage or prevent access to the playing area
except in an emergency


214.    The type, strength and height of a pitch perimeter fence or wall will vary
according to its location and required function.    At one extreme, at a certain
type of ground or small stadium used by very few spectators, there may be no
need for a perimeter fence or wall at all; or if such a wall or fence exists it
may need to consist of little more than a rail to mark the playing area.     At the
other extreme, at some major soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement
forms a necessary part of the safety measures, it may be necessary to have a
fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal circumstances (see also
Chapter 14, paragraph 209) but allows for access in emergency.    Even at these
grounds however specification of the pitch fence may vary for different parts of
the ground.


215.    For most major stadia, whether used for association football or other
sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to prevent access to
the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to discourage attempts by spectators
to enter the playing area.    Gates or other access points (minimum width 1.1
metres) should nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency and, at those
grounds where a perimeter track is used as part of the exit system, for the
departure of spectators at the end of an event.    Provision of such gates or
access points is particularly important to allow full access to the playing area
(or track) where it is likely to be used as a place of safety in an emergency.
Such gates or access points should be properly stewarded and clearly marked so
that immediate access to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured.


216.    If spectators can lean on the perimeter fence it should be deemed a crush
barrier and fulfil the conditions of height and strength specified in Chapter 9
although if the fence is of solid construction its height may be more than 1.12
metres.    This is because the pressures acting on a person forced against such a
fence are distributed over a large area of the body, unlike the situation with a
normal crush barrier, where the pressures are localized.

    16.     ESTIMATION OF SAFE GROUND CAPACITY


    To assess the number of spectators which can be safely accommodated account
    should be taken of the features of the individual ground, its configuration,
    general condition, use and any deviations from the Guide's provisions.


    217.     The previous sections of the Guide give guidelines and safety
    considerations for individual features of a ground.          This section suggests a
    method of calculating the number of people that can be safely accommodated when
    taking into account interactions between these individual features and where
    there are deviations from the guidelines.          The following paragraphs contain as
    of necessity generalised guidelines in view of the wide variety of types, sizes,
0   configurations of sports grounds, their use and general condition.


    218.     To facilitate the calculations a plan of the ground should be available
    with such details as exits, stands, terraces, stairways, passages, kiosks, seats
    and barriers.           A scale of 1:200 is appropriate for this purpose.


     219.     The method assesses:


             a.        the holding capacity of a terrace or viewing slope (that of a seated
             area generally being determined by the number of seats when it conforms to

             guidelines); and


             b         the capacity of a given exit route from a terrace or stand.

§
     220.           The number of people that can be safely accommodated on a terrace or in a
     stand (or other covered accommodation) is either its holding capacity, or the
     capacity of the exit system to be used in normal circumstances at the end of an
      event (assessed in accordance with paragraphs 229-232 below) or the emergency

      exit system whichever is the smallest.


      Terraces and viewing slopes
      221.          Where crush barriers meet the strength and spacing guidelines of Chapter 9
      the capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should be assessed from the area
      available for standing by allowing a packing density of between 54 and 27
      persons per 10 square metres depending upon the condition of the terrace or
      slope.          Only those parts of the terrace or viewing slope from which the whole of
      the playing area can be seen, excluding gangways, should be included in this

      calculation.
                                                      50
    222.- The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:


           a.      54   persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or viewing                        slopeis
            in good     condition (as set out in Chapter 8 ); and


            b.     27   persons per 10 square metres when it materially deviates fromthe
            recommended guidelines, so as             to constitute a possible hazard to

            individuals closely packed.


    223.     It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures where conditions
    fall between the two extremes.                When the positioning and length of gangways do
    not meet with the recommendations of Chapter 8 , paragraphs 96-100,an appropriate
    reduction should be made in the area available for standing.


®224.           Even distribution of spectators on the terrace may be difficult to
     overcome notwithstanding the measures in this guide because spectators may
     prefer to gather in a certain part or parts of a terrace.                      Ground management
     should therefore take such factors into account when assessing safe capacity

     levels.


     225.        The capacity of the terrace is calculated by multiplying the area
     available for standing by the appropriate packing density.                      The following

     formula may be used:


             Capacity (Number of persons)             _A    x   (27 to 54)
                                                       10

                10


226.     When the strength of crush barriers conforms with the guidelines but the
spacing of such barriers does not, the capacity is calculated from the provision
of crush barriers in the area available for standing (as defined in paragraph

2 2 1 ) as follows:


        a.     Where a terrace contains either "peak viewing areas" only or "other
        viewing areas" by multiplying the total length of the crush barriers by the
        appropriate distance between barriers (as given in Chapter 9, paragraph
        116 - 117 ) or the existing distance, whichever is less, and multiplying by
        the appropriate packing density.

 Chapter 9, paragraph 119, Table 2) but not the spacing requirements of the

      228.       Note:       In small grounds attracting few spectators and low density crowds,
      and where a terrace contains no crush barriers or where most or all of those
      installed have to be discounted for calculation purposes the restrictions on the
%     crowd capacity may be unrealistic.                          A more flexible approach may be appropriate
      taking account of the recommendations of the Guide to assess the terrace holding
      capacity.              In   such       cases the permissible packing density is however likely to be
      much lower than the 27 persons per 10 square metres referred to in paragraph
      above and the overall terrace capacity will be severely limited.

 Exit systems
 229.   General considerations to be taken into account when assessing the
 adequacy of exit systems are set out in Chapter 6 .


  230.     The capacity of an exit system can be calculated by assessing for each
  element in the system (ie each gangway, doorway, stairway, exit etc.) the number
  of persons who can be pass in 8 minutes (ie egress time, see Chapter 6 ,
  paragraph 5 6 ) or, the emergency evacuation time appropriate to the accommodation
  (see Chapter 11, paragraphs 183-185), whichever is the shorter time.                                    This
  calculation is made by multiplying the width of the element by the appropriate

  flow rate in Chapter 17.


   231.      Where an element in the exit system isless than 1 metre wide thatelement

   should be omitted from the calculation.


   232.Flow restricting elements of the kind described in                                 Chapter 6 should         be

   ignored for the purpose of these calculations.
17.    RECOMMENDED FLOW RATES


233.     From stands and stairways a flow rate of MO persons per minute   perunit   of
exit    width (ie 5>5 0 mm) should be used.


234.     From terraces (including covered terraces) and the ground generally   aflow
rate    of 60 persons per minute per unit of exit width should be used.

STEWARDING


1.   All stewards should be capable of carrying out their duties and should be

properly trained-to do so (see Chapter 13).


2.   Stewards must be informed in writing of all that they are expected to know
and do.     The following list gives examples of typical tasks and duties which
stewards should be expected to carry out and for which they should be prepared.

Stewards should:-


     i.      Prevent overcrowding by ensuring the crowd limits in various parts of the

     ground are complied with.


     ii.     Prevent spectators, as far as possible, from climbing fences and other
     structures eg floodlight pylons, and from standing on seats.      Where by
     virtue of the scale of the incident stewards are unable to prevent this,
     they      should immeidately report the matter to the nearest police officer or,
     if no police officer is present, to the chief steward or the safety

      officer.


      iii.      Ensure that gangways andexits are kept clear.


      iv.       Identify and investigateany incident or occurrence among spectators,
      reporting their findings to the police or to management.


      v.      Be able to operate effectively the fire-fighting equipment at the

      ground, and know its location.


      vi.     Know the location of the first aid room and any first aid equipment

      kept elsewhere.


      vii. Be fully conversant with any methods or signals used to alert staff

          that an emergency has arisen.


          viii. Be capable of recognising potential fire hazards and suspect
          packages, reporting such findings immediately to the nearest police officer
          or, if no police officer is in the immediate vicinity, the chief steward or

          the safety officer.
ix. -Comply promptly with any instruction given in an emergency by a police
officer, the’chief steward or the safety officer.


x.    Remain at their allocated posts as instructed unless authorised or
ordered to do otherwise by a police officer, the chief steward or the

safety officer.


xi.   Report to the safety officer any damage or defect which is likely to
pose a threat to spectator safety eg a damaged crush barrier.
    Annex C .


    TESTING OF CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS


    1.    For crush barriers the test is to consist of the application of an evenly
    distributed force of either 6.0 KN/metre width (400 lbs f/foot width) or 4.3
    KN/metre width (290 lbs f/foot width) of barrier as mentioned in Chapter 9.


    2.    For handrails the test is to consist of the applicaton of an evenly
    distributed force of either 4.3 KN/metre width (290 lbs f/foot width) or 2.74
    KN/metre width (188 lbs f/foot width) of handrail as mentioned in Chapter 9.


    3.    The force is to be in the form of a static load acting on the top rail of
^   the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal axis and applied.in

    about ten equal increments.


    4.    The force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full force being
    maintained for 5 minutes each period.               The interval between applications to be
    as short as possible, ie to enable complete unloading and reloading only.                 A
    record should be kept of any deformation during the loading periods, during the

    periods of maintained loading, or during the recovery period.


    5.    If on the removal of the force for the third time the recovery of
    deformation is at least 7 5 % the barrier or handrail may be deemed to have
     satisfied the loading requirements.


#    If this requirement is not met but the recovery is more than 50% then the test
     should be repeated and          if on retest the recovery is at least 75% the barrier or
     handrail may be deemed to have satisfied the loading requirements.


     If the recovery is less than 50% on the first test or less than 75% on the
     retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have failed to meet-the

     loading requirements.


     6.    If during any test, even though the barrier or handrail satisfies the above
     loading requirements, doubt should arise for any reason (including such matters
     as cracking of the terracing or distortion of connections) as to the safety of
     the barrier or   h a n d r a i l ,   a detailed investigation should be carried out.   Unless
     the results of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety of the

                                                         59
1*   barrier or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case may be, should be
     deemed to have failed the test.


     7.   A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails tested and of

     their performances during the tests.

                    a.  A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
                    designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
                    10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will requji
                    a safety certificate from the local authority.

                     b.  An obligation on the local authority                                            to issue such
                     certificates.



                                                                                                                  DOCUMENT No.      \3 i G

          and conditions under the certificate'-'with .-the object
          of sec u ri ng a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
          Safety certificates are of 2 kinds -"firstly, the general
          safety certificate (the main form of control) and,
          secondly, the special safety certificate (for occasions
          or activities not covered by the g eneral 'c e r t i f i c a t e ).

          d.  A right of appeal to the -Secretary of State, in
          relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
          contents, the procedure for ‘which is set out in
          regulations made under s.6( f)"of the "Act.

      \ e.   Rights of various interested bodies (police, building
      J au tho ri tie s or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
      | "abolition", fire authorities) to consultation, access to
      ^ grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

          f.  An emergency procedure for       restricting the admission
          of spectators to a wider range       of sports grounds than
          those to which the designat ion      provisions apply, if the
          risk to spec ta tors ..is seen (by   the courts) as justifying


          g.  Powers.'-pf^entr.-y and inspection to sports grounds;
          and pr e s cr ib ed — penSlties for offences under the Act.

other compet iti ve ac tivities take place in the open air and where
accomrcodatj.on has been provided for spectators.     A sports stadium is
a sports ground where ac com mo da ti on for spectators wholly or
substan tia lly surrounds the area used for the acti vi tie s takine-
place therein .                                                   ^

     3.        Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical    appendix to his
      to safety standards at football grounds designed        to assist the         oca a „ ,

      in their task cf enforcement.
     Consultations on the- Report

          When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including the
 -local authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about
     Lord Wheatley-s proposals.     The football authorities made it clear that they were
     apprehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general
  agreement with the proposals themselves.        Detailed consultations were held on the
 guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly
 amended, were finally published by the Heme Departments in November        1 9 7 3   as a
 special booklet, "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".        It was revised in 1975
 in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted
 on football grounds-


 Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)

 5       The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.     Its primary
 I m p o s e is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will
 no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.        The Guide therefore deals
 with matters such as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of
 escape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the
 construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators
both under normal and emergency conditions.        The Guide is not a set of requirement
         rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.      As Lord Wheatley
recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum -flexibility in any system of
control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds
factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to
ground.



 ^      Vvhil_ tn_ basic principles set out in-the Guide are relevant to all sports
stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are
involved.


General Approach to the Act


      The main instrunent °r controi under the- Act is the safety certificate issued
t*.e local auJiot xoy. a safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium
Which is the subject of a designation order, .made by the Secretary of State.            The
certificate enables the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as
are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.
               The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
        /portant grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with
             st.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
             dia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated
        ... 1976.      This was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
        Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
        Following the       fire   at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
        liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and                  k   of the Football League,
        and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were

        designated.


        Substance of the Act

        9.     The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under the Act, that
1       is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local authority for the area in
    ®   which the stadium is situated,.-which is required for every s ports stadium desig­
        nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.
                                                                                                               t




    -•"-TO.        Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate any sports
        stadium h a v i n g ' accommodation for more than   1 0 , 0 0 0    spectators as requiring a
        s a f e t y certificate.   Safety certificates are of two kinds, general a nd special.
        A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued,
         for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
         regularly taking place at the stadium.          A special safety certificate may be issued
         at the discretion of the lo ca l authority for a special event or other circumstances
         not covered by the general safety certificate.                   Such an event might be an evangel-
■}      istic rally which might call for s p e c i a l arrangements if, for example, seating were
    0   provided for the congregation on the playing area.                   A special safety certificate
         can be issued only in respect of a s p o r t s stadium for which a general safety

         certificate is already in force.


         11.       The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section_2.                The local
         authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
         are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
         Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to contain
          terms and c o n d i t i o n s relating to major'matters such as entrances and exits, means of
          escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of ciush banier^, c*nd
          maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
          To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certificate
          may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and

          the maintenance of safety.



                                                   iii
  12.    An.earlier Bill, introduced in 1973, limited the terms and conditions
  imposed under a safety-certificate to what was necessary to securc a reasonable
 degree for Members of the public."           There was some difficulty over this term
 because it might have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.                         This
 f .ticular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section                    1 7   , that'is,
 any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.                 On the other hand,
 it seemed     right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
 activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
 purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
 other'facilities at the ground.            Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section         2   (1 ) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium",            (although the terras "safety", as
defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a
sport).      Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
 (wlj^are, after all, the people the Act'’is mainly designed to protect and who will
be greatly in the majority).            Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate to state
the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




1 3   - A ction   3   s e ^ j u t :the broad procedure to be fallowed when a local authority
receives an application for-, a .safety certificateT' It S q u i r e s them to determine
whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified' person, ie a person likely
to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate.         If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
certificate to him.         Ir: this respect, the general safety certificate is different
from the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act. 1971:                        the latter
is ^psued"only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
instrument oi continuing control.            The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
because only they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special
occasion in question.


14.     In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from        1   April   1 9 8 6   ) the local
authority is required to send a ,copy of any application for a certificate to the
police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and condition;
       ; included in the certificate.   Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and
Consultation take place with, the police and the Building Authority.       The need
for such consultation is self-evident:       there must be close co-ordination of the
interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects

of safety at football grounds.


15.    Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer, surrender and
cancellation of safety certificates.      It is of primary importance that a local
authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears
appropriate for them to do so, for example, if they find in the course of a
routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an
immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.       Again, they
must have power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.


16.     Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or
requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.       Appeals
lie to the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.


17.     Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to
the safety of spectators at sports grounds.       This is in the nature of a reserve
power which could be used, for example, to give backing to requirements of the
 local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.
 This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for variouo
 other purposes connected with the Act.      To date no regulations have been made

 under this sub-section.


,18.    Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and
 appeals. Sub-sections (1) and (2) provide for the d ee me d withdrawal of an applica­
 tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority
 determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.          The
 section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending
 determination of an appeal against the inclusion of. that condition, although a
 court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
 remain in force ponding the determination of the appeal#




                                         v
  .39.      The holder of a general safety certificate is required by section           8   to
      notify .the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadi..
   Ihe purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without
" the local authority's knowledge, which might affect the safety of spectators


  2 0 - ~ J-tlon 9 P r i d e s for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation
  which may affect sports stadia.



  a.                                                     authorities should not feel inhibited
  fro* using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part
  of it, should be prohibited or restricted.             Should a magistrates' court, on the
  application of a local authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any
  sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted
  until remedial action has been taken,' the court may make an order accordingly
 jjns power applies to any sports stadium, or ground, whether or not .f                          t„
 ^ r e quiring a safety certificate.            Where a general or special safety certificate
 is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation
 by amending the certificate, in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.
 In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the
 local authority and the ciub would usually be expected to securc, on a voluntary
              rea^onabi- standard of safety; however, where management appears to be
 unwillmg to undertake the necessary measures or is slow to act on advice, this
 additional power can be used.

                <lMl* ” lRl> "lth Clvil ^ l l i t y - Its purpose is to Eake clear
that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in resnect of a
contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate', the existing
rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for neelt- ~
gsnce against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.


2*.     The Secretary of State is empowered by section         1 5   to extend to classes of
s,.,r„s gioimdb other than sports stadia such provisions or the Act as are no'-
already expressed to apply to them.            Tor example, it enables the Secretary of
-Late by oreer to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
race-courses.   Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension
order under this clause:   an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)
cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order
under section 15 to the class of sports ground to   which itbelongs.   Todate,
the powers under this section have not been used.


25.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the
Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations, exceptcommencement   orders,
made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.    It also
imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making any orders or regulations,
except commencement orders or- orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult
with such persons as appear to him requisite.
     FETY OF SPORTS^GROUNDS ACT 1975

P R O N D U R E S R E G A R D I N G ,APPLICATIONS jrPRjfiBMERAI^

1   .    The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application
for a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to
the Regulations or a form to the like effect.                       An application should be accompanied
by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­
ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers
and evidence of the applicant's status.                     It is, however, open to a local authority,
under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further
information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine
the.terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.       On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine.whether the applicant is a qualified person, le a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­
ditions to be imposed in the certificate.                        If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general
    safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.                    There is, however, a
    right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is

    not a qualified person (see paragraph             1 0   ).


    3.   In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 19S6) the local
    authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of any appli­
    cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chie^
    Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult then about tne terms
    an d conditions to be 'included in the certificate.                  Elsewhere in England and Wales
    the local authority must send a copy to arid consult with the Chief Officer ol
    Police and the building authority.             In framing such conditions, local authorities
    will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the
    Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.             In this connection local authorities are
    reminded that, this non-statutory document is -not a set of requirements to be
    rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.                    The maximum flexibility,
    s h o ul d be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual

    grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­
    struction.    In this regard, it should a3so be noted that the Act provides that the
     terms and conditions should be such a-*

            As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different
activities.             Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other
events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.              It is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided in^o

2       classes:-


             1   .    those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
            •stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;


             2   .'   those cf a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
             concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
             over to      spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and condition^
             will have to be devised.      It is not, of course, necessary       to   provide for
             these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium

             authorities.


7.           There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
to-the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected vo attract signi­
ficantly more than the usual attendance.              In the case especially of cup re plays
these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would
not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to
the grant of a Special safety certificate.              In order to overcome this difficulty,
it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which
might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to
    certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
    notice is given tc the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
    incorporation in the general safety certificate.


    8   .        Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
    tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
    ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
    the certificate or of the local authority (see section          li ( 2 )   of the Act) and will
    presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the
        original certificate.      It will thus be to the mutual benefit of looal authori
        ■and clubs/stadiun, authorities for a elose liaison to be maintained after the
.       issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety mea,
                                                                                    sure
        are being carried out. It is likely to be in the stadium operators' financial
        interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work
        has been completed, and the, should accordingly ensure that the local authority
        is kept informed of progress.      For    its .part the looal authority will no doubt
        wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the
        work, the certificate can be amended without delay.


        9.       After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
     transfer, of the certificate to another person.           Similarly, while a local
     authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the c e r t i f i ­
     cate has been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the
     original applicant as the person to-whom the certificate should be granted.               These
• r e , however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­
     cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium
    organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the
    organisation.        However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in
    both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.
    Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to
    giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with
    any necessary appeals procedure.        In the second case, there is no reason why the
    local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­
    tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already
    reached.



              In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
    certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
    paragraph     2   above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed
    transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right of appeal to any
    "interested party" (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
    g        lot t.ie inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to ar,end or replace a safety certificate                The
regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
any such appeal shall be given within            2 8   days following receipt of a notice of
the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified
the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
in the locality.
           In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
       ending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
     specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
     It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
     advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
     which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
     that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
     meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority's
     decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
     denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State.     For
     the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by
     Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention tc appeal, and a person wishing to
     appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under Section 5(4) of
a>
     the Act-is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.


     12.   Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
     notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining tc the
     appeal.   It will then be fcr the local authority, in accordance with Regulation
     8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it
     wishes tc oppose the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is
     required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state
     whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5    of the Act.   (The procedure govern­
     ing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)


     13.   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
     order a public inquiry under Section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
     In such a case, the procedure to be follov/ed is laid down in Regulation 12.

     14.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
     practice of copying to the Home Office newly issued or amended safety certificates.

                      next requires to be considered whether the application should be refus
            on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.              This
             ecision must, in accordance with regulation          6   , be made within 28 days of the
         receipt of the application, not only in cases where the local authority has

         it h ™ ? , that thG aPPllCant 1 3 3 qualified Person but also in those where
            has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to
                 considered.    There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds
        other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see
        Paragraph 9 ). In the event of      a                      ^   ^     ^       ^

         g a m required, under regulation       6   , to    givethe applicant the reasons for its
        decision-.



        5.        Khen the first 2 stage., have been completed, should it have been decided
        that a special safety certificate..should he issued, the local authority in
        metropolitan counties and Greater London (fro™ , April 1986, is required, hy

                                              c°Py °r ^ e application, to the chief officer
            -.*> ice and to the fire authority and to consult then, about the .terms and '
        conditions to be included in the certificateElsewhere in England and Hales •
        the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officcr of
        o        ice and the building authority.         The special safety certificate must        in
    accordance with regulation 6 (2 ,, then be issued not less than 28 days before
    tne proposed event is due to take place.           ’


    6   -        The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
    according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of

                           n0t ^ aPPr°priate- (In SUitable cases, however, regard may
»           had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

    ,‘°o H l 1 °n thS baS1S indicated ^ Paragraph 3 of the paper relating to th-
      rocecure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".) Any

S*e"ldl ^afety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms
and conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in
section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where
appropriate by reference to th^ plan -’tt-irh-H  m
                                pi^n .atached to the general safety cartificate.


7.           Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the deter-
                       an> appeal, the t o m s and conditions can be varied only by formal

            °f                    ^    - r * on the application of the holder of
    « ce.tificate or at. the discretion of the local authority (see section H ( 2 )
c.          t,o Act).    This        an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety



                                                    ii
          rtificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has
 been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.                      Any such amend­
 ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph                10    below.


 8    .     Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
 to another person an equally unlikely contingency.                    Any possible difficulties
 in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the
 general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.                      Nevertheless,
 should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide
 within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it
 decides to the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating
 to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will
 the appropriate appeals procedure, should                the need arise.        In the case of an
) application for transfer before,         a special safety certificate has actually been
 issued, there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica­
 tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­
 cess it from the point already reached.


 9.         Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a deter­
 mination that the applicant is nob a qualified person (paragraph                     3   ) and against
 the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).                      In addition the
 Act provides (in section 5(3))a right of appeal to any "interested party"
 against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
 certificate or against a refusal           to amend or replace a safety certificate.
 The regulations provide that, in           the case of a special safety certificate, notice
|of          suc^ appeal shall be given within        7   days follov/ing reccipt of a notice
of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a nev.'spaper
circulating in the locality.


 10.       As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate cr refusing so
to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also
to advertise its action in the press. • A similar obligation falls on an appellant
 (uadei regulation      8   (7 )) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish­
ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section
5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.
(The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the
paper relating to the 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
Certificates'.)

Dear Sir

SAFETY 'OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION

1.    The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the effects on the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Government reorganisation in the Metropolitan
^bounties and Greater London brought about by the Local Government Act 1985.

2.   With effect ;
                 ■from 1 -April 1986 responsibility for administering, the SSGA .1975 will,
in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London, ,transfer to the appropriate
Metropolitan District Council (MDC) or London Borough (the "successor" authorities).
They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue of and amendments to safety
certificates. A consequential effect of Local Government reorganisation is that the
current certificating authorities in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London are
not in the meantime empowered to issue or amend safety certificates for any period
commencing on or after 1 April 1986. Such certificates or amendments will fall to be
issued by the successor authorities. It is therefore in the interests of applicants
in these areas to ensure that applications for special safety certificates, or amendments
to existing certificates, which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 are.
copied to the appropriate successor authority who should be kept informed of developments
and progress so as to be in a position -to-assuae responsibility for the case,        inquestion
with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.       •-

                                                                            Yours faithfully

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 7/1 986

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975:               LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

Introduction

1.  HOC 54/85 and 5/1986 were copied to Chief Executives of
Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).  The purpose of this circular is to
advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
about by the Local Government Act 1985 (L G A ) and to give guidance
on discharging these responsibilities.  It is not intended to affect
any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
ensure that all those who have an interest in securing safety at
sports grounds are fully consulted.

 SSGA       1975

 2.  The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
 the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
 was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious accident at
 Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

  3.      The main provisions of the Act are:

          a.  A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
          designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
          10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
          a safety certificate from the local authority.

          b.  An obligation on the local authority to issue such
          certi f i c a t e s .
E.R.
                c.  A discretion for the local authority to set terms
                and conditions under the certificate with the object
                of securing a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
                Safety certificates are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
                safety certificate (the main form of control) and,
                secondly, the special safety certificate (for occasions
                or activities not covered by the general certificate).

                d.  A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
                relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
                contents, the procedure for which is set out in
                regulations made under s.6(1) of the Act.

                e.  Rights of various interested bodies (police, building
                authorities or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
                "abolition", fire authorities) to consultation, access to
                grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

                f.  An emergency procedure for       restricting the admission
                of spectators to a wider range       of sports grounds than
                those to which the designation       provisions apply, if the
                risk to spectators is seen (by       the courts) as justifying
                this.

                g.  Powers of entry and inspection to sports grounds;
                and prescribed penalties for offences under the Act.

   A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any place where sports or
   other competitive activities take place in the open air and where
   accommodation has been   provided for spectators.  A sports stadium is
   a sports ground where   accommodation for     spectators wholly or
   substantially surrounds the area used for the activities taking
   place therein.

       LGA   1985

       4.  The combined effect of s . 16 and Schedule 8 paragraph 7 of the
       LGA is to transfer to Metropolitan District Councils and London
       Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
       responsible for administering the SSGA in place of the Metropolitan
       County Councils and Greater London Council.    A summary check list of
       these responsibilities is contained at Annex A for ease of reference.

       5.  Paragraph 7(3) of        Schedule 8 of the LGA redefines "local
       authority" in England        and Wales for the purposes of the SSGA        as
       meaning:

                a.  in Greater London, the London Borough Council or
                the Common Council of the City of London;

                b.  in England, in the Metropolitan counties,           the
                district council;

                c.  in England outside Greater London and the
                Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the county council

       6.  In order to avoid any anomaly or duplication arising out of the
       Metropolitan District C o u n c i l s ’ and London B o r o u g h s ’ responsibilities
as "Building Authority", paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 8 of the LGA
redefines, for the purposes of the SSGA, "building authority" in
England and Wales as meaning:

       a.  in England, outside Greater London, and the
       Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the district
       council.

The effect of this, together with amendments to Sections 3(3), 4(7)
and (8), 5(5), 10(4) and 11 of the SSGA resulting from paragraph 7(1)
of Schedule 8 of the LGA, is that in Metropolitan counties and
Greater London, where the "building authority" and "local authority"
are synonymous, the local authority is not required to refer safety
certificate applications to the building authority or consult it
about the terms and conditions of a certificate.  Similarly the
building authority in these areas does not have the status of
"interested party" and has no need of the right to authorise entry
and inspection of a sports ground because these powers are vested in
it as the local authority.

7.  An additional change brought about by paragraph 7(1) affects the
role and status of the Fire Authority in Greater London and the
Metropolitan counties.   The converse of paragraph 6 applies in
respect of the Fire Authority which, from 1 April 1986, has the status
of "interested party" in Metropolitan counties and Greater London.
In these areas the local authority is required to refer safety
cert.ificate applications to the Fire Authority and consult it about
the terms and conditions of a safety certificate; and the Fire
Authority will have the right to authorise entry and inspection of
a sports ground.   The reason for these changes is that the newly
constituted fire authorities will not (as in the past) be the same
as the local authority.

Transitional Arrangements

8.  Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitional
Provisions) Order 1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
Metropolitan District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory powers,
including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports grounds
The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE circular LGA(L)
(DOE) 13/L G A ( M C )(D O E )16 of 26 November 1985- The Secretary of State
takes the view that Metropolitan County Councils and the GLC are not
empowered to issue new safety certificates or amend existing safety
certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1986 : SI 1985/1781
therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before 1 April,
applications for certificates to come into effect on or after 1 April.
Successor authorities will therefore wish to ensure that they are kept
informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend­
ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the Metro­
politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will auto­
matically have come to successor authorities in their present role as
building authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
early contact with the current ’c e r t ificati ng’ authority to ensure a
smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1986 without impairing
the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
that applications for special safety certificates for events on or
after 1 April 1986 may require advance consideration if a certificate
is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor authorities will doubtless
wish to be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
in hand by the present certificating authority in respect of sports
grounds in their area.
Guida nc e   to the SSGA p r o c e d u r e s

9.  A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.   A detailed description
of the Act and its provisions is contained at Annex B.  The Regu­
lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
safety certificate applications and appeals.   These same regulations
also empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
is at Annex C.  Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
safety certificate is at Annex D.

10.  The following points are highlighted as being of particular
potential interest to local authorities:

    a.  Procedure under s. 10. Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
    Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
    applied to all sports grounds within the meaning of the Act,
    not just to stadia.  It is hoped that authorities will not
    feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
    where they perceive the risks to be such that urgent action
    is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

    b.  The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
    Green Guide).  Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
    Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C.  Authorities will no
    doubt bear in mind the contents of paragraph 4 of HOC 54/1985
    dealing with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry

Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds

11.  The Final Report of Mr Justice Popplewell's Committee of Inquiry
into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
16 January 1986 (Command 9710).  A separate Home Office circular,
number 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1986 ,
giving details of the Government's response to the safety recommend­
ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

13. This circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
 Secretaries of the successor authority coordinating committees, and
 to Chief Fire Officers for information.  Paragraph 10 is of
 particular relevance.

                  Dear Dr Popper

                  I apologise for not replying to your letter of 15 May 1990 sooner, but I do
                  wish to express my thanks for your kind and supportive comments about the
                  social workers assisting at the Hillsborough Inquests.

                   As a profession, we seem to be more frequently at the receiving end of
                   negative comments, so your remarks were particularly welcome.

                   From the personal contact I have had with the social workers involved in the
                   Hillsborough Disaster, I have nothing but praise for the way they have
                   responded and worked in some very difficult circumstances.  It seems you have
                   had a good experience also in working with them.

                   Thank you once again and I did pass on copies of your letter to those
                   involved.


                   Yours sincerely

Dear Sergeant Stokes,


Thank you for your very kind letter of the 12th of June.

It is very kind of you to let me have the name and address of the artist.

May I also thank you for the file of press cuttings on Hillsborough and the
Marchioness.  I very much appreciate you letting me have this.  Thank you
very much indeed.


Yours sincerely,




S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

 Dear Dr POPPER,

 Thankyou for your kind letter of 18 May.  A personal thankyou
 of this kind is very much appreciated, especially as it confirms
 the feeling of caring management which was previously perceived.

 You should have already received a video copy of the news
 headlines which accompanied the inquests.  I am sorry the
  uality is somewhat poor, but this results from editing from a



• ppy of a copy.  Enclosed are copies of the various newspaper
  uttings which also covered the inquests.  I have also included
  those which dealt with the Marchioness tragedy, up till their
  adjournment.

 May I also pass on the name and address of the artist responsible
 for your picture: Priscilla Coleman,
        1 You may want to write to her, perhaps to commission
 another portrait!

 Finally, once again my sincere thanks for your letter.         For as
 much as my opinion m a t t e r s , I thought you conducted the inquests
 in the most kindly and harmonious of manners.         The quotation
 from Samuel on the final day was extremely profound.         Perhaps we
 will work again together, one day.

 Yours thankfully,



^ffarkStokes

Dear

I want to write a separate note to you to thank you for your
commendation. I am not only honoured, but extremely touched
by the thought and generousity of your spirit in honouring me
in this way.

You might be interested to know that when X took it home, my
mother, wh4 is now 90+ looked at it and read the words
carefully. Before I had any opportunity of saying anything
she spotted with what care the wording had been chosen. She
said that she did not think I could have done better myself,
and that I assure you is a compliment indeed. Others too have
commented on the wording. I am most grateful to you.

1 hope that you and Doreen had a comfortable move to your new
quarters and I wish you both the very best for the future. I
was sorry to learn that Doreen is not much better and I do hope
that there will be a speedy improvement. Perhaps the holiday
will help a little.

I would like to repeat my thank to you for the way you have led
your team in this enquiry and, in particular, for your personal
support and friendship.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Mervyn,

I have written individual letters to the people who were
involved directly with the Hillsborough inquests in April
and May.  For your information I enclose copies of the letters
so that you can see what I have said.

I am quite certain that there are very man y people whom I have
left out and not thanked individually, I would not want either
you or them to think that I am slighting them and I am therefore
taking this opportunity of thanking them through you for all
of the work which has been put in to preparing the information
and files in connection with these inquests.




Yours sincerely,

             Dear Mervyn

             Just a short note to ask you, please, to convey Wendy and my thanks to all
             the officers who contributed to the lovely flowers which you sent her. It was
             very very kind of them to think of her and both, she and I have appreciated
             the thought and also enjoyed the display. Thank you again, very much indeed.

             I also want to take this opportunity of thanking you and all the other
             officers concerned for your very great kindness to me during the Inquests
             and,in particular, I want to thank you for the thought of obtaining the ITN
             drawing of the 'Opening of the Inquest'and presenting this to me.

             As you know, when I watched the TV recording of the Opening I was not overly
             impressed with the likeness, but the more I look at it and think about it the
             more appropriate I feel the picture is, not only because of it's uniqueness,
             but also because of it's specific association with the Hillsborough Inquest.

             However, most of all, what makes it special, is the fact that you took the
             trouble to obtain it for me and present it to me.  I am most grateful indeed.
             Please convey my thanks to all concerned.

             Yours sincerely,

         Dear

         I understand that you were one of the officers who was assigned to deal with
         the enquiry and investigation and that you were based at Liverpool.

         I am sure that on many occasions you found your task in dealing with people
         who were involved in this tragedy a difficult and painful task.

         I am most grateful to you for all the work that you have put into these
         enquiries and therefore your assistance in making the inquests run as
         smoothly as they appeared to do.

         I hope that you will have a very bright and successful future with the Police
         Service.

         Yours sincerely

         Dear                ,

         I am writing to thank you for your contribution to the Hillsborough Inquest.

         I know that you had a part in Detective Inspector Layton's team, connected
         with the unravelling of the video and photographic evidence and I would like
         you to know how very much I admire the skill and dedication which was brought
         to bear in connection with that work.

         I would also like to thank you for the way you dealt with the presentation of
         the summaries.  Your very pleasant manner and your support for me in the days
         that we were together during the Hearings.

         I wish you all the very best and hope that the future will be successful and
         happy.

         Yours sincerely,

   Dear

   I am very grateful to you for your contribution to making the.Hillsborough
   Inquests so successful. Maintaining good relations with the Press is, of
   course, an exceedingly important matter, not only in inquest enquiries, but
  iindeed in many other spheres of life. Your presence during the hearings
   {insured that there was a liaison person available for media representatives, and
   I am sure this played an important part in maintaining good relationships.

    I would like to say how much 1 appreciated the availability of press cuttings
    so that one could see what was happening and what was being said.

    I wish you all the very best in your future career with the West Midlands
    Police.

         By the time you receive this you will, X hope, have had a wonderful holiday
         in California, and to a certain extent the memory of the Hillsborough Inquest
         in April - May will already begin to fade.

         I do however, want to take this opportunity of thanking you for your
         involvement and in particular for your sensitivity and feeling for the
         bereaved.

         I would also like to take this opportunity of thanking you for bringing the
         lovely flowers to Wendy, which was very much appreciated by her.

         I wish you all the very best for the future and hope that your career in
         the Police will be crowned with success and satisfaction for you.

Dear

I would like to write and thank you for your very great help in connection
with the Hillsborough Inquests.

I can remember that when you were initially charged with the task of
producing the listings, you felt that I was setting a very difficult and
possibly unobtainable target, namely that I wanted pathologists present at
each inquest, that they should be clustered, that family units should be done
jointly, and various other requirements, which you are very well aware of.

I am most grateful to you for the great skill which you have showed in
preparing the listings, and I think that you must have taken great
satisfaction from seeing how smoothly the system ran.  You did an excellent
job with regard to this and I am most grateful to you.

I have not, of course, had the pleasure of meeting your daughter, but I do
hope that her wedding on the 5th May went smoothly and well and that you all
had a very happy day.

May I take this opportunity of wishing you all the very                       best for the future.

Yours sincerely,

         Dear

         It was lovely to be able to see you on the 1st May to obtain the honour which
         was bestowed upon you and I felt very privileged to have been invited to be
         present.
                                            i
         Judging by the way in which you dealt with the organisation and arrangements
         for the Inquests, I have no doubt that this was very well deserved.

         I am most grateful to you for everything that you have done in connection
         with the Inquests, not just the practical activities, but also your very keen
         observation of matters that needed attending to in connection with staff at
         Medico Legal Centre, not to mention myself.

         I would like to take the opportunity of thanking you and your husband for
         your great kindness in puting me up on the night of the 1st May, it was very
         kind of both of you to put yourselves out for me.

         I hope that we will not lose touch over the coming months and years and look
         forward to seeing you again.

         May I wish you all the very best, not only at work but also in your
         activities, particularly golf.  I do not know what your handicap is, but I
         hope it improves dramatically.

         Dear     ]/&/$             /

         I would like to say how very much I have appreciated the enormous amount of
         work which you have put into making it possible for the Inquests to be
         conducted in the manner in which they were.

         The preparation of the files was a tremendous undertaking and I would like
         you to know how very much I appreciate the very high standard which you set
         and achieved in these cases.

         I now realise that we had set a very tight timetable for completion of the
         files and I can well imagine that your heart must have sunk whenever you
         received a further note from me, suggesting modifications or clarifications
         to the- documentation. However, you never let it show, nor did you allow your
         standards to slip, I think that you did a tremendous job.

         I also think back to several meetings when we discussed various matters to do
         with the Inquests, and your counsel was always pertinent and to the point.

         During the Inquests themselves your presence, the speed with.which you were
         able to sort out problems and your general guidance and support to other
         members of the team, as well as to myself, was a real benefit.

         Please accept my very grateful thanks for your enormous contribution to the
         Hillsborough Inquests.

         Yours sincerely,
                                JL

   Dear

   It is difficult to write to say how very much I appreciate the contribution which
   you have made to the Hillsborough Inquests.

   You are, of course, aware how very much I admire the skill, application and
   dedication of yourself and your team, in sorting out the video and photographic
   evidence, and I think one can say, without very much fear of contradiction,
   that very many of the families owe a great deal to you and your team for
   establishing the facts.

   I would also like to put on record how very much I appreciated your excellent
   presentations at the Inquests themselves. You had an extremely difficult task in
   having to deal with all 95 deaths and your presentations, both in content and
   manner in each and every case, were of the highest order.  I am most grateful to
   you, as indeed I am sure is everyone else who was present in Court.

    I had the pleasure and privilege of seeing you receive your award, at which time I

•   also had the pleasure of meeting your family.
    you, and justly so.
                                                   I think they were and are proud of


    I wish you every success for the future and hope to hear, from time to time, of
    further success.

    Yours sincerely,

         Dear Graham

         I am writing to thank you for all your help and support in connection with
         the Hillsborough Inquests.

         May I say that I very much appreciated the way that you tackled the
         presentation of the information in respect of those of the Inquests in which
         you were involved.

         I know that there were several cases where you exercised very great care,
         skill and persistance to ensure that the information, which was placed before
         me and the jury, was done in an accurate and yet sensitive manner and I am
         quite certain that this was very highly appreciated.

         I, and I am sure your colleagues, also appreciated your sense of humour and
         balance, which is so necessary in a situation such as we all found ourselves
         in.

         I wish you all the very best and much success and that future assignments
         with which you may be engaged may give you satisfaction and fulfilment.


         Yours sincerely,

          Dear

          It was a real pleasure being able to work with you in connection with the
          Hillsborough Inquests.  You seem to have the gift of being able to strike
          just the right balance between a   proper formality and gravity on one hand and
          a relaxed and friendly attitude,   which was both refreshing to me and, I
          think, must have been welcome and comforting to the bereaved.

         You were an important member of the team and I would like to thank you for
         your contribution.

         May I also take this opportunity of thanking you for bringing the
         lovely flowers to Wendy, which she and I very much enjoyed.

         I do not know what the future holds for you, but I would like to take this
         opportunity of wishing you well.    I am quite certain that you will be
         successful in your chosen career.

         Yours sincerely,

I am writing to thank you for all the help which you have given in connection
with the Hillsborough Inquests, I believe that you have been involved in
different aspects, including reading all, or virtually all the statements,
which have been obtained at this inquiry.  In addition you were involved with
Michael Tredgold in the listing of the Inquests, and you must be aware, as I
am, how smoothly that aspect went.  I am most grateful to you for your help
in that regard.

In addition to   that you were selected to look                  after Court, and, in
particular, to  dealwith the jury and I think                    that choice proved to be a most
happy one. Asfar as I could tell you looked                      after the jury extremely well
and also managed to ensure that Mr. Jones and                    I were adequately fed and
watered and care for.

I am most grateful to you for everything that you did to make the
organisation and running of the Inquests so successful.

I hope that your future in the West Midlands Police will be happy and
successful and that you will be contented in the tasks which may come your
way.

Yours sincerely,

Dear

My first contact with you was at various working sessions and I remember one
particularly long meeting at Police Headquarters.

During these meetings I was impressed by your contributions to the
discussions and your very perceptive understanding of the difficulties which
had to be overcome.

During the Hearings I was particularly impressed with the way you sought to
present the summeries, making modifications in order to improve the
presentation and to assist both the families and me.

Your concern and interest was obvious and I would like to thank you for your
tremendous help and support during the hearings, which have concluded.

I am sure that you will do very well in whatever future assignments may come
your way. I wish your well and I hope that you will be happy in everything
that you set your hand to.

         Dear

         I am writing a short note to thank you for the way you responded to any
         difficulty or problem which I raised with you in connection with the
         preparation for the Inquests, as well as during the two and a half weeks or
         so that we were up in Sheffield.

         I can clearly remember ringing   you and putting various matters to you and
         your assurance that the matter   would be dealt with.  I very     much appreciate
         the enthusiasm, time and effort which you put into making sure that, as far
         as it was possible to do, outstanding queries which were put to you were
         properly resolved.

         I hope that your future career   with the Police will be such                           that   you will be
         able to look back on it in years to come and feel that your                             work   and
         involvement had been worthwhile and fulfilling.

Dear

I understand that whilst we were busy with the Inquests in Sheffield you were
one of the officers who was holding yourself available to deal with any
problems which might arise in Liverpool.

I am most grateful to you for maintaining a friendly contact with the
bereaved families (I remember that you came down on one occasion and told me
a little bit about one of the families whom you had seen and who apparently
had found the Inquest in respect of their loved one helpful).

The task in dealing with bereaved was, undoubtedly, a very difficult one and
I appreciate your endeavours, as this would not only be beneficial to the
relatives, but also to me and to the West Midlands Police and indirectly, to
the Police Force of the United Kingdom in general.

May I take this opportunity of wishing you all the very best                    for your future
service with the West Midlands Police.

Yours sincerely

        Dear Diane

        I do not have much opportunity for dictating letters to you, but have had the
        pleasure of having had several meals with you at the Moat House.

         I also glean from conversations that you have very great skills in the
         secretarial field and I know that your presence and reliability were a very
         great assistance during the Inquests.

         I hope that your future will be bright and the decisions and choices which I
         know you are thinking about and which you will have to make, will prove to be
         right and happy ones for you.

         Yours sinriferely,

 Dear

 I want to take this opportunity of writing to you to thank you personally for
 your involvement in the presentation of so many of the summeries in respect
 of people who lost their lives at Hillsborough.

 Maintaining that sensitivity for the individual, when one deals with a number
 of deaths, is a difficult thing to do, and I very much appreciate the way you
 approached the task and dealt with the problems.

  I know, from conversations with you, that your police service is drawing to a
  close and that in about ten months time or so you will be retiring.  I hope
  that for the remainder of your service you will continue to enjoy success and
  job satisfaction and that when you do retire you will have a full, happy and
  satisfying retirement.

  Yours sincerely

         I want to take this opportunity of thanking you for your tremendous help and
         support in connection with the Hillsborough Inquest.

         I have very much appreciated the way you dealt with the preparation for

         appreciated, not only by me but I am sure by all your colleagues during

         I understand that you hope to be retiring in a few months time and, whilst it
         is likely that we will be meeting before then, I would like to take this
         opportunity of wishing you all the very best during your retirement, lots of

Dear

You did not have the opportunity to stay in Sheffield during the Inquests,
but were left to hold the fort at Nechells. Whether that was a good or a bad
thing is a matter which only you can judge, but I would like to say that an
anchor man is a very important cog within an organisation, and I recognise
that the fact that you were there, available and ready to undertake
research tasks which may be put to you, was an important reassurance to all
of us whilst we were dealing with the Inquests in April and Hay.

I would also like to thank you for the very courteous way in which you dealt
with the filing and documentation whenever you came up to my home in
Nottingham in the run up to these inquests.

I hope that the future will be bright for you and that you will have many
years of satisfaction in your police service.

Dear Joan,

Thank you for all the help you have given me during these
very trying weeks whilst we were preparing for and also
during the inquests.

I very much appreciate your help with sorting out and
organising the jury.  I think you will agree that we
were very fortunate in having Peter Griffiths as the
Jury Officer in court and I am sure that you appreciated
his help and good humour as much as the jury obviously
did and me as well.

I am also grateful to you for dealing with the preparation
of the files for each day so that I could prepare for the
hearings and for ensuring that I was not distracted by
unnecessary i nte ruptions.

I fear that there is still a great deal of work we are all
going to have to do in connection with these inquests so I
cannot promise any relaxation yet.

Thank you again very much indeed for your help.

Just a short letter to thank you very much indeed for your
support for me whilst I was dealing with the Hillsborough
inquests.  It was really good to know that I did not have to
concern myself with the day to day running of inquests arising
out of work in Sheffield and Barnsley.  I am most grateful   to
you for your time and effort.

As you know we are now in a sense in limbo whilst the D.P.P.
considers the matter.  The extent of any future hearings will
very much depend upon his decision and I will let you know
as soon as I have something concrete to report so that we can
plan appropriatly for the future.

    I very much appreciate how you and Robbie Forrest have dealt
    with the Sheffield inquests and affairs so that I did not have

    I am now awaiting the decision of the D.P.P. and when that is
    to hand I will be in a better position to judge how much
    additional work the Hillsborough inquests are going to produce
    for all of us.  I will of course keep you informed so that we

Dear Pauline,

Thank you very much for making yourself available during
these weeks whilst we have been getting ready for the inquests
and also whilst they were taking place.  I very much appreciate
the fact that you have been there and ready to undertake
not only the day to day tasks which obviously needed to be
done but also anything that came up which I needed quite often
urgently in connection with the inquests while they were taking
place.

I am afraid the work relating to Hillsborough may only just
be begining as far as you are concerned but I hope that you
will feel that the involvement with this whilst on the one hand
sad also enables one to have a sense of satisfaction in seeing
the work being done efficiently and with some kind of appreciation
from others.

and the one that I am nov dealing vith at Hillsborough.
I am also most grateful for you for making arrangements
for Bill Maddocks to come along and participate in the
discussion, and for indicating that if need be he would be
willing to come up and give us the benefit of his experience.

I found Johnny's comments very helpful and I am sure
I have gained a lot from the time which I spent with
all of you.
I really would like to say I very much appreciated the
excellent lunoh which you gave me. I am most grateful
and hope that if you are ever up in Sheffield,you will
not hesitate to call in and see me.
I am also grateful that you have indicated that if I
have any farther problems, I may get in touch with you. I
will try and avoid taking up too much of your time, but I
fear that I aay well want to discuss certainaspects with
you as we get nearer to the actual Inauests.

Yours sincerely,



S.L.Popper,

    Dear Mr Popper
    Thank you for your letter of 28 April 1989. I am enclosing some
    information about the service which Victim Support Sheffield
    provides, along with the information on those who were at the
    Medico-Legal Centre following the Hillsborough tragedy.
    I hope that you would put our leaflet "For Those Bereaved by
    Violence" on the reception desk in the Medico-Legal Centre. We
    are involved in a research project which is attempting to assess
    the help given to people who are bereaved in this way and we
    have trained staff and volunteers to offer help in this
    sensitive area of work.
    I have already written to you and your staff to express our
    thanks for your kindly and efficient service over the days we
    were at the Centre and would just like to reiterate how helpful
    you all were.
    Yours sincerely___________

      Dear Mr Popper

      Re:      Hillsborough Disaster.                   15 April 1989

      Many thanks for your letter in connection with the above.  Please accept my
      apologies for not replying earlier but, apart from having to submit my own
      reports to our National Headquarters, we have been deluged with a whole
      range of enquiries from other sources.

      Hence in order to simplify these enquiries and to provide everybody with
      similar information I have developed a summary sheet which indicates where
      all our staff were based, the activities they were involved in, and a
      complete listing of staff names.

      I trust that this is sufficient for your needs at the present time.  All
      the staff can be contacted via this office and personal addresses of
      individuals involved can be supplied on a need to know basis.

      Finally please accept my personal thanks for the help and co-operation I
      and all my members received from your staff through the incident.  If we
      can be of further assistance at any time or if you require any further
      information please do not hesitate to contact me.

      Yours sincerely_______

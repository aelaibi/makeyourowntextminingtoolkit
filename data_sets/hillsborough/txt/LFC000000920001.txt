I am Vice Chairman o f Liverpool Football Club. On the 15* April 1989.1 attended Hillsborough

Football Stadium to watch the FA . Cup Semi Final between Liverpool F.C an : Nottingham

Forest F.C. I now produce as ‘PB R l’ a copy of a statement I made shortly after the disaster at

the ground in which 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives. I confirm the truth of that statement

and wish to state the following by way of clarification; -



In my earlier statement I describe how spectators started to come onto the running track at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground. This was shortly after the game had started. I would re-iterate

my’ observation that at this time, the central pens on the Leppings Lane terraces appeared overfull,

ahhou     there was room in the adjoining pens at either side. My immediate thought was that this

was not an outbreak o f hooliganism as the spectators were taking care not to encroach the. playing

area despite there being little room between the perimeter fencing and the pitch




  Ether way he clearly blamed the disaster on I            v Hv     a-,:>rters. Superintendent DuckenfieUi

      A few minutes after the game had been stopped I decided to go down onto the pitch,

      accompanied by Tony Ensor, a Director o f Liverpool F C in order to investigate matters

      further.This was approximately 3:10pm. On proceeding to the goalmouth at the Leppings Lane

      end, a member of Liverpool supporters showed me their tickets which were still complete. They

      stated that the police had opened an exit gate and allowed the Liverpool supporters entiy with no

      check being made for tickets. Many spectators lay injured on the ground. Some were motionless.

      It was apparent to me at this time that there were some fatalities.



       At approximately 3:25pm I went to the Player's dressing room to inform them and the coaching

       staff that deaths had occurred and that therefore the game would have to be abandoned 1 made

       a conscious decision to inform the players at this stage as I recalled that after the Heysel disaster

       the players had complained that they had been left uninformed as to what had happened on that

       occasion.




       Tony Ensor and I then proceeded to a meeting in the Boardroom which had apparently been

       arranged by Graham Kelly of the F. A. Although the meeting was strictly called for the benefit of

       Club Chairmen and Secretaries, Tony Ensor insisted that he also be admitted in his role as Club

       Solicitor. This was permitted.



       Shortly afterwards, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield arrived in the Boardroom accompanied by

       another police officer and Graham Kelly. The Superintendent spoke about the Liverpool

       supporters arriving late. On further questioning by Tony Ensor about the cause o f the disaster he

       stated either: ‘Your people forced open a gate’or ‘Liverpool supporters forced open a gat

       Either way he clearly blamed the disaster on Liverpool supporters . Superintendent Duckenfield

       whilst appearing tense was also very controlled. I confirm that at this stage it was obvious that

      a number o f deaths had occurred



      One lesson I had learned from the incident at Heysel the previous year, was never to make snap

      judgments. On that occasion, a lot o f information had been had been circulated in the immediate

      aftermath which had subsequently turned out to be untrue. Mindful of this, and in view of the fact

      that at that stage the impression I had received from various sources ( including, I think, Graham

      Kelly, ) was that Liverpool fens had forced open a gate, I made a careful examination of the

      Leppings Lane end. I was accompanied by Tony Ensor



      Some supporters showed us the gate which they said the police had opened I now know that this

      gate is referred to as ‘Gate C \ As stated in my previous statement, the gate was a concertina

      type. There was no indication of a forced entry which did not surprise me as the gate was o f such

      construction that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for fans to have forced it open

      from the outside.




      I have marked a copy plan o f Sheffield Wednesday football ground. This is a copy o f that which

      appears at Appendix 1 o f the Interim Report o f Lord Justice Taylor. I have indicated the gate I

      inspected by marking it ‘1M am also aware that there are perimeter gates leading to the turnstiles

      in Leppings Lane. I have marked these 42 \ I confirm that I did not inspect these gates as the area

      leading from Gate ‘C* had been cordoned off. It was impossible to proceed further than Gate ‘C’

      as some o f the deceased had been laid out in that area.



      I now produce in evidence as ‘PBR2! , a copy o f the marked plan.

          had stated that Liverpool supporters had forced the gate. I did not feel the need to At the time

          o f writing the statement, the true facts surrounding the opening o f Gate ‘O’ had been established.

          In the circumstances, I did not feel it appropriate to adopt a defensive stance. My concern in the

          immediate aftermath was to offer as much support as possible to the bereaved families and,

          indeed, the Liverpool players who were all deeply affected by the tragedy.

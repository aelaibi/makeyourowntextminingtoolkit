Dear Lord Taylor

Please find -enclosed a copy of ’The Missing Voice’, a summary
of some recent research commissioned by the Football League
from MORI to determine the views of supporters on some major
issues affecting the game today and in the future.

The report looks, amongst other things, at supporters*
attitudes to membership schemes, match/ground facilities and
televised football.     it was part funded by sponsorship from
Rothmans Publications,.

It is by no means exhaustive and is only part of an on-going
campaign of market research and dialogue with supporters.

I hope that you will find the report summary both useful and
informative.   If you have any views or comments directly
concerning the report or the areas covered, I would be very
happy to hear them, and hope that you will not hesitate to
contact me.

Yours sincerely




T R PHILLIPS

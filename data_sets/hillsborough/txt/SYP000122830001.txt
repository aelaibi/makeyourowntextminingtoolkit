                                S u b je c t:-   HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER - SATURDAY 15th APRIL 1989._



                   h .m                 With reference to the above, I report that I attended the
                                football match at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, between
              l.ksv-f           Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. whilst off duty.

                                        I travelled to the match by private car, with friends,
                                one of whom is a serving Police Officer, Constable
                                stationed at Marsh Lane.

                                        I arrived at Sheffield just after 12.30pm. and having walked
                                from my parking place, arrived at the ground just after 13.00
                                hours. At this time, I saw that the turnstiles were open. I
                                did not go into the stadium immediately but eventually did so
                                at approximately 13.20 hours. I had a ticket for the West Stand
                                situated at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium. As I approached
                                the turnstiles, I could only see gates marked 'Leppings Lane
                                Standing’. I could not see any entrance marked for the West
                                Stand seating area and because of this, I approached the nearest
                                turnstile and asked a Police Inspector for directions to the
                                correct entrance. The Inspector I spoke to could not tell me
                                exactly whepe to go and advised me to go to the nearest turnstile,
                                which was the one that he was covering with a small number of Police
                                Officers.    On handing my ticket in at the gate, I was informed
                                that I was not at the correct entrance and was directed to
                                turnstiles further to my left towards the 'North Stand' entrances.
                                Whilst this only caused a minor inconvenience to myself and
                                nobody else, I do feel that I should point out,, that at this
                                time, there were no queues at any of the turnstiles despite there
                                being several thousand people in the aeea of the main Leppings
                                Lane and turnstile area. I feel had I arrived at the ground
                                any later, that this would have caused problems, particularly
                                 if a number of people had had the same difficulties in locating
                                their allotted turnstiles, as I had.

                                         I think that Police Officers, particularly Supervisory
                                 Officers on duty at the turnstiles, should have had a greater
                                 knowledge of the location of turnstiles, and more directive
                                 information displayed at the turnstiles.

                                         Having entered the correct turnstile area, I was physically
                                 searched by a Police Officer. On passing through the turnstile,
                                 I was again searched by a Police Officer and another search was
                                 made at the stairway where access to the stand is gained, making a
                                 total of three searches made of me in the space of approximately
(_D»^p^rrx/                      twenty yards.

                                         I do appreciate the importance and necessity of such searches
                                 at football grounds but I felt that three searches in such a short
                                 space of time was unnecessary. The second and third searches
                                 were actually made within view of each other.

        I feel a search could have been made either immediately
outside or inside the turnstiles. A third search prior to
entering the stand was unnecessary and officers displayed at
these points could have been replaced by stewards, thereby
releasing Police Officers to assist with the crowd control
outside the stadium.

        At about 14.50 hours, I went to the toilets in the West
Stand. From there, I had a clear view of the situation that
had developed in the area immediately outside the turnstile
area, within the fenced enclosure between the turnstiles and the
Leppings Lane. There were thousands of people crammed into this
area and thousands were outside on Leppings Lane also trying to
get into this enclosure. The situation did appear to be out of
control and people were scaling the walls, I believe to escape
the crush, rather than to gain access to the ground. There were
police horses in the compound but the situation appeared to have
got to the stage where they were of no use in pushing back the
crowd. Having been to both Goodison Park and Anfield Football
grounds, both as a Police Officer and spectator I know how
effective the use of Police horses are in organising and
maintaining orderly queues of thousands of people waiting to get
into these grounds.

        I feel I must point out however, having seen the
situation outside the ground that had the decision to open the
pass out gates not been taken, then there may well have been even
greater casualties and fatalities than resulted in the gate being
opened. Inside the ground there was an escape route onto the
pitch whereas outside there was no means of escape from inside the
compound immediately outside of the turnstiles. I think it would
be wrong to shoulder the blame for what happened solely on the
decision to open the large pass out gate but feel had the crowds
been properly policed and organised at an earlier stage then the
whole situation would never have developed.

        The event that took place inside the stadium that resulted
from the crush were also witnessed by myself. I was overlooking
the terrace and was disturbed by the delay in anybody in authority
actually realising what was happening. The initial police action
was to prevent people climbing over the perimeter fencing and the
security gates were not immediately opened. There was a
security closed circuit camera situated on the south side of the
West Stand which was facing along the Leppings Lane terrace.
Further to this, there was an observation room between the West
and South Stands. I could see clearly what was happening in the
terrace and I can see no reason why the person monitoring the
C.C.T.V. or the observation room can not have realised at an earlier
stage what was happening and allowed the safety gates to be opened.

        Once spectators were admitted access to the pitch and
the situation began to unfold, there were literally hundreds of
police on the pitch but it was the spectators who took the
initiative oP organising make shift stretchers, assisting in
helping fellow supporters from the terracing and even giving heart
massage and artificial resuscitation to those in need. This was
all done whilst many Police Officers stood around literally doing

nothing, although many did give valuable assistance and no
doubt helped save many lives, but I do feel more could have
been done by Police Officers who are trained in first aid
and resuscitation to assist the very stretched St. Johns
Ambulance Service.

        One last point I feel I must comment on is the design
of the ground, in relation to crowd safety. I am aware that the
Leppings Lane terrace is reserved solely for the accommodation
of visiting supporters to Sheffield Wednesday on match days and
access is not granted to home supporters. I feel it is therefore
not necessary to have the system of lateral fencing that divides
the Leppings Lane terracing into smaller sections. I could see
that the wing sections were not full and had the lateral fencing
not been present, it would have allowed the massed spectators
in the middle section to spread out and possibly have saved
unnecessarily wasted lives.

        Whilst I appreciate that it is not my position to criticise
or condemn anyone, I do have very strong feelings about the
extremely disturbing scenes I witnessed at Hillsborough on
Saturday, in that what happened could have been avoided and
I respectfully request that my observations be made available
to the Investigating Officer responsible for the inquiry into
the incident and that this report be submitted accordingly.

        Constable         las discussed this incident with me
and I am aware that he was only too aware of what was going on,
particularly in the standing area concerned. His brother was in
this section and he sought to ensure his safety. His comments
are pertinent to any enquiry, particularly in view of his own
crowd control experience at local matches.

               of the d e c eased        people   I carried from the               pitch on that       day.



               I carried three           people all males         off       the   pitch and a t t e m p t e d   to treat

               one male on the           pitch but he a p p e a r e d to fae dead.

                       dark    coloured short         bomber       ty            t on.       We    covered his fate with

                       some    clothing     because        he was dead,



                       I was    in a daze and then a man                   ran past me wit h a hoarding and shouted

                       about    his   c l o t h i n g , but    I saw he ^Kad a wedding                  ring on.        I helped        to

                       carry this man across               the    pitcj?                 t him at the           rear of the North

                       I went    back across         the      pitch with       the hoarding and another                   person was

                       placed on the hoarding.                   Again this          person was a big            lad wit h no

              en o u g h a nd went         back   down   to the L a p p i n g s L ane       terrace.    I found a lad

              friend there and we all                 sat     together          for a short while.

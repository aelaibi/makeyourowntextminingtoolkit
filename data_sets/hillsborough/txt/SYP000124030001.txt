 <350.      WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE”F00TBALL GROUND?
 THERE WAS         AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE TANNOY STATING THAT YOU COULD LEAVE THE

 GROUND - THAT WAS WHEN I LEFT.

 G51.       DID    YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF                EITHER APOLICE OFFICER,     A STEWARD, A

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF MY OWN ACCORD BUT AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE TANNOY.


<318

 <352.      DID    YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU                CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 dQ.        DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK THAT THE FANS HANDLED IT BETTE^^HAN THE POLICE.                           THE FANS TOOK THE

 INITIATIVE TO RIP THE HOARDINGS DOWN TO MAKESETRETCHERS.                          I DON’T KNOW WHAT

 THE POLICE WERE DOING WHEN THEY MADE THE LINE ACRQ$S THE PITCH, INSTEAD OF

 DOING THAT THEY COULD HAVE HELPED PEOPLE.

 <354.      IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHEN THE SURGE HAPPENED ON THE TUNNEL I THINK THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN POLICE OR

 STEWARDS ON THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL DIRECTING THE FANS ROUND TO THE SIDES,

 LIKE THEY DID AT THE LEAGUE GAME, IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OR EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

Q18

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 I SAW A PHOTOGRAPHER ASSAULTED BY SOME FANS IN THE CROWD BECAUSE HE WAS

PICKING THE COVERS OFF THE BODIES TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS



DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE GAME SHOULD NOT HAVE KICKED OFF BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH.

 IT SEEMED TO BE THE SUPPORTERS WHO WERE HELPING THE DEAD AND INJURED RATHER

THAN THE POLICE„ IT SEEMED LIKE SOME OF THE POLICE WERE IN SHOCK AND JUST

STANDING AROUND

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

^j)ICIAL INQUIRY?

 IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE DIRECTION OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE GROUND    I DON! THINK

THE DISASTER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. ALSO PEOPLE TURNING UP LATE AT THE SAME TIME
AFTER BEING DELAYED BY ROAD WORKS AND POLICE STOPPING TO SEARCH THE FANS

 FIRE SERVICE DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER AND THE ONLY THING THEY DID

 WAS TO PULL THE GOAL NET DOWN.

 <£['     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ■1)    ON AN F .A . ORGANISATIONAL POINT, THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE NOT GIVEN ENOUGH

 TICKETS, ON NORMAL OCCASIONS THERE ARE ALWAYS FANS WANTING TICKETS, AND THIS
 WAS A BIG MATCH, OUR AVERAGE GATE IS 40,000, FORREST IS ONLY 20,000, YET WE

 GOT 15,000 LESS TICKETS.

 2)      ADMITTEDLY MANCHESTER UNITED WERE AT HOME THAT DAY, AND AS IT HAD GONE OF

 ALL. RIGHT THE YEAR BEFORE, I THINK IT WAS DECIDED TO HOLD IT AT HILLSBOROUGH

 AGAIN AND THEY BELIEVED EVERYTHING WOULD BE THE SAME AGAIN AND COMPLACENCY

 SET IN.      ANOTHER POINT IS THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS HAD TO USE THE LEPPINGS L.N
                                                                           page ;
                                                                           GSL878

 ENTRANCE TO GET INTO ALL THE ALLOCATED PARTS OF THE GROUND WHICH IS NOT THE

 NORMAL PRACTICE,    IT WAS LIKE A FUNNEL EFFECT.

 3)     I BELIEVE FOR A MATCH LIKE THIS THE AREA SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT OFF, AND

 ALL FANS GOING TO THE GROUND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PRODUCE THEIR TICKETS

 BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND TO AVOID THE LARGE CROWD OUTSIDE■

 4)     THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER STEWARDING/POLICING INSIDE THE GROUND TO

 DIRECT THE PEOPLE TO THE OTHER VIEWING POINTS, RATHER THAN LET THEM GO

 THROUGH THE TUNNEL.     AND EACH SECTION/PEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROPERTY STEWARDED

 POLICED TO ONLY ALLOW THE PENS TO BE FILLED PROPERLY AS IT IS AT MOST OTHER

 GROUNDS.
        THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY AN OVERCROWDED PEN,

 LOUDSPEAKERS/LOUDHAILERS COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF PENS 3

 AND 4 TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO THE EMPTY PENS.     THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE TO

 ANY OF THE CROWD TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHAT ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE

 MADE YOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND, THE COMPUTERISED SCOREBOARD COULD HAVE BEEN

 USED TO INFORM PEOPLE, ALL THROUGH AFTERNOON IT SHOWED AN ADVERTISEMENT.

 INFORMATION TO THE FOREST FANS WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL.

 6)     THE REFEREE ACTED VERY QUICKLY IN TAKING THE PLAYERS OFF.

 7 5    THIS IS A GATHERING OF 50,000 PEOPLE AND IT IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION TO

 HANDLE AND A LOT OF POLITICIANS ETC SEEM TO FORGET THEY JUST SAY ITS A

 FOOTB ALL MATCH.

 Q53 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE DIDN’T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO, THEY WERE STANDING ON THE FENCING

 AT THE FRONT SHOUTING FOR US TO MOVE BACK.        IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO MOVE.
                                                            /
 LET ALONE MOVE BACK.        THERE DIDN’T SEEM TO BE ANY COMMUNICATION.  THE POLICE

 WERE SLOW TO REACT.       THEY DIDN’T SEEM TO REALISE HOW ^EIOlJS IT WAS, THE

 FANS TOOK THE INITIATIVE.        THERE WERE SOME POLICE WH o V   h   / GET STUCK IN BUT

 THERE WERE A LOT WHO JUST STOOD AROUND.        THERE SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF

 MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.       THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE
                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                       GSL881

 EVERYONE IN THE GROUND AWARE THAT A SERIOUS INCIDENT HAD TAKEN PLACE.                 THE

 AMBULANCE WENT ROUND THE EDGE OF THE PITCH VERY SLOWLY, IT SHOULD HAVE GONE

 ACjttpS& THE PITCH AND BEEN QUICKER ABOUT IT.      PEOPLE WERE DYING THE RESPONSE

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE URGENT.


Q 19

 Q54 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



 THEY DID AND IF YOU HADN'T GOT A TICKET YOU WERE TURNED AWAY WELL BEFORE THE

 GROUND.     THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION OF QUEUES AT TURNSTILES SO THE RATE OF

^TRY     INTO THE GROUND WAS A LOT SLOWER.    THE SEARCHING OF THE FANS INSIDE THE

 GROUND ALSO SLOWED THINGS DOWN EVEN MORE.       IF THEY HAD TO OPEN THE CONCERTINA

 GATE TO ALLOW THE CROWD IN THEY SHOULD HAVE BLOCKED THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE AND

 DIRECTED FANS TO THE SIDES OF THE TERRACING.

 I THINK THE FENCING OF THE TERRACES INTO PENS WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN WHAT

 HAPPENED.     THERE WEREN’T ENOUGH GATES IN THE FENCING AND THEY WEREN'T BIG

 ENOUGH.     LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED THE SPION KOP END IT

 WAS OBVIOUS THEY WOULD HAVE THE MOST SUPPORT.

 NO

 <333

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

^|'T'ER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 NO

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHY DIDN’T LIVERPOOL GET THE BIG END IN THE BEGINNING AS PER RATIO OF

 SUPPORTERS OR WHY DIDN'T THEY GET MORE TICKETS.

 WHEN THE GATES WERE OPEN TO LET THE SUPPORTERS IN WAS THERE A BREAKDOWN OF

 COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE IN AND OUT OF THE GROUND.    THE POLICE SHOULD

   ^VE BEEN ABLE-TO MONITOR THE CROWD IN PENS 3 AND 4 AND SEE THERE WERE TOO

 MANY IN THERE PRIOR TO THE KICK OFF.

 WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED NOT TO ENTER THE TUNNEL.

 WHEN THE SITUATION HAD OCCURRED THE EMERGENCY SERVICES DID THEIR BEST.

 AFTER ALL THEY WERE IN THE SAME POSITION AS WE WERE, THEY DID THEIR BEST TO

 HELP .
 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL FENCES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS REMOVED, POLICE OFFICERS

 COULD REPLACE THEM.

 NO

 Q53

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.

 15 THERE WERE A CONCENTRATION OF POLICE AT THE FRONT ENTRY GATE AND FANS

       HAD GOT OUT ALONG THE FRONT FENCE. SHOUTING AT US TO MOVE BACK.      THEY

 DIDN’T REALISE THAT THE CRUSH WAS STILL CONTINUING AND WE COULD NOT MOVE

 BACK AT ALL.
 2) THERE WERE NO TANNOY ANNOUCEMENTS WHICH MAY HAVE GIVEN DIRCTIONS TO

 ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM.

 Q54
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL ENQUIRY?

 1) IF FENCES ARE REQUIRED THEN THEY MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT EXIT GATES

 ^ H I L L S B O R O U G H THEY WERE TOO FEW AND FAR TOO SMALL.

 2) THE STANDING ALLOCATION TO LIVERPOOL WAS TOO SMALL.

 3) WHEN I ENTERED AT EPM (1400) THERE WERE ONLY SMALL QUEUES BUT THERE WERE A

 LOT OF PEOPLE MILLING ABOUT IN LEPPINGS L.N WHO WERE NOT SUBJECT TO CROWD

 CONTROL BY POLICE AND STEWARDS

 4) COMMUNCIATION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED BOTH IN MORE SIGNS WITHIN GROUND AND

 DIRECTION BY POLICE AND STEWARDS. MORE CCONTROL OF FANS ENTERING PENS AND

 CLOSING THEM WHEN THEY ARE FULL.

 5) COMMUNICATION AMONGST THE POLICE WAS VERY INEFFICIENT.        WHEN I LEFT AT

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH, IF SO, CAN YOU SAY

 I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE PEN 2 WAS VIRTUALLY EMPTY.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE? IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT

 CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 I MANAGED TO GET OVER INTO PEN 2 FAIRLY QUICKLY. I HELPED ABOUT 5 OTHERS TO

 GET OVER INTO PEN 2. ONE WAS A 10 YEAR OLD LAD, ANOTHER WAS A 60 YEAR OLD MAN,

 THEY HAD BOTH FAINTED. THE MAN WAS WEARING A          JACKET. HE HAD      HAIR,

              TROUSERS ON. WE TOOK THEM TO THE FRONT GATE OF PEN 2 WHICH WAS OPEN

        HANDED THEM TO A POLICEMAN THERE,

WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

16.30 HOURS (1630).

Q51

DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EI T H E ^ A POLICE OFFICER, A

STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT/^ OF YQjJR QWN ACCORD?,

                           Y DAUGtSiHJOKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT ASKING FANS TO
OWN ACCORD. I REMEMBER KENNY

STAY CALM. I LEFT BY GOING Ij/fo PEN 3 USING THE BACK GATE THROUGH THE CENTRE

TUNNEL AND OUT OF THE BACr


#
G5£

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

G53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE EMERGENCY SERVICES DID NOT REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON.      IT WAS MAINLY LEFT

TO THE FANS. IT WAS THE FANS WHO PULLED THE BARS DOWN. FANS WHO PUT PEOPLE

INTO AMBULANCES. THERE WAS A LINE OF POLICE ALONG THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             GSL900

 DOIhju NOTHING BUT SEPARATING THE TWO SETS OF SUPPORTERS. IF THERE HAD BEEN A

 TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT TELLING THE FOREST    FANS WHAT HAD HAPPENED, THOSEPOLICE

 COULD HAVE BEEN USED ELSEWHERE. FOREST    FANS WERE CHANTING ATFIRST, BUT    IF

 THEY HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CHANTED. LIVERPOOL FANS

 DID CHARGE ACROSS THE PITCH AT ONE STAGE. THE LIVERPOOL FANS ONLY CHARGED

 BECAUSE THEY WERE ANGRY, NO OTHER REASON.


Q19

 (334

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD    WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I'VE NEVER LIKED THE LEPPINGS LN TERRACE. IT IS DESIGNED TO KEEP PEOPLE IN.

^ B L A M E THE FA FOR GIVING THE SPION KOP END TO FOREST. I KNOW THE POLICE WERE

 MOANING THAT IT WAS EASIER, GEOGRAPHICALLY, TO GIVE THE SPION KOP TO FOREST,

 BUT THE AVERAGE GATES OF BOTH CLUBS SHOULD HAVE DICTATED THIS.

 LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE INSIDE THE GROUND AND THOSE OUTSIDE.

MORE & MORE PEOPLE WERE BEING ALLOWED IN TO AN ALREADY FULL TERRACE.

FANS MILLING AROUND OUTSIDE GROUND SHOULD BE MADE TO GO IN.      THEY TEND NOT TO

 GO IN. THEY TEND NOT TO UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE, ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE A SEAT

 TICKET, AS THEY ARE GUARANTEED A MATCH VIEWING POSITION.

 THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO ANFIELD EVERY OTHER WEEK, NO PROBLE

 MERSEYSIDE POLICE ARE USED TO HANDLING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, BOTH AT ANFIELD

 A      GOODISON PARK. I FEEL THAT AN OUTSIDE FORCE SUCH AS W YORKSHIRE SHOULD

 HAVE CONSULTED WITH MERSEYSIDE POLICE BEFORE THE 13TH APRIL 1989 (150489).

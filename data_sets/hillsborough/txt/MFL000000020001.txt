D ear Corhrade,     .

          E n c l o s e d is a recent article of January 5th,       in the
S h e f f i e l d evening newspaper, The Star.

          It reveals clearly that the struggle against the Chief
C on s t a b l e is intensifying, and that your letter to The Star
w i t h all your signatures on it, wil l help this intensification
of the struggle, in a manner b e n e f i c i a l to the poor people who
s u f f e r e d such losses.

        It will of course, also strengthen me, as I have been in
a r a t h e r exposed position for the last 6 months, by bringing in
a new layer of support for my stance, and the one that you will
be t a k i n g in the letter, as a result of the meeting I had w ith
you in the House of C o m m o n s , towards the end of last year.

     No other Member of Parliament in Sheffield has emerged to
support me, and two Labour-Members of Parliament have supported
the Chief Constable.

       Kindest regards,         and all the best     for the New Year.



                                                Yours,

Dear Alan,

      Time is passing, and in January the full report on
the H i l l s borough Disaster is e x p e c t e d to come out.

       You remember that we agreed w h e n I spoke to you recently
that I should let you have a copy of a letter which I sent to
ma n y newspapers, including the most important paper in South
Yorkshire, The Sheffield Star.

     This letter will give you facts and quotations from w hich
to formulate a letter of your own to be sent to the Sheffield
Star, and signed by the Merseyside Labour M.P.s.

     The address of the Star,is in the copy letter w h i c h I
enclose.

     Blanche and I hope that you are feeling a good deal better
and   are sorry that we were not able to come to your Christmas
Do on Monday last.




                                   Yours ever,

     In everything that we say and do c o ncerning the appalling
disaster at H i l l sborough Football Ground, we should never forget
that we are speaking, or writing, against the background of 95
dead, and hundreds injured, w i t h all the attendant m i s e r y ,heartbreak,
and sense of acute loss, w h i c h all the families of the deceased must
have gone through, and still be going through, and will for a
considerable time in the future.

          The fundamental essence of the Interim Report on the Inquiry by
the Right Hon: Lord Justice Taylor, is that on April 15th," the
p o l i c i n g of the Semi Final at Hillsborough, broke down", and that
"the m a i n reason for the disaster was the failure of police c o n t r o l ” .

     Speak i n g of the conduct of some 65 police officers, giving oral
evidence at the Inquiry, the report says, and I quote 'that for the
most part, the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion
to their r a n k 1, and later '....the senior officers in command were
defensive, and evasive w i t n e s s e s ....... But neither their handling
of problems on the day, nor their account in evidence showed the
qualities of leadership to be expected of their r a n k ' .

        In the final p a r a g r a p h of the section of the report dealing
w i t h the p o l i c e ,(Paragraph 285) it says "It is a matter of regret
that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire
Police were not p r e p a r e d to concede they were in any respect at
fault in what o c c u r r e d " .

          It was against this background that the Chief Police Officer,
Mr W r i g h t stated that he held himself r esponsible for all that had
occurred, and took the sensible step of tendering his resignation.
One must assume from this that he intended to resign, but sections
of the press are acting as though he did not intend to resign. In
the m e a n t i m e however, Mr Wright has remo v e d vir t u a l l y every senior
o f f i c e r under his command, and who had any connection w i t h the tragedy
at Hillsborough, into new positions, and some of them away from
Sheffield.


                                                      c o n 't

      As soon as the Interim Report came out, Sir Jack Layden,
Chairman of the Police Committee, rushed straight into print to
the effect that Mr Wri g h t should not cease to be the Chief Police
Officer of South Yorkshire.          He was s u pported in this by two members
of the Police Committee, a Labour Member, and a Tory Member, who have
not ceased to gain p u b l i c i t y claiming immense support for the stand
t hey had taken.

          This 'pre-emptive strike', clearly intended to sway opinion on
the Police Committee, whe n even t u a l l y it met to discuss the case,was
most unfortunate.           They should have w a i t e d for the committee to meet,
instead of seeking support for a one sided case.                It was against this
b a c k g r o u n d that I decided to make a statement asking that Mr Wright
sh o u l d have his resign a t i o n accepted.     This appeared in The Star with
a comment in lurid terms that 1The new call for his head came amid
claims that the u n d e r - f ire-force-boss had made highly placed enemies
in W h i t e h a l l 1.

          This claim was under the heading in large black print of 'Sack
Chief Constable call by M.P. Martin F l a n n e r y 1, and gave not a w o r d of
e x p l a nation about the statement re g a r d i n g 'enemies in Whitehall'.

          In public life generally, and indeed, in other aspects of life,
w h e t h e r it be a Prime Minister, a Comm a n d i n g Officer or, for instance
a Chief Police Officer, if a drastic mistake is m a d e ,involving massive
loss of life, it is accepted that the pe r s o n at the helm is responsible.
All the evidence shows that proper p l a n n i n g for Hillsborough was
c o m p l a c e n t and neglectful, and for this Mr Wright must take blame. The
H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy need never have occurred if he and the senior
officers involved had p l a n n e d and carried out their wor k properly. The
I n t e r i m Report, makes this a b solutely clear, and it is therefore incumbent
on Mr W r i g h t to resign his post, w h a tever finding the Police Committee
comes to.

          He claimed that he accepted full responsibility.     Let him prove
that b y honourably giving up his position, and allowing a new officer,
u n t a i n t e d by this shameful episode, to take over command of the South
Y o r k s h i r e Police.

          T h e Sheffield Star has u n f o r t u n a t e l y been speaking wit h two voices
on the question of Mr W r i ght's resignation.                  It prints articles which
s e e m to support his c ontinuing to be Chief Police Officer,but in its
E d i t o r i a l of Mo n d a y August 7th 1989, The Star in a separate paragraph
w i t h i n the Editorial says the following:




                                                               c o n 't

"Chief Constable Peter Wright has tendered his resignation.
Wh e n members of the South Yorkshire Police A u thority meet on
August 14th, they should accept it".

     I c o mpletely agree w i t h The Star for the reasons w h i c h I
have given above.




                                   Yours sincerely,

Lynne Ley

Hillsborough CLP
112 Hadfield street
Sheffield 6

Dear Lynne,

Thank you for sending me a copy of the
resolution which is to come before the next
meeting of your District Labour Party.   I agree
entirely with the views expressed in the
resolution.  It seems to me that for the South
Yorkshire Police Authority to disregard the
offered resignation of the Chief Constable
following the Hillsborough disaster is to refuse
to accept that anybody should carry the final
responsibility.  It used to be a virtue of
public life in Britain that when mistakes were
made it was those at the top who accepted
responsibility and did not merely leave their
underlings to be the only ones to suffer.

The Hillsborough disaster was an enormous *
calamity the consequences of which are still
being felt very strongly on Merseyside and I am
very pleased that pressure is coming from within
Sheffield to ensure that those responsible
accept that responsibility.  I hope that your
District Labour Party supports your resolution.

Yours sincerely.

Dear Comrade



Thank you for your letter of 7th October enclosing a copy of the resolution
recently passed by Hillsborough Constituency Labour Party concerning the
decision of South Yorkshire Police Authority not to accept the resignation
of the Chief Constable.

I wholeheartedly endorse the sentiments of the resolution and have recently
reiterated my support for the stance of Martin Flannery MP on this matter.
In my capacity as Chair of Liverpool District Labour Party I will continue to
raise this matter inside the Liverpool labour movement, as well as in
Parliament, in an effort to ensure that those responsible for the events
of April 15th are removed from their positions of authority. I believe that
this is the least that should be done to reassure the families of those who
died and were injured on the Leppings Lane terrace.

Please keep in touch if there is anything further I can do to assist.


Yours fraternally




Eddie Loyden MP

Bear Blanche,




Thank you for your letter re the Hillsborough Disaster and my approach to
Harry Chase and Tommy Smith of the Working Party.

The letter I forwarded to you is the only letter the other was just an
acknowledgement. I have tried phoning on a number of occasions but I did not
get a response so I assumed you 'where away.

I did get on radio and something in the local press after Martin rang me
I could not contact the other Liverpool MPs as they ■where away at the time.

If Martin still wants the others to write let me know. I have not been able
to get away worse luck . I hope you and Martin have had a holiday.

See you at the Conference   although I can't say I'm looking forward to it
with enthusiasm .


Regards to you and family

    ^^tiDear Colleague,

                 Police Officer,Mr Peter W r i g h t ,t e n dered his resignation.

                 Layden made a statement before the A u thority even met, that they
                 w o u l d not accept the resignation, and was supported by other
                 m e m b e r * o f the Authority.

     ■         I immediately said that the resign a t i o n should be accepted
      ;-#;as the Chief Constable was in overall command of the Police Force

                 accepted.

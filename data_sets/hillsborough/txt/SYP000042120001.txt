complaint against                      referred to in your letter so that,
if nec333ary, Mr Dear can alao undertake that enquiry.

I would be grataful to receive a response indicating your intentions and to

Dear Mr

Thank you for your letter concerning the events at Hillsborough on 15 April.

I appreciate and understand the concerns you express in the letter but regret
that, in view of the current judicial enquiry into the tragedy, I sun unable
to comment upon the policing arrangements for the match. May I express my
deepest sympathy to yourself and all those present.

The incident involving                       |.s another matter and one which
can be investigated immediately. You say that you do not wish to prosecute
this man but do not indicate whether you want to make an official complaint.
I enclose for your information a leaflet about complaints against the police
which may assist you in deciding whether the actions of that individual
officer should be investigated.

A- stamped addressed envelope is enclosed for your reply.

Yours sinceraly




Assistant Chief Constable

Mr. M. Jones,
Assistant Chief Constable,

P.O. Box 52, Lloyd House,
Colmore Circus Queensway,
Birmingham. B4 6NQ,.

    Dear Mervyn,

    R e 8 GARY   PH T T .T P   JONES (deceased1) No.8 6 .

    You will recollect that we had a letter from Morecroft Dawson
    & Garnett regarding the above in which they suggested that a Mr.
              cof the Yorkshire Fire Service had been involved
    with the above deceased. You have already supplied me
    with a copy o f |            statement N 0 .83 OOI.

    Following that, I wrote to Morecroft & Dawson and asked
    them to let us have any evidence which they had from Mr.
          ]and they replied in fact on the 23rd of October
    (I am sorry this was not forwarded to you sooner) in
    terms that they had merely received this information, and
    that if we did not have a statement no doubt we would be
    obtaining it.

    I cannot quite understand what is going on, because Mr.
            |statement makes no reference whatever to his
    involvement with any individual. I wonder whether it
    might be worth checking out what if anything he did say
    to Gary*s fam ily.

    In order to assist, I enclose photocopies of the letter of
    the 26th of September 1 9 8 9 of October 1989 and 23 rd of
    October 1989.

    You^s siij^erely,

                            Thank yoi^for your letter of 18th October.

                            We ourselves do not have a statement from Mr       I. our Clients were merely
                            provided with information by the County Fire Service of Mr          | involve­
                            ment. We do not therefore know whether he has already made a statement to
                            the Police with regard to the matter, but if not, no doubt you will make
                            arrangements for a statement to be obtained.

                            Yours faithfully,

approximate          position at w h i c h            the girl       I refer was         lying.        The

posi tion      is i ndi cated by a b 1ue dat.                       I hav e signed        this    p 1an

A third       person that          I gave       first aid       to was       a white     male,       aged about

22 years,          mousey     coloured wav y hair,              medium       build,      he was wearing               very

dark    trainers,          blue    jeans,       light       coloured    short      sleeved       *T*      shirt w ith

a pocket       on the        left breast.             I remember a ten            pound note         being       in the

*T*    shirt       pocket,      it was     s t i cking      out and     I pushed         it back       in.



The man had numerous                heavy tattoos            on both arms.



I came across             this man       on the       pitch,    r e n dered first aid a n d after

failing       to    revive     him,      i left       him   in the same         position.

                   the      man      X          refer?        the    hair      is     too       dark       but    this       may       be    the       quality        of

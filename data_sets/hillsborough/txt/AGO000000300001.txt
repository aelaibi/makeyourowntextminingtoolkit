You have in the past received numerous representations about the
Hillsborough Inquest and requests for consent under section 13
of the Coroners Act 1988.             The last substantial request was last
year and was supported by numerous MPs with constituencies in the
Merseyside area.              It was refused.


Matters have been relatively quiet.                   The attached (unsigned)
letter from Mr Eddie Loyden MP invites a further inquiry by
reference to "recent disclosures made about the Hillsborough
tragedy, which had featured in certain sections of the press".


I       have     not   seen   any   such   reports   and   do   not   consider   it
appropriate to comb media publications with a view to finding
material which may or may not be the same material that Mr Loyden
has in mind.            It would be inappropriate in any event to revisit
the decision you took under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988
other than on the basis of cogent evidence in proper form.


I have therefore drafted a short reply to Mr Loyden indicating
what is required if this matter is to be seriously revisited.




S. J. WOOLER                                                          7 June, 1994

House of Commons,
London, SW1A OAA                                                   14 June, 1994




Thank you for your letter of 3 June 1994 about the inquest in
relation to the Hillsborough tragedy.


I have in the past considered numerous representations made in
relation to this case in support of applications under section
13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for ray consent to an application
being made to the High Court for an order directing a fresh
inquest.           All   those       representations        were   carefully   and
sympathetically considered but I concluded that this was not an
appropriate case for consent.


I have     not   in fact      seen    or heard     any recent media       reports
relating to this matter.             Press reports alone could not however
constitute a proper basis for me to reconsider that decision.
I could     only    do   so   on     the   basis   of   a   renewed   application
supported by significant cogent and fresh evidence.

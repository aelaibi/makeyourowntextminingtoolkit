        onto       the         terracing.                  We     started             singinc^'i'Ti tRte t u n n e l ,                      ‘'We' re        on    the

that, the      tunnel        dipped at the end                       and /ne went          to the     let i of        the

tunnel     and ended up on the                  terrace       i ta Pe/f 4.       Once      on the     terrace         I

was a b s o l u t e l y     packed.

I turned to                   and said,          " T h e r e ’s no way       I'm standing            on here      for

90 minutes".               I was   the    near the          back and saw around                 people    being

crushed and gasping                for a i r .        The    singing       had stopped and            people were

shouting       to the        police      to open the          gates and to get us out.                      All    the

time    people were           pushing      from behind and             I felt        the    pressure        getting

worse and worse,              it was      very hot,          I began to sweat a lot.                     We were

swaying        in the       crowd and g r a dually            being    pushed towards              the    front       from

beh i n d .

As the        push    continued       it began to turn               into a surge we moved                  quite

qui c k 1y to a c r ush bar rie r whe re we                    both s t o p p e d .        We were       on the

other     side,       he    turned    round and said,                " D o n ’t go under          y o u * 11 never

get up"         1 said,        "I've      got    to    I "m getting         c r u s n e d !‘.    At t nxs    o irne

the    crushing was           bad,    I was      gasping       for    breath.          i had to look up to

breathe        I thought       I 've got        to get       under    so    I ducked down under                 the

barrier       and     looked up,         it was       dark    I c o u l d n ’t see anything              I was

stuck,        people were          standing      on my       legs,    I thought          this     is it     I'm going

t o d i e the n               m l led me        up and asked me             if   I was alright.              I could

the    football        because       it was      too    packed and          1 w a n t e d to get         out.      We

were    still        being    pushed towards            the front          in a continual            surge,       the

pressure       at     this    time was       getting worse            the further           forward we were

going     the worse          the    pressure and            crushing       became.         I could see          people

a r o u n d me they         looked    tired,      out       of breath and frustrated.                     A gate at

the    front     of the       pen opened,         people were          climbing and being                 carried

over    the     fences.        The    game      had stopped by now.

             was     still with                    and we said w e ’ll get               out through that             gate at

          the front          of the      pen.       We s t r uggled     to get       to the gate*              We   got about

          3 yards          from the     fence and          I could see        people were          lying on the          floor

          of the terracing,                 the    crowd were       swaying and           treading       on each

          other      the     scene was          sheer   chaos.       The    police at the            front were         pulling

          people       out     of the       crowd.

          Two    pol icemen were             pulling       people    out    one at a time            thrjj^^h the        gate

          A young          boy aged about           10 years       old wearing           a tj/a.cksuit top          I d o n ’t

          we were          nearly out of the            gate.

                                                                                         he then fell          over    right by

          the    gate.         His     dad shouted,          "Push back,           push back       h e ’s fallen o v e r 11.

          His    dad       c o u l d n ’t get     to him.      I saw this          boys    face had turned             purple

          and    his       eyes were        open    1 think     he was      dead.         "ihen a po 1 a.c,e o f f i c.er

          pulled me out              onto    the    track,     he then went          back and        pulled this          boy

          out and          laid him on the           pitch     right     behind the          goal,    he was        joined       by

          his    dad and he was              crying.

           .iy now     I had got         out      of the    crush     I was       trying     to   recover my breath                i

          was    taking        deep breaths and then                I realised that                      was    still     in the

          pen so       I went        back    to the     fence and        looked for                      I c o u.1 d s e e

          loads      of faces ail            gasping       for fence,       some     of    them were s q u a s h e d up

          I was      still       look i ng fo r              and then saw him being                  pushed out         of the

          gate     cinder        the   outer       track.     He    then c o l lapsed onto            the floor         .behind

          the    goal.

          Ev e r y o n e    were     shouting       in f r u s t r a t i o n at    the    police,     people were            lying

          on the       pitch and         it was a chaotic            scene,        nobody knew what was                going

          on,    nobody        took     charge      or try to organise anything.

A few m inutes             later            got    up from behind the            goal     and we w a i K e d

onto     the       pitch    into the       penalty ar ea.          All   I could think aisout was

t hat    poor       little    kid.        I was    deeply shocked,          I had got my breath                 back

by now and           I started       to shout at the          police who were             standing around

doing     nothing,           I said to a young             officer,        “Why did we get           the       little

end"     he    said,        " D o n ’t blame      the    police    blame    the FA"        Then                got

his     ticket      w hich was       intact and showed             it to a reporter and              ripped          it

up    in front        of him and said,              "Show this       the world".

The     police asked us to go to the                      side,    we were       still arguing with                the

police        it was all        in the      heat    of the moment          but    I felt so frustrated.

I saw a d v e r t i s i n g     boards      being       pulled awa y from the           side and they were

being     used by supporters                as stretchers          to ferry across           the    pitch

people        who    injured and          dead.

1 w a l k e d over         to the South Stand and stood at the                      side w a t ching was

going     on.        Some Forest          supporter       began    chanting       "Cry Babies" and we

star t e d       to argue with         them.       By this    time       I realised       it was     stupid

argu i n g with them as Liverpool                       supporters were          dying,    so   j. went        to try

started        to    pull    some    fanjf\over tj^e fence.               I pulled four or five

s u p porters        o u t a 11 of t hiem w^r ? alive.

1 heard a message               over      the    tannoy    for the       pitch to be cleared anci the

supporters           to go to the N orth Stand out                  of the way.

I was     in a gony w ith my              legs    I couldn't       do anymore       I picked up a

bo a rding         there were       two    or three       people    injured on the           boarding and

six     or seven s u pporters              started to run wit h the               boarding      to the         other

end.          I had to give          up by the          half way    line    because       I was     slowing          it

down.         My    legs    gave    up on me and                  and me went and sat              in the N o r t h

Supporters          were     running       up and down the          pitch    continually and every

time   they      ran    past        us there was a loud           cheer.

It was about           4. 3 0 p m    (1630)    by now and a loud speaker a n n o u n c e m e n t                   said

the game was           being a b a n d o n e d so we decided               to   leave and try to find a

phone and        ring     home       to tell    relatives we were               safe.

there were        far too many              people    crammed      in      it was       so dangerous      and       that

was a major         factor          in my mind why these             people were          injured, and killed.

A 3.s o I t h i nk t he       po lice we r e s 1 ow t o r eac t t hey o bv i ous 1y d i dn ’t

realise what was              happening,        I couldn't         u n d e r s t a n d why the     police     lined

up across        the     half way       line,    they should have               been at     the L e p p i n g s

Lane   end helping            the     injured.        I also     saw a 1ot of           p o 1 i ce of f 1 c e rs

just   standing         around        the    penalty area        doing      nothing      they    Loo should

have   been helping             the    injured.

I w o u l d also       like     to know why the kick               off wasn't       delayed until            all

the fans      had got         in safely.

The F.A.      and      police        should    have    org a n i s e d     the m atch better, the matcri

sh o u l d have     been      played at Old T rat ford as                  they experience          of   large

crowds.       Also we         should of had the S p i o n Hop end as we                       have got more

s u p p orters    t ha n F o r eat.

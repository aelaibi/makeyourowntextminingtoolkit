PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 14 AUGUST 1989

OFFER OF RESIGNATION BY CHIEF CONSTABLE

Report of the Clerk and Financial Officer

1     Introduction
      The purpose of this report is to set out briefly the main relevant
      considerations to the Authority’s decision on whether to accept the Chief
      Constable’s offer of resignation following the publication of the Interim
      Report by the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor on the Hillsborough Stadium
      Disaster.
2     Options
2.1   Members already have a copy of the letter which the Chief Constable sent
       to the Chairman on 4 August placing his office at the disposal of the
       Authority.
2.2   The following alternative responses are available to the Authority
      (a)        To accept the offer of resignation with or without an expression
                of reluctance.
      (b)        To accept the offer of resignation (with reluctance) but to ask
                the Chief Constable to remain in post until a successor has been
                appointed and/or is in a position to take over from him.
      (c)        To accept the offer of resignation (with reluctance) but to ask
                the Chief Constable to remain in post for a specific period - for
                example until the substantial completion of the Coroner’s
                Inquest, expected to take place early in the new year.
      (d)       Not to accept the offer of resignation.
2.3   In practise there may be little difference between options (b) and (c) in
       terms of the eventual date of the Chief Constable’s resignation. Moreover
       in relation to option (d) it should be borne in mind that the Chief
       Constable having attained the age of 60 is now in a position to retire on
       full pension. His term of office as President of ACPO expires in
       September.
2.4   Whichever decision is adopted it will be essential to spell out for public
       information the underlying rationale. However, no matter how carefully
       this is done, there will be a tendency to read into the decision an
       implied degree of acceptance of the contents of the report and support for
       the Chief Constable and his Force.
3     Considerations
3.1   In reaching this decision the Authority will have regard to the following
      main factors.
      (a)     The statutory duty of the Authority to maintain anadequate    and
              efficient Police Force.
      (b)     The interests of the public of South Yorkshire.
      (c)     The effectiveness, reputation and morale of the South Yorkshire
              Police Force.
      (d)     The general public interest at a national level.
3.2   It would be presumptious of me to comment on any of these factors and the
      list is probably not exhaustive. However as some indication of the
      national dimension of the issue I attach some of the press comment
      following the publication of the report which can be seen to represent a
      wide spectrum of opinion.
4     Conclusion
      The factors outlined in paragraph 3 are closely interlinked and in giving
      as they must prime consideration to their statutory duty as expressed in
      3.1(a), the Authority may in effect be reflecting the balance of arguments
      under items (b) to (d). I suggest therefore that the overriding
      consideration must be which of the options set out in paragraph 2 best
      serves the maintenance of an adequate and efficient Police Force.

                 Gr *o S ■8°!
             E DIDN’T set out to “apportion blam e”: but, by

   H         golly, he seem s to have m anaged it. Only hours
             after the Taylor report on the Hillsborough trag­
     edy, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire w as offer­
     ing his resignation. It should be prom ptly accepted.
     Lord Justice Taylor w as clearly appalled not just by the
     slop of police organisation at the ground but by the ini­
     tial blustering m endacity of sen ior officers in his wit­
    ness box. We pay our police, well, to m aintain high stan­
    dards o f truth, organisation and efficiency. There is no
    benefit w h atsoever in shrugging benignly w hen they
    tall so far below those standards. Of course the British
    w ay is that good chaps with a distinguished record
    should be given the benefit o f the doubt. But if the point
    o f the inquiry, and indeed of its 43 action points, is to
    prevent a tragic repetition, there is an im perative to *
    demonstrate that the South Yorkshire police perfor-
    mande; at the highest levels, w as abysmal.
          That does not, though, m ean that police m ust carry
    the entire can o f blame, w hilst all other parties walk
   aw ay sm iling. On the contrary, in a notably thoughtful
   set o f interim findings, Lord Justice Taylor contrives to
   paint a rounded picture full of reality. Sheffield W ednes­
   day Football Club, for all their pride in Hillsborough,
   had not kept a constant eye on safety. Poor signposting;
                  ^or access to the ground and the terraces,
   bhem eld City Council w as dozy, too, in monitoring
   these things. And there were som e drunken hooligans of
   fan$ who contributed the melee w hich contributed to
   the tragedy. On a day filled with horror most things that
   should have worked didn’t.
         The level of the incom petence, in fact, is well dem ­
   onstrated by som e of the 43 remedies. Football m atches
   with more than 5,000 spectators should have at least on?
   ambulance in attendance; and a doctor. There "is a kin­
   dergarten air to such prescriptions. And yet, damningly,
   Taylor finds them necessary, solem n words on solem n
   paper. The m ore controversial, or expensive, recom ­
   mendations are, of course, the ones that will catch the
   headlines. M andatory low er lim its on the num bers who
  can be packed into terraces; stew ards or police dedi­
  cated to crowd safety; ample escape routes through
  wider gates from behind perim eter fences; enough turn­
  stiles to cope; an absolute ban on entry to grounds, or
  areas of grounds, once a strictly delineated and elec­
  tronically monitored capacity has been reached.
        Every suggestion (high praise) is both practical and
  swiftly im plem entable. The broader debate about all­
  seat grounds and n ew stadium s will have to wait until
  next year, and the full report. But the instan t business
 of making football as safe as possible for a season only a
 fortnight aw ay has been pu nctiliously fulfilled.
        And yet, at the end, you are still nagged by at least
 one wider question. Why should the British police, as a
 matter o f w eary routine, week in and week out, have to
 deploy them selves inside and outside football grounds
 to a m ilitary schedule? Why did they, w hen there w as
 tumult on the terraces, gather to forestall a pitch inva­
 sion rather than save lives? One kn ow s why. Only days
 after Hillsborough, before the shock at 94 lives lost had
 abated, youths at other grounds were fighting and in ­
 vading again as though Sheffield had n ever existed. The
 vast majority o f Liverpool fans, like the vast majority of
fans everyw here, em erge w ithout blame from Taylor.
But we live in a society w here our national gam e (com ­
pare and contrast the United States) is a battle ground.
Safety — w hatever the precautions — is only a part of
that story. There is a discom m oding tendency in succes-
sive reports to see a problem — drink inside, drink out­
side — shuttleil back and forth like a bit o f sticking plas-
ter. There is also a relentless w eighting of costs on to
clubs       [or extra police, stewards, electronic devices
emptier terraces, identity cards — w hich will inevitably
hasten its decline. That ought to be faced squarely too.

inadequacy should be exposed.
     Mr Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South York­
shire, has acted in the best traditions of his service in
offering to resign, even though the criticism is of his
subordinates — for their preparations, their conduct
when disaster struck and their bearing at the inquiry.
For the police in Sheffield, this is the most ignom ini­
ous day since the “ Rhino whip” scandal of the mid-
1960s which cost a previous chief constable his job.
     Thus far, Lord Justice Taylor has handled the
issues arising from the disaster with laudable com ­
mon sense. His recommendations for averting a
recurrence during the new football season, which
begins in a fortnight, should be acted upon by the
clubs without cavil; indeed many have anticipated his
proposals. A further report will deal with the broader
issues — of coping with late influxes of supporters; of
dealing with the minority who persist in arriving at
the ground in a drunken and uncontrollable state; of
the relevance and practicability of the Government’s
identity card scheme; and of whether completely new
stadiums are needed for matches of this importance.
If that report is as soundly based, it should be res­
ponded to as readily.

 You will now have received a copy of the Report of the Inquiry conducted
 toy Lord Justice Taylor into the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.
 The Report levels a number of criticisms at members of the South Yorkshire
 Police and indicates that the police handling of events was a contributory
 factor to the disaster that occurred.

 You will recall that at the meeting of the Police Authority on 21 April I
 made a statement in which I accepted full responsibility for police action
 in connection with the event.

  In the light of Lord Justice Taylor's findings I have decided to offer my
  resignation to the Committee in order that members can review my position
  as Chief Constable. Accordingly my Office is now at the disposal of the
  Committee.

  I have forwarded a copy of this letter to R C Johnston, Clerk to the South
  Yorkshire Police Authority.

             Dear Member
             OFFER OF RESIGNATION BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE
             Further to my letter of 8 August I enclose a further item of press comment
             which appeared in the Sheffield Star on Monday.
             I also enclose copies of letters which have been received by the Chairman or
             myself addressed to the Police Authority as such. I would add that it may
             well be that there is further correspondence in the GPO at Rotherham
             awaiting collection which is prevented by the NALGO action.
             Yours sincerely

    Lessons that
      must be
     acted upon
 THE report by Lord Justice Taylor into the
 Hillsborough Stadium disaster puts Sheffield
 in the dock.
    It damns South Yorkshire Police for a
 breakdown of control; it indicts Sheffield City
 Council as inefficient and dilatory; and it
 accuses Sheffield W ednesday of failing to act
 on capacity problem s at the Leppings Lane
 end of the ground.
    In other words, all the blam e for the
 tragedy is laid at Sheffield's door.
    But the interim report reserves its clearest
 and most damning criticism for South York­
 shire Police. It presents a catalogue of errors.
    Chief Constable Peter Wright has tendered
 his resignation. When m em bers of the South
 Yorkshire Police Authority meet on August 14,
 they should accept it.
     Peter Wright is an honourable man who
  has had a brilliant ca reer and who has
! behaved with utmost dignity since the tragedy
  in April.
     He has consistently said he would shoulder
 the executive responsibility for the actions of
 his officers, and he has said he fully accepted
 th efind ing sand conclusions of the inquiry.
               Enormousjob to do
      In those circumstances the police authority
  has no choice and should accept his offer to
  go.
      It is significant that Lord Justice Taylor's
  report dwells most on the behaviour of senior
i officers, c a llin g into question le a d e rs h ip
! qualities and the wisdom of pre-match plan­
  ning decisions.
   It says 65 police officers gave oral evi­
 dence, and that the quality of their evidence
 was in inverse proportion to their rank.
    Collectively, Sheffield now has an enor­
 mous job to do. With the city bidding to
 become one of the w orld’s major sporting
 centres, confidence has got to be rebuilt and
 w e have to prove our commitment to the task
 ahead.
    The findings of the interim report have to
 be faced squarely, and if difficult decisions
 have to be m ade as a result, so be it. Respon­
 sibilities in all quarters, from police, to
 council, to club, cannot be avoided.
      The re has also got to be a fundamental new
j approach to the whole business of football,
  and that involves everyone from fans to
  s o c c e r a d m i n i s t r a t o r s , a n d th e c l u b s
  themselves.
    Ninety-five lives w ere lost on the terraces
 of Hillsborough. The least w e can do is to
 make sure their memorial is the knowledge
 that lessons have not only been learned, but
.acted upon for the future.                      ,

     Dear Mr Chairman

     This Chamber of Trade wishes to advise you of its support for the Chief
     Constable of South Yorkshire, Peter Wright, following the issue of the Interim
     Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster inquiry by the Rt Eon Lord
     Justice Taylor.                                  !

     We feel that South Yorkshire can ill afford to lcj>se the services of a Police
     Officer with the integrity of Hr Wright at this time.

     Whilst it is public knowledge that Mr Wright is prepared to submit his
     resignation as a result of the criticisms of the'Police handling of the crowd,
     we trust that your Committee in the interests of (South Yorkshire, will not
     aocept it.

     Yours since

   Dear Jack                                 |
                                             j

   Just a note for the record that I believte your Committee      snould
   not accept the resignation of Peter Wrign^..

   This would riot, be a solution to the problems that occurred in
   that tragic event in Hillsborough.      I jindicated on Yorkshire
   Television that if public opinion was fpr retribution then you
   will sack the Chief Constable, but if itjwants to find solutions
   to complex problems, then Peter Wright wijll be asked to continue
   to be part of what will hopefully be a national team trying to
   find solutions to these complex problems!.    1 also believe that
   taking a wider view of Police operations,! it would be in the best

   THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

   The Executive Committee of this Association have discussed' Lord Justice
   Taylor’s Final Report on the circumstances surrounding the tragedy at
   Hillsborough.

   In general we welcome the Report.         Our concern has always been the
   prevention of a repetition of tragedy.   By describing so clearly the nature
   of the sport of football in this country, Lord Justice Taylor has given
   hope.   Me d o , however, note that his report is but the last of many.
   Perhaps the football industry will be made to take note of this one!

   Naturally the Report’s recommendations are often drafted in general terms.
   In particular we would wish to draw to your attention recommendations 70 and
   71 concerning offences. We entirely support these proposals for the reasons
   set out so clearly in the Report.     In particular we recommended in written
   a n d .oral evidence the need for legislation to deal with ticket touts. In
   connection with recommendation 71(iii)» however, we are concerned about the
   use of the word "pitch”. Recently we have been told of invasions by unruly
   spectators onto race course tracks and indeed invasion of a boxing ring
   followed by an assault on one of the competitors.          I am not a legal
   draftsman, but I do urge that "pitch" be so defined as to include any area
   or enclosure at a designated sports ground used or intended for the use of
   participants in the sport.

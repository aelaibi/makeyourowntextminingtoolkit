           On Saturday 15th April            1989    (150489)    I was on duty at Sheffield

           W e d n e s d a y ’s Football   ground f<?r the F .A.      cup semi-final    between

           Liverpool and Nottingham F o r e s t \ I was part                    Serial 2 , the officers

           i)\ charge of the serial were              Inspector DARLING,        shjt COX and Sgt.
                 n
           HEMMINGWAY.        I was partnered with PC 2417 ROTCHEbl^ and our^duties were

           in the lower portion of the South Stands
                                                 x
           At about 11.45am (1145) together with PCN^OTCHELL,                      TURNER and ROBERTS

           we initially tookN^p position on the tur nst rikgs directly behind the

           Police Cont ro 3. bo;<. T nKsu? were the turnstiles admitting Nottingham

           Forest fans,       these turnstiles were at the junction of the South Stand-

           West Stand so only a matter of yards from where we were stood

           Liverpool     fans were gathering on the corner terrace there appeared

           to be no bad feeling between either set of fans.
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                SI 842

At about 2.40 pm (1440) Sgt. HEMMINGUftV^ i nst ru>Vftd\ PC RQTCHELL and

myself to go into the         lower portion seats of the South Stands by i t ’s

junction with the West Stand corner terracing as Liverpool                  fans had

been climbing from the terracing             into the seats we remained      there up

to the match kicking off.

As the match kicked off I became aware of            Police Activity by the

Perimeter fencing directly behind thegoals              in front of the      West

Stands.     As more Police began to arrive PC ROTCHELL climbed down from

his position and went to assist,            I followed about a minute       later.     By

t h e time I had got onto the pitch a Police Officer              had already run

onto the p ^ c h and stopped the match'."

I ran to the ferhs^ywhere           casualties were be'Kjg passed through a gate

and assisted       in carrying casualties to a temporary first aid post

which had been set up at the corner flag by the South Stand-West Stand

By this time there were a lot of Police            in attendance,       I saw a serial

gtxnng into a section of terracing towards where the casualties were,

by thiV^time       I had lost my serial,      so I followed this serial       into the

ter ra ci ng .    At first we were working together with the Liverpool               fans

in carrying       casualties who were Bsing passed over a high dividing

fence,    to a ga\e g iv i ng \ac cess to the^gitch,      other     people on the pitch

were then r e c e iv irujst hese casualties and carrying them onto the pitch.

I had carried about f ou?sS£.eo pi e to this gate t^ien Inspector DARLING,

who was on the perimeter track,            saw me and     told me      toclimb intothe

next enclosure where most of the casualties had               been. I climbed        into

the enclosure and all         I could see was people stackea^WQree and four-

deep,    they    were   very blue   in colour and seemingly dead,        i saw a PC

who I know by sigPf^from E c c l e H i e 1d Police Station, giving mouth to
                                             I   A
mouth  to a man.  I joined him and g^ive heart massage to him, we

carried this on for several minutes and there was no pulse.                  Liverpool

fans who were with us,         said that we should try and help someone else
                                                                                      PAGE        C
                                                                                      81842

               becauseNthe man was dead.       Th^y picked him up and passed him over the

^       b77C   div jading fe^ce to the other fansN^ho carried him away.

         4o    * then        another PC giving mouth to mouth to another m a n , I gave

fcua_          heart massage to him,    but he had no pulse and his chin was blue in
vji        -(o
            ,  colour.     It was at this time that I saw a man,    covered by dead bodies

Po             sitting up,    I gathered Some fans together and we extracted him from

               the pile of bodies,    he was apparently unhurt b u t xin shock some fans

               walked him arounc

               There w^s still a pile of bodies,      blue in colour laid out by the

               perimeter fence,    together with officers and fans we lifted these

               people over the dividing fence and they were carried away by fans at

               the other side.

               I then assisted in helping some injured fans down to a gate and onto

               the pitch.     There were by now no more casualties    in this enclosure and

               I remained there for a short while with other officers.         It was at

               this time that I became aware of fans in the West stand seats,

               shouting and being abusive at the Police.       I then saw several officers

               from my    serial grouping on the pitch so I went and joined them.          From

               there    I assisted in carrying casualties to waiting ambulances and also

               to console and advise shocked and distressed people wandering on the

               pitch.     It was at this time that a Liverpool fan stopped me and said

               that he was going fto get, a petition up to complain about the F .A.

               handling of things.     He said that he h a d n ’t got a ticket, and h e ’d got

               into the ground,    he then walked off and I continued to assist with

               shocked fans.     During this   period I saw several Liverpool fans keep

               asking various Police Officers why someone had opened the

               gates and let fans in.     Some of the fans were shouting at Police

               Officers and were obviously extremely upset.

               Once    people were cleared from the pitch our serial were instructed

               to sit in the North Stands and await further orders.         It was from
                                                                        PAGE
  *                                                                     S184E

         there that our serial was stood down at about 6pm <1800).

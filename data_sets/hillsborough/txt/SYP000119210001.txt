                 12 midday outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, detached from serial for

                 public order/coach reception on Leppings Lane.

                 At this time already fans outside ground drinking from cans of beer

                 in street.     All advised regarding entry into ground.       (This continued

                 all the time I was on duty on Leppings Lane,         some fans stopped

                 drinking most continued,      though too many individual incidents, to

                 list).   Touts also operating continually.

                 2.00   p.m.   returned to turnstiles with serial.      Immediatily turned

                 away approximately five Liverpool fans who smelled strongly of

                 intoxicants.      More people gradually turning up but not busy.

                 (3)

                 2.30 p.m.     at this time smell of alcohol very strong all around,

                 instigated 'breath testing'      in certain cases.     (Fans who looked or

ground,   between now and 2.45 p.m.    quite a lot turned away smelling of

drink.    Includes one lad of about 18 and younger brother who was seen

to get very upset when refused e n t r y ) .

2.40 P.M.     raucous shouting and chanting of Liverpool fans intimidating

even though coming from some distance away,         coming towards Leppings

Lane turnstiles, down Leppings Lane.           (Sound of either a drunken mob

or high spirits,    difficult to tell which).

2.45   p.m.   sudden arrival of innumerable Liverpool fans^liSSidn't see

the resulting crush develop as it happened that quickly from kneeling

down to search someone by the time I stood up, a serious crush had

developed on the turnstiles.                                                     ;

I was now unable to search or check for alcohol due to crush of

people. The situation was now very dangerous, young children,            old

persons etc. were in very real danger of fainting and/or being                   j


crushed at the turnstiles.      The crowd did not respond at all to

repeated shouts by myself to move back and ease the pressure.

In light of situation at (4) went through turnstiles and sought out

supervisory officers to appraise them of situation.           Informed

Inspector Bennett     (FI), an Inspector from F2, who I don't know and an

unknown Sergeant of the situation outside the turnstiles.           People

were now coming through stiles in a state of partial faint,          stating

"Some o n e’s going to die out th ere,” etc.

infuriated members of public.

Youths were visible climbing over the wall above the West Stand

Leppings Lane end.      (This had also been apparent since about 2.30 or

2.45     when youths were first seen climbing onto the walls dividing the

North and West Stands entrance).           I apprehended one youth of about 14-

15 who had just jumped down from the wall, but was told by

supervision,    I c a n ’t remember who,    to release him.

(9)

The noise and commotion from outside was continually getting worse,

it was apparent that someone or more likely several people, would get

seriously injured if something was not done quickly*

The gates were then opened at the West Stand,          I saw approximately
                                                                                     I
2,000 fans upwards rush through the gates straight into the tunnel

leading into the West Stand.       There was a solid mass of people

streaming in for what seemed like a long time maybe a minute.              Anyone

in front had no option but to go forward straight down the tunnel due

to the mass of people pushing them from behind.           Those at the sides

could have broken off, but d i d n ’t appear to.

( 11)

I immediately went outside and rejoined my serial on the turnstiles

outside the North Stand,      Leppings Lane end.      There were now virtually

no fans outside the turnstiles,       I would say only about twenty.         For

the first time I heard the public address system asking fans              'to

move back at Leppings Lane end'.

Police Sergeant 408 Whitlam shouted out something like,              "COME ON FANS

ON THE PITCH," after a message he had heard on his personal radio.

      immediately the left hand side of the West Stand, as you face it.            It

      then became fully apparent what had happened.       We were tol<f^o form a

      line to push people back so others could get to those in the central

      portion.     I tried for some time but it was almost futile as too many

      people were ignoring and pushing from behind.

      (15)

      I looked up and saw a young boy who looked about 12, who was green

      and obviously dead, being hauled over the central fencing behind the

      goal.

      d6)

      At this I felt I had to help other people who may have a chance,

      still    in the central section,   so I climbed over the security fencing

      into the central section of the West Stand to help.          At this time

      there were still too many people in the central section to be able to

      move properly and administer first aid correctly.           I then checked

      pulses of casualties/bodies etc.       I helped with what emergency first

      aid I could,    I removed bodies   (too many to remember any details),       I

      passed some over^the fence to other officers.       I also prioritised the

      evacuation of casualties who still had pulses wherever possible.             I

      was helped by many Liverpool supporters initially,          as there were not

O
            many officers in the central section initially, however,     some were

             still obstructive,   only three or four though.   The majority were

             excellent in that they did what they were told to and as such, we

             were able to get some casualties out quicker than without

             assistance.   There was no room to give mouth to mouth as the room it

             would take up would have meant there would not have beeft enough room

             to remove/aid other casualties.

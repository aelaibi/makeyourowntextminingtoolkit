      Dear Mr Sharp

      HILLSBOROUGH - ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE, MR WALTER JACKSON
      Thank you for your letters of 3 and 6 September and your most helpful
      comments when we spoke on the telephone early last week. My original
      proposal was for members to consider Mr J a c k s o n ’s case at their meeting last
      Friday but as a result of what we discussed, that proposal was shelved.
      Having put all sides of the case to the members last Friday, there emerged a
      general view that there was merit in dealing with all cases arising out of
      Hillsborough in the same way. Of course you are aware the particular issue
      is whether the disciplinary matters should be left until after the inquests
      and particularly the balance that has to be struck between the possibility
      of further evidence emerging from the inquests and the effect on officers
      delaying a decision until after their conclusion, which could be February at
      the earliest. The Authority therefore resolved to defer further
      consideration of Mr J a c k s o n ’s case to allow me to consult with the Police
      Complaints Authority. I am aware that a meeting is to take place on 18
      October between senior officers in the South Yorkshire Force and
      to consider the implications of this.
      I shall be reporting further to the Authority at its meeting on 19 October
      and if a decision is taken then to deal with Mr J a c k s o n ’s case without
      awaiting the outcome of the inquests, I anticipate that a special meeting of
      the Authority will be called within the following two weeks.
The Authority further resolved last Friday to request you to address them
Investigating Officer whenever it is they decide to consider Mr J a c k s o n ’s
case in detail and therefore perhaps we can speak during the day of 18
October to generally update ourselves and if it be appropriate, consider
your availability during the following fortnight.
Yours sincerely




R C Johnston
Clerk and Financial Officer

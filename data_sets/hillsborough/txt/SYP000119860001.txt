              After        briefing           and    packed meal             at     Hillsborough                myself        and      other

              officers          of      the    serial       made      our     way        on       foot    to W a d s 1 ey B r i d g e          Railway

              s u p p o r t e r s , who        we w e r e     detailed             to    escort          down      to '.the- L e p p i n g s      Lane

              area        of   the      football          ground.           Th e    train          1 u n d e r s t a n d was         to a r r i v e        at

              approximately               S.00       pm.     We w e r e        in       p o s i t i o n at      the     station         at

              approximately               1 1 . 3 0 am.          On    the w a l k           up    from      the    football           ground         to

              the        railway        station       I noticed             that        all       the    public       houses         had     thei r

              front        windows        boarded          up and       appeared              to    be    closed.

               I was       standing           with    other       officers              at    the       entrance        to     the     rai .1.w a y

              istation         n e ar    to    the    road,       I saw a           constant             stream       of     fans      walking

              down       the    hill      towards          the    ground,           I also          s a w as       many      fans      walking         up

              hill       away     from        the    ground.           As    the        time       passed       the     number         of    fans

              walking          in b o t h      directions             increased,              I also         realised         that      t he      fans

              walking          downhill         were       carrying          cans        of       beer    not      ju s t    oris or        two    but

              1/S      doz     or m o r e *         I then       realised           that          the    -fans w a l k i n g      up    hill       were
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       R347

probably         looking             for    an    outlet           to    purchase           alcohol.            After        a while

myself       a n d PC          S9E9 Bennett              a n d PC        -1429 B a s h f o r t h        were        detailed           by

Insp.      Ellis          to    cross       the     road and             pay a t t e n t i o n       to    the       other        side

because         it w a s        really       getting              busy.         We    moved and           were       standing           next

to a    public:           house       called        'The R a i l w a y '             the    front       door        was     closed and

the w i n d o w s         boarded          up.      I then          saw a fan              walking        down       to     the    ground

he w a s       carrying          IS    cans       of B u d        Weiser         beer,        in his       right          hand     he w a s

carrying         8    cans,          he w a s     holding           them        with       the     plastic          straps        with

which      the* cans            were       held    together,               in his          left     hand       he    had 4        cans,

3 held         by the          plastic       strap and              th e    fourth          one     was    open and             he w a s

drinking         from          it.     I remember               this       well       because        I like          drinking           Bud

Weiser       and      I made          a mental           no t e     that        he m u s t       have     money       to     b u r n as         it

is e x p e n s i v e       at    £2.65        per       4    cans.

Myself       and P C s           Bennett          and B as h fo r th             had       occasion        to s p e a k       with          a

drunken        fan who           was       legless          sat     on     the w a l l        outside          'The R a i l w a y ’

public       h o u s e , we          left    him        in the          custody        of at        least       "l/E doz          of    his

mates.

As   the     fans         walked       down       the       hill        towards        Hillsborough,                 I. n o t i c e d       one

or   two     turn         left       down    the        side       of    "The Railway''.                  We    followed           and

went    into         the       back    yard       of     th e      public        house        and    saw       that       the     back

door    wa s     open and             that       the     place was              full       of L i v e r p o o l      fans

drinking.             A    man       who     I assumed             to     be    the    lan d lo r d was ou ts i de                in        the

backyard.             I    o v e r h e rad       him        say    to    other        officers          " I ’m not          letting

anymore         in b e c a u s e       they're           getting           rough."            We    took       up    ou r    position

back    on      the m a i n          road.

At   approximately                   1.50    pm the           train        arrived          and     I made          my w ay       back

over    to      the       railway          station,           I would           say    that        a group          of 8 0 0      to 3 3 0

Liverpool            fans       got    off       th e    tr a i n ,      I searched              a few and           with       other

foot    officers               and    mounted           officers           we    escorted           them       down       towards           the

                                                                                                                                               R347

The     fans     were       in a g o o d m o o d              and       caused              no       problems        none          I could          see

were      drunk,          in f a c t      I looked across                        the        road       towards          other        fans          w ho

had     not     come       by    train,         and were             drinking                   from     cans       and     walking            all

over      the    road,          I thought            that       we    were             escorting              the    wrong          fans.           The

f ans     were       escorted          u p to        the      turnstiles                    at L e p p i n g s       Lane       where          they

made      their       way       to   enter.           I saw a               large           number          of     other       fans       sat       on

the     bridge        parapet          and      on    the       road and                pavement              across          from       the

turnstiles,               these      fans       were       making            no a t t e m p t            to      gain     entrance             to       the

ground.

As    time      passed          a Liverpool               fan      spoke           to       Insp.        Ellis       whom          I was

standing         next       to,      th e      fan    indicated                  that           he    had     just       purchased             a

ticket        from a y o un gster                   and    he w a n t e d              to       know     if      it w a s      a forgery.

The     ticket        was       bright         yellow         in     colour,                a    c h e ck     revealed             that       indeed

it w a s      a forgery.               The      man       said       that          the          youngster           was       selling          them

on a n o t h e r      road and            that       he w a s        surrounded                      by o t h e r    fans          buying          them.

The     fans were           arriving            in g r e a t e r            numbers              and Le ppings                Lane       was

becoming         choc — a — b l o c k , a m a n               came          up     to me             stating        that       he       was    a

Liverpool            fan     but     he     had      purchased               a ticket                 for     the N o t t i n g h a m f o r e s t

end, but        wished          to   ge t      in the L i v e r p o o l                 end.            I informed             him       that        it

would      be    impossible               to    do    so.          1 heard an                    instruction              from          Irtsp.

Ellis      to m o v e        on all         the      f a ns     who         did        not       have       tickets,           this       we

started         to    do.        I saw again               that         a    large              number        of    fans       were       sti l l

sat     o n the       bridge          parapet         and       across             the          road m a k in g          no    attempt             to

gain      en t ry .        The       crowd      thickened and                      a    constant              number          of    fans       were

asking        for     directions               to    th e N o r t h          and        West          stands        and       for       standing

o n ly.       I could           only      just       see      the       signs           at       the      respective               turnstiles

bobbing         heads.           A    lot      of    fans       were         milling                 about       unsure        about          which

O n a wall         above         the      turnstiles,             I saw a senior                    officer          he     was      lifting

fans    up out          of    the        crowd      and     o nt o     the     w a ll ,      I could        not        understand

why,    I had heard                 no    radio message,                1 am a          community           constable                and

carried my           own      radio        but      ha d    not       been     able       to    hear       it       in t h e        crowd.

A Land Rover               came      with       a   loud        hailer       on     the      roof,     I n s p , Ellis               took

the m i c r o p h o n e       and        attempted          to    sort       ou t      the     fans.

At    2«30     pm the         crowd         increased            and    I believed              at    that          time       that       the

kick    off w o u l d         surely           be   put     back       to a l l o w       the       remaining             farts

inside.           The      fans      were       still       being       lifted          up     by the       senior             officer

onto    the w a ll.

A    short    while          after        3.00      pm     I heard        the       roar       of    the    crowd           I then

realised          that       th e    game       had      kicked        off,       but     there       were          still       a very

large       group       of    fans        at    the      turnstiles            in L e p p i n g s      Lane.              Fans       were

still       asking         for      directions             to    their       respective              turnstiles.

A    short    time         later         1 was      instructed            to      go    towards        the          concertina               type

gate    to    the       right        of    the      turnstile.               On arrival              there          outside          the

gate    I saw a            number         of    injured          fans     lying         on     the    ground.               1 also           saw

two    people        lying          head       to   head with           their          faces        covered          with       a

blanket.           I realised              that       they were           dead.           fans       started           to      c om e     out

of    the    ground a number                    were       very       abusive          towards        us,       I    could          not

understand           for      what        r ea s o n ,     X did       not     know what             had    happened.

Then    the       f i re     brigade           arrived          and    started          carrying           in       cutting

equipment          into       the        ground,         the     ambulances             arrived        we       were        instructed

to k e e p    the       area        clear       for      the     emergency             services.            Some          of    the

injured were               tended         by P o l i c e        Officers,           the      fans     were          s t il l

coining out          of      the     concert!na             gates       and       obstructing              the       passage            of

emergency          vehicles.               With       other       officers             1 was        directed           inside           the

ground       to    stop       fans        from      using        the    gate.           A number           of       fans       w e re     still

                 As   time    passed and     the    f a ns   dispersed,       eventually       with    other   officers

                 we m a d e   our   way   back   to W a d s 1ey B r i d g e   to   see   off   the    train.

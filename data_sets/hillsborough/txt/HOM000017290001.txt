Dear Minister

              know, one of the recommendations of the Public Inquiry led by Mr Justice
j^pplewell into the Bradford fire, was the importance of access to the pitch in
an emergency.                   “
T K e r e f o r e without prejudice to any future inquiry concerning the events on
Saturday at Hillsborough, will your Department now implement Mr Justice
Popplewell’s findings by ordering the immediate removal of all barriers at sports
stadia of the type behind which the crowd was trapped.

Yours sincerely

MARY TAYLOR

    PHILIP HOCSON



    Police Constable 42



    On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was engaged on football duty at Sheffield

    for the sard final football match between Nottingham Forest and

    Liverpool Football Club at the Hillsborough Stadium.     My scale of duty

    commenced at 8am at Barnsley DHQ.

    The serial I was attached to was 'D' Division serial 16, which

    consisted of other officers.                .

    PS 2379 Swift    '

    PC 42 Hooson (self)

    PC 803 Tattershall

    PC 3198 Akred

    PC 2083 Packer

    PC 12 Taylor

    PC 1368 Mackenzie

    PC 1453 Phillips

    PC 2185 Cooper
#   We all travelled to West Bar Police Station by transit van and paraded

    there for briefing at 9am.     Chief Inspector King conducted the

    briefing, Superintendent Bates was officer in charge.

    After briefing, personal radios were issued, one radio between two

    officers, but it was found that there wasn’t enough radios to go

    round.   So myself and PC Tattershall teamed up with PS Swift having

    one radio between the three of us.     We were then joined by two

    officers frctn the HQ Drug Squad, who were attached to our serial

    working in uniform, one of whan was PC 3211 Priestley.     Tiie ether Drug




                                                                                    232
Squad officers name I don't know.   We were each given a packed lunch.

Our allotted duty was to attend at Midland Station and escort the

Notts Forest fans and Liverpool fans who would be arriving by train,

separate them at the station and put than on a number of double decked

PSV's provided by South Yorkshire Transport.     After the fans were

placed in their respective buses they were transported to the

Hillsborough Stadium being escorted by 2 PC's per PSV.     Then

marshalled off the buses and into the stadium.     The PC's would then

return to the Midland Station.   We attended at the Midland Station and

commenced our duties at 10am that date.

My serial remained at the station all the time, not travelling with

any of the football fans on the PSV's.

All the fans who arrived at the station were well behaved and co­

operated with our requests.   All appeared to be decent, genuine

football fans fran both teams.   There were exceptions when one or two

of the younger element fran both Notts Forest and Liverpool Tried to

get through the cordon and into the city and using all sorts of

reasons.    The snooker tournament being one of them.

Each of these were searched and when football tickets were found on

them they were sent to their respect PSV's without patting up much

argument.   This was the way in which my serial dealt with the fans

filtering the non-fans through the station gates, but the vast

majority did what they were requested to do.     There were no unpleasant

situations at the station, everything was good humoured having a laugh

and a joke with seme of the fans fran both sides.

At about 2.25pm we were informed by the British TransportPolice        that

all the expected football fans who were travelling by train had

arrived at Midland Station and that they were not aware of any large
                                  - 3 -




groups of fans still being in the rail system.

In view of this my serial along with other officers frcrn other serials

boarded the PSV's at Midland Station and were transported to the

Hillsborough Stadium. ,

The route taken by the driver of the PSV in which we were travelling

took us along Middlewood Road past Hillsborough Park and right into

Leppings Lane.    I noticed that there were large crcwds of people,

walking along Leppings Lane towards the football ground.    These people

were walking on the pavements and into the road on both sides of

Leppings Lane.    As we neared the corner of the road where the entrance

road is to the turnstiles at Leppings Lane, the area was completely

swamped with football fans.    I could only see Inspector Sykes who was

standing on the corner to the entrance and he was totally surrounded

with Liverpool fans.   It   was like a sea of faces in that area

stretching frcm half way along the pavement from the junction with

Vere Road and well past Gate C at the Leppings Lane turnstile.     This

area of the turnstiles was wall to wall people who seemed to be packed

into that area.    I could see several fans climbing over the top of the

gate.   I did not see any Police Officers in this area, unless they

were lost in the sea of people.     I could see two mounted officers who

were completely surrounded also and were quite obviously struggling to

control this crowd of fans.    It would be fair to say that this area at

this time was totally congested with fans trying to get into the

ground at these turnstiles and still more large numbers of fans were

converging on Leppings Lane frent the direction of Penistone Road and

Middlewcod Road.

Kith difficulty the driver of the bus in which we were travelling

rranaoed to work a way thiough the fani maxing thtii way along lappings




                                                                           234
Lane frcrn the direction of Penistone Road, towards the turnstiles at

the rear of the West Stand.   I could hear on other officers radios

that officers at the Leppings Lane turnstiles were shouting for

assistance.   I couldn't make out any specific request only calls for

assistance and more mounted officers to attend at this location.

I have worked football duty at Hillsborough Stadium on more than

several occasions during my service including a number of semi finals/

but I have never seen such a large number of fans at the Leppings Lane

end at that time cf day, the area was totally over-run.   This would

have been at 2.50pm.

At about 2.55pm we arrived outside the gates to the North Stand in

Penistone Road and debused.   My serial went straight into the

gymnasium where we were to be held on standy as a reserve serial.      We

managed to get a hot drink and were just about to eat our packed

lunches, having only been seated for a matter of a minute when

Sergeant Swift told us we had to leave because we were required on the

track in front of the West Stand.   We immediately left the gymnasium

and went into the playing area of the stadium.   This was before 3pm

because as we en:ered the playing area I saw players fran both teams

on the football pitch warming up.

We walked along the track in front of the North Stand towards the West

Stand and when passing sane fans in the North Stand I heard sane of

them "hissing".   As we made our way along the track, there was no

indication to us at this time, that anything was wrong in the West

Stand of the stadium.

My serial at this time, including myself consisted of PS Swift, PC

Tattershall, PC McKenzie, PC Akred, PC Taylor, PC Packer and PC

Cooper.
We reached the comer of the track between the North Stand and the

West Stand and without looking too carefully I got the impression that

the area was not as full as the West Stand appeared to be.    As we

began walking along the track in front of the West Stand the noise was

deafening.    The whole stadium seemed to be shouting but I didn't take

any particular notice at this time, this sort of behaviour not being

unusual for a game of this importance. _PC Packer was in front of roe

at this time.    As we made our way further along the track towards the

South Side I began to sense something was not quite right. I could

see at this time that there were already three other.Policemen

standing on the track in front of us.    As I neared Gate 4 I realised

that the people in the West Stand were not shouting but were

screaming.    I realised then that something was seriously wrong and I

heard people in the crowd screaming "let us out," "Oh God.help us."          I

looked at the people in the crowd and I could see by their faces and

that people were crushed up against the fencing that they were clearly

in a desperate situation.    I immediately grabbed the officer on the

track and asked him to get sane assistance to us.    I knew that I had

to open the gate to get people out even if it meant getting a

bollocking.     I can remember thinking "If you're wrong Phil lad,

you'll get a right bollocking for this."    I then went straight to Gate

4 at the fence behind the goal posts and shouted to Sergeant Swift who

was a number of yards away fran my position to my right: "I'm opening

the gate" and I opened the gate.    PC 3198 Akred was with me at this

time.

On opening the gate, the crush was so great that the people behind the

safety fencing.in this stand could not move to free themselves.       With

PC 3198 Akred"! immediately began“pulling people out frcm the crcwd -
and through the gate and on to the track.    Most of the people that we

pulled out initially were able to walk and did not have any apparent

serious injuries. Each and every person that we pulled out frcm Pen 4

took a great deal of physical effort, not one of them came out easy.

Each one was trapped in one way or another by various parts of their

body.

After a short while at Gate 4 we were joined by Sergeant Swift and we

continued to pull these people free.    On more than several occasions

jackets, pullovers, shirts etc were ripped on peoples backs in the

effort to free them.

There was no doubt that the people in the stand were desperate for

their lives.     The best description would be to say that people were

drowning in a sea of people.     All the faces that I saw at the front

were pale, grey, white or blue all with panic and pain written all

over them.     The people at the front couldn't scream for help only

stare, screaming at your with their eyes.     There were many whose eyes

wsre closed.

Whilst we were standing at the gate, I could see two men on the floor

at the gate opening, we were frantically pulling people out as fast as

we could to try and get to the people at the front, but as soon as one

was pulled free the space was filled with another and pressure was

still being pushed forward fran the back of the stand.

I got down an my hands and knees and grabbed hold of one of the men

who was on the floor face down, hanging out of the gate into the

track, I put 'my arm under his armpits and tried pulling him out,,

whilst I was doing this people who were being pulled free above me

were standing on my back to get to the track, other officers present

grabbed hold-of’me and-other parts, of the man end with.a. ^re.at deal of
physical effort we managed to pull him free.   We carried him to the

grass area behind the goal nets, put him down, established that he was

breathing and alive, he muttered some vords and we left him and

immediately returned to. the gate and continued pulling people frcm

the pen.   I became aware that the man we had pulled out from the floor

was in fact being attended to by another officer.

It is difficult to say how many we physically pulled frcm the pen but

it must have been in the hundreds, most of whan were walking, sane

unconscious, sane dead, sane collapsed.   The ones who were brought out

unconscious were tended to immediately by whoever pulled them out.

They were brought round by slaps across the face or if they were

collapsed mouth to mouth resuscitation where necessary.   I didn't

count how many times I did this, I couldn't guess.   As time was

passing more and more officers were arriving at the scene, this was

quite obviously within minutes of opening the gates even though we

seemed' to have been there a hell of a long time before anyone actually

came, but it was only minutes.

The main problem was that no matter how many were pulled frcm the

front, the crush was so great fran the back we couldn't relieve any

pressure to get to the people at the very front or sides who were in

serious trouble.

It became obvious that pressure needed to be released fran the rear

where there was now space appearing.   Officers were telling or

shouting to people to move back fran the front but they wouldn't so

the situation continued.

I made a request to one Inspector who was standing on the grass to get

a serial in through the back to pull the people out.   Whether he did

cr not I don't know, he seemed a little non plnssed an<3 walked away.
I can remember pulling a boy of about 16 years fran the crowd who had

a broken arm.    By that I mean I could clearly see that the bone in his

right forearm was broken.    He had somehow managed to pull himself

above the people in the crowd and shouted to us that he had broken his

arm, with another officer we managed to grab him and pull him through

the gate and on to the track.    He just thanked us and walked off.

Most of the ones— who were pulled out, who were able thanked us and

were crying, thanking god that they had got out.

As more and more officers arrived at the scene, they began to tear

down the fencing with their bare hands, trying to get to the people in

the pen.   Sane £ven tried to kick it down.    Sane officers were hanging

over the fencing and pulling people over quite clearly in sane danger

of falling into the pen themselves.

At this time I moved away fran the gate and started checking the

people laid down on the grass, I cannot remember how many were laid on

the grass at this time but my estimation would be in the region of

about 30 to 40.     Other Police Officers were engaged in attempts to

revive people.

I made several attempts to revive people with artificial resuscitation

and whenever I thought I felt a pulse I would shout any medical

personnel who were near at hand.     I seemed to have found more dead

than alive.

The situation in this area was quite chaotic, bodies all over the

place, people wandering about crying, screaming, shouting, Police

Officers and what few medical personnel were there trying frantically

to revive people.

After sane time at checking bodies and making several hopeless
attempts to revive people it became obvious to me that there was
                                 - 9 -




nothing more that I could do.       I was feeling absolutely physically

shattered.      By this time all the people in Pen 4 had been pulled out

and there only remained the dead bodies in Pen 3, a large number of

which had been taken out and placed on the field.                   ' '- ■

During the most frantic moments of trying to revive the people on the

grass there were no medical personnel to speak of and the St John's

Ambulance Brigade consisted of what I could see, two old men and one

young boy of about 12 - 14 years who was totally overwhelmed by the

situation.      Although on saying that, once they had gathered their

senses they got stuck in and worked very hard.

Kith regard to the behaviour of the fans I can say that the ones who

were seated above the pens were shouting and screaming abuse, but the

ones who were on the ground got organised into groups and helped us

with the injured etc by carrying them on advert boards and were a

credit to themselves.

As I have previously stated I have worked football duty at

Hillsborough on quite a number of occasions and have always been

impressed by the pre-planning and organisation of the duties and

crowd.       I would consider it one of the best policed grounds in the

country.      Whatever happened on this occasion to cause such a tragedy

can only be speculated upon, but again I have never seen as many fans

at the Leppings Lane end at that time of day.

G.            LORD J U S T I C E .T A Y L O R : Do you know anything about the
       Tannov system that was in operation that day, or did you have
       ■anythin.? to do with that.'' - A. No, it was nothing to g o with
       ms .

G. Mr. Sanderson- would you wait a moment.  There may oe another
   question.   If you would just wait a moment.

                    POLICE CONSTABLE PHILIP HOPSON Called

                           Examined bv MR.    PHILLIPS

,0. You are Police Constable Philip Hooson?              Is that right? - a .
    That is correct, sir.

a-'.   There are one or two matters out of your statement I want to
       ask you "about-, m r . Hooson, You were on duty at the match, and
       part c-r your duty was to go to the Midland Station, was it
       not? - A. That is correct, sir.

G. With a serial ox other Officers to meet supporters or: the
   trains? - a . That is correct.

0. These would be the ordinary service trains at the Miciianc
   Station, and they were supporters from both Liverpool ar.c
   Nottingham Forest^ •- A. That is correct, yes..

G. when the supporters came off the trains at the station did you
   anc the rest of your serial have some method of searching and
   filtering the tans? - A. We did, sir. yes.

G.     What did you do with regard to the football supporters?  How
       did you filter them? - A. What do you mean?  How. physically
       or how did the arrangement work?

0.     i'es. - A. How would you like me to explain it to you? - What I
       am trying to say is when they arrived at the exit it was like
       a matter of depending on the identification with whatever
       scarf they were wearing or what ticket they had on tnem.   The
       Nottingham Forest went down to the bottom end of the train
       station and the Liverpool fans went to the top side.

G . So you separated them into two groups effectively at the
    ticket D a r r i e r ? - A. More or less, yes. sir.

G. When you got them into the appropriate group what did you
   do? Did you search each one? - A. No.  My serial did nct
   search each one.

G.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      How did you get them into the same
        group?     I can see it if they are obviously wearing colours of
        tne d u o . but otherwise what do you do?   Liverpool on.the
        left, Nottingham on the right?     How did you separate tnem off?
        - a . That is basically it. sir.      British Transport Police,
       •they have all the information as regards what trains what fans
        were using and which platform they were going to arrive at.
        and they basically did the segregation prior to them arriving
                                                                15


                                                                                      P. HOOSON

                              A        ;o us.  We just continued it, ensuring that the Nottingham
                                       Forest fans went down to their collection point and the
                                       Liverpool fans went to theirs, basically speaking.

                                  0.        MR. PHILLIPS:     So '.he Liverpool trains and the
                                       Nottingham trains arrived at different times, aid they? - a .
                                       As far as' I am aware.
                              B
                                  0. And you would get a batch of supporters all from the Liverpool
                                     train and another batch from the Nottingham train? - A. That
                                     is r i g n t . s i r .

                                  0.   were you concerned to know whether the people who came through
                                       the barriers had tickets for the match? - A. What we did. when
                                       they came through and if we had identified them as football
                              C        s u pp or ter s. we asked them where they were going. Our
                                       instructions were not to.allow them into the city centre.   So
                                       we searched them for a ticket, and if they had a ticket,
                                       dependent whether they came from Liverpool or Nottingham,
                                       cetermined which end of the platform we sent them to.

                                  0. You say you searched them for a ticket.  Does that mean you
                                     searched everyone who appeared to be a football supporter for
                          D          a ticket? - A. Basically, yes, sir.

                                             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That really means that those.who
                                        :ame without ticKets haa the advantage of going into the town
                                       tnat those who came with tickets did not have?    A. The'
                                       it. basically, sir.

                                  G.        MR. PHILLIPS:     And it was only those with tickets you
                                       sent along to the buses that were going to the ground? - a .
                                       That is it. sir.   As far as I can remember, yes.

                                  G. So if a person had said to you he was going to the match but
                                     naa not got a ticket with him you would not let him get on the

                                     a ticket with him when you searched him. you would not let him
                                     go to the appropriate bus to go to the ground? - A. I don't
                                     know. sir.  I did not particularly come across that problem
                                     that I can rememoer.

                                  0. All of those who came....       - A. As far as I can recollect,   yes.

                                  G. Then I think you and your serial went off to the ground after
                                     you had finished dealing with the arrival of supporters at the
                                     station? - A. That is right, sir.

                                  G. And the bus you went on travelled along Middlewood Road, past
                                     Hillsborough Park and down Leppings Lane from the Catcn Ear
                                     Lane ena? - A. That is right, sir.

                          H          would it be when you were going down Leppings Lane? - A.
                                     Roughly speaking it would be 2G-to-3, quarter-to-3, roughly.

            A. It did stop. sir. but            the exact location I am not sure.
            It was in Leppings Lane.

D
                     MR.. WOODWARD:  Sir. I do apologise for rising ar.c
                interrupting, but it is- in relation to Mr. Sanderson.   The
                purpose of calling him first this morning is tnat m s
                attendance is required urgently elsewhere in relation to some
                matters that are happening in Barnsley.   Might ne ce released.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I was about to take an opportunity
                of saying that, because I have found what I wanted, which was
                something which confirmed what he had to say.  So I don't
                think I neea to ask him anything further about it.

                     MR. WOODWARD:   He will be available should later
                information be required from him, but his attendance is
                required urgently elsewhere, sir.

                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes,   he is free to go.

                     MR. PHILLIPS:   Did the situation in Leppings Lane seem
                to you to be unusual? - A. It did inasmuch that there were
                quite a lot of people there which I thought for that time of
                day.

        u . And your bus had some trouble getting down Leppings Lane, aid"
            it? - A. We did. sir.  We had to travel very slowly.

                Were     the fans out on the road then as weil as on the pavement?
                - a ,.   From the Leppings Lane they were both sides, but in the
                main     at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, but they were walking
                cown     tne road towards the turnstiles.

        u.      I think you went to the gymnasium as you were expected to do
H               and got there at about 5-minutes-to-3? - A. That woula be
                approximately.
                                                                17

                     the Leppings Lane stand? - A. To the West Stand, yes. sir.

                  G.   And did you go in fact on the pitch side or at the back of                  the
              B        North Stand? - A. We went on the pitch side. sir. on the
                       track.

                  G.   What die you see as you were walking towards the stand? - A.
                       As I was walking up towards it I saw the ground was full, ana
                       we neared the west Stand I could see that the West Stand was
                       quite full,   but tne section to the right as you walk 'towards.'
                       it did not seem quite as full.
              C
                  G.   When talking about the West S t a n d .I think we should say the
                       terraces, the Leppings Lane terraces, rather than the Stand..
                       The section to the extreme right you say was not very full? -
                       A. it did not appear to be so.

                  u.   Where did you see the biggest concentration of people? - A.
                       The most of   the stadium appeared full, but to direct it
              D        straight at   the Leppings Lane end, the full face of the
                       Leppinss- Lane end seemed to be quite full, as far as T saw--.it.

                  G. Did you come to gate a ? - a . I did.                   sir, yes.

                  G. Was that gate open or closed when you got there? - A. It was

                  G. what did you see.

                            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:                     Have you the time when this was
                       going on?

                  G.        MR. PHILLIPS:    What time was it when you got to or were
                       approaching gate a ? - a. I would not be quite sure to give you
                       an exact time.  As far as i can remember it was before 3
                       o'clock, before the kick-off, because the players were warming
                       up on the pitch as we walked into the staaium.

                  0.   Did you see anything that happened on the pitch after you got
                       to the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. On the pitch, sir?

                  u    Yes? - A. No,                  not on the pitch.

                  0.   You don't know whether the game had started or how long it
                       went on? - A. Absolutely no idea, sir.

                  0.   You say gate                    was closed? - A, That is right,   sir.

                  0. What aid you see in pen a ? - a . I saw that there was quits a
                     number of people crushed up to the fencing.    They seemed to oe
              H      in quite a despera te situation.

0. Thar, of course, would be the first of the two centre pens you
   came to? - A. That is right, sir.

G. Were there other Officers on duty outsiae pen 4 ? - a. as I
   walked on the track as I can remember tnere were three Police
   Officers standing on the track.

G. Were they conscious or appear to be conscious of what was
   going on in pen 4 ? - a. I can't say, sir. I really don't
   know.

G. Were   tnev looking towards pen 4 or out towards tne pitch? - A.
   As far as I can remember they were not   looking towaras the
   pitch.

0 . When you  got to pen-^ you found the gate closed, you saw
     people crushed up against the fence.  Did you take the
     opportunity of looking along towards pen 3? -A. Net that I can
     rememoer, s i r .

G. You c a n ’t say whether No. 3 gate was open or not'? - A. What I
   can say to y o u . when I walked on that track towards pen 4
   there were no gates open.

G. None at all? - A. None at all.     sir.

0. Were     there spectators on the perimeter tracK?   - A. r.c. sir.

G. Ncr.e at all? - A. None at all.    sir.

0.- What  cia you ao then when you saw what you did see in pen 4 ? -
    A. What I did. 1 realised there was something desperately
    wrong, and of course understanding that the oraers are that
    nobody goes on to the track. I had to decide to open the gate.
    I told the Police Officer there - I have no idea who he is -
    to inform the control room that we will need some assistance
    and we would open tne gate, and then I went and opened the
    gate.

G.   I think you debated a bit with yourself, did you,     before doing
     so? - A. I think so. sir, yes.

G. And we have the views or the thoughts you had in your
   statement? - A. That is right, sir.

G.          LORD JUSTICE T a YLOR: What was the thought? - A. I
     think/ "If I ’m wrong I'm going to get a right bollocking for
     th i s" .

q           M p._ PHILLIPS:   That tends to suggest that you had had it
      clearly drummed into you not to open these gates.     Is that
      right? - A. It is, sir.     Over the years of attending foctoall
      matches tne practice is that nobody goes on to the track
      except in exceptional circumstances, i.e. they are under
      gj-j-gg— QJ- they are ill or in the wrong part of the football
      stadium and consequently would be escorted to where tney.

                                     MR. JACKSON: Sir, my understanding of the photograph
                                 and my consideration of it came to the conclusion that the
                                 shades between the front,and the rear half of the fence was
                                 not to be taken into consideration.  That seemed to me to
                                 be the sum of it but that is only my assessment of it.   I
                                 was relying only on the clear spaces    pen six and seven.

                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes.                 .

                      B              MR'. JACKSON: May I next ask you about your evidence
                                 when vou said when you first arrived on the track there did
                                 not appear to be any people.   Clearly on any track there are
                                 a number of people,,Police Officers. A. The usual personnel
                                 Police Officers.

                                 If we look at that photograph we see it timed at 1459 and
                                 perhaps importantly we see gates three, four, and five, are
                      C          all open.  That means you must have arrived on the track
                                 before that. A. Yes, Sir.

                                 So that we 'can' time your arrival     prior to 2.49.   A. Yes,


                          ■Q ■   And your ability to see what you saw. A. Yes,        Sir.
                      D          May I now move back some four or five hours to the railway
                          Q
                                 station.  Mav I preface my question by emphasizing I c^o .ri.o'c
                                 criticize at al * but I wonder why people are prevented fro-'
                                 aoins where they want to go and with what power.   If someone
                                 takes an early train to Sheffield with a match ticket and
                                 arrives in Sheffield at about 11 o'clock with what power do
                                 you compel him to go to the ground? A . I am unable to answer
                                 that.

                          Q      Is it the position that he is taken to the area of the ground
                                 and released? A. That is it.

                          Q      I use the word deliberately.  Is he in fact in police
                                 custody effectively from his arrival at the station to the
                                 ground? A. That is a strong word to use but basically I
                                 would sav that.  He is under our control and direction.

                                 May I say that events in the past have well justified a
                                 great deal of control being extended.  In the future there
                                 may be recommendations, I merely want to ask what went on
                                 and not to criticize.  It is the position, for very good
                                 reason, that these young men are effectively in custody?
                                 A. That is right.

                                 Ironically, as my Lord pointed out, if you claim to have no
                                 ticket ycu could go into Sheffield centre, A. Basicallv,
                                 ve s •

                           c     What   time did   the first train arrive? A. I have no idea.

                           Q     Approximately     around 11? A.    It would be around that roughly
                      H

                                    Cross-examined by MR. MULLER
                       A
                           Q. Two minor matters, officer.    I want you to see if you can
                               help u s a little about the position at gate four when you
                            ' had opened the gates, do you follow?     I think that you said
                               in your statement that eventually you assisted in hundreds
                               of people being taken out. A. That is right, Sir.

                           Q.   You cannot put a more precise figure on it than that?
                       B         A . There was a l o t , S i r .

                           Q.   It mav be very difficult for you to recall precisely but
                                 vou mentioned that there were four or five people on
                                 the floor at the gate. A. That is r i g h t , S i r .

                           Q.   I ask you about that because in your statement you refer
                                 specifically to two men being on the floor. A. Yes, Sir,
                       C
                           Q.   What is the position, is it two, or what is the' position,
  »                              can you help us? A. This is like over a period of time.

                           Q.   When vou first got there. A. When we first got there I
                                 did not particularly look.   I just saw what was in front
                                 of me but what I can recollect is during the time that we
                       D         stood at the gate whilst we managed to pull people out
                                 from the bottom -- you see sometimes some people crawled
                                 or managed to get on their haads and knees, .to try. to get ,
                                 to the gate.   That is the best way I can explain to you
                                 and so thevv would appear all the time.  They would not
                                 be there all at once.

                           0.   It would not be a question of people jamming the bottom
                       E        of the gate, it was a question of people crawling to that
                                position? A. They would appear there and we would take
                                them out as best we could, Sir.

                                     Cross-examined   bv MR.      GLASGOW

                           Q.   Do you know that the situation that we see in the photograph
                                at " 1459 occurred before you arrived? A. You are saying that
                       F        that occurred before I arrived?                  ■^  •

                           Q.    I am asking you.   A. No,   Sir,    it did not occur before I
                                 arrived.

                           Q.    At the time when you arrived you had the impression that
                                 there were no spectators on the perimeter area. A. That
                                 is right, on the track.
                       G
                           0.   But there were some police officers, were there? A.          That
                                 is right, three as best as I can recall.

                           Q.   You are quite sure that all the gates were shut? A.          I am.
                                 sure,Sir.

                     A       A.     I nave            seen   a video,   Sir.

                             One that shows a compilation of different shots from different
                             angles, some in black and white and some in colour? A. That
                             is the one.

                             I think that there is probably only one of those.             We can
                             see, and perhaps I can remind you, that at the time when
                     B       this photograph was taken to the closest minute, at 1459,
                             we can see a stream of orderly people walking along the
                             perimeter and being shown into gate one. A. That is probably
                             how it was to begin with.            I cannot, say, I was not looking
                             at p e o p l e , b a s i c a l l y .

                             N o , but the first people who were allowed out of the gates
                             we know walked perfectly normally along the front of.the
                     C       ■perimeter gates and 'were shown into gate one. A. I do not
                             know   where they went, Sir, but they did walk.

                             It appears that there must have come a time when all those
                             three gates that we see there open were sut again.    Car. you
                             help us on that? A. No, Sir, I cannot.   All I can say to you
                             is that when I went on that track, which was before three
                             o'clock, all the gates were closed and there was n--one on
                     D       thi   rack.  When I opened the gate I stayed there ..-.til
                                  ,en was emptv-, or ther-eabouts.

                             When vou opened the gate there was no question of people
                             walking our normally and in an orderly stream  A. No.

                             5v that              stage      they were already in acute distress       A. That

                             One matter only, officer.  Do I understand that as soon
                             as you cane in sight of the West Terrace you took in at
                             a glance that the centre was full but there was room at
                             the ends? A. It was not at a glance as such, it was as I
                             was walking along past the North Stand.

                             That did not require any detailed observation, it was
                             obvious to your eyes.  A. It appeared to be full, yes.

                         Q   In the centre?                   A. Yes.

                         c   With room at the ends?                     A. In the corner ends it did not seen

                                           the North S t a n d ,because that was the route you took,
                                           were vou first in line or were other officers preceding
                                           you? A. There was P.O. Packer in front of me and I think
                                           Sergeant Swift was in front of me as well at that time.

                                            ou   :hink?   a .   That is right.

                                           Where were you going, what was your destination? A. To
                                  B        the track in front of the West Stand.

                                           At that time were the team already out      onthe pitch?   A. They
                                           were out on the pitch warming up.

                                           This would be the second warm-up, the immediately before
                                           kick-off warm-up, would it? A. Possibly, I do not know.

                              C            The goal area at each end is an area where photographers
                                           gather? A. Usually at a football match.

                                      Q    There are a number of individuals that onemight expect    to
                                               between the perimeter fence and the back of the goal'
                                           A . "hat i s right , Sir

                                      Q.   Certainly at that sort of time.    As you walked towards the
                              D            West Stand end where were you when you first appreciated
                                           that something might not be right? A. Actually walking on
                                           the track in ‘front of the -West Stand itself.

                                           It.was net until you got up to the West Stand that anything
                                           struck' you? A. That is right.

                              E -Q         In the course of the events of that afternoon is it right
                                           that there was a time when minutes hung and seemed like hours
                                           and other times when you looked at your watch and time had
                                           sped by? A. I did not look at my watch at all.

                                           Did you have an impression that times became confused? A. I
                                           have no concept of time whilst I was there.  It was only when
                                           we had been relieved and sat down that we appreciated
                                           that time had passed.

                                           There were already officers in the area of the gate that you
                                           have described opening? A. Yes, Sir.  T h e r e were three
                                           officers who were spread out on the track as far as I can
                                           remember.

                                      Q    You cannot recall who they were,      you do not know them?
                                           A. No, Sir, I do not know them.

                                      Q    You are quite clear, are you, that you opened the gate?
                                           A. Sir, with respect that gate was shut and I opened that
                                           05t-p .

                                           Someone must have caused it to be opned but in the evidence
                                           that we have heard in this Inquiry, for example in relation

                                  to the tunnel a number of officers have said that they were
                                  the first down there, they were the only ones who were
                                  doins things.  Do you follow? A. I know, Sir.

                            •Q.   But your recollection" is clear- of opening     the gate?
                                  A . Absolutely.

                        B   Q-    That   is before   the kick-off? A. Before the kick-off,    Sir.

                            Q.    From the moment that you opened it would it be right to say
                                  that you were more or less by it? A. That is right.

                            Q.    Until you had got out of that pen as many people as you
                                  could help? A. That is right.

                        C   Q-    That would extend from some time before the kick-off to .some '
                                  long time after the game had stopped? A. Yes.

                            o.    Is it vour recollection that throughout that time the gate
                                  in question remained open? A. It did, yes.

                                  As you had been walking along in front of the North Stand to
                                  the West Stand are you aware of whether there had been
                        D         or were any spectators walking along the front of the West
                                  Stand to go towards gate, one? A. We were not aware of that,


                                  You are not saying that was not happening? A. I am not saying
                                  that was not the case.  I am simply saying I do not remember
                                  seeing anyone'.

                                  And if your evidence is correct and you have done your best
                                  to recall it from the moment that you perceived any problem
                                  vou save help by opening the gate and did all that you
                                  could until the problem in the pen had been resolved? A. That
                                  is right, Sir.

                                  When  you opened the gate first of all it is right, is it,
                                  that people did not come flooding out of it? A. No, Sir,
                                  they could not .

                             0    They were   just jammed there?     A. That is right.

                             C    What   you had to do was to get? A. Physically pull them out.

                             Q    To drag them out? A. Yes.

                             0    And that is what you then occupied yourself in doing for
                                  the rest of that period? A. That i s r i g h t .

                                  If what you say is right as you approached the West Stand
                                  you did not see- any gate open until you actually opened
                                  gate four? A. That is right.

                                      gate?   A.   That's right, Sir.

                                  Q   Can you help as to whether or not there was anybody by
                                      Gate 3 at that time or do you just not recall?   A.    When
                                      I got to ---   As far as I can remember, when I got to
                                      Gate 3 ---
                         B                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Gate 3?   A.   Gate 4, I am sorry.
                                      P.C. Packer would be in front of me.   I understand that
                                      he went to Gate 3.   I couldn't say whether it was open or
                                      closed.

                                           MR. WOODWARD:    It would seem, from what you have
                                      described, by the time you got to Gate 4 Mr. Swift and
                                      Mr. Packer had already gone ahead of you.    A.   No, sir.
                                      P.C. Packer had.   Sergeant Swift was by this time behind
                                      me and I was accompanied by P.C. Akred.

                                      for Henry Boots and Howarth Timber and a gate open - bottom
                          D           right foreground.   A.   That's right, sir.

                                      And there "are two Officers at least in that picture that
                                      can be seen to the right.    Is that Sergeant' Swift?
                                      A,   That is Sergeant Swift.

                                  Q   Do you recognise    anybody else there?      A.      And myself.

                                  Q   Which one is you, because ---  A.   I am bending down,             sir.
                                      My hair was slightly longer than it is now.

                                  0   You are bending down?      A    I am bending down at that point,
                                      there.

                                  0        LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:,   Just in front of the figure in
                                      the corner?   A.      That's right, sir.

                                           MR. WOODWARD:   You recognise you: helmet, do you?
                                      A.   No, sir.   Sergeant Swift is the Sergeant with no hair.
                                      That is Sergeant Swift.  But, yes, basically I recognise
                                      my hair.   It was quite a bit longer than it is now.

                                  Q   To his left or to his right?      A.      I am at his right

                                  Q   It may be you have got a slightly different print from
                                      ours.   It is a different print from mine.   Yes, your hair
                                      is longer.   So you were then occupied in dealing with
                                      people at that gate throughout that time?   A.   That's
                                      right, sir.

                                  Q   You are quite sure that it was you that opened the gate,
                                      are you?   A.   I am absolutely positive, sir.

     prior to my arrival    and did what he did ---

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is what I was             going to   ask
     you.      A.   I can't say, sir.

Q. You were walking round the pitch, I take it, along the front
   of the North Stand?   A.   That's cor rec.t, my Lord . '

Q. Can you say whether there were any people being shepherded
   along the front as you were doing that?   A.   1 can't
   recollect.

Q.    But by the time you got to the track in front  of the West
     terrace, there were not spectators out on the track?
     A..   No, sir, not at that stage.    Whether this has happened
     prior to me going there, I can't say.    I can only say wnat
     happened when I got there,                           _■ -

Q.          MR. WOODWARD: But it is likely, is it not, if as you
     walked along the front of the North Stand to go to the West
     Stano you had seen a gate in the perimeter fence open and
     a number of people come out, that is something you would
     have remarked upon because of your training?   A.   That's
     ri g nt , s i r .

C. And if it had happened .before your eyes, you are likely to
   hcve rerr.einoered i t . A. Yes, sir.

             MR. HYTNER:        Sir, may I just say, before we go further,
     there seems to be s let of difficulty encountered by people
     i n r e l a t i o n to this.  Can I just say there has, of course,
     also D e e n evidence from Mr. Grobbelaar --

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have it in mind.                  In fact,
     I was about to ask a question.

            MR. HYTNER:   Mr. Collins at some stage indicated that
     he might be actually going to submit that Mr. Grobbelaar
     w a s wrong.   Can I just say so there is no mystery so far
     as Mr. Woodward is concerned that I shall be making submissions
     based on the proposition that the evidence seems to suggest
     that Gate 4 at any rate was opened and shut, opened and shut,
     and that is consistent with all witnesses and it is also
     consistent with the evidence that we have heard very little
     of, for obvious reasons, that some fans were actually pushed
     back into the terraces once they had got out of the gate
     ontothepitch.

          LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:       Well, Mr. Hytner,         this is an
     address.

          MR. HYTNER:   No, it is not an address.         I am simply
     indicating what line I am t a k i n g i n fairness to Mr. Woodward
     so he can meet it in questions.

            . MR. COLLINS:   Sir,    I do not think I ever sought to say
     Mr.     Grobbelaar was wrong    except as to his timings.

                                     .                                              261

                                           LORD JUSTICE          TAYLOR:      The question I was going to put
                                      to this w i t n e s s :

                                  Q. You say, as I understand it, from the time that you opened
                                     Gate 4, it remained open for at any rate 20 minutes or so
                                     whilst you were getting people out, is that right?
                                     A.   That is co rr e c t .                    /

                              B   Q'. .Not shut at all in that time?               A.     Not shut at all.

                                  Q. So if it was opened at all other than by you it must have
                                     been opened before you got to the front of the track, is
                                     that right?   A.    That is correct.

                                  Q. Was there ever a stage when fans were coming out as if
                                     the top had been taken off a Coca-Cola bottle?   A.    Nc,
                                     sir,no.

                                  Q   You were having to peel           them out?               We were havina to
                                      prize them out.

                                  Q   Did that continue right through or did there come a stage
                                      st which the pressure being relieved, people were walking
                                      out?    A.  Later on, sir, but we still had to pull them
                              D       o u t . ’

                                      By that time' the players were well off the pitch-,                             i imagine r
                                      A.   I cannot remember.    No idea.

                                           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:,              Y e s , thank you             Well,       no
                                      bollocking!   Thanks.

                                                                  GARY C A M M O C K , called

                                                                Examined by MR.     P H IL LI PS :

                                      Constable Gary Cammock,           is that right?           A          That is
                                      correct, yes.

                                      You, I think, were on the serial which went to the
                                      railway station at Wadsley Bridge, is that right?
                                      A.   That's correct, yes.   One of the two serials.

                                  Q   You were there for some considerable time waiting                               for the
                                      train to come in?   A.   Yes.

                                  Q   When it finally did come in, just before 2 o'clock, you
                                      went with the people on the train down to Leppings Lane.
                                      A.   That's true, yes.

                                      What time did you get to Leppings Lane?   A.   I don't
                                      know, ten minutes, Quarter of an hour after we had left the
                                      sta tion, I su pp os e .

                                      Once you. had arrived at Leppings Lane with the people                                 from
                              H       the train, did you remain on duty in that vicinity?
                                      A.   Yes, I did.

                                                                                                                                    262

                 I am     a married           man        and     live     at, t h e    above         address         with      my     wife    and

                 family.

                 I am     employed          in   a       part     time     capacity             as   turnstile           operator

                 supervisor           at    Sheffield             W e dnesday         Football          ground          at   Hillsborough.                 I

                 have     worked       at     Hillsborough                for    32    years         and      have      held     my    present         post

                 for     about    10 y e a r s .

                 Basically        I deploy               the     operators           where       I want        them      and     then      check       the

                 takings     or       otherwise             after        the    kick       off.

                 I have     already           been         seen     by    the    West       Midlands           Police        and      filled       in a

                 p ro    forma    concerning                my    duties        and     observations               on    the     stadium

                 disaster        of    t he      15th       of    April        19S9     (130439).

                 I have     been       asked         a     specific        point       about         the      t u r n s t i l e s ‘r e g i s t e r i n g

                 more     than    one       observation.

                  F r offs t i m e    to    time,          and       I d o n ’t     remember a n y          specific             i n c i d e n t , but

                  operators           do    report             faults.         These       are    either         A)        Turnstiles             jam    and

                  they     have       trouble             letting        in    the       customers       or      B)        The    turnstile             may

                  run     free       and    register             more        than    one,      when    in     fact         only     one      person       has

                  entered.            These          complaints              are    very       infrequent,            if    I was       to    quantify

                  it rnaybe          twice       a    season.            I am       certain       that      on     occasions            these       faults

                  may     well       be    due       to    the       fact     that       the   operator          keeps       his       foot       down    f or

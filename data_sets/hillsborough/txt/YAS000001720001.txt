1.   I was born on 19th December, 1945.
2.   I am a Qualified Ambulanceman operating from Longley
     Station.     My call number Is 406.     I have been employed by
     SYMAS as an ambulanceman for 12 years.       I have had training
     at Mark field and am qualified up to Miller standard.          I
     have since 1980 studied the extended skills on a voluntary
     basis and I am now waiting to go on the course established
     under the National Curriculum.            Prior to joining the
     Service I was attached to an Ambulance Squad with the
     Territorial Army.      On 15th April, 1989 I was on shift
     0600 to 1400      I live very close to Longley.     I went home
     at 1400.      I was due to go on leave.     I arrived at home at
     1405   and started gardening.         My home is also near the
     Northern General Hospital.
3.   Shortly after 1500 I could hear sirens.        A neighbour told
     me shortly after 1505 that something had happened at the
     football match and there were a lot of casualties.        I put
     on my uniform and returned by car to Longley Station two
     minutes away.      When I arrived there Q.A.
     was there.      He said he had been trying to contact Control
     by Station telephone and Station radio for a while but
     without success.      I said the best we could do was to take
     two ambulances to the ground, which we did.       I did not see
     __________ again until the following day.
4.   I took ambulance number 331 to Hillsborough.      On the way I
     managed to contact Superintendent Ray Clarke at Control and
I said I was taking that ambulance to the ground.      My route
was along Herries Road.      It was cordoned off by police to
allow access of ambulances.         Police directed us down
Herries Road to the roundabout and then on to Leppings Lane.
As I approached the Leppings Lane end there were a mass of
fans, most of whom moved out of the way.     One man tried to
jump onto the front of the ambulance.      When I reached the
Leppings Lane gates I was directed down the side of the
ground behind the west stand.      As I arrived at the point
marked with a red X on the plan attached to this statement
police and fans converged on me telling me         they all had
priority cases for me to attend to.      This was about 3. 20
p.m.      I asked a policeman if he had seen our Incident
Officer and he said no.       I went to look at one of the
priority cases but the first one was dead.          Injured and
dead people were laid alongside the wall adjacent to the
area between the west stand and the south stand.
I started to say to police that we would pick three injured
persons up.      Before I could do that my ambulance came up
alongside with a policeman driving it.     The policeman said
there were three injured persons on the ambulance for me.
I said that was O.K. but I did not have any attendant.     Two
of the injured were conscious         and one was      deeply
unconscious.     I did the necessary pre-checks.     The third
casualty's breathing was not too poor, and I secured his
airway.       A man whom I took to be his friend was looking
after him.        I decided to move my ambulance away and at
     this point I saw our Major Incident Tender Vehicle driven by
     ___________ coming the other way towards me.       He was coming
     from the Penistone Road end.          I saw he had an ambulance
     attendant,                   with him.   I signalled
     towards me.      I asked            what he was doing but he did
     not know what his specific instructions were.       I asked him
     to help me.      He said he was not a Qualified Ambulanceman.
     I suggested that he drive and I would travel in the back of
     the ambulance with the casualties.        This was agreed and we
     then took the three injured to Northern General Hospital
     where we were met by many porters and the injured were taken
     off very quickly.
     At Northern General I saw Charge Nurse Ian Batty.       I passed
     onto him the information I had about the patients,
     particularly the one whose airway I had secured and who was
     still unconscious.         The other two were still conscious.
     While I was there other ambulances arrived and I assisted
     with the unloading.                   and I then proceeded back
     to Hillsborough with him driving.
     I called Control on the radio and got through and said I was
     returning to Hillsborough and my message was acknowledged.
8.   We encountered similar conditions on our return journey
     to the ground.      We started to make our way back to the
     Leppings Lane end.          When we reached the vicinity of the
     gate at the Leppings Lane end      we could not get through any
     further.      I saw Mr Jones who told me all the casualties
     were now being gathered at the other end.         We were then
     directed back to the other side of the ground (the Penlstone
     Road end) and to the main entrance marked with a red Y on
     the plan attached.               When we arrived there I lost
                       I then proceeded Into the gymnasium and could
     see     a number of ambulancemen and doctors dealing with
     patients.       I think It was about 1545.
9.   I then assisted In unloading bodies from three or four
     ambulances which had arrived at that end of the ground and
     took the bodies Into the gymnasium.            I then returned to the
     gymnasium and with police officers and Mr Hopkins I sheeted
     and bagged up bodies.            Eventually each body was allocated
     to a police officer.
10. My colleague at Longley,                        , had now arrived and
     when I reported to Mr Jones                and I volunteered to make
     up a crew.         Shortly after that I spotted ambulance 331
     still being driven by                      .   He handed me the keys
     to it and                         and I went to Northern General
     Hospital mortuary to collect three bodies from the hospital
     there.      We brought three bodies back to the gymnasium as
     requested by the police.           Thereafter we made approximately
     ten journeys to the Medico Legal Centre transporting
     identified bodies and our work finished at 0615.

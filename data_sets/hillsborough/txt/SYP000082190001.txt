             and more Transit vans arrived on the road.               It was

             noti cable that most of the fans arriving had been

             drinking.     Empty beer cans         could be seen littered

             about the floors of the vans and some of the fans

             wanted to urinate as they alighted.               They were

             stopped from doing so,             Most of the fans were in high

             spirits however,      if the letter of the law had been

             implemented I feel that there would have been more under

             arrest than got to the ground.              Having said that,     I

             would say that no one was acting out of order and

             they made their way quietly to the ground.               The

             number of Police Officers at the location would not

             have been able to arrest the numbers              involved.

             Herries Rd then walked to front                                 istone

             Rd.



While   crossing the road serial stopped by a Super j.ntendent who was

listening on his radio.         There appeared to be some confusion.               We were

then told,    "They’re on the      pitch,       get in there".    We walked    into the

ground v ia the Spion Hop end and onto the                pitch perimeter,    on looking

towards the Leppings Lri end of the pitch,                I saw a large number of fans

on the pitch.      I presumed that there was some sort of public order

situation taking      place.    We then started to run along the pitch

towards the Leppings Ln end and the se r ial then became dti s pe r s e d .

Myself and Police Constable £155 EDWARDS s tayed together.                    On our

arrival at the end of the ground,              a large number of fans were walking
                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                          S2645

 on the pitch.                I was situated approximately at the edge of the 18 yard

  box between the goal and the West Stand.                      I had no idea what was

 happening at that stage and was telling the f an^ to get off the pitch.

 A Sergeant then told myself and Police Constable EDWARDS to form a

  cordon across the pitch, which we did along with a number of other

 Police Constables who               I did not know.       I still at this stage had no

  idea what had happened and was trying to control                     the fans on the pitch

 and tell them to get off.                     I could see that there was a melee at the

  rear of the goal.



 While on the pitch at this time                    I was becoming worried as one fan had

 already run towards the Notts Forest end and if more were to follow,                                 I

 felt there would have been a full scale                    riot.



 It was some minutes              later, after       J. had seen someone being carried on a

 stretcher and a number of Liverpool                    fans had approached shouting.

There's       people dying         in there why aren't you h e l p i n g ? ”     Most of these

 people appeared under tWe                    influence of alcohol.    I then decided that I

was serving no useful ypurpose where                    I was and together with Police

Constable EDWARDS,               moved towards the goal.          I remember talking to

afrout six persons who were                   lying on the ground,    but these were not

 injured,         just shocked.        I then saw a y ^ ^ ^ ^ g ^ c ^ a b o u t ^ 2Q(j/ears^ laying

on the floor who was panting strongly and couldn't get his breath.                                I

 talked to him, tried to calm him, whilst doing so I signalled for a

St. Johns Ambulance               lady to come to him as well.             The youth was still

 having difficulty breathing                   but was still    panting,    a stretcher then

arrived,         he was put onto the stretcher and was taken a w a y .                It was

 then that           I became aware that a large number of persons had gone by on

makeshift stretchers,some with coats over their faces.                           Although I

knew people had been injured I was still                       unaware of the true scale of
                                                                               PAGh.
                                                                               S2645

the incident



Myself and Police Constable BjjOUJARDS continued to help the walking

wounded.      There were a large number of wooden advertising boards

strewn across the penalty area.            The fans with these were told to put

them into one pile and to wait for us to call for them,               thanking them

for their work done already.            By this time most,   if not all of the

bodies had been removed.           Even at this time I did not know what had

occurred or the enormity of it.            I had seen persons being     carried on

makeshift stretchers^but thought that these were             injured p e rs o ns   not

dead ones.      I did yhot come into contact wi/h any corpses myself.               Some

t ime after I do nfot know how l o n g , I wag / a pproached js y Chief
        r J 'I 'S |/
Superintendent NESB1T/, who told me to tell the fans o n the pitch that

the game was off an®/'to start          leaving the pitch.    This   I did until

about half the number on the pitch had left-/I           then joined other

colleagues who had formed a cordon across the pitch at the halfway

,1ine «



I was then told by Police Sergeant TAYLOR to go back to Rawson Spring

Rd to assist     in getting the Notts Forest fans away from the ground.

It was only at this       late stage while talking to Police Constables from

the serial     that   I learned of the enormity of the disaster and the

number of deaths       involved,   which at that stage was about 70.



After the traffic was       cleared we/ made our way to Claywheels Ln, where

after grabbing a bite to eat, w e r e        transported to Rawmarsh and went

off duty at 7.30pm       (1930).    j   did work at the semi-final     the previous

year,     our serial worked at / h e .Hi 1Isborough Shopping Centre some mile

to a mile and a half frorK /he ground.

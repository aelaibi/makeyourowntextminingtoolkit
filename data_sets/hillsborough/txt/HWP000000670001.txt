Dear Sir Nicholas/

re: Hillsborough Disaster

You will be aware of a recent television documentary "The Cook Report" on
the above. It provided fresh evidence that - in spite of previous rulings -
victims were still alive long after the recorded time of death.        This
underlines the case made repeatedly by families of the victims/ that there
remain extremely serious unanswered questions concerning the way in which
the emergency services responded to the disaster/ and the subsequent way in
which the police investigated it/ and reported on it.

I would seek an early meeting with you/ along with Members of all parties
whose constituents were involved in the tragedy. I would particularly like
to explore with you the opportunities for an inquiry into the specific
matters raised by "The Cook Report".

I appreciate that we have met before on the issue/ and that the families'
case has been before the High Court.  However/ in the light of this fresh
evidence presented on television/ and the consequent public disquiet/ it
would be in the interests of all concerned that an early exploration of
these matters takes place.


Yours sincerely,




Pel

Thank you for your letter of 15 January to Michael Howard, about
correspondence you have received from Mr Phil Hammond, Secretary of
the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

As you and Mr Hammond are aware, the Home Secretary has undertaken
to consider carefully the points which were made in the programme
Hillsborough, and the representations which have been made to him by
the bereaved families and by others. He has emphasised that he
would not take the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would
need to be convinced that it would be in the public interest to do
so and that it would stand a chance of providing a better
understanding than there is at present of what happened on that
terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether
there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether that
evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been put
before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the
Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points raised by
the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he will reach a
decision on any further action to be taken as soon as he has been
able to consider all the issues.

Dear Michael,


Mr Phil Hammond, Hillsborough Family Support Group


Mr Hammond has been in touch with me about the campaign by HFSG to obtain justice
for themselves and the family members they lost.

1have no hesitation in supporting their call for a fresh inquiry, as there is clear new
evidence and because of overwhelming public support. The families have requested that
you order a new inquiry and I hope very much indeed that you will do so.

1look forward to hearing from you,


Yours,



  J

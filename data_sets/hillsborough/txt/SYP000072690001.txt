              This     m a n ’s face          was    blue.     The    crush behind was                  so    intense         t hat    the

              wa s n ' t    possible.           The    p o liceman a n d        t h ^ r f an     pulled me         out of the            gate

              and     onto       the    track       behind    the    goabr          I felt myself             start      to    pass      out

              come around.               Eventually          I was    able      to open my eyes and after                           a while

              I could sit              up.     A Policeman          canyr iver to rne and                told me         to    lie     down

drink       of water.          There      were     still       a lot of. people on the                  pitch and       in

the L e p p i n g s      Ln end.



At    this     stage      I still        didn't      know what            had h a p p e n e d to                I went

back       onto    the    terraces and had a look ar^mrfd to see                               if 1 could see him

anywhere,            I spent about              10 minu£**5 sea r c h i n g          for    him but      I couldn't

O uts i d e    I saw some          people who           I know from th Ho p at Anfield.                         They

told me        that      they had seen            _______ and that           he was all           right and had gone

back       to the     car.         As    I went      back to the car, someone                  came     out     of a

house       near     to the        groun d and          let me use          his phone,            I m a n a g e d to get

t h r o u g h to my sister and tell                     her    I    was     all right. I then walked up

towards        the    car where          I met     up a g a i n wit h                 and we tra v e l l e d         home.



I haven't          really got a n y o b s e r v a t i o n s              on the way the           incident was

h a n d l e d after       the m a t c h was        stopped          because       I was     semi        conscious       and

unaware        of what was           going       on ar o u n d me.           I know that          if the      fan and

the    two     p o l iceman h a d n ’t pulled me                   out    of the gate        I wouldn't         have    got

out.        The    gate was        too    narrow and the                 sheer    volume     of    people      behind

I was       s u r p r i s e d when      I initially a r r i v e d at the ground how few                          police

were       actually       present.         There was           only one          p o liceman to search           people

at    the turnstile            and      there were        no m o u n t e d       police     in evidence around

             the entrance          gates.         W h e n we got     inside    the    ground there were             no signs

             indicating where              the    terraces were and all              you see was        the    tunnel

             t h r o u g h w h i c h the    pitch was          visible.      I a s s u m e d that    that was where

             the     standing areas were.

             One     of the things          I would       criticise was        the    ticket allocation.              Our

             average        home   gate     this       season was 33*000*         yet we     ended up in the

             srna 1 1er end of the ground,



             Liverpool        had still          got    some     tickets    left on the F r i d a y before           the

             m a t c h w h i c h they      put on sale           to the general       public.        Beca u s e    this was

             only     the    day before          the m a t c h    it meant    that    people    living        outside      the

             a rea    couldn't      get     to A n f i e l d     to buy tickets,       so they turned             up to

             Hillsborough          on spec        to try and buy tickets              there.        This w o u l d just

             have a d d e d to the          p r o b 1 eras whi ch occur red at         the ground.



              I am willing         to a t t e n d a n y    court     or hearing       to give       evidence       if I am

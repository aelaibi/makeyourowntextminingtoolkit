               persons residing in the neighbourhood of the track, or be
               detrimental to the interests of persons receiving instruction or
               residing in any school or institution in that neighbourhood; or

       (b)     would seriously impair the amenities of that neighbourhood; or

       (c)     would result in undue congestion of traffic or seriously prejudice
               the preservation of law and order.”

        CHIEF PERSONNEL OFFICER
REPORT OF THE ACTING HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPABTMEHT TO THE GEWEIAL
PURPOSES PANEL


Subject:- Safety of Sports Grounds

1.   Introduction

     This report raises a number of miscellaneous issues which require members'
     attention.

2.   Visits to Sports Grounds

     Members have expressed an intention to visit the Sports Grounds within the
     City.  Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
     have indicated that they would welcome such a visit at Members' convenience.
     It is therefore recommended that such visits are arranged as soon as
     possible.

3.   Minutes of Advisory Group Meetings

     The Advisory Group met on 24th August, 1989 and 14th September, 1989.
     Copies of the minutes of those meetings are attached for Members'
     information.

4.   Don Valley Athletic Stadium

4.1 The Advisory Group visited the Stadium on 20th September, 1989, to make an
    inspection of the site and discuss with the architects their proposals for
    implementation of the requirements of Lord Justice Taylor.

4.2 It is clear that substantial resources will need to be devoted to the
    numerous issues raised. Members will receive a full report in due course.

4.3 The Stadium has not yet been designated by the Secretary of State as
    requiring a Safety Certificate. However, since the premises are in the
    course of construction it is felt that every effort should be made to ensure
    that they will comply with the Green Guide and Lord Justice Taylor's
    recommendations.

4.4 There is one matter which requires consideration at this stage. The
    Advisory Group are meeting to discuss this matter on 28th September, 1989,
    and at the meeting of the General Purposes Panel on 2nd October, Members
    will receive a full report upon the matter. The issue which requires views
    from Members is the effect upon safety of spectators of a hill located at
    one end of the Stadium.

5.   Sheffield United Football Club

5.1 At its meeting on the 15th September, the Panel considered whether or not
    spectators should be admitted to the Kop in view of the fact that the
    barriers had not been tested pursuant to the removal of the radial fences.
    I have now received confirmation from the Club that the barriers have been
    tested. A copy is attached for members' information.

5.2 On the 21st September, 1989, I was notifed by the Building Surveyor that a
    number of items of maintenance work had not been carried out at the Club.
    Additionally, the Building Surveyor was concerned that the perimeter wall at
    Shoreham Street and Cherry Street was in a dangerous condition. I advised
    the Club by letter on the 21st September that my representative and the
2.

      Building Surveyor would attend at the Club at U o ’clock on Friday the 22nd
      September to discuss the matter. Unless the Building Surveyor was satisfied
      that the premises were safe, then a prohibition notice would *
      immediate effect. Upon attending the Club, an inspection revealed that mo
      of the maintenance works had been carried out. Those which Tanained were
      not of immediate danger to spectators in the opinion of the          “J .
      Surveyor. Arrangements were made for the wall to be supported by
      and scaffolding. The work was carried out on Friday -the 22nd September y
      the Works Department. The Club gave an undertaking to replace the wall
      within the~next~three weeks. There are no matches scheduled to take place
      at the Club in that period. This item is referred to members for
      information purposes.   I am concerned that this matter w a s picked up at a
       late stage and discussions are taking place with members of the Advisory
       Group to establish how we can ensure this does not occur again. A further
       report will be submitted to members in due course but any comments members
      have would be welcome.                                                     ^

Recommendation:^

1.    Members are asked to suggest suitable dates for visiting Sheffield   United
      Football Club and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

 2.   Members are asked to note the contents of the attached minutes of    the
      Advisory Group Meeting.

 3.   Members' views upon the safety of spectators at Don Valley Stadium are
       sought *

comments had been made on pitch perimeter gate* and that gangways had been
mentioned. Mr. Sianiagton once again raised the question of the 21,000
capacity which, if it was subject to a 151 reduction, would get to
approximately 17,850 people.    There fora, a higher than 21,000 figure must
have been used by    Mr. Butler to     start with. Mr.    Butler indicatedthat
that was the case    and he went on    to reiterate chat his figures were based                                                     Firej

Mr. Ward referred to the Building Surveyor'* report which ran to 29 pages
of ioaediate safety requirements. There was also the list of wor.-.s
required by the Fire Service. He said was there any reason not to issue
a Prohibition Notice. The report clearly revealed immediate safety
hazards.  The concensus of the meeting was therefore that a Probition
Notice should be issued and a recommendation made to Che General Purposes
Panel at its meeting of 15th September to that effect.  Some dicsussion
then took place as to whether use could be made of the bars. It was
confirmed that they could because all we were doing was prohibiting the
use of the premises for sporting activities.

      fait there was a need to monitor the area. Mr. Butler said that he was
      concerned about the gate specification. The Fire Service referred to
      item IB of their letter. Mr. Butler felt the gate should be a maximum
      of l.l metres high and should look as if it could be easily opened.  The
      Fire Service accepted this point and said they were happy toreduce  the
      height of the gate to l.l metre.

For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes


Dear Mr. Bownss,
                                     Sheffield United Football Club Ltd.
                                       Safetv of St>orts Grounds Act 1S75
                                       i-...ii—   ■- ... .. it,             .,T ...       .■■i.i.- i.ii                I., in .....


                                                                          Radial Fences

            I write to confirm that the lengths of barriers, numbers 33,
42 and 46 on Spion Kop and 19 and                                                        20 on the Bramall Lane terrace
were          load tested, in accordance with the procedure                                                                             set     out in
the 'Green Guide', on Friday 15 September, as requested.
            A copy of each of our two record sheets showing the results
of the tests together with extracts from our drawings 651S/100C
and 6518/102C showing the location of the barriers tested are
enclosed.               You will see from the results that in all cases the
barriers withstood the test load.
            Our report about the results                                                 of the annual barrier                                   testing
will          be forwarded in the next day or so.

                                                                                  Yours sincerely,

      Dear Ed




      1 suppose that it's quite possible that Dr Slater will pursue you and us now. He might make a
      complaint to the Press Complaints Commission or he might take a libel action against us. I le may
      well not do either, however, particularly as wc have already published a letter from him.

      He inight ask us to publish something further about you misinterpreting the phone call he is
      supposed to have made, arid I think that we would be prepared to do that. This might well be the
      end o f i t

      If he makes a co
      complaint would be against us not you,

      When it comes a libel action, he could choose to sue you, the BMJ. the BMJ Publishing Group,
      or even - remarkably - the printers. He would probably sue you and the BiMJ, and you needn’t
      worry as our insurance policy will cover you as well as us.

      If he is well advised, then he will not take a libel action - as it's a miserable action for everybody.

      Best Wish,

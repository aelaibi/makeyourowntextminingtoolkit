             It was most pleasant and useful meeting you at lunchtime today, albeit
             for a very short time.

             I have noted your obvious interest in the Hillsborough disaster and how
             it was covered by members of the press. In keeping with Lord Justice
             Taylor's instruction to me I will be letting you have copies of
             statements which refer to press activity which could be described as
             unhelpful, obstructive or in bad taste. As more statements of this type
             come to notice I will advise accordingly.  I trust that you will treat
             the information you see in the strictest confidence.  If you should wish
             to pursue further enquiries with any persons who have given statements to
             my officers I would be grateful if you would contact me first, given the
             obvious confidentiality concerns.

             If there is any other way in which I can help you please do not hesitate
             to contact me. To assist I enclose my card. For the time being and
             until the oral hearings are completed I will be resident in the Sheffield
             office. Thereafter I will return to Birmingham.

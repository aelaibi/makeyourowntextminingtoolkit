  Dear Sir



  REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

  I refer to your letter of 28th November 1990, in which you       request a copy of your
  clients statement, Mrs Dolores STEELE.

  The policy on the release of information is as follows

  The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West Midlands Police
  back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
  In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
  were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.

  The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
  Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
  Police Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.  I now have  to look to South
  Yorkshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in responding
  to your request.

 At the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
 release any information to any party.  This is based on legal advice that has been
 given which indicates that information should only be released on the order of a
 Court which could include that of the Coroner.

  I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained at the
  present time I must decline your request.

 Yours faithfully




 J M JONES
 Deputy Chief Constable.

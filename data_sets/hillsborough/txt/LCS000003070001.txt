PERSONAL



Dear Gath,

   ■'••Thank you very much for ringing back on Friday evening.   I did appreciate ■'
the call.          ’             v                                       .

  V On Saturday, 29th April, the attached report was considered by nine Local
Authorities i.e. the seven in the North West, plus Nottinghamshire and Sheffield.
There was an agreement to endorse the report and to consider implementation when
funding had been agreed. I now have the task along with colleagues, of trying to
identify funding for the Regional Unit for the next three years. As you will see
the kind of activities envisaged by the Regional Unit are not the most popular.
However, I think one must remember that both the Helpline and Counselling/Out Reach
Services are aimed at both children and young people as well as adult victims.

     In addition to the annual expenditure of £350,000 for the Regional Unit a
first estimate of additional expenditure which will be incurred in providing direct
services to children, young people, adult victims and their families is around
£1 million per year.   This will be firmed up over the next couple of weeks, but it
is certainly unlikely to be less than £1 million.   Given the amount of money
involved and the regional and national role for services, it was decided to explore
every possible avenue regarding funding.   I would be grateful if you would consider
raising the possibility of financial support from The Royal Trusts as one source of
funding.


                                                         /continued

/coat’d....




     From my brief contact with His Royal Highness, Prince Charles, last week,
it was clear that like so many people visiting Merseyside he was personally affected
by the gravity and seriousness of the situation.   I did not, obviously, hassle him
personally about finance, but I am sure if the Trust were so minded to seek his
opinion he would be supportive of the need for provision 0f help and services.

     I look forward to seeing you on the 16th and will arttve at whatever time you
think appropriate.         •

                               Yours sincerely,                                 •

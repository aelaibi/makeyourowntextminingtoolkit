          Forwarded under separate cover is a copy letter which I have just
          written and despatched to Treasury Solicitors.  (Second copy attached).

          I am most concerned that when I make an undertaking with you or your
          senior officers that it is observed. It would appear yesterday in the
          hearings that that agreement was compromised as a result of the way in
          which Counsel interviewed one of your officers. It may be, of course,
          that Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police have already agreed with
          Mr Andrew Collins QC that the initial submissions could be referred to
          in the hearing. However, I am not at this time privy to such an
          agreement. No doubt, in due course, when Treasury Solicitors reply to my
          letter all will become clear. In the meantime I wish to assure you that
          I have always intended to maintain the integrity of our earlier
          agreement.

         SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

         You will recall in the early stages, because of the slowness of the
         supply of written recollections from South Yorkshire Police Officers, it
         was agreed that we would take from them their initial submissions which
         would be later superseded by their signed final versions, after they had
         been checked by their appropriate legal advice. I personally made an
         undertaking with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that only
         the final versions would be the ones used in the Public Inquiry and this
         was after discussion with you.

         I am concerned that yesterday an officer was referred to his initial
         submission which contained opinion that had subsequently been removed
         from his final account.   Given the undertaking I made to South Yorkshire
         Police I would hope that this would not happen in the future because it
         was only on that understanding that we received their information as
         early as we did.

        I have formalised this in writing because this effects our personal
        integrity in the matter. I have copied this letter to the Chief
        Constable of South Yorkshire Police for his information.

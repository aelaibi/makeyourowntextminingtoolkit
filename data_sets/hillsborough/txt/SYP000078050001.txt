             At 10.00 am (1000 hrs)         on Saturday IStfcr'April 1989 (150489),              I was
                                                                    -------------- A 7,773 S~~
             with other Officers        i n ,Serial No.^^3 commanded by PS2228 ATKIN in the

             N Stand of Sheffi eld Wednesday!Footbal1 Ground at Hi 1Isborough, where

             we received a briefing regarding the match,                   Nottingham Forest -~v~

             Liverpool,      in the sem^— final of the F.A. Cup.

             Following the briefing with the other Officers                      in my Serial, we then

             made our way to Penistone Rd N which runs between Hillsborough

             Football Club and Uladsley Bridge Station, w here we were to perform

             duty at static points on the footpath along the length of this                        road,

             regarding any Public Order d ifficulties which may have arisen during

             the day.

             We were    in position at this point from 11QQ hrs pnwards and it was

             noticeable then that there were a large number of Liverpool                        supporters
                                                                               PAGE     2
                                                                               S2231

already walking about this area,            some of whom indeed were asking where

the nearest public houses were.

All Liverpool      coaches arriving at Hillsborough were being directed up

Penistone Rd N, under Wads 1 e)/ Station Bridge, onto Halifax R d , where
                            /                         ------------
they were being parked at the top of the road, with the fans debussing

and then making their                down the road towards the Football Ground on

foot.                        /
                         /
                  /
As the day progressed,            the number of buses being parked obviously

increased over / h e      period of time,     resulting in the buses being

parked closet/ and closer to where we were holding our position.

Whilst thi«/was going on,            thousands of football fans were making their

way down /this road, a large number of whom were carrying cans of

alcohol/ bottles of cider,            cans of beer,   lager,   etc.   The majority of

these/people who were thronging the footpaths on both sides of the

road, were of the younger age element and several of them were quite

boisterous,     singing football songs etc.,          though no trouble was

actually witnessed at this point,            during this period.

As the day progressed,            it became obvious that there were a number of

large groups of these youths walking up and down Penistone Rd N,

apparently aimlessly,            but all carrying drinks of some description.

At approximately 14QQ hrs, a ’Football S p e c i a l 8 arrived at Wadsley
                                      s'
Bridge Station,      where the fans w/re gathered at the bottom of the

bridge and escorted by both ^ o t           and mounted towards Hi 1 lsborouqh

Football G r o u n d .   W h i 1st fost of the fans were walking down towards

the bottom of the hill ,-/there was a large number of fans walking up

the hill enquiring as they went as to whether any of the fans had

spare tickets and I did see at least one youth running beside coaches

as they went up the hill doing the same t                 .

At approximately 145Q hrs, still at thi/s location,               there were still

hundreds of fans making their way dp-wn the hill, apparently in no
                                                                             PAGE         3
                                                                             S2231

hurry and virtually all of whom were carrying drinks of some

des c r i pt io n .

Shortly after this,       the Serial   came together at the bottom of

Penistone Rd N, outside a pub called ’The G a t e ' , where we witnessed

what we were informed by other Officers as some fans            ’making u p ’ after

having been involved in a fight         inside the premises which were all

quiet,    by this time Officers already having resolved the problem.                The

people making up after this trouble were extremely drunk.

Having performed our duty on Penistone Rd N, we should then as a

Serial have made our way to Claywheels Ln Rd Traffic Wing to receive a

meal, and then to remain on standby,          but at this time the Sergeant

received an urgent message by radio to the effect that our Serial was

required immediately at the Leppings Ln end p4 the Ground,             due to

severe problems being experienced at thajr location.            We immediately

made our way there,       being only a coutwe of m i nu te s ’ walking distance

away, and,       on our arrival, we sauya large group of youths being held

back by a number of Officers        placed across the gates     including Mounted

Officers? at this point, we /ere told to line up as a Serial

and then form a cordon acr/ss the entrance, whi ch we did.

Almost     immediately after /do i ng this,   I not i ced a tall Liverpool    fan

who was very obviously dtrunk, start to remonstrate with Of f i cers to my

left, demanding that he be allowed entrance to the Ground.              He was

informed there were problems        inside the Ground    (we were unaware

exactly what at this time), and as soon as they were resolved,               he

would be allowed access.         He was either too drunk to understand this

or just would not believe what he was being told and continued to

demand ent ranee.       He finally tired of s peak ing to Of f i ce r s on the

cordon and then staggered across to the middle of the entrance to

Leppings Ln, where he there started berating a Mounted Officer who

told him to move away from that position and reiterated what had
                                                                      PAGE          4
                                                                      S 2 231

already been said, and he started to turn his horse away from this

man, and the next thing    I knew,   the drunk had f a ljren under the horse

which shied away from him,    standing on the 1<       part of one of his

legs a s it did so, having been helped to pns feet by someone and moved

across the line again to my left where/ne sank onto the pavement to

examine his leg.    Having done this, / e started to get up, at which

point he quite deliberately punchy^ the parapet of the bridge at the

side of him,    ripping the top of/his fingers/knuck1es on that hand to

shreds.    He was then joined b V another man who strenuously encouraged

this person to complain about xhe incident and said he would back him

to the hilt.

A short time after this it became apparent that something was going

wrong   inside the stadium at which point we were taken in through the
                               /
gates of the Leppings Ln engf, where we were formed into a second

cordon and not long aftee' this the first bodies started to be carried

from the direction of/the stand.        There were also at this time people

walking out from the/ same direction in injured conditions.

As this was happening,    a number of Liverpool supporters,     some of whom

appeared deeply shocked and crying,       came from the direction of the

Leppings Ln end and when they saw us standing there in a cordon they

started shouting,   "You fucking murderers",     "Y ou ’re a set of bastards",

"You bastard murderers",    etc. etc.

Having given this matter some consideration after the day's events,             1

have come to the conclusion that these same people knowing with

hindsight what    I do now, must have been at the rear of the crowd in

the Leppings Ln end when the disaster was unfolding as they could not

have    come from any other direction than the communal tunnel     that leads

to and from the Leppings Ln end.

It was at this time whilst still      in the cordon and trying to placate

these people before they got outside onto Leppings Ln itself and in
                                                                                a

       sight of those who were still outside that one of these               'fans’ took a

       swing at me with his fist, which fortunately missed and he was then

       hustled away by another two friends or fellow fans.

       At this    point, a young man, who appeared to have severe rib injuries

       and who was crying in a deeply distressed way, approached me from the

       direction of the Leppings Ln stand.          I took him to one side, as the

    ^j^first ambulance had just arrived,         sat him down, and tried to console

       him as best I could,      but he was too distressed to think rationally,

K      stating that people all around him had died and he had somehow managed

       to escape and he could not handle the fact that he was alive and these

       other people were dead.

       Having done what      I could for him,    I then left him and aided another

       fan who was injured and in deep distress, and I then put them both in

       a place of safety to await the chance to get them into one of the

       fleet of ambulances which were now starting to arrive en masse,                          but

       due to the fact that they were as what would be classed that day as

       'walking wounded',     they were left whilst others more seriously

       injured,   people who appeared dead,       or were unconscious etc., were seen

       first, with the ambulance staff,

       with oxygen and Police Officers attempting to resuscitate whoever they

       thought they could help.

       As this was happening the flow of bodies,         conscious,   unconscious and

       apparent dead was increasing all the time.

       Myself and all the Officers around me were         lending assistance where we

       could and at one point I assisted some other Officers to carry a man

       on some advertising hoarding to what was becomding known as the

       ’casualty clearing a r e a ’ at the back of the Leppings Ln, where he was

       placed at the side of the fence at the rear of the stand along with

       other people to await treatment from the medical staff available.                              He

       appeared to be dead.

         A short time later,    I was instructed by an unknown Police Inspector to

         go with two female Police Officers to the opposite end of Leppinqs Ln

         and keep the access    road which runs along the length of and to the

         rear of the Leppings Ln end clear for ambulances,       doctors,   etc.    to

         have a clear passage through.     With these Officers    I then went to the

         rear of the Police Control Box in the Ground where there were also

         casualties being brought out,    including two young boys who appeared in

         a bad way.

         We did what we could as regards getting ambulances for these injured

         etc. and then secured the road allowing access and egress for

         ambulances and incoming medical staff,    doctors,   nurses etc. who had

         been alerted to the tragedy by local    radio stations.

         We continued to do this for some considerable time, at which point we

         were then instructed to stand down as there were no more ambulances

         coming from the clearing station and we went to the N Stand again for

         the de- brief.

         I was later informed that the man we had taken on the hoarding had

         been resuscitated but I do not know if he survived the day.

         Duty commenced at 0800 hrs at Bentley Police Station and terminated

         there at 2000 hrs.

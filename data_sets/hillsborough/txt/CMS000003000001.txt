 LETTER FROM MR B DEVONSIDE, HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP TO
 THE MINISTER FOR SPORT

 We recently spoke about this matter.           Mr Devonside's letter was
  transferred to this Division by DES to be treated at official
  level.      No indication was given by DES as to whether or not an
  acknowledgement had been sent to Mr Devonside.          I understand that
 Mr Devonside has now telephoned you seeking an explanation
  why he has not received either an acknowledgment or a reply.


  2.   Mr Devonside is the Secretary of the Hillsborough Family
  Support Group and has written to the Home Office on several
  occassions in the past.         Together with other members of the Group
 he met with Lord Ferrers in May 1990 to discuss matters arising
  from the Taylor Report.


  3.     In    the   light   of   Mr   Devonside's   connections   with   the
 Hillsborough tragedy you suggested that you would wish to reply
 him direct^.      A draft reply is attachedblktA "W®*9

                oonaorning- tire implementation of the recommendations of Lord
             Justice        Taylor's       Final      Report        on      the   Hillsborough       Stadium
             disaster.           As you know your letter has been passed                             to this
             Department in view of our responsibilities for matters arising
              from the Taylor Report and for sports ground safety in general.
              I apologise for the delay in replying to you.


             Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there
              is no single solution to all the problems of crowd safety and
             control        that    exist      at     football        matches.         However,       he        was
             satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives than
             any other measure.            This is a view which the Government supported
             when the Report was first published and which it continues to
             support.


             As   you      know    Lord     Justice        Taylor        recommended       that     clubs        in     . .
                                                                                                                      a*M to

            I am aware that the House of Commons all-party committee on
            football recently recommended that the all seater requirement be
            relaxed for grounds in Divisions Three and Four of the Football

 1                                              Wednesday,    8th October.      1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have read your letter to me, for
 3          which I thank you.       Your main concerns I think relate to
 4          the video evidence, Mr. H o u l d s w o r t h 's evidence and the
 5          missing videos.       Is that right?
 6   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    Yes.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Also the evidence of Dr. Walker?
 8   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    Yes.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         So far as the video evidence is
10          concerned that is a very important aspect of my inquiry,               I
11          am looking into it.        I have had detailed submissions made
12          by leading counsel,      both in the writing and orally,       about
13          it and unless you think that there is anything that you
14          can add further to that I would rather suspect that there
15          is probably not much more we can say about that at this
16          stage?
17   MRS.    SINCLAIR:   Have you    interviewed Mr. Houldsworth yet?
18   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Not yet,   no, but I am going to,
19          that is to say if he will come and see me.           I imagine he
20          will.
21   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    I think he will.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART—S M I T H :    I hope to see him very soon.        So
23          that aspect of the case is in hand so unless you want to
24          say anything more about that.
25   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    Well,   as long as it goes in very thoroughly to
26          Mr. H o u l d s w o r t h 's evidence and as regards to the video
27          being missing throughout the inquest that is of great
28          concern to me.       I think it had a lot of impact of the
29          verdict as well as all the other evidence that was, in my
30          opinion, withheld and that wasn't brought to light to the
31          jury.    I am very concerned about that.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: That is something that I am looking
33          into.
34   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    Addressing?
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART—S M I T H :   Yes, absolutely.      I regard that as
36          very a important matter to be addressed.          Equally,   I have


                                           2
 1          had fairly detailed submissions on the significance of Dr.
 2          Walker's evidence.      I do not know whether there is
 3          anything more you want to say about that.
 4   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     Dr. Walker's evidence once again highlights _
 5          it should have been brought forward.        The man himself
 6          waited, you know, to be called and he was not and the 3.15
 7          cut-off time would never have happened,       hopefully,    had he
 8          been called and his evidence would have been submitted.
 9          Dr. Popper would have been able to have a 3.15 cut-off.
10          In my brother's case,     as well as Michael's and a lot of
11          other fans who died, you know,       in my mind a lot more would
12          have had to be dealt with in the aftermath.        The rescue,
13          you know, the rescue of all these people.
14               The questions have never ever been answered.           I do
15          not know any family that has ever been satisfied with
16          anything,    all the inquiries right from the West Midlands
17          Police right up to the day of the verdict.        I don't know
18          any family that has ever been satisfied with anything
19          that's gone on. Every step of        the way we've been stopped.
20
21   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What do    you think the ought to
22          happen?     Do you think there ought to b e ---
23   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     The verdict squashed because if it does not the
24          fight will go on and if we don't do it our families are
25          doing it.     My young daughter is only 16 years of age, her
26          school,   she goes to Broughton Hall High School, they have
27          class debates about Hillsborough and it still goes on.
28          The fight will still go on.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The verdict quashed and a new
30          inquest ordered?
31   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     That would satisfy —    I wouldn't mind,     I know
32          maybe everybody doesn't agree,       but if the verdict was
33          squashed and a new inquest held that would be perfectly
34          acceptable to me, with all the new evidence as well as
35          evidence that we couldn't submit.       As long as that was
36          permissible.     That is the only thing that will satisfy me


                                          3
 1          and ray family and that's the truth.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            What verdict do you think would be
 3          returned?
 4   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     Let put it like this, if I went out of here
 5          today and drove a car and I knock somebody down I would be
 6          held responsible for that.             9 6 people died that day.   96
 7          people.     Someone somewhere is accountable.           Some
 8          accidental death.       Someone somewhere is accountable for 9 6
 9          people dying.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Did you come to the meeting on
11          Monday?
12   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     Yes,   I did.     I 'in very sorry,   I can't speak in
13          public and I can't speak.             I can't speak.   Ann will tell
14          you I'm not very good at speaking.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            You are doing very well now, if I
16          may say so.
17   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     It's how I feel.          I've had a lot, we've all had
18          a lot of trauma in our family.
19
20          this is nothing to do with what s going on now,,
21
22                        and a lot of —          Michael was actually revived.
23          To me he died twice.          He was in with a chance, which a lot
24          of the people who died---
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Did he ge .to hospital?
26   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     No.
27   MS.    ADLINGTON:     No,   sir, Michael's case was one of the cases
28          again on judicial review and strong evidence from a police
29          officer, who was actually brought to the inquest, gave
30          evidence and he .stated that he left Michael breathing on
31          his own.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Who was that?
33   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     P.C. Maughan.       I've actually met P.C. Maughan.
34   MS.    ADLINGTON:     And stated:       "We have one this one."       Michael
35          had very little sign of traumatic asphyxia,            even the post
36          mortem report discloses this.             He was left with a St.

 1           John's Ambulance man down by the Spying Cop area.                 P.C.
 2           Maughan was called away to form the cordon on the halfway
 3           lift®*     Mrs.    Sinclair has had a meeting with P.C. Maugha.ii.
 4   MRS.    SINCLAIR:         I asked him why Michael stood out so much in.
 5           his mind.         Michael must have been one of the first out of
 6           the pens.         The game was still being played.        P.C. Maughan
 7           was a football fan himself and he could even recollect in
 8           his mind what positions the team were playing in and he
 9           told me.
10                    He told me that when he got to Michael, two
11           supporters run up and said come and help him.               He started
12           resuscitation attempts and he said Michael started
13           breathing and he said:            "I've won this one."     They were
14           the actual words he used.               He then placed him on a
15           hoarding with help of the supporters and there was a St.
16           John's Ambulance station being set up.               He carried him
17           down to the St. John s Ambulance.               He handed him over to
18           the St. John's Ambulance men and then he went back.                    He
19           ran back up the pitch towards the Leppings Lane and as he
20          - was running up the pitch he received a call on his radio
21           to form the cordon of the halfway line.               I asked him,      I
22           put to him,        I said:     "But why did you do that when you
23           knew in the crowd there was dead and there was dying?"                      He
24           said:      "He had to.       It was an order.    He had to follow the
25           order because someone had to take charge.               It was chaotic
26           and nobody knew what they were d o i n g . "
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:               I think that is right.     Does this
28           emerge on the body file?
29   MRS.    SINCLAIR:         No, that actually doesn't emerge, that
30           conversation---
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:               Is there a statement from P.C.
32          Maughan?
33   MRS.    SINCLAIR:         Yes, but it was just a statement he made.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              This is something that you have
35           spoken to him personally about?
36   MRS.    SINCLAIR:         Oh yes,    I've spoken personally to him.       He



                                                 5
 1          agreed to speak to me, didn't he, Ann?
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We will ask P.C. Maughan about
 3          that, whether he will remember it now is another matter?
 4   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    With all due respect,   he might because Michael
 5          was the first person he got to and that's why Michael
 6          stood out in his mind.      So he may well remember.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can just I go back to what we were
 8          talking about earlier.      You said if you drove out of here
 9          and knocked somebody over?
10   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    I would be accountable.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It depends really whether it was
12          your fault or not?
13   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    Yes.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It might not be your fault?
15   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    No.
16   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    If it was my fault I would be accountable.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        If it was your fault then a number
18          of things might happen.      If you were very much the worse
19          for drink and you knocked a person over on a pedestrian
20          crossing when you had plenty of time to stop you might
21          well be charged with causing death by reckless driving if
22          you caused their death.      This is a very serious offence,
23          similar to manslaughter.
24               If it was a matter of an error of judgment or
25          something of that sort you were not drunk but you were
26          distracted or you were not paying as much attention as you
27          should have done you might be prosecuted for careless
28          driving.    You through your insurers would be liable to pay
29          compensation in both those cases to the injured person or
30          to the relatives of the deceased if he was killed.
31               One of the problems about inquests is that there is
32          no available verdict between accidental death and unlawful
33          killing.    Unlawful killing is manslaughter.    It is a very
34          high degree of negligence.
35   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    Negligence?
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yes, a disregard for an obvious


                                          6
 1          risk.         In this particular case the Coroner made it clear,
 2          correctly,       that a verdict of accidental death did not
 3          absolve people from blame.                It was not a verdict which
 4          meant that no-one was negligent.                I appreciate that a Lot
 5          of people find this difficult to understand?
 6   MRS.   SINCLAIR:        I personally do.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:                The reason for it is this that it
 8          has been found I think over the years that a c o r o n e r 's
 9          inquest and a coroner's jury is not a very satisfactory
10          tribunal for deciding civil liability.                I personally think
11          very strongly that that is so, I think it is much more
12          important that questions of civil liability are decided by
13          a High Court judge rather than a coroner and a jury.
14          Those questions are decided by a High Court judge.
15                  In this case what happened was, and I do not know
16          whether you were one of the people who put in for
17          compensation,          or not?
18   MRS.   SINCLAIR:        No.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:                A number of people did and they
20          w e r e ---
21   MRS.   SINCLAIR:        Quite rightly so as well if it stops a disaster
22          of this kind ever happening again.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:                Yes, what happened when they put in
24          the claims for compensation was that the police said that
25          they were not going to contest liability.               That meant,
26          although they did not actually formally admit that there
27          was negligence,          they---
28   MRS.   SINCLAIR:        That's why whole point.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:                They accepted that they were liable
30          to pay compensation because there had been negligence.                 To
31          my mind there is no difference between a formal admission
32          of liability in those circumstances,              civil liability I am
33          talking about, and saying: we accept that we are going to
34          pay compensation on a 100 per cent basis.               There is no
35          difference.
36                  I think some of the people the other day were worried


                                                  7
       that there had been no formal admission of liability but I
       am afraid that is not really —          it is not a valid point.
MRS.   SINCLAIR:    We think it is.      I mean the families do think
       it is.    There was a train crash two weeks ago, three weeks
       ago, the first that happened the police arrested the
       driver.     There was five people killed in that.       There was
       96 on that day and you know.          We just hoping -- the whole
       point of all this, the whole point of us.          We've been
       given a little light at the end of the tunnel and I for
       one I really strongly believe I wouldn't be sitting here
       talking to you if it hadn't been for Jimmy Mr. McGovern's
       Hillsborough program.      I firmly believe that.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think that is probably right.
MRS.   SINCLAIR:     I know I'm right.       After eight and a half years
       I do know I'm right.      I'm saying to you now that we hope
       that there is going to be light at the end of the tunnel
       after all this fight.      It's never going to stop and I'm
       just putting my faith in you that you will quash the
       verdict and that is---
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I have to tell you that I cannot
       quash the verdict.
MRS.   SINCLAIR:    I thought it w a s ---
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        No,   I cannot do that.    What I can
       do or what I could do is recommend that the Attorney-
       General applies to the Divisional Court again.          That is
       really all I could do.
MRS.   SINCLAIR:    That could be your recommendation?
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        If I was satisfied that there was
       fresh evidence which rendered the---
MRS.   SINCLAIR:    I am sorry, you keep talking about fresh
       evidence.    What about the evidence that's never been heard
       at the inquest?
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That would come under the
       definition of fresh evidence but it has got to be evidence
       which would affect the verdict, you see?          I tried to
       explain to you on Monday that there were literally
 1          thousands of people who saw a bit of what happened,
 2          hundreds of people who took part in the rescue operation..
 3          It does not follow that simply because they did not all
 4          give evidence at the inquest---
 5   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     It was very selective evidence, wasn't it?        It
 6          was very selective.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The Coroner has to select evidence.
 8          If the Coroner has selected evidence on an unfair basis or
 9          it can be shown he was prejudiced or something of that
10          sort then that is a different matter.        But this is what
11          the Coroner s job is, he has got to, in the same way as
12          Lord Taylor's Inquiry, the people who were presenting the
13          evidence to the Inquiry had to select the evidence which
14          they thought was relevant.        They did not call every single
15          witness that they could have done.
16   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     I do understand that.     I do understand that,
17          but still to my mind —      I mean going back as far as the
18          mini-inquest in Michael's case I was never allowed to call
19          -- the police summary from the West Midlands police stated
20          that no match ticket was found in Michael's effects.           What
21          they didn't say, until I phoned up Matt Sawyer and had
22          murder with Matt Sawyer, was- Michael's jacket was not
23          found.    I said,   "Why did you not put that in?"    I wanted
24          to bring a witness to stand up and say Michael bought a
25          ticket.     He was a Liverpool supporter who runs the coach
26          and has forty-five —     he's a season ticket holder —     a
27          shareholder,    rather, at Liverpool.    We couldn't bring him
28          to say---
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Did anybody ever suggest that he
30          did not have a ticket?
31   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     It was stated no match ticket was found in
32          Michael's effects.     Can you imagine how we felt about that
33          in the light of all the publicity about the ticketless
34          fans that went in the match and supposedly---
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Simply the fact that a ticket is
36          not found afterwards,    even if it is true, would not


                                          9
 1          suggest to me that he had no ticket.
 2   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     But obviously you —   I'm not a reader of The
 3          Sun, obviously you're not.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:  I do not read The Sun.
 5   MRS. SINCLAIR:  But millions did.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I know that The Sun misrepresented
 7          this entirely.
 8   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     Not only The Sun, but it was all over, wasn't
 9          it?     Brian Clough.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       One of the things I should explain
11          to you,    I tried to do this on Monday,   I think may be
12          people did not follow what I was saying.       At Lord Taylor's
13          Inquiry there was a very important and serious issue as to
14          why the police lost control of the crowd outside.       The
15          police were saying it was because the supporters arrived
16          late, there were a lot of drunken fans, they were not;
17          doing what they were told,    they were pushing at the back
18          and they could not control them.      Briefly that is what the
19          police said.
20                  The supporters, on the other hand,   said that, no,
21          okay, there may have been a minority of people who were
22          misbehaving but the great bulk of the fans were behaving
23          perfectly legitimately,    they were simply anxious to get in
24          to see the match and the failure, the reason why the
25          situation got so dangerous outside the turnstiles was
26          because the police were not in control, they were not
27          policing it properly.
28                  That was a very controversial issue before Lord
29          Taylor.     He decided in favour of the Liverpool fans on
30          that.     He made a clear finding that the reason why the
31          police lost control outside was because of inadequate
32          policing.
33   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    They froze, they said.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Just bear with me.   I have had no
35          fresh evidence put before me which suggests that I should
36          review that finding or that there should be a review of


                                        10
 1          that finding.
 2   MRS.   SINCLAIR:   You will stick with that format?
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I will stick with that finding.
 4          This is what I tried to tell the people on Monday.          The
 5          fresh evidence which I have be asked to consider relates
 6          to two things,       in general.    First of all there is the
 7          video evidence which is relevant to the question of
 8          whether the police appreciated or should have appreciated
 9          or did appreciate that those pens were full at the
10          critical time.       That is a very important question.
11   MRS. SINCLAIR:     Crucial, yes.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH CLARKE:           But it has got nothing to do
13          with what happened outside the turnstiles.          The other
14          evidence relates to this 3.15 cut-off point.          That is
15          basically what happened after the disaster and again it
16          has got nothing whatever to do with what happened outside
17          the turnstiles.        So the suggestion which I think has been
18          made in the press that I have made up my mind that---
19   MRS.   SINCLAIR:   Can you understand that suggestion?        You know,
20          I put it to you,_ can you understand that?
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I find it very difficult to
22          understand it because it is just completely contrary to
23          the facts but I do see apparently people did think that
24          but I want you to understand---
25   MRS.   SINCLAIR:   I think that's public opinion, very much so.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          ---that so far from having made Tip
27          my mind against the Liverpool fans I have actually made up
28          my mind on this aspect of the case in their favour.
29   MRS.   SINCLAIR:   With all due respect,       I don't think you could
30          do otherwise.    ,
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART— SM I T H :     That may be so.   All I am trying to
32          explain to you is that at the moment my inquiry is not
33          concerned at all with what happened outside before the
34          gates were opened because Lord Taylor has decided that
35          point.   In my view his decision is supported by evidence
36          and there is no point in that question being reviewed.


                                           11
 1          That is why I was slightly taken aback, to put it mildly,
 2          that anybody should be suggesting that my mind was made up
 3          completely the opposite way.
 4   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     I think it was your own fault,    it was remarks
 5          that you passed.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am not a politician.
 7   MRS.   SINCLAIR:      Probably you've gone into this with all the
 8          other families maybe.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am very sorry about that remark,
10          I regret having made it.     It simply never occurred to me
11          that people would take offence at it.
12   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     Well, you don't understand the strength of our
13          feelings,    this is what we're saying.     You must be detached
14          from it and we don't want you detached, we want you right
15          in there.     I keep saying this, with all due respect, you
16          can t know how we feel if you can come out with a remark
17          like that.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think I do understand.
19   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     I think maybe now with hindsight but you didn't
20          on Monday.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Well, maybe not.
22   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     I don't think a man of your -- an eminent man
23          in your position would have come out with a remark like
24          that.     Had my daughter come out with a remark like that
25          she would have been severely told off and reprimanded by
26          me, but she wouldn't come out with a remark like that.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I hope that is water under the
28          bridge.
29   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    You might hope so but we will have to see,
30          won't we?     But getting back to the 3.15 cut-off, you will
31          be dealing then with the lives that could have been saved,
32          my brother is one of them.        I firmly believe that Michael
33          could have been saved.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What do you think should have been
35          done for him?
36   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     In the first place he was handed over to the


                                         12
 1           St. John's ambulance men.           He was found on his back, he
 2           was not even in the recovery position at twenty-five to
 3           four after he had been out of the pens, resuscitated and
 4           me told by PC Maughan he was resuscitated and given all
 5           the medical evidence there was hardly any injuries on him.
 6           People looked at Michael's post mortem report and say,
 7           "How did he die?"        I spoke to Dr. Clark, he couldn't
 8           really give me an answer but he died through lack of care.
 9           I think had he been taken to hospital,         if he'd been put in
10           an ambulance and taken to hospital Michael would have been
11           here today and no—one will ever, ever convince me
12           otherwise.     He was put in the gym.       I didn't know until
13           Monday at your meeting that there was,         I think it was
14           Louise said there was bags put over their faces, plastic
15           bags put over their faces.
16    MR.    BONE:     What did the ambulance man do to help Michael?
17    MRS.   SINCLAIR:     Nothing.    We can't find any evidence.
18    MS     ADLINGTON:     We don't know if he was put to one side to be
19           picked up by an ambulance.          The family were concerned when
20           Tony Edwards,    the ambulance man,      came forward during the
21           making of the Cook Report and he actually stated that the
22           ambulances were prevented from going on the pitch at half
23'          past three on the grounds that the fans were still
24           fighting.
25    MRS.   SINCLAIR:     And Michael was down there.
26    MS     ADLINGTON:     I would say possibly quarter past three
27           Michael was down that end of the pitch, he was one of the
28           very first ones out, he was out of the pen while the game
29           was still going on.
30    MR.    BONE:     The ambulances were a few yards away on the other
31           side of the road?
32    MS     ADLINGTON:     Michael's papers have been submitted again as
33           part of the appendices because it was one of the six cases
34           that went forward on judicial review.          It's at the back of
35           all the papers.
36                   Another matter of concern was the fact that when the


                                            13
 1          families went down for judicial review they had instructed
 2          an independent pathologist,        Ian West from Guys Hospital.
 3          There was some difficulty in obtaining the post mortem
 4          photographs to enable Ian West to prepare a r e p o r t .      There
 5          was delay in any event.       Eventually South Yorkshire police
 6          released those post mortem photographs to Ian West and we
 7          were told on the Friday as the case started on the Monday,
 8           Sorry,    South Yorkshire police have sent the wrong
 9          photographs in Michael's case."         So those photographs
10          never reached the independent witness.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Have they reached him now?
12   MS     ADLINGTON:     Not at the moment.
13   MRS. SINCLAIR:       They   were lost, they have been lost.
14   MS     ADLINGTON:     They actually sent the photographs of another
15          Kelly.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         These are the post mortem
17          photographs?
18   MRS.   SINCLAIR:     Yes.    I was assured by PC Greenway that he was
19          sorry for the mix up and that they would be sent by
20          courier down to      Dr. West's office on the Sunday before     we
21          went to the High Court, the case was heard and they never
22          arrived.     We've since phoned up and they have been lost,
23          haven't they?
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Is there anything else that you
25          wanted to say to me.
26   MRS.   SINCLAIR:      No, nothing that I can think of.      It will
27          probably come to me later on.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        If it comes to you later then send
29          us a letter about it.
30   MRS.   SINCLAIR:    Right,   I will do that then.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Thank you very much for coming.

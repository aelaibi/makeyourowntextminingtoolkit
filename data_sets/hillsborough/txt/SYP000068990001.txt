that     the      charge          for      seats        is at         least           double         that       for     s t a n d i rig r oo m

experience             to    deal        with        the      arrangements.                   Clubs        are       usually

approached             by the           FA    in F e b r u a r y          to    see    whether          t h e y ar e        prepared               to

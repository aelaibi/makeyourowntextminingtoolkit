            stationed             at    Woodseats.

            On    Saturday             15th       April       1989        (150489)             I    commenced          duty       at       Woodseats

            Police             Station       at    0845       hours.            I then             travelled          to    Hillsborough

                  the          pitch    via       the     South          Stand.           There          were    no    players             on       the        pitch

            but       I saw       a    number        of    Police          Officers                against       the       fence       facing              the

            Leppings             Lane       terrace.            I    ran       over       to       the    wire    fencing             and       I saw           two

            young          girls       on    the     terrace             but    pressed             hard       against          the    fence.                  They

            were          in    the    centre        stand          part       of    the       terrace          between          gates          3       and     4.

            The       girls       were       white        and       both       about       19       or    SO    years       of    age.              T h a t ’s

            all       I    can    remember           about          them       but    I have             since    learned             their             names

            in    their          carotid          artery.            I    climbed          up       the    fence       to       try    and          pull        the

through          the          fence       by       slapping          their        faces,                            ;

As    I was          doing          th^t       someone             climbed        over       the      fence        from       the       terrace

in    order          to       escape          the       crush       and    jumped          down       on     top    of       mt.        All    I    can

remember             was       a    figure          falling          towards          me     and      hitting           me    on    the       head.

I    cannot          describe             the       figure          but    I was        knocked            unconscious              and       came

round       on, t h e          pitch          in    the       recovery          position.               I don't          know       who

carried          me       on       to    the       pitch.

I got       up       and       went       back          to    the    fence        but      the     two       girls       were       no    longer

against          the          fence.

I    then    went             to    gate       3    in       the    fencing           which      I saw        was       open.           This       gate

led    into          pen       3.        Also       at       the    gate       was     Chief       Superintendent                   John

NESB1T       and          a    middle          aged          St.    Johns       Ambulanceman.                     I saw       a    young       white

man,    about             22 y e a r s         of       age    lying       across          the     bottom          of    the       gate

apparently                trapped             by    hislegs.              I think          he    wore        an anorak,                 I don't

know    what          colour.                 S o m e o n e was           lying       across       the       young man's                legs    and

this    prevented                   anyone          getting          through           the      gate.         I    can't          give    a

description                   of    that       second          man.

I don't          know          who       pulled          the       second       of     the      above        men    from          the    gateway

but    Chief          Superintendent                         NESBXT       and     I    pulled         the     man       trapped          by    his

legs    from          the          gateway.              Together          with       an     unknown          Nottingham                Police

Officer          I    carried             the       man       onto       the    pitch.           We     placed          him       about       five

yards       into          the       playing             area       and    to    the     South         Stand        side       of    the       goal

mouth.

I    couldn't             feel          his    pulse          so    the    Nottingham              PC      started           mouth       to    mouth

resuscitation                      whilst          I gave          the    youth        cardiac          massage.              We    were       then

joined       by       PC       Tommy          J A C K S O N (FI          Sub    Division)             who     took over             the       mouth

to    mouth.              We       kept       this       up for          some     time       and      then        the young             man    began

             vomiting.              Because       of    this      we    thought             the    man    was       starting           to    breath

             so    PC    JACKSON          and    the    Nottingham               PC    took       him    to    the     gymnasium.

             I turned          to    return       to    the    fence         and       I saw       some       Liverpool           lads       crowded

             round       another          youth       lying    on      the       ground.           I    can    remember           nothing

             about       him    other       than       he   was     white         and       about       18 y e a r s       of    age.        He

             looked       dead       and    I    couldn't         find       a    pulse.           I grabbed           another          PC,       I don't

             know       who    it    was,       and    together        with           two    Liverpool          fans        we    carried

             the    youth       on    a. p i e c e     of   hoarding             to    the    gymnasium.               I    can't       describe

             the    hoarding          or    the       two   Liverpool             fans.           We    placed       the        body    on    the

             floor,       I    c a n ’t    describe         the     clothing            he    wore       or    describe           him       further.

             I was       then       told    to    keep      unauthorised                people          out    of    the        gymnasium         so    I

             did    not       return       onto       the   pitch.           At       that    time       I was       working           with

            Police        Sergeant          SEWELL.

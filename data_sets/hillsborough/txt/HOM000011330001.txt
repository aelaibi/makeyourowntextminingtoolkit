HILLSBOROUGH AND THE SAFETY OF SPORTSGROUNDS

The Home Secretary, who is on holiday, is concerned about
suggestions in the Press that there may be some dragging of feet
on compliance with the recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's
interim report.   He feels we should know the precise position.
Although the Home Secretary was concerned primarily about clubs,
we should also be aware of the extent to which the police have
responded to the report.

2.   It would be very helpful if we could have a report from each
of the police forces in whose area there are league clubs on the
extent to which, so far as the police are aware, clubs have
managed or are managing to comply with the recommendations and on
the extent to which the forces themselves have complied with
those recommendations which are directed at them.

3.   In Mr Goddard's absence, can I ask whether this is a task
which can be taken on board fairly quickly by the Inspectorate,
perhaps through its regional offices so that we can report to the
Home Secretary?

4.   The alternative is to use. the ACPO machinery, but that
places the entire load on one office, which may delay the
replies.

5.   A list of all the clubs in the Barclay league by police
force area (and ACPO region) is annexed.

6.   We are taking similar action with fire brigades,          though
there are fewer recommendations aimed directly at them.

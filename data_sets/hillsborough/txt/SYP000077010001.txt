            of



            On Saturday 15th April           1989 (150489)         I attended the Hillsborough

            Football Ground,        Sheffield,        to view the match between Liverpool and

            Nottingham Forest.           I travelled to the ground by coach with about

            forty six other people most of them members of the Harrogate and

            District Liverpool S u p p o r t e r s ’ Club.          I caught the coach outside my

                                                                                           S212:

          house and arrived in Sheffield at about               1300 hours



          The    coach parked in the area of Beulah Rd and we all walked to the

          ground from there.         I witnessed no disorder but a                    re

          drinking beer f r o n i ^ n s .     1' stopped near to the ground to get some

          chips and alsafuo        purchase match prog ramines.       I arrived at the ground

          at about     1400 hours.



          Whilst outside the                      Ln entrance   I saw two youths approach a
Orr
          Police Offi cer and J m e y       said somethi ng to the effect that they had
-nrocer
          bought some t i g h t s    from a ’Tout'      but they were for the Nottingham
rq^r
          end.               inted to know if they could use them for the Leppings Ln

          entrance.         The Officer told them to see a steward.          I asked them if

          there were many ticket touts about and they said something                like a

          devil of a lot.         I c a n ’t remember what those two looked like except to

          say that they were white teenagers.



          The Club Secretary,]________________ had to wait outside the Leppings Ln

          entrance for Sheffield m e m b e r y o f      the Club to arrive so that she could

          give them their tickets.           JF waited with                  and another

          mernbe r ,                         of



          Jp to about        1430 hours,    the   crowds at the turnstiles were quite scarce

          but after about        1430 hours,      there seemed to be a rush of people

          arriving at the entrance and the crowds began to become thicker and

          thicker.   There didn't seem to be any queues it was just a mass of
                       /'
                   /
          people j^ound the turnstiles.   There were some Police Officers outside

          the     owd area but I did not see any in the crowds.



          By 1445 hours,       the crowd was very very intense and bundled up close,

u. u
                                                                          PAGE        3
                                                                          S2127

    they all seemed to pushing and shoving.         I became frightened in the

    crowd so                  .             and myself stood in area between two

    large blue iron gates which were opened out forming a type of 'V'

    shape.     These gates afforded us some protection but I was still

    worried.



    Myself and            decided to try and get   i y from the crowd but
                                         c ^ r r
    as I tried to leave the gate area, I caught/my left ankle whilst in

    the crowd.     It was very painful    so I r'^JXirned to the protected gate

    area where                    was still standing,



                    left to get me help and after a few minutes two Policemen

    came and assisted me out of the crowd onto Leppings Ln.         The crowd had

    spread right out from the gate area onto the road.



    The Officers sat me on a wall outside a shop in Leppings Ln.          I

    remained there until about       1500 hours, when I noticed that the crowd

    appeared to have dispersed somewhat.



    At about    1505 hours   I spoke to a Police Officer about my injured ankle

^   and he directed me to the ground First Aid room I walked to the

    First Aid room around the outside of the ground.         The room is situated

    close to the Police      room at the rear of the North Stand.    I remember

    going through a gate somewhere near the Leppings Ln entrance which a

    Steward opened for me.        I arrived at the First Aid enclosure and spoke

    to a St J o h n ’s ambulance woman and she sat me down on a chair.        Later

    they put a bandage type support on my foot.



    After a few minutes      I saw people being   carried and escorted to the

    First Aid room.     I have to say that my memory of the events around the

         First Aid area are very sketchy.            There seemed to be total        confusion

         and t ur mo i1.    Dozens of people j * € r e   being    carried in and escorted in

         by fans,    stewards,    ambulamflmen and Police Officers,           some of the

         people were       laid on the floor nearby but          I cannot   remember their

         descriptions.       The only thing     I can remember specifically was a lad

         being brought       in crying.    I saw that one of his arms,          I think his left

         arm was bent at an angle towards his head but he was conscious.



         I believe it was about        1600 hours when I asked a St Johns ambulanceman

         if the match had been abandoned and he said it was about to be.                         I

         asked him if I could leave and he said yes.                 I then walked out of a

         gate near the Spion Hop and made my way back to the coach.



         I had to wait on the        coach for about forty five minutes for everybody

         to get back,      fortunately/everybody who went on our             coach arrived back.

Dear Mr and Mrs Church
Thank you for your letter of 29 September to the Home Secretary
about the death of,your son, Gary, in the Hillsborough disaster.
The Home Secretary is responsible           for coroners' law bvit coroners
are independent judicial officers           and the Home Secretary has no
authority to intervene in the way           a coroner conducts his enquiries
in any particular case. In fact,            the Sheffield coroner, Dr Popper,
has now retired.
I note your comments about the legal profession but this is not a
matter for the Home Secretary.




Please accept my sympathy for the loss of Gary in such tragic
circumstances.
                                                       Yours sincerely




                                                       J H ROWLANDS

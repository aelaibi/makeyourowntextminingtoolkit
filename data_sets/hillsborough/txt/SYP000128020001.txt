            POLICE CONSTABLE 611 BOOTH

            F 2 SUB DIVISION,    ECCLESFIELD POLICE STATION

            FA CUP SEMI FINAL SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989



            At 9 am (0900)     on the above date    I reported to Ecclesfield Police

            Station where transport was waiting to take officers from F2 to

            Hillsborough Stadium*      At Hillsborough I was briefed along with all

            other officers on duty.      I was one of ten constables     in serial   19

            under the direct supervision of POL PS323 PROCTOR.          Our duties on this

            date were outside the ground in Leppings LN near to the turnstiles

            which were to be used as access        points into the ground for all

            Liverpool   supporters with the correct ticket.       Our brief was to

            receive fans at that location and to maintain order and also to
                                                                              P AGE    2


assist where possible and,          if needed,   serials working on the

turnstiles at Leppings LN.           I was in possession of my personal       radio.



At   11 am   (1100)   that date,   we received a further briefing at the rear

of the West Stand which is at the Leppings LN end of the ground.

This briefing was       carried out by Inspector SYKES who ensured that all

officers were aware of specific duties under his command outside the

Leppings LN end of the ground*           We were instructed to carry out

selective searches of fans outside the ground and to search any

vehicles that were carrying Liverpool            supporters and depositing     them

at the ground.        Serial    19 then went outside the ground to the area of

Leppings LN adjacent       to the turnstiles at the mouth of the official

car park at the rear of South Stand.             It was evident at this point

that large numbers of Liverpool          fans were already in the area, many

of them asking        if tickets were available and also asking for

directions to any local          pubs that might be open.    At 12 noon   (1200)

the turnstiles        into the ground were opened and some fans began to

enter    in an orderly fashion*        Other fans were not interested in

entering the ground and were milling around in Leppings LN in quite

large numbers, many of them drinking from lager cans etc*              Up until

about    1.30 pm (1330),       there did not appear to be any serious     problems

in Leppings LN despite the fact that many fans            (hundreds   in my

estimation)     did not have tickets and were drinking.         From 1.30 pm

(1330)   onwards,     maintaining any sort of order,      either at the turnstiles

or in Leppings LN itself became very difficult.             Officer?, from serial

19 were constantly trying to remove fans without tickets from

Leppings LN.      This task was quite      impossible as droves of Liverpool

fans with tickets were arriving*           The pavements and the road way were

completely blocked and I was made aware that traffic was to be

stopped from entering Leppings LN*           Shortly afterwards a special
                                                                        PAGE


train containing Liverpool     fans was arriving and the fans would

shortly be arriving in Leppings L.N,       By 2!.30 pm (1430)   the situation

in Leppings LN had deteriorated to such an extent that          I would say it

became every man for himself.        There was so much nastiness from some

fans towards the Police that a colleague of mine,        PC2530 Lock ley,

commented that he had never seen a situation quite        like it.    Fighting

broke out    in Leppings LN at about 2*35 pm (1435)*      Some fans were

arrested.     People were   coming up to me and showing obvious forged

tickets,    some of them were mere photostat    copies of originals and

this had created a lot of antagonism amongst supporters.           At about

2*45 pm (1445),    the double gates situate to the     left   (as you look

from outside the ground)     of turnstiles number one were opened to ease

what was obviously a crush at those turnstiles*        Myself and

PC3135 BURNLEE went with Inspector SYKES and other officers and

eventually closed these gates      to prevent any other persons from

entering the ground using that method.        I was then aware that

problems were being encountered at turnstiles A to G and the crush

there was unbelievable.       I went to the perimeter gates situate

fifteen yards    in front of the turnstiles and tried to close one of

them to prevent any more     persons from getting near to the

turnstiles*     These gates were forced open by fans wanting to get to

the turnstiles.     The gates were    pushed wide open and fans began to

scramble through towards the turnstiles*        Double exit gates just       in

the official    car park were opened to ease the pressure of the crush

outside,    one young male fan had already been lifted from within the

crowd and handed over the top to police officers and fans were

scrambling up the outside wall       to get into the ground*    The opening

of these gates caused many people to rush through and lots of

people   in Leppings LN saw the opportunity to gain entry and did so.             I

then heard a loud speaker announcement telling fans to get off the
„.

           message was passed for all available officers to go onto the pitch I

           did so and assisted at t ha t 1o cat ion *

           I am a single man and I live at my parents"                house in

           Liverpool.      I am a Liverpool     supporter and always have been.

           Although I didn't have a ticket for the F A Cup Semi Final match

           between Liverpool and Notts Forest,            I did want to see the match.

                                      So on 1989
                                            Saturday
                                                 (150489),
                                                      15th April
                                                            my m a t e , ______________       and

           myself set off for Sheffield by train.              We left Lime St Station at

           about   1110 hours and eventually arrived in Sheffield at about                 1330

           hours or thereabouts.

           Although the train itself was a "special’ just set on for the

           faotball,     we did seem to keep stopping for no apparent            reason.     I

           think we were delayed by about half an hour.

           When we arrived in Sheffield itself,             we were   escorted off the train

           Station by Police Officers.          There were about four Officers on horses
                                                                            PAGE     i


and a few on foot who were stood on the road static as the horses

guided towards Leppings Ln End.

It was coming up to 1400 hours or just after by the time we arrived at

the Leppings Ln end.

On my way to the ground I didn't see any supporters drinking alcohol

at all and I didn't       see any fighting or drunkenness.       We were all

having a laugh with       the Police Officers on    horseback and there was a

good atmosphere all       around.

When we arrived at the entrance to the ground,             it was already packed

with people.     I was surprised to have even got this far without a

ticket,   because    last year the Police were checking along the road on

the approach to the ground.

In front of the big blue railings there were quite a few Policemen

from the bridge to the shop,         about fifteen or so in all.      They weren't

blocking the way,      they were just stood there.

They d i d n ’t seem to   be checking tickets at    all ~ one of them said to

me,   "Either come in     or fuck off."

He didn't ask to see my ticket.          I just walked past him along Leppings

Ln to see if anyone was selling any tickets.                      bind myself

wanted to buy one.

We couldn't get any tickets at all,          so we walked back up to the

Leppings Ln entrance and      sat on the     bridge wall opposite the

turnstiles,    by this time   it was about 1420     hours or thereabouts*

The crowds at the entrances         to the turnstiles still seemed packed.

They weren't getting any better.           It was chaos.    There was no

organisat ion.      Several Police horses were in amongst the croM/d but

they didn't seem to be doing much good.

          left me on the wall and went back doM/n Leppings Ln towards the

garage at the end by the      Station to     try to get some tickets.      Whilst

he M/as gone the crov/d seemed to get        bigger and it began to
                                                                               PAGE


spill out onto the road.

About this time a Police Land Rover pulled up right by the shop.

There was just one Police Officer       in it and he stood on the ledge of

the door with the door open and started to shout through a loud hailer

to the Police on horses to       "make a line across   the g a t e s . *

He kept shouting it over and over,       but no one seemed to take any

notice,   then he started to get angry.

I don't know whether they didn't hear him or what but they didn't do

anything.     It wasn't as    if he M/as too far away from them.           I think the

Policeman shouting directions was a Senior one because he had braiding

or something on his cap.

I don't know what happened to him then because]                    |came back to

where    I was and had said that the gate had been opened.            So we both

thought we would go and get in.

          still h a d n ’t found us any tickets.

We got down off the wall and went across the road past the Policeman

and joined the crowd.        We walked through the railings and into the

area in front of the terraces.        This area was busy but not as much as

it had been before.     There still weren't any queues at the turnstiles.

At this point            and myself split up and       I headed for a gate.           I

followed the crowd basically.        The next thing     I knew I was at a large

gate by the side which was open,       so I went through the gate.           There

were    lots and lots of people all going through the gate with me and

none of us showed any tickets.        I didn't see any Policemen or stewards

on duty at the gate either outside or inside.          No one was trying to

close the gate.

I was absolutely amazed the gate was open.

As soon as    I was through the gate immediately        in front of me I saw

the tunnel.     I noticed there was a couple of Policemen           and two

Stewards,    I think, at the tunnel entrance.
                                                                              PAGE


Everyone was walking past them.           They weren't making any efforts to

stop people going down the tunnel.

This must have been at about          just before 1500 hours when I got to the

tu n n e 1.

I didn't        really hang around in the yard area after going through the

gate.         I just M/ent straight towards the tunnel   but I didn't see any

fighting or drunkenness and I didn't see anyone drinking alcohol.                     It

still     looked and felt    like a normal Semi Final match.

As I got into the tunnel        I felt it was more packed,    but although it

was full        the crowd was moving.    You had to go with the crov/d though

and I was soon out into the terrace.

At the end of the tunnel        I M/ent into   the right hand pen.    It   felt

packed,        but I didn't realise it was soon to get worse.        I went    into

the terrace and about three or four steps down,           I thought    I would

watch the match from there.           The goal was slightly to my left and I

would have got a good view.

By this time the players were out on the pitch warming up.

When I first got into the terrace          I had enough space around me and wa

fine.         Gradually I felt myself being    pushed further forward by the

crowd behind me.         Then it must have been    about kick off time,       1500

hours, when there was a surge forward very fast and I found myself

right forward,        about six foot from the front fence onto the pitch,             I

had also been pushed across a bit, as I was more or less in between

a gate        in the front fence and the right hand goal    post,     I must have

gone down the gap in between the crash barriers because there was

nothing        in my path all the way to the front.

When we stopped it was absolutely packed, my right arm was pinned to

my side but my left arm was up.          All   I could move was my head.

I expected the crowd to move backwards as it usually does if there's

surge forward,        but it didn't   it just stayed as packed.      That's when I
                                                                              PAGE            5


wanted to get out.

At the back everyone was singing,         and at the front people were

shouting for help and to stop the match.

Although I was only about six feet from the front there seemed loads

of people    in front of me,    between me and the fence,

I knew they were having problems because             I was myself.     I could hardly

breath,   there wasn't, enough room.

It seemed like ages before anything happened,             then I saw a lad getting

through the gate at the front,         but to my horror a Policeman pushed him

back into the terraces.        People were shouting all around me.           There

was a lad next to me on my left.            I said, " W e ’re going to die   here",

and he replied,    "Yes,    I know."

There was a middle aged man in front of me who was turned to the right

so I could see his face.       He was saying something about his son,

over and over.     I didn't know what to say.           I said,    "Drag him up."

He said he couldn't.        I didn't know   M/hat    to say,    he was very upset,

I shouted through the railings to the Police that people were dying                      in

there,    but they took no notice.        Everyone was shouting it to them.

I didn't say anything else because          it was    just getting harder    to

breath.

The man in front of me who I mentioned earlier,                his face was going

yellow,    then his head slumped forward and I knew he was dead,              I don't

know how, just the way he was,         his face.

I would describe him as being about 30 to 40 years old.                 He had dark

shortish hair with a moustache.         He was quite tall, about six foot I'd

say.     It's hard to judge because he was on a lower step than me.                 He

was a well    built chap.     I have since recognised a picture of him in

the Liverpool Echo on the Monday 17th April             1989 (170489), after the

incident.     I recognised it was him.

In amongst the crowd as      I looked around I could see lots of people who
                                                                             PAGE   i


I thought were dead.       Their heads were slumped forward and the colour

of their faces was a yellow and blue colour.          I d o n ’t know what

happened to that man I didn't see him again until when I opened the

paper the few days afterwards.       I think he was there by me,      but     I

thought    I was going to die myself so my attention was elsewhere.

I just didn't    look.    From the newspaper   I found out the man's name was

Thomas HOWARD from Runcorn*

The crowd was still just as tightly packed and there were about four

Police Officers shouting for everyone to move back.           They were

standing on the concrete bit of the fence.        Obviously there was

nothing we could do,      the people at the back didn't    realise what was

happeni n g .

A feM^ Police climbed on top of the fence when they realised what was

happening and began pulling people out,        but because it was so packed

it was hard.

Eventually after what seemed like ages,        I saw the gate to my right

open,    there were Police by it trying to pull      people out and everyone

was just climbing out.       The crowd was so tightly packed that       people

from behind were walking over the crowd to the front to get out the

gate.

One lad had his knee or arm on my shoulder trying to get up and

towards the fence.       I had to push him off me because I was going down,

I knew if I fell    I wouldn't be able to get up again.

Later    I saw           in the next pen to my left. He was climbing over

the fence onto the pitch.       I shouted to him for help but      it was no

good *

Gradually we started to get more room and the crowd swayed to the left

and lots of people fell over,      I turned around

and there was a lad behind me who had fallen too.          Some lads grabbed

him and as he got up he grabbed me to help me to my feet and pulled me
                                                                         PAGE      7


backwards out of it.

There was    loads of room behind me and I moved back,     that's when I saw

so many people just dead on the floor all around me,        that's why we

kept falling over, we were falling over them.

I just switched my mind off at that point and kept telling myself not

to look around but to keep going.         I headed back towards the tunnel

and went back through the way I had come.        My head was banging as

if it were about to explode and I was shaking as though I was going to

callapse.     I walked round for a bit then sat down.      Then I went    into a

nearby shop and the man there gave me a drink and a tablet.         I then

went to look for             and eventually I found him.

At the match I was wearing blue jeans and trainers and a green

sweatshirt thing,      I have got black hair and am about 5*11 tall.

Throughout    it all   I got slightly injured,   I had bruising to my ribs

and chest plus under my arms and the back of my legs was bruised too



One thing    I would like to add is that    it could have been prevented if

there had been proper      controls and organisation outside the ground

before the match.      The FA could have put more thought    into the end we

were given.    We have got far more supporters than Notts Forest.

Thank you for your letter of 16 May 1997 to Jack Straw, in support of recent
calls for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case
for a further public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many
representations which have been received. Concerns that a number of issues
relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed attention following
the Granada television documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which
has been put forward, calling for a new public inquiry. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no
matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. As you will
know, he therefore announced in the House on 3 0 June that there will be an
independent scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the
Court of Appeal. I enclose for your information a copy of his statement to the
House, which includes Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's terms of reference. You will
see that he has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith gives him.

It is our earnest hope that the independent scrutiny will finally bring an end to
the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Re:   Hillsborough Justice Campaign

I know that the issue of the Hillsborough disaster is a matter
you will be addressing following your appointment.

However, may I add my wish that new evidence, which has been
recently forwarded, be examined as part of a fresh enquiry
into the disaster.  I have a number of constituents who have
been affected by the disaster and know they certainly look to
a new government to examine these concerns.

I hope you are able to look at these matters.

Best wishes.

Yours sincerely




David Hanson        MP
Delyn

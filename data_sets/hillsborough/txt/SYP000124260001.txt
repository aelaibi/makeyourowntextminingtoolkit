 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL. IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.   PARTLY IT HAS GOT TO BE THE QUESTION OF THE GATE BEING OPENED ALLOWING

 FANS TO ENTER PENS 3 AND 4 VIA THE TUNNEL.

 2.   THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT GATES OR ESCAPE ROUTES FOR FANS,     IN AMY EVENT TO

 LEAVE PENS 3 AND 4 SAFELY,

 3.   THE PERIMETER FENCE AND OTHER FENCING AROUND THAT AREA WAS IN MY

 OPINION FAR TOO S E V E R E .

 IN GENERAL WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DESIGN Of SUCH AREAS FOR CROWD CONTROL.

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THERE SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF DIRECTION.           THERE WERE A LOT   OF POLICE

CONSTABLES BUT THEY SEEMED TO BE ACTING INDIVIDUALLY AND WITHOUT ANY

ORGANISATION FROM THEIR SENIOR OFFICERS.

ALSO THE FIRST AMBULANCE THAT ARRIVED WAS DRIVEN VERY SLOWLY ROUND

THE PERIMETER OF THE TRACK INSTEAD OF GOING QUICKLY BY THE DIRECT ROUTE

ACROSS THE PITCH TO WHERE IT WAS NEEDED.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 MY OVERRIDING       IMPRESSION ABOUT THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES

 WAS THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTE CHAOS.          THERE WERE NO ORGANISED CpEUES

 WHATSOEVER.        ON OTHER OCCASIONS,   THE USE OF POLICE HQRSESS HAVE TAKEN

 THE BACK END OFF A CROWD TO ENABLE THOSE IN FRONT TO RE/FORM INTO

 P®>ER   QUEUES BEFORE LETTING THOSE AT THE BACK TO THEN REJOIN IT.

 THIS PROCEDURE HAY HAVE HELPED THE SITUATION AT LEPPINGS LANE BUT WAS

 NOT ATTEMPTED DURING THE TIME THAT I WAS THERE.

 I THINK THAT THE CHOICE OF ENDS FOR THE SEMI-FINAL WAS AS IN THE

 PREVIOUS YEAR TOTALLY       ILLOGICAL.     IF THEY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS OF

 PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE THAT NOTTINGHAM FANS SHOULD HAVE THE SPION KOP

 END OF THE GROUND AND THE LIVERPOOL FANS SHOULD HAVE THE LEPPINGS LANE

 END BECAUSE OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE GROUND THEN I THINK THAT AN

 ALTERNATIVE VENUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN,,

                                                                                  PAGE

    CO ORDINATION BETWEEN THE SERVICES.        MANY POLICEMEN       STANDaNG BY THE FENCE

    AND NOT DOING ANYTHING         THE FIRST AMBULANCE GO   N THE WAY OF OTHER PEOPLE

    BEING REMOVED FROM THE PEN..

    GS4

    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEi... IS VITAL TO THIS

    JUDICIAL    INQUIRY?

    THE BIGGEST FACTOR AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED WAS THE LACK OF A PERIMETER CORDON

    BY THE POLICE TO PREVENT PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS GETTING NEAR THE TURNSTILES.


(319

    I MYSELF SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED IN THE WEST S T A N D ,

^ERE         WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OFFICIALS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

    GROUND.     WHEN THE GATE WAS OPENED THE FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO THE

    SIDE P E N S „

    I C A N 51 UNDERSTAND WHY THE GAME WAS NOT DELAYED TO ALLOW THE LOCKED OUT FANS

    TO GET IN.

    I THINK THE F.A. WERE WRONG TO ALLOCATE THE SPION KOP TO THE NOTTINGHAM FANS.,

    I THINK IT A GREAT PITY THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR THE FENCES        IN THE FIRST-

    PLACE.     BUT THERE SHOULD BE SETTER ESCAPE ROUTES IN THEN THAN THERE WAS AT

    HILLSBOROUGH.

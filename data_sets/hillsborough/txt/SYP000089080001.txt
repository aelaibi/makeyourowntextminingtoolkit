           I reported on duty at Hammerton Rji'r olice Station at 9.13am (0913)

           that day.          My duties were ^^6 ty-Serial 3 which entailed duties              in the

           upper    level of the Soutjy'atand where the Nottingham Forest S upporters,

           were to be seated.                  lOam (1000)    I was at Hillsborough Fjxftball

           Ground and was^givers a full briei                        in the North StajcKf with other

           of f i ce rs .     I was given a per^arial ra di o.            I n s p e c W r DARLING was that

           ctuties at several tuj^yf€tiles giving access to J^rg^South Stand.                         From

                               -----
           Forest Supporters began to enter .^fie ground.                     There were all sorts of

           fans, men, women and children all were in good spirits- and seemed to

           be looking forward to the match.
                                                                                      PAGE      2

Towards 2 yoOpm {3^-30)       in the influx of fans          indreased but still they

were w § 4 1 behyfved and good humoured.           About this time I became aware

of a slighX' fault on the radio.           After a message from control was

passed tmere seemed to be a noise as if the handset were faulty.                           We

were lo take our cooked meal         in the grounds gymnasium during the game

and as 3 o'clock approached it had been decided that shortly after the

kick off myself and PC70 WHITELEY an officer on my Serial would go and

eat.




Shortly before 3pm ( J 3 0 0 ) I became aware of t h ^ e           being some concern

Re the size of the crowd at the Leppings Lp/end.                   I heard on the radio

calls from an/officer there         (I c an ’t r e t a i l   who) wanting more nyftnpower

to assist </ith the large crowd.         Iy<fannot say if anyone wasyfli re cted

to assist.         I then remember an Qf f i ce r believed to be Sy«f£t» MARSHALL

requested that some gates b^/opened to relieve pressure on the crowd

at Leppings Ln.         I think^this request was made^n^^re than once but due

to the noise of the crowd near this officer and the interference on

the radio it was difficult to hear him clearly.                   I remember him

telling control that if the gate were not open to relieve                     crowd

pressure there was a great         risk of injury to fans.           The reply from

control was to the effect thaj/if            lives were in danger to ’OPEN THE
                                                                   N SSO ^-

prevent any trouble.



At this time there were more and more Liverpool fans on the pitch at

the Leppings Ln end maybe                                               stretching upto the halfway                      lane.        I cannot

recall any radio messages                                               at this time as to the reason for this.                               We

continued walking to that                                               end.      A line of Foljxrf were                across the pitch

near the half w a y s 'll ne and when we passe 3 tfhro ugh this line that is the

first time I became aware that people had been injured.            Some were

                                                                                 S3334

lying on the ground getting their breath back others were obviously

injured.      Some were just milling about.         We came across a man with a

j.eg inju r x and we took him half carrying him to the First Aid a»€t

near J/fa the gym.      The re we re many injured people at the ^irrst Aid post
                                                                     Kl 7 0 5 s ),
being tended to .       An officer I know from C 1 Di v is i<yr"’PC 2910 CAHMQCK

was in possession of a stretcher and my^^rTf PC. -70 and another stayed

with him and the stretcher and ^jp^^back to the pitch t o                            where

we could.      Lying on the pi>cft we came across a ^etfng man who had an

injury to      the lower^pujart of his stomac h . ^ n e was unable to walk and

obviously      in aafln.      We placed hiau^fi the stretcher and took him to the

First AijJKpost.        I remember one ambulance being there but the First

Aid staff      seemed to be hcp^-irfig difficulty coping with the amount of

injured.       The casu-a-Ky was laid on the floor on a blanket.            We

returned onto^^The pitch with the stretcher as there seemed to be a

great n e e ^ f o r   them.    By now I was aware thj^lnany people were

suffering from bad injuries as they w e ^ T laid on the^yTtch.                I was

aware of /Police Officers^ Ainbular>gHnien, St. Joj»ffs Ambulancemen and

other fans giving a s s i s t a n > ^ t o   persomyfn   need.   Other fans just

seemed to be mi 11 i ng ^sHEfout and it was difficult to see who was in the

most    need of treatment.        Fans had broken down boardings and were

running the full        length of the pitch with injured.       By this time the

Forest fans seemed to real ise the serious nature of the incxji#-rrir and

were applaudi ng Liverpool         fans as they carried off         i nj u r e d .    When

we returned to the injured we came across a ® 4 »/T.aid on the floor                        A

woman was given him cardiac massage and^f^man giving him the kiss of

life.



A   bottle of oxygen w a y ^ l s o     being used to try to revive h i m . ^ A        man

who stated he was^a doctor came and was also assisting.^ftfter about 5

                                                                                       S3334

        dead.     I decided we should renuj've him as quickly as possible and he

        was put on the stretcher.              we neared the gym as^the man dead we

        were instructed to taka/him to the gymnasium wiyifxh he did.             It was

        then on entering th<r gym that I became awat^T of other fatalities as

        several bodies were        laid out with white/^lankets coverino/Chem. We put

        the body dowjpr it was covered and I instructed an offi^rer who had

        assisted        carrying the stretcl^r to stay with tj ?fe body.        (I don't

BocU|   know w pm the officer was).         J m e body was a wh>xe male heavy build
M5€o    a b a u £ 6 ' 00" tall.   He hadr brown hai r .   We^fing a grey/white shirt



                                     I went back cj/ain onto the pitch and was

        separated from the other officers^ I had been with.               By this time there

        seemed to be more medical assistance on the pitch.Ambulancemen                   and

        ambuances were in the vicinity and most of the injured had been moved

        or were being moved.         I can still not recall what was being        said on

        the radio.      Officers were just trying to clear the           pitch of fans so

        that medical assistance        could be given to those in need.


                                     k J*5>S<5>o
        At this time I met up with PS GARDNER who was part of my s e r i a l .            He

        indicated to me that other^people had been injured and bodies were at

        the rear of the Leppings Ln stand outside in the Lane and assistance

        may be required there.         At this time I became aware that the fencing

        at the front of this stand had large holes ripped in it im'd'^I saw a

        barrier had been knocked over.           We attended at tja^rear of Leppings

        Ln.     Some bodj^s had been laid out near t h / t e n c e     to the river.

        Officers had placed barriers in front of them and were stood around

        them.     Several    injured persons were also there next to the wall.

        Officers and medical        personnel were assisting them whilst an ambulance

        arrived.    I assisted the^fe as some fans had started to leave the

        ground.     They we r p f cal 1 i ng Police   'Murdering bastards * and othe r
                                                                              PAGE       6
                                                                              S3334

similar phrases but all officers kept quiet and concentrated on the

job in hand.        I recall a loudspeaijjrf message going out asking fans to

remain in the ground as t h e i p / a s parture was hampering the arrival of

ambulances.        It was neces/ary from time to time to pr^v-ent the crowd

from leaving to all ow/^rribulances to attend to tpelat the i n j u r e d .       The

injured persons w§^e moved prior to the bq^les being m o v e d .



Officers were subjected to much abuse and ridicule by upset Liverpool

fans    leaving.   I remember a number being passed over the radio for

persons to ring re casualties.         I made a note of the number and gave

it other officers as lots o f      people were making e n q u i r i e s   After a

time I remember a fnes^ge being passed on the 1oud^ffeaker that the

game would be canjz^lled and that fans should k e^fp tickets .            Of f i ce rs

who were not engaged in special        duties were then asked to attend at

the North Sjfrand where they were to be given duties as required.                I

attended there       with my Serial.   At this time the extent of the

seriousness of the incident had become apparent and all officers

seemed very upset depressed and confused by the days happenings.

There were no further duties for us to do and we went s a ii duty at 7pm

<1900).
                                                               /

The only time I became aware of the serious nature of the incident was

when I came across the injured people and the bodies.              I felt sick and

helpless.     No one seemed to be able to say what had happened or why.

All    I could do was to assist    in the way I did but even that did not

seem to be enough.

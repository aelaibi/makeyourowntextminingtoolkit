     29th September, 1989

     Professor L. Maunder, OBE F Eng
     Department of Mechanical/Engineering,
     University of Newcastle Upon Tyne,
     Stephenson Building,
     Newcastle Upon Tyne,
     NE1 7RU.

     Dear Professor Maunder,

     Thank you for your very kind hospitality to             land myself last
     Tuesday and we were pleased to be able to talk to you about all the problems
     of staging matches and the implications of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
     1975.

     As promised, we enclose two drawings which Fred has prepared showing the
     sections of the moat at both the Fulwell End and the Roker End of the ground.

     Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to
     give me a call or if you would like to visit Roker Park again we would be
     pleased to welcome you.

     With thanks and kind regards.

     Yours sincerely,




     General Manager/Secretary

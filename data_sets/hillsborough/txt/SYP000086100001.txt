Throughout              the     late         morning           and       early         afternoon           there       was    a steady

to    look       into     s ome         vans       t hat       were        parked        on     pub     car      parks       and    saw       the

As    the     start       of       the       match          drew        c l ose    it w a s      noted        how      it s e e m e d        thau

there       were        scores          of    people           staying            in the        pubs, apparently                   is    no    rush

to    get     to    the       ground.

Everyone           seemed          to    be    in       reasonable?               cheer.

Our    unit        only       responded                to    one        incident         prior        to    the m a t c h .         An

Merries          Road     area.              All       was     quiet        on our         a r r i v a l ..

We    did     not       h ave      a    radio          in    the        back      of    the     van as        I recall         arid so         1 am

not    aware        of w h a t          was    being           said.

At    about        3.10       pm we          were         told       that       we h a d      been    d i r e c t e d to      go    into           the

ground        where        t h ere       was       a      problem.             We w e r e       dropped          off    on Peni s t o n e

Road     and       were       told       to    enter           the       complex         via     gates        7 7 - 7 8 area.            WE    were

then     held       on s t a n d b y          for       several           minutes          not     knowing          what      was

happening.               We     could         only          see     a                    smal^sectiort                 of    the    ground

down     the       passage             towards          the       Spion        Kop      end.       We      could       see    people          on

the    playing           surface,             s ome         j ust       milling         around,         others         running          back       and

Rumours          began        to       permeate             that        someone         had     been       killed,          injured          people

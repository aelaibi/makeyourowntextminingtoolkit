FA/HILLSBOROUGH
          telephoned. She is putting together some more
information for us that was coming in. She would bike that
round on Monday.
With regard to who gave the address at the Counsel meeting
on Wednesday she thought the Chairman may give the address
with me adding in the legal bits. I thought that was
sensible. It would be for the Chairman to decide, she
mentioned that although PRO had got agreements from the
clubs they were probably only soundings out and not
contractual agreements in breach of the UEFA regulations.
In addition Wembley would probably invite the FA on the
management committee. Graham Kelly had also given her a
whole file containing letters from the public to the FA.
She would be copying that for us as well.
Engaged 15 minutes including dictation

Subsequently attending           |who forgot to tell me that
they had received a solicitors letter in from someone who
was injured at Hillsborough. It was the first solicitor's
letter they had received. They were acting for someone
called           who had suffered injuries but no details
were given in the letter. She said she would acknowledge
the letter and tell the solicitors to correspond with us in
future. I said that would be appropriate.

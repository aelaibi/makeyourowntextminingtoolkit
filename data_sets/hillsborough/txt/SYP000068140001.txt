Dated                        060589


               I am      a married        man      and       I live        at     the       above       address          with my       wife       and

               children.

               I have       lived       h ere    for       nearly        17 ye a r s .

               0 n Saturday            15th April            19 89    C 1 504 89)            I attended            t he H i l l s b o r o u g h    ,

               ground       in S h e f f i e l d      on     the     occasion            of    the      F.A.       Cup    Semi     Final      between

               Liverpool          and Nottingham                 Forest.

               I bought          the    tickets         on      the M o n d a y         before       the      ga me      from a      colleague

               for      £10.00      each.        It w a s        a surprise              for    my      12 y e a r       old    son,

               The      tickets        were     for     the      uncovered              seats      in       the    South       Stand    for

               gangway       13     row E E      seats          3 & 4.          We      travelled            by    car    from     home     and

               parked       in Barnforth St                on    s ome     wasteland            behind            th e   barracks.           We

               walked       up    the m a i n      Penistone             Rd     to      the    ground.             We    passed     two      or    three

               pubs,      possibly        thr e e .          All     the      pubs       were      packed          and    the    car       parks       and
                                                                                                                                        PAGE       2
                                                                                                                                        S 1£ 4 0

pavements               in f r o n t       of    them            were       full     of     supporter/■              There        were    mainly

bottles             strewn        outside            the         pubs"       on    p a v e m e n t s ^fnd g r a s s        verges.         They

were          all     orderly,            chanting           and        singing          a n d using' l a n g u a g e .           I would

say a m a j o r i t y             of      them were              worse       the     w e a r fjar d r i n k .         They        were

mainly           Forest         f ans.          There            were       Police         present       at all        the      pubs.

We    got        to     the     ground          about            1.50pm       (1350)        and     we    went       to    the     rear     of

the       South        Stand         to    the       players           entrance            to   see     the    teams        arriving.

W e ’d m i s s e d         the       Liverpool              team       so we        waited        5-10      minutes         for    the

Forest           Coach         to a r r i v e .

A    l a rge        crowd       had       gathered           to    see       the     players          but     soon     dispersed           once

t hey         h ad a r r iv e d .

We    then          made       our     way      to     the       turnstile           where        there       were     no    queues        and

we    walked           straight            through           turnstile             No.      20 and       were       shown       down     the

gangway             by a s t e w a r d          and     another             steward         showed       us    to    our     seats.          We

sat       d o w n a b out         2.0 5      ( 1405)              2.10 p m        ( 1410) .       T h e L e p p ing s L n E n d

and       the       New Stand             (North        Stand)           were        quite empty            but     the     Kop    End     was

r e a s o n a b 1y full.

It w a s n ’t until                  2.45pm          <1445)        that       the     Leppings           Ln End        and      the     North

Stand          started          filling          up w i t h L i v e r p o o l              Supporters.

At    t hat         stage       it w a s        apparent           to me          t ha t    the    two      sections         behind        the

goal          (Pens      3 & 4)           were       filling           up    considerably               quicker        than       the    outer

pens .

At    3.00pm            (1500)         the      two     pens       3 & 4 appeared                  to    be    very/full           but     there

was       a    considerably                amount           of    space       in     the w i n g e d        secyions         (Pens       1 &

About          3 minutes             after       kick        off       I noticed            two    youths          climbing        up    the

perimeter              fence         immediately                 behind       th e    goal        posts       at    which       time     it was

At     the      same      time       supporters                 in thei r h u n d r e <i/. w e r e              still       entering

these        two      pens         via    the       tunnel          entrance,            unfier      the       Leppings          Ln Stand-

Supporters              were        desperately                trying         to    l e ave        these       two    pens       via       the

 gates          in the         sectional                fencing.

My     v i e w was        mainly          th e      gate       from Pen 3               to    the w i n g e d        a r e a Nos.          1 & 2.

Th e     gates        were         very       narrow          and      supporters             could       only       come       out    in o n e 5

and      tw o ' s .       Fans       were          still       entering            through          the       tunnel       into

pens      3 & 4.

I saw a P o l i c e m a n                run       on    to    the      pitch       shortly          after          one    of    his

colleagues              ha d       told       these       two       youths         to    get       down       off    this f e n c e ,          and

speak        to     the     referee.                At    this         time       supporters             were       spilling          onto          the

pitch        and      the      police          and       St.     J o h n s ’A m b u l a n c e       people          were    trying             to

assist          people         from       the       pens       through            the    gates       onto       the       pitch.

Supporters              were        being          lifted        up     into       the       seating          area    in L e p p i n g s            Ln

by     fellow         supporters.

The     game       was      immediately                  stopped            and    within          a minute          there       was       a

barrage           of P o l i c e m e n         entering             the      ground          via Gangway             E of       the    South

Stand        n ex t     to w h e r e          we    were       sitting.             They       went       to    pens       3 & 4 to

assist          supporters               to    get       out     of     the       gates       to    these       pens       but    this          task

appeared           to     be       quite       difficult               as    the    gates          were       very    narrow.

Supporters              were        still          entering            the    ground          via    the       tunnel       and       it

appeared           that        a    lot       of    the       f an s    at    the       front       of    the       pens    were       trapped

from      the w a i s t            downwards             by    the w a l l         underneath             the       fencing.

By     this       time      f an s       were       filling            the w i n g       sections             1 & 2 from          entering

Pen 3        into       Pen        2 through             the     s mall       gate.

By     t hi s     ti me     the      pitch was                quite         full    of       supporters             and    Police          avid St

Johns        Ambulance              personnel             were         carrying          people          to    spaces       on    the          pitch

fatal        injuries           and       they were              not      moving.           The      Police           a n d St       Johns

Ambulance              personnel            then         went       to    help       other       supporters.

By     this       tim e      bill        boards          were       being       ripped          down       and     u s e d as        make       shit

stretchers.                  These        were       being          carried          mainly       by       the     fit      supporters               to

carry        the       serious           injured          from        the      pitch       via    Gangway             E where            I was

sitting           or    to     the       far     corner          of      the    field       between             the      Kop     and      the

North        Stand.            Prior        to      this       an     ambulance            had    arrived             on    the      field and

was     parked          between           the       back       of     the      goal     and      the       fence,          the      Leppings          L.

End    .
Immediately,                 several           fans       wedged          themselves             between           the      ambulance               and

the     fence          trying        to     force         the       mesh       down and          t ha t     proved          to      be

unsuccessful.

At     this       time       the      influx         of    supporters                via    the      tunnel           had      stopped          but

the     Pens       3 & 4 were               still         overcrowded.                 People          were        obviously              in    pai n

and     also       frightened               and      they were              screaming            and       shouting            to    get       out

and     people          were        s t il l     spilling             onto      the     pitch and although                          the    gates

to     the    winged           section           1 & 2 were               cl osed,         people          were       being         allowed          in

Prior        to    the       ambulance              arriving             a white       youth         about         13-15         years         of    ag

didn't        seem        to    respond             to    t he      treatment,             at    which          t i me     he w a s       left

lying        on    the       pitch.            He    had       d ark      hai r      and    he w a s        about          5 ' 4 - 5 ’6.        I

Several           Firemen           then       arrived           down       gangway         E and          immediately               went       down

I c a n ’t q u i t e         remember            whether           it w a s      before        or a f t e r       the     Firemen

arrived          that      the      bill        boards        were     being        used       as    make      shift         stretchers

The      firemen made               sure        that    gangway            E was     accessible             for      injured           peopl

to    be    carried          from        the     ground,           which      was    then       done.

P rior      to    the      g a me     being       stopped,            an    officer        with       a w a 1k i e/t a 1k i e

shouted          from     the       corner        flag        to    the a n n o u n c e m e n t       bo;;,       ^Police

so    he    ran     back       to     behind       th e       go als .

I also        recall         a Policeman               and a P o l i c e w o m a n          climb         o nto     the      wall      next

about       halfway          j us t      behind        us.         y heard         the    Pol i c e m a n      shy'u.t s o m e t h i n g

I c a n ’t e x a c t l y          remember         when         t h is h a p p e n e d    but       it w a s      certainly                at

the    early       stages           of     the    game,        in f a ct         thinking           about      it,      it    could         hav

possibly          been       j us t      before        the     k ick       off.      The       reason       I looked            at    him

was    because           he a p p e a r e d       to    be      anxious          and      in a      hurry and             It h o u g h t

there       might        h a ve     been        trouble         or a f i g h t       behind          us.

The    next       thing        I saw was           an       oxygen         cylinder        being          brought         from

somewhere          on     the S o u t h          Stand        and women            from    the       canteen         staff         were

Round       about        the      s am e    time       an     announcement               came       over    the      loud       speaker-

requesting             the     pitch        be    cleared           in o r d e r     to    get       the    game        re-started.

I think          that     this        request          wa s    given        before        the       firemen         arrived.

When       the    request           was     made       I saw        people         lying       d o w n all        over       the     pitch

and      it a p p e a r e d       to me         that    a major            disaster        had       occurred           and     it w o u l d

have       been    ludicrous               for    the       game     to     have     been       re-started.

Liverpool          f ans       were        by    this       time     agitated            and    very angry with                    Press

It w a s       still       mayhem          on    the    pitch and                about       3.45       (1545)       - 3.50pm

( 1550),         the    majority            of    injured          supporters                had       been    taken       from       the

ground         and     it w a s       at    this       time       that       we    left       to       come    home       and    it was         on

exit     of      the    main      gates          on P e n i s t o n e        R d. we        heard       an a n n o u n c e m e n t     that

th e    g a me    had      been       abandoned.

During         the     incident,            the     Forest         supporters                were       taunting          the    Liverpool

fans     from        the    other          end    of    the       ground and                it w a s        obvious       that    the

Liverpool            fans       had    taken        offence            to    t h is     and       at    one    stage       I thought            a

fight      would        develop            on    the    pitch.

This     is w h e n        the    cordon          of    Policemen                stood       on    the       halfway       line.

The     organisation              during          the       incident,             mainly          by    the P o l i c e ,       was

disorganised               but    saying          that,       it s e e m e d           an    impossible             task    considering

the     situation           they       had       been       put    in.

My     s eat     was    in the         uncovered             area       of       the    South          Stand,       approximately

6 ' (feet)        from      the       section          fence       from Pen             1 and          about    SOfeet          from    the

track      around          the    pitch          near       enough          in    line       between          the    goal       posts       and

the     perimeter           fen c e .

I had a          clear      view       between          and       up    to       the    section             fence    of    Pen    3 & 4.

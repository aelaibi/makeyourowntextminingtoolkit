FILE NOTE DATED 13.9.90.
Mr. Devonside telephoned and I spoke to him for a few
minutes.
1.   He wanted to know when the date of the resumed
     Inquests would be, which I told him, the 19th of
     November.
2.   Whether I was able to tell   him the form and scope of
     the resumed Inquests.   I replied that I was not,
     partly because it was a matter for me and partly
     because I had not yet finalised my thinking on the
     matter and his question was therefore premature.
3.   He wanted to know who was responsible for sflecting
     witnesses.   I explained to him that this was entirely
     my reponsibility.
4.   He asked the same question   again, 'was it I who was
     selecting the witnesses'?    I confirmed that this was
     so.

     I also explained to him that I would expect to be in
     touch with the legal advisers and as might be
     appropriate and necessary.

TURNBULL. TIME 10.57 to 11.24.       0274 391362___________


I managed to get hold of Jim and asked him similar
questions to Mr.     Sturt.


     1.   Did he think that there was any reason why,
          having allowed the officers to summarise the
          evidence of the rescue that I should now have to
          call these people specifically.     Jim Turnbull
          felt "no".    He thought that it was perfectly
          proper for me to allow this evidence to go forward
          on the basis that this would be of benefit and
          help to the bereaved and that it might help them
          with their grieving, but that was no reason why
          one should have to go over it again if it didn't
          in fact advance the primary considerations of the
          inquest.
          I asked him what he thought about meeting with the
          lawyers    and having discussions in camera with the
          exclusion of various parties.     He thought it was
          an excellent idea that he had done it himself and
          he felt that if that having meetings in this way
          procedurally with a view to sorting out the
          running of the Inquests proper had many many
          advantages and tended to facilitate rather than
          hinder.




LESAAD
         He did say that if at such a meeting anybody
         objected, then of course it might be necessary to
         take that into account and act appropriately.

      STTMMABY OP MKKTTNG HELD AT THE MEDICO LEGAL CENTRE. SHEFFIELD.
                             10 SEPTEMBER 1990




Present:           Dr S Popper, HM Coroner, Sheffield
                   J M Jones, Deputy Chief Constable, Cheshire Constabulary
                   Detective Chief Inspector Tope
                   Detective Inspector Perkins
                   Mrs D S Harper, Principal Admin Officer




It was agreed by all present to work through the notes made at the meeting held
at Nechells Green Police Station on 31 August 1990. All present were in
possession of a copy of these notes.

1.   VENUE

     It was agreed by all present that it would be advantageous to hold the
     Inquests at the Medico Legal Centre. However, various aspects would have
     to be looked into e.g. re-positioning of existing furniture, rooms for use
     by various parties, fire regulations. Providing these conditions could be
     met then the Medico Legal Centre would be used. As a back-up Dr Popper
     suggested that he approach the City Council and ask them to look for
     premises in case any of the above conditions could not be met.   It was
     decided that the car park at the Medico Legal Centre could house
     portacabins which could be used as an overflow for press, families etc.

     Dr Popper raised the question of catering, stating that at the Kegworth
     Inquest outside caterers were used and this seemed an appropriate way of
     dealing with the matter. Mrs Harper agreed to look into this
     aspect.

2.   TIMING

     It was agreed by all present that 19 November 1990 would be a suitable
     starting date. The civil proceedings being scheduled to finish on 9
     November this would leave 10 days before the start of the Inquests.  If the
     Inquests were not completed by 19 December 1990 then they would be
     adjourned and reconvened on 7 January 1991.

     Dr Popper agreed to fax a letter to all interested solicitors informing
     them of the date of the Inquests and what aspects they would like aired at
     the Inquest, requesting a reply by return of post.  If nothing is heard
     from the various parties by Monday, 24 September 1990, Dr Popper agreed
     that he would chase up the replies.

     Letters would also be sent to the jury informing them of the date ofthe
     Inquests and asking for a reply by return of post. Again if no reply was
     received Dr Popper would make follow-up enquiries.
     Mr Jones, Deputy Chief Constable, suggested that the pre-inquest review
     should take place before 2 October 1990, the opening date of the civil
     proceedings - Thursday, 27' September 1990 was the date agreed upon.
     It was also decided that a review would take place on Monday, 12 November,
     one week before the Inquests start.

     It was decided that the timing for Inquests the would be as follows:-

            Start                    -   10.00 am
            Lunch                    -   12.30 pm
            Afternoon session begins -   2.00 pm
            Close                    -   4.00 pm

3.   CORONER’S POLICE INQUIRY TEAM

     It was decided that the team could be cut to the following personnel:-

                Superintendent Beechey
                Detective Inspector Perkins
                Sergeant Griffiths
                Sergeant Tredgold
                Woman Police Constable Taylor
                Police Constable     _
                Police Constable        ~|
                Police Constable'    ~1


Detective Chief Inspector Tope would return for the actual Inquests.

If extra staff was required they could be recalled at short notice.

Officers would be working normal hours whilst based at Nechells but twelve
hours when the team is resident in Sheffield.

If a press officer was required it was suggested that Police Constable
Bridgewater could be used for this purpose, perhaps spending a few days in the
press officer to gain first hand experience.

ACCOMMODATION

Due to the present financial difficulties it was suggested by Mr Jones, Deputy
Chief Constable, that perhaps the decision to provide officers with single
occupancy rooms was one that needed to be reviewed.


TRANSPORT

It was decided that the provision of hired vehicles would be best looked at
nearer the time of the Inquests.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT

It was agreed that Miss Henderson would continue to provide administrative
support.
COMMUNICATIONS

Sufficient numbers of pagers and portable telephones already existed on the
Inquiry.

TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT

1.       Dr Popper stated that he intended to use video at the Inquests.

2 & 3.   Dr Popper stated that as the Inquests would be videoed to relay
         the proceedings into the portacabins then he could see no reason not
         to record the proceedings.

4.       If the Inquests were held at the Medico Legal Centre there would be no
          problems with amplification as the equipment was already in situ.

5.       Transcripts would be provided to those parties who requested samewith
          a fee being charged. Dr Popper stated that the City Council would be
          asked to carry out any photostating of the transcripts.

6.       Mr Jones stated that a satellite link for Holmes would be available at
          Furnival House for any research that was required.

7.       It was agreed that any colour photocopying would be undertaken in
          Birmingham so advance notice would have to be given of any
          requirements.

With regard to Furnival House, Mr Jones, Deputy Chief Constable, stated that it
was necessary for the one floor to be retained for use by West Midlands
officers as it contained the Holmes equipment and relevant documentation.  This
was agreed by all present.

EVIDENCE TO BE HF.AWD


Dr Popper stated that he intended to take evidence at the Inquests of what
happened at least until Chief Superintendent Nesbitt arrived on the scene at
3.20 pm.   Dr Popper then discussed how far he wished to go back. He stated
that he would hear evidence for example, on the routes, the pubs, local
residents etc. Dr Popper stated that he would want to hear evidence from
perhaps four categories - supporters, official people who were present but not
police officers etc, police officers and experts, e.g. Health and Safety
Executive.

Mr Jones, Deputy Chief Constable, asked what the role of the West Midlands
officers would actually entail. Dr Popper stated that he saw their role as
followss-

1.   To go through statements of witnesses to ensure we are picking the right
     witness, there may be another witness that can provide clearer evidence on
     a certain point.
2.   Warning of witnesses

3.   Dealing with ad hoc problems as they arise e.g. research of facts.

4.   At the Inquests themselves, providing court usher, dealing with
     press, shepherding people about.

5.   To look after the jury for possibly three or four days and to make their
     hotel arrangements etc.


Dr Popper stated that a West Midlands Police officer would be required to give
evidence on certain facts, something which could be looked at later.

A general discussion then followed on the way in which Dr Popper intended to
conduct the Inquests.

           Dear Doctor Popper

          HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

           I am now in a position to respond to your letter of 31 August 1990 and to
           confirm the telephone conversation I had with your secretary earlier today.

          The requests made in your letter have been given very careful consideration
          by myself and by the appropriate members of the Police Complaints Authority
          and it has been decided that the reports, supporting papers and documents
          should now be passed to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.    I
          am sorry that I was unable to accede to your request to delay such a move
          but the Chief Constable is aware of your interest in the matter.

          Yours sincerely




           Chief Constable
           Investigating Officer
File under Inquests.     Xl Mr. Leslie Sharp and P.C.A. v

FILE NOTE 10.9.90. TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH LESLIE
SHARP.______________________________________________
He told me that it had now been decided to send the papers
to South Yorkshire Police. He said that in his view these
papers were simply and solely to be used for disciplinary
purposes, and that it would be quite improper for them to
be used during and as part of the Inquest proceedings.
He also went on to say that he thought that if we wanted to
use any of the police officers, we might have to obtain new
statements from them.
I said I did not agree with that because the statements
apart from a very few had originally all been taken for
Lord Justice Taylor and for my benefit, and that I felt
myself free to use them if I wanted to.     I said in practice
of course I would be probably calling the witnesses viva
versa.
He said that he had spoken to Mr. Wells and the
Police Authority and had suggested to them that it might be
a wise thing to discuss the position with me and in
particular not to use the statements in any way preducial
to the Inquest.     He thought it was likely that Mr. Wells or
somebody would be contacting me.
He confirmed that he still had a close personal interest in
the matter and no doubt we would be discussing the matter
further.
I thanked him for drawing the attention of Mr. Wells to the
coronal interest.




JOAAEZ
We spent a few minutes talking about the police officers'
evidence.    He thought that if the disciplinary proceedings
were over, they might be more willing to give evidence, but
on the other hand it did raise the issue that if something
came out at the inquest, the whole thing might have to be
re-opened.   He thought it might be that South Yorkshire in
the end would wait and see.    The disadvantage of that was
that the officers would still be in jeopardy and might not
be prepared to say anything.
He wondered whether there would'nt be enough officers who
would not be in jeopardy and who would be willing to give
evidence.    I said I thought that there were quite a lot
like that.

FILE NOTE DATED 8.9.90.MEETING WITH PAMELA GORDON, CHIEF
EXECUTIVE, MR. WEBSTER HEAD OF SOLICITORS DEPARTMENT, DAVID
PURCHON, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND CONSUMER SERVICES
DEPARTMENT.   THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING TO DISCUSS
ACCOMMODATION FOR HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS.__________________


Mrs. Gordon commenced the meeting by saying that there had
been some further developments since the meeting had been
called.   The members had now decided that they would make
the Council Chamber available together with the necessary
number of rooms.   They thought maybe four or five.   The
only condition was that they would like me to vacate them
on the first Wednesday of every month, and in addition, if
it should prove to be unnecessary to have the Inquests at
Council Chambers, that I should move back to the
Medico-Legal Centre.
I said that I was happy with their decision.   I saw no
objection at all to adjourning on the first Wednesday in
every month, though we would probably have to pay the Jury
which would cost about a thousand pounds a day as I didn't
think one could reasonably expect them to go back for one
day in the middle of a long Inquest.
With regard to moving back to the Medico Legal-Centre, I
said that I thought that we would need Portacabins and
links to them so that we had some capacity for overflow.
I also pointed out that there might be difficulties with
regard to normal Inquests bearing in mind that the




LESABF
University Department was expanding and also bearing in
mind that there had been an article in the Star where
people were complaining that they had been "railroaded
aside".    I said my officers had felt that there was a
little justice in this in that the building was so crowded
with Hillsborough people,aQd— Uasit ^Je had a duty to ensure
that the bereaved of Sheffield were properly looked after.
They suggested that it might be possible to hold a routine
Inquest at a suitable alternative location if we could'nt
use the facilities at the Medico-Legal Centre. I said that
was certainly worth looking at.
It was pointed out to me that the Press would be in the
gallery and therefore separate from the main auditorium.
Inquiry was made as to whether I would have television
cameras.   I assumed that this was a reference to T.V.
cameras and the Press and said "no", but thoy»did point out
that we would need video equipment as we would be showing
videos and contrary to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, these
would form part and parcel of the Inquest and would have to
be seen in public by the Jury.     I said that if we did have
video equipment, then I would quite like to have filmed the
proceedings as we had done with the Interim Inquests but I
did not necessarily say that it was an absolutely essential
matter.
                                             />
Mr. Webster said that he would p     u   t    i   n   touch with
me.   I said that I would ask Sue Harper, West Midlands
Police to deal with the accommodation side on my behalf.




LESABF
The meeting then broke up.    Mr. Purchon and Mr. Webster and
I went round. We had a look into the Chamber/ (it was in
use and we could'nt go in).    I was shown Committee Room 4
which was suggested as a Jury Room.    I was shown the Lord
Mayor's Parlour which was considered possible as a room for
Mr. Jones and myself and West Midlands staff.    I was shown
the two big Reception Rooms which would be available during
the day time but would be needed in the evening and there
is a further room upstairs about the same size as Committee
Room 4 for use by the shorthand writers.    I asked about
loudspeakers. Apparently the equipment is not very good.

                     may need to refer to it occassionally

                     transcripts not evidence in proceedings If all
                     parties agree in respect of any particular person
                     may be possible to include some of the evidence
                     as documentary but remember jury and therefore
                     would have to be read.

                    cross examination Cannot stop counsel preparing
                    using these but
                   not adversarial
                   not to be used oppressively
                   not to be used to try to introduce evidence in form
                   of questions.

11.    Length      difficult depends on lawyers etc
                   reserve the right to review need for particular
                   witnesses
12.     Experts    Not civil trial and therefore evidence must   be
                   restricted to relevance
                    and comprehension.

13 . Listing. This is going to be difficult.

14.    Press will be entitled to attend, but because of space constrains
      press passes will probably have to be issued.

15. Comments from floor.

16. Representation of interested parties.

17    Any other business.

    Dear Dr Popper

    ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS - HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

    I attach herewith a copy of a self explanatory letter that I have forwarded to
    the Catering Manager, Sheffield City Council.  I trust this confirms the
    arrangements as previously discussed.

    On Monday 5 November 1990, I attended a meeting at Sheffield City Council to
    discuss arrangements in preparation for the Inquests to be held at the Town
    Hall.

    We discussed arrangements for payment of witness expenses which we have since
    discussed separately over the telephone.  I took the opportunity of advising
    Mr R Michie, that the West Midlands Police Team would be arriving on Sunday
    evening (18 November 1990) for an operational briefing.   I confirmed that
    during the first week it was very likely that there would be a need for
    meetings in the evening to discuss progress and arrangements for the following
    day. Mr Michie agreed that it would be very sensible for you to reside at the
    Moat House Hotel, Sheffield for that first week and that Sheffield City Council
    would meet the expenses appertaining to this requirement.

    We have since spoken and I can confirm that I have made a provisional booking

•   for you on Sunday 18 November 1990, for one night, at the rate negotiated for
    the residence of West Midlands Police officers (ie £52.50 bed and breakfast
    inclusive of VAT).  I will speak to Mr Batley to ensure the appropriate order
    and settlement of invoices is arranged.

    Keep taking your tablets 1

 Dear Wendy

 HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - CATERING ARRANGEMENTS

 I refer to our recent discussion regarding the catering requirements during the
 forthcoming Inquests to be held at the Town Hall.

 I can confirm that the Inquests will open on the 19 November 1990.     During the
 morning, legal submissions will be made and the Jury have been asked to assemble
 by 1.30 pm for the afternoon proceedings commencing 2.30 pm. On that first day
 therefore, there will be no refreshments required for the Jury in the morning.

 Thereafter arrangements will be required as follows:-

 Tea/coffee in thermos flasks and biscuits to be made available in       the anteroom
 (for the Jury - 11 persons) and Committee Room 4 for the Coroner. Sufficient
 quantity to provide a drink before start of proceedings and a mid-morning
 break.  The same facilities to be made available in the same rooms at 2.30 pm
 to allow for a mid-afternoon break.

 As discussed, I can confirm that no formal arrangements for lunch will be
 required for the Jury.  Each member will be given their daily allowance and may
 seek refreshment in the town centre or indeed purchase on an individual basis
 from your servery.  HM Coroner and officers from West Midlands Police will
 purchase a light lunch, probably sandwiches, from the servery next to Committee
 Room 4. You have agreed to make arrangements to serve the Coroner with his
 requirements on a tray, providing prior notice is given that the Court is to
 rise. Furthermore, arrangements will be made to invoice the Coroner on a
 weekly basis for the refreshments that he receives.

 The Inquests which will commence on 19 November 1990 will runon aMonday    to
 Friday basis 10.00 am to 4.00 pm. On 19 December they will be adjourned until
 the 7 January 1991.  It is expected that there will be a considerable number of
 personnel attending the Inquests. These will include members of the legal
 profession, a large number of witnesses, families of the deceased       and the
 press.  I can confirm that all such persons will be required to purchase
 refreshments from you at your prescribed rates.




                                                                       Continued.
I trust this clarifies the matter but do not hesitate to call me on the above
telephone number if I can be of further assistance.

Yours sincerely

Dear
             /
I understand that you are moving today. I hope that it all goes
smoothly and well.

I am faxing up to you a redraft of the schema for the Inquests
(Resmd/inq3). This is modelled on the first draft but I have moved
the sections dealing with the stadium and previous events more to the
end. I think this will have advantages in that we will get into the
events of the day quicker and also the more complex matters will all
be concentrated at the end. I think that there may be other advantages
as well.

I had a useful meeting with Dr. Nicholson. He will have a look at the
Elrond report and let me have any appropriate comments. He will also
have another think about the 14.52 photograph and head count. I had
suggested to him that it might be possible to take for example a
section of high density population which is clear and then extrapolate
to other areas from that. He I think is going to try and compare head
counts in a particular row between this photograph and the one of
15.03 and see whether this adds anything useful.

I also drew his attention to the comment to page 101 of the DPP report
(Part IV). The entry figures through the turnstyles are shewn. If you
calculate these it would seem that all but 374 had entered the West
and North Stands through the turnstyles No 1-16.

The thing that puzzles me is that the area outside those turnstyles
which is physically seperated from the area ouside turnstyles A-G and
which also is larger was just as congested as the area outside A-G. If
the computation is correct who were all the people seeking to enter
through 1-16. and who entered through gate A. If the stands were
full where did they go too.

It may well be that that crowd included some displaced W. terrace
supporters and might well include some non ticket holders but it would
be strange if they all were non ticket holders in that area. Another
explanation I suppose would be that there were people on the stands
who should not have been there and who presumably got through the
turnstyles.

It would be helpful to know whether there are computer print out of
turntyle totals for A-G and 1-16 at different times to 3.00p.m. Do you
know whether this is avaiable. Dr Nicholson said he would think about
this further.
I also had a very interesting talk with Dr. H. Muir from the Cranfield
Disaster centre. She told me she knows you from your other interest
(horses). She will let me have a video on croud behaviour in simulated
life threatening situations in aircraft. At some time we will need to
discuss this to see whether she has something to offer us.

She also told me that they have discovered that the pressures exerted
by group trying to get out of an aircraft is higher than at first
thought. This may be relevant to Dr. Nicholson and his leaning crowd
model.

I am still rather concerned as to how to deal with the documents which
either I or the parties may wish to introduce. Maybe the best thing is
to hear what people have to say on Tuesday and then review our
decisions.

I have assumed that you were planning to come down on Tuesday but if
that is wrong please let me know. If yo are comming what time are you
expecting to be at MLC?


Yours sincerely,

FILE NOTE 26.10.90.MEETING WITH DR. NICHOLSON AT MEDICO
LEGAL CENTRE ABOUT 10.30a.m.___________________________
After introductions and a brief explanation as to what had
already occurred with regard to the Interim Inquests, we
started talking about the H.S.E. report.
Dr.Nicholson confirmed that he felt that he could deal with
most of the information in that report apart from the
mathematical aspects contained in Professor Smith's
studies.
I explained to Dr. Nicholson that in many respects, I did
not think that that was likely to be relevant.   I felt that
bearing in mind that whilst I am trying to sort out the
civil liability aspects or the minor degrees of negligence
I was concerned whether there was any recklessness or gross
negligence and I felt that if the argument came down to
discussions oi ffvu^c    or mathematics, that it would be
very difficult to hold that somebody had been grossly
negligent or reckless even if their viewpoint was different
to somebody elses. Dr. Nicholson agreed with this.
We then discussed what I thought might well be the three
main points namely the barrier.   It seemed clear to me that
we would have to deal with its state and the forces acting
on it, and its capability of withstanding a certain amount
of pressure.   There obviously was rust present and it was
visible.   Apparently Dr. Eastwood had agreed that if he had
seen that amount of rust he would not have passed the
barrier.   I explained to Dr. Nicholson that with reference




BACABC
to the earlier point, i.e., the gross negligence and
recklessness that there were two aspects to this.
  1.     Failure of the particular person constitutes
         gross negligence/recklessness.
  2.     Could one say that that particular failure, even if
         it wasnt grossly negligent/reckless, mitigated or
         reduced the liability of somebody else. In a way this
         widened the scope of the evidence whichhad to be
         given.
  3.     In connection with this I mentioned the work done by
         Mr. Burns, for Helrond Engineering.     I gave Dr.
         Nicholson a copy of the report and          oa •He

         undertook to look through these with a view to
         letting me have a brief          of the major ^ 9 *^
         which might be relevant to the inquest.
We then discussed the ^packing.'      Dr. Nicholson felt that on
thewhole their estimates wereon the conservative          side.
He didn't feel that the picture used by Mr.        Burns was
suitable though he acknowledged this and so        did I that Mr.
Burns might not have had much option because that was the
only picture that may have been available.
I asked him how reliable the figures on their counting on
1452 were.        He felt not terribly good because of masking
and the angle.        I asked him whether it might be possible to
take maybe a section from that photograph and preferrably
the highest density section and then extrapolate from that
to the numbers.       The other possibility would be to compare




BACABC
a suitable area with the 15.03 count to see what difference
if any there was.     He said he would have a look and come
back to me on that.
We then discussed the question of the turnstiles. I pointed
out to Dr. Nicholson that with this being an all ticket
match I wondered whether 750 was the right number.       Dr.
Nicholson drew my attention to the vast disparity in
through putting,cA1
                  the v=aaKtarts turnstiles in the various
sections of the ground.    He felt that this was something
that had to be addressed namely what planning had gone into
deciding how many turnstiles to use for any particular area
and why for instance 1 to 16 hadn't been allocated somewhat
                                                               ci
differently so that at least some of the peopled/might have
been able to go through there.
I then drew his attention to the fact that according to the
computer printout, the West Stand and the North Stand at
3.p.m. were completely full apart from 350 people.       If that
was correct,^and it would appear from the studies which
they had madejf there was no problem with either the
counting mechanism on the turnstiles or the computers, then
what was the explanation for the vast numbers of people in
the area covered by turnstiles 1 to 16, what were they
doing there and where did the people go who were let
through Gate A for example.    It seemed to me, and I put
this to Dr.   Nicholson, that given that there were vast
numbers outside those turnstiles, it either meant that the
people who had been let in previous to these two stands had




BACABC
got in without tickets, assuming that the people at that
point had appropriate tickets or that there was a vast
number actually pressing forward trying to get in who
didn't have any tickets.     Dr.    Nicholson agreed that that
did seem to be the case and at this point was unable to
offer any other explanation.       He said he wanted to have
another think about this because it raised some very
interesting and complicated problems, not only with regard
to the numbers but also to the capacities of the turnstiles
etc. He said he would come back to me as soon as he could
on this point.
We discussed the question of the distribution of the
deceased.   We noted the distribution in front of barrier
124A but Dr.     Nicholson said that unfortunately they had
thought about trying to get some help on crowd dynamics but
in fact were not able to raise anybody who really knew
anything about this subject.

              Concern was expressed over the use of the Council Chamber at this required
              major alterations to the furniture for each Council meeting.  It was noted that
              the proceeding* would have to be adjourned on the firet Wednesday of each month
              to prepare the room for such meetings, (I wag also concerned that the fixed
              furniture in the Chamber did not lend itself for the requirements of a
              Coroner’a Court.)

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

NOTE FOR FILE


Monday 17 September 1990 1530 hours


I attended the Medico Legal Centre in Sheffield for a meeting with Station
Officer Ibbotson, South Yorkshire Fire Service.

I asked Mr Ibbotson for advice on seating arrangements in the court room
at the Medico Legal Centre. He confirmed the present fire certificate
allowed for safe evacuation of all personnel seated in the court room ie

40     in the fixed tier seating
10     in moveable seating to the left
10     jury seats
4      legal representatives
6_     other

70     total


I asked if the fire certificate could be extended to cover additional
personnel if the side seating was re-arranged. Mr Ibbotson confirmed that
an additional 3 rows of 10 chairs could be added leaving 2 side aisles and
an aisle between the fixed seating and additional rows.

To achieve this additional seating, 1 fixed unit of 10 chairs would have
to be removed leaving a total capacity for 90 people.

Mr. Frazer said that he was pleased to be able to tell me
that the Family Support Group had now decided to instruct
the Steering Committee to represent the families.        He said
he thought the instructions would come direct from the
Group rather than through solicitors but that was really a
problem for them.     The nett result would be that either he
                             tfYfV/h
Junior Council and/or Mr. Huytron would be present.      He did
not expect Mr.                         throughtout. Pos sibly
at the beginning or at the end or at any particular
tnrmi»wt.nR point in time when he might want to

cross-examine.
Mr. Frazer wanted to know whether I was having a
Pre-Inquest Review.    I explained that I would have
preferred to have this with solicitors only but we felt
that that would not be a very good idea as it might give
the impression that things were being done otherwise than
in public.   Mr. Frazer felt that it would be right that if
Group members wanted to attend, they should be able to sit
behind but in principle he thought that the meeting could
and should be held with legal representatives only.       He
felt it would be very helpful as it would enable them to
prepare more realistically if they knew what was happening
I explained to him that it was my intention to let them
know as soon as possible the eeeHreitlfer of how I was
proposing to run the inquest together with an indicator of
the sort of numbers that we were likely to be calling.




LESABG
We discussed the     nominations by him of witnesses.    I
explained to him     that whilst I realised there was some
difficulty in that       didn't have access to all the
statements, on the other hand what I was really after was
names of people who he/his clients knew and who they felt
ought to be given the opportunity of being heard.        It
wasn't so much people whom they didn't know about but
people whom they did know who they might want to put up to
me for me to consider.     I repeated that of course in the
end it would be my decision.
He then said that as far as he understood it, I was
intending to run     the Inquest generically, more or less in a
similar form of line to Lord      Justice Taylor.   I said that
that was correct, but there were certain elements of
modification to that.     1.   That if I was calling generic
evidence and was able to find people who could give that
evidence satisfactorily and who had an association with one
or more of the deceased, then I would probably use that
person, as it would enable a certain amount of specificity
to be brought in.    2. That it was my intention to probably
call people like Mr.     Hicks and Mr.   Devonside who had been
present and of course had suffered a tragic loss.        I felt
that it was important that by listening to a number of
people who had maybe strong views, that although this would
in some ways mean that there particular bereaved would be
dealt with in somewhat more detail, it would also mean that
the generics for everybody else would be properly explored.

Mr.   Frazer mentioned Mr.       Spearitt.   I said that he was on
my list for consideration.

  Two things: 1) Mr. Spearritt had rung him. He had raised an issue about
  and announcement regarding Adama survival which was concerning him.
  Mervyn was dealing with the point but is seemed to me that this really
  was outside the Coronal Inquiry. Mr. Spearritt however had indicated
  that he was expecting to be at the inquest and so were several other
  people who he was speaking to. One could therefore deduce that there
  might well be a good attendence. Both of us felt that this was much
  more likely in view of the Clapham verdicts.

   2)     Apparently South Yorkshire Police were now wishing that they had
^^not recieved the D.P.P. report as they had to make a decision as to
^^what to do. I said that it was their fault, we had spelt it out for
   them, at leat spelt it out to Mr. Sharpe and that was all that could
   be done.

  I also told Mervyn that should it come about that South Yorkshire had
  refused to release documents and that I was approached I would suggest
  that the matter be decided by the Divisional court. I didn't think it
  would be right for me to release the documents without their authority
  bearing in mind that there was I think a major point a principle at
  stake.

   3) We also discussed the accomodation, thought that they could perhaps
   ....... enlarge the room on Furnival floor by incorporating some of
   the other space for putting video links in. Both of us thought that
   maybe we ought to consider taking the fourth floor as well.

I told him that we were planning to start on the 19th of
November.   He gasped.    He said he thought there would be a
lot of opposition from Hammond Suddards and the others,
bearing in mind that the case was proceeding there seemed
to be no prospect of a settlement.     He said that obviously
if I set that date they would be ready for it.     He would
let his wife know that he wouldn't be home for 6 weeks.
We discussed the duration.     I said an estimate of 6 weeks
would probably be sensible but they had got some problems
with regard to financing again.     I said I would speak to
Hammond Suddard and would let him know in due course what
was happening.




I telephone Hammond Suddard.     Mr. Metcalf was out.   I asked
if Belinda North         was in but she was in a meeting.
They said she would ring back as soon as she was free.

CALL FROM MR. STEPHEN WALKER, SOLICITOR TO THE SOUTH
YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY.


He told me that he had received the documentation regarding
Mr. Jackson and that initially it had been his intention at
the meeting on Friday to deal with the complaints, but he
had heard indirectly from Mr. Sharp that I had raised an
objection and he felt that perhaps it might be wiser to
defer decision for the time being.   He wondered whether I
would be prepared to write to the Authority.
I explained to him that it was not that Ihad raised     an
objection but that when I was told by Mr. Sharp that    he was
releasing the D.P.P. file to South Yorkshire Police and the
Authority, I had felt that it was unfair          the other
interested parties in the Inquest they should not have
access to this and furthermore I also felt that as one
could not anticipate the findings of the inquest, police
officers who might perhaps be told on thebasis of what was
now available, who had no case to answer as far as
discipline was concerned, could find themselves in jeopardy
in the light of the inquests.   I thought it therefore would
have been fairer to have postponed decisions until all the
evidence was available so that it could all be dealt with
in one fell swoop.
I also explained to him that whilst up to now I had
resisted requests for statements and whilst of course I had




LESAAS
no authority to release them (Blair Peach), I did not think
that once they had been handed over I could legitimately
object from a coronal ploint of view to their release if I
was asked, though of course whether or not they should be
released should be decisions for others to take.
Mr. Stephen Walker said he fully understood the situation
and he was also concerned that if the Authority dealt with
Mr. Jackson whilst the other officers were not dealt with,
this would also create an element of unfairness.    I pointed
out that in a sense he was saying, he was looking at the
situation and saying the same thing as I was but looking at
it from different point of view.
He mentioned that of course if the matter were dealt with,
some of the information might well become public.    I
pointed out that this would merely aggravate the
situation.
I mentioned that Mr. Sharp had said that information had
been supplied simply for disciplinary purposes but that of
course even if the party in receipt scrupulously observed
this restriction, it could still possibly give rise to
complaint from others.
Mr. Stephen Walker thanked me for my assistance, confirmed
that it would perhaps be better if I didn't write at this
stage and that one would have to wait and see what happened
at the Police Authority meeting on Friday.
I had also pointed out to Mr.   S.   Walker Rule 24 which
required notice to be given to any party whose conduct is




LESAAS

     likely to be called in question as well as Rule 20 which
     allows such a person to ask questions of witnesses.

FILE NOTE 11.9.90. QUICK CONVERSATION WITH MERVYN.
This was about 16.40.
I rang him and he rang back because he was busy initially.
I recountered what Mr.   Frazer had said and asked him
whether apart from financial reasons, there were any other
good reasons for starting in November.    Mervyn felt that it
was in everybody's interests, the bereaved, the officers,
ourselves to get it over and done with.   He felt that
         that the inquests were more important than the
civil proceedings and if need be, they would have to have
an adjournement. He thought the correct thing to do was to
stick to the dates which we had fixed and to make it clear
that this is what we were going to do.
I said one of the things that worried me was that I did'nt
want to get into a situation where we had got everything
arranged and then have to adjourn at the last minute.     To a
certain extent this will depend upon the civil trial of
course but if need be, hopefully they would adjourn or have
to instruct other people.
I asked him what he thought about officers etc., who might
have to give evidence in fairly quick succession.    He
thought and I agreed, that probably they would prefer to
get it over and done with as well, that extending it merely
prolonged the agony.

Mervyn Jones rang.       He said that he had a word with Mr.
Sharp, a very pleasant conversation.       Mr. Sharp explained
to him the dilemma he was in, in that the investigation was
strictly speaking, initiated by South Yorkshire Police, the
other parties acting as their agents in effect, and that he
felt he would probably be compelled to disclose the
information to the Chief Constable.
He could see that there was a dilemma but he didn't feel
that he had very much option in the matter.       He said to
Mervyn that he felt that I would have to lose on this
particular one.
Mervyn explained to him that it wasn't any question of
winning or losing. I was anxious that as far as possible,
things should be done correctly, but if the decision was
that information had to be disclosed, then so be it.       It
remained on the other hand, if that were to happen, I might
find that I could not successfully resist confirming that I
had no objection to releasing information to other parties.
Mervyn said that he was waiting for a phone call from
Hammond Suddard, and he would let me know if they had
anything to say.




JOAAEM
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR SHARP AT ABOUT 2 P.M.
I phoned Mr.Sharp and got through to him directly.      I
confirmed that I had heard from the D.P.P.as indeed he had
and   that I thought at some point wewould have to meet to
talk about various things.    I inquired as to what he was
proposing to do in respect of the disciplinary activity (I
did   not tell him that I knew of his plans as in a sense I
had   found out and indeed Mervyn had found out by accident).
Mr. Sharp, very freely and without any hesitation told me
that it was his intention to release the documents on
Friday to the South Yorkshire Police and the Police
Authority in order that the disciplinary aspects would be
dealt with without delay.
I expressed my disquiet at this.    I felt that this
disclosure should not be made until after the Inquests were
completed.   I explained that I felt that the Inquests
might well produce additional evidence which would have to
be reviewed and indeed the D.P.P.   might have to have
another look at the matter.   I also felt that it was
potentially prejudicial that one party should have access
to all the statements, whereas other parties to the
Inquest did not have this facility and even if it wasn't
prejudicial, it would give the appearance of that.
I felt that it might well be legally unsound to release the
documents at this stage before the Inquests were completed
(a point which   did not really accept) for I said that
even if there wasn't any legal bar, I thought it would be
technically a very bad move indeed and it shouldn't take




JOAADR
place and I would much prefer that it didn't.   I said that
whilst I hadn't yet decided about the time of the Inquests,
I would have liked to have done them in November, though I
wasn't sure whether it would be possible to do that.     ^
said that if in fact I was likely to delay the Inquests for
a year or so, then obviously different considerations might
well apply, but in view of the fact that I was intending to
proceed as rapidly as I reasonably could, I thought it
would be better if the release was withheld.
Mr. Sharp explained to me that although West Midlands had
carried out the investigation, this had been done following
a request by South Yorkshire to the D. P.P. and that in a
sense, the West Midlands Police were merely an extension of
the South Yorkshire Police effort in this regard.    I
accepted this of course, but said that although this might
well be so, the fact remained that in this particular
instance, the South Yorkshire Police had been the subject
of criticism and this aspect might still arise to a greater
or a less extent in the Inquests.
Mr. Sharp said he could see the point and that he would
think about it and take advice as to what should be done.
He explained to me that strictly speaking, he should have
submitted the documents to South Yorkshire, even before the
D.P.P. had given his decision, but by agreement this had
not taken place.
I said that as far as I were concerned whether the
non-disclosure was on his initiative or alternatively by




JOAADR
agreement, I would be content.   I was just anxious that the
parties who might be represented at the Inquest should be
equal so to speak and that one of them should not have
access to statements which the other would not be able to
see.
Mr. Sharp queried the proposition bearing in mind that
there were civil proceedings and he thought that these
couldn't or should'nt have taken place.   I could'nt quite
follow the point because in these cases, disclosure of
documentation had not been made just to one side.
I explained to Mr. Sharp that in the final analysis, it was
a matter for him, but it was my very strong view that the
release of these documents should not take place and that I
was asking him at least to think about it very carefully
and hopefully to acceed to what I was suggesting.
Mr. Sharp confirmed that he understood the point that I was
making and that he would think about it, that he would take
further advice.
He then said that I had also mentioned that it might be a
good idea if we met and he said that he would be in touch
next week to see whether we could fix something up.   The
conversation then terminated.

 Mervyn Jones phoned.   He had had a message to ring Mr.
 Kennedy and he was alerting me that something was about to
 happen.   I explained that I had already heard from Mr.
 Kennedy and that I was expecting a fax from Mr. Kennedy
 very soon.   Mervyn rang again.   He mentioned that he had
 quite by chance heard that it was the intention of Mr.
 Sharp to release the statements which had gone to the
 D.P.P. to the South Yorkshire Police Force in connection
 with the disciplinary activities.    He was a little bit
 worried about this.    Indeed so was I.
 I was concerned that this disclosure might seem unfair if
 one party in the Inquests had seen all the statements
 whereas the other parties had not.
 We felt that if the Inquests were to disclose any further
 information it might be necessary for the disciplinary
 matters to be reviewed and it followed therefore that it
 might be more sensible to wait with the disciplinary
 aspects until after the Inquests were re-opened.
 I also thought that it might be incorrect from a legal
 point of view to make this disclosure at this stage.
 In any case, I felt that it would be tactically a very bad
 move and was potentially criticisable, justified or not.
 We discussed what to do and we agreed that I would get in
 touch with Mr. Sharp and see what he had to say on the
 matter and then perhaps discuss it with him.
 in the meantime, just as I put the phone down, the faxes
 from Mr. Kennedy arrived.   Mervyn Jones had said that he




 JOAADR
would find out when it was intended to release the
documents.     He didn't really think it would be until next
week.
Mervyn Jones phoned back a short while later at about 5 to
2 to say that he had been in touch with Nechells and that
in fact the intention was for the documents to be released
on Friday.     I told him that I had already tried to get in
touch with Mr.     Sharp but that he was out.   He suggested
that I might be able to trace him through the Force Control
Room.    I then spoke to Mr.   Sharp, the contents of this
discussion, see separate file note.     I rang Mervyn Jones
back after that discussion and told him that Mr.     Sharp was
going to think about the matter.     I asked whether he
thought it would be worth mentioning the problem to Mr.
Kennedy.     He felt that it might possibly be a wise thing to
do.
I then had a word with Mr. Kennedy on the car phone.      It
was difficult to hear.     The contents of this conversation,
see separate file note.
Mr. Jones rang back. He said he had been thinking about the
matter and in addition to everything else we had said,
there was the public interest immunity aspects of the
matter and the views of the Police Complaints Authority.        I
told him that Mr. Kennedy had already mentioned this to me.
We did'nt feel that we could take this point up with the
Police Complaints Authority, but perhaps when I have next
have the opportunity of speaking to Mr. Sharp, I could put




JOAADR
                              - 3 -



the point to him.
I then went to Barnsley and did an Inquest.   After the
Inquest at about quarter to half past four I had a message
to ring Mr. Jones again, which I did.   Mr. Jones told me
that he had now heard that Mr. Sharp had given instructions
to hold the documentation whilst he re-considered the
matter.
We discussed meeting to talk about the operational side of
things.   He suggested Thursday the 6th or Monday the 10th.
We will agree the date later on.   Later on in the evening,
I phoned Mervyn at home and we decided that Monday the 10th
would be the most convenient despite the fact that it was
rather late and we would meet at my office round about
11.30 or so.

FILE NOTE DATED 30.8.90
I telephoned Mr. Kennedy at about 2.45. from the car (I
had asked Mr. John Scruby to drive me to Barnsley so that
I could use the phone).
I said to Mr. Kennedy that I had heard from Mr. Sharp and
that he was proposing to release the statements which had
been submitted to the D.P.P. now that the decision was
known to the South Yorkshire Police.     I was somewhat
unhappy about this as I felt that the release to one party
was not desirable and I wondered whether in fact he had any
views on the pasaprxatsy of this step.
Mr. Kennedy said that he had not had any discussions with
Mr. Sharp regarding the release of these documents. That
strictly speaking, as far as they were concerned, once the
decision had been taken, the matter was out of their hands.
That they had had nothing whatever to do with the
disciplinary side, and that this was under the control of
the Police Complaints Authority.
Mr. Kennedy mentioned that another factor which might well
come into this was public interest immunity and he wondered
whether in fact the documents could be released in this
form. I did explain to Mr. Kennedy that having spoken to
Mr. Sharp, he Mr. Sharp, said that he was going to think
about the whole question again and re-consider his
decision. At this point the line became very poor and the
conversation terminated.   I rang Mr. Kennedy again but he
was engaged.   I spoke to his secretary.   I explained that I

would now be tied up with an Inquest but that perhaps she
could mention to Mr. Kennedy that if Mr. Kennedy thought it
appropriate, he might care to mention the problem to the
Police Complaints Authority.       She said that she would take
the message in straightaway.       The conversation then ended.

Mr. Jones, when he spoke to me after the Inquest
told me that he had heard that Mr. Sharp had given

This was obviously after my conversation with him and no
doubt he would be considering the best way to handle this
problem which is obviously quite a difficult one.

He was ringing up to find out what was happening.                I
re-counted the substance of the conversation with Mr.
Frazer.   He confirmed that he had heard that the case was
proceeding in October.             He suggested, subject to my
consent, that he get in touch with Hammond Suddard and find
out what their views are with regard to timing, and what
their        with regard to the civil case was.             I agreed.
He mentioned that basically the South Yorkshire case was
a. that their policing was in line with the state of their
art, but that the opening of the gate had created the
situation for which some responsibility should be taken
or something like that and b. that they were entitled to
    that the ground was safe, bearing in mind that the City
Council had licensed it and that the Club had Safety
Engineers, and were responsible for their premises or
substantially that.
I asked him if he could j(ease sort out the long range
weather forecast, and find out what it was if possible.
He also said he would try and arrange for somebody to be
at the civil case, perhaps at least the opening in order
to take some notes so that we know what was happening.

FILE NOTE 4.9.90. TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. FRAZER
11.30 .15 TO 12.02 .27.


I had a message from Joan to say that Mr. Frazer wanted to
talk to me.   I rang him back.    He told me that they were
having a meeting of the Steering Committee to-morrow, that
there was some pressure on them to know what was happening.
He had understood that the civil case was starting on the
2nd of October and it was in fact scheduled to run for 7
weeks.   Their main concern was timing.   When was I
proposing to have the Inquests?
I explained to him that I had not yet contacted him because
I was busy considering the matter.    In some respects I
would have liked to have done it in November time, but I
was not sure whether it would be possible.    He responded by
saying that he felt that taking into account the civil case
(which he felt of course might well be settled and not run
its full course), and taking into account winter and the
problems with travel and so on, that they wondered whether
in fact it would be possible to do things much before March
April of next year.
I said that I thought that sounded a little bit late to me
but I was most interested to hear their view.    I asked him
what the families felt about this and he said he thought
that they were resigned to a delay.
He also mentioned that it was his understanding that all
the parties who will be attending the Inquest would be




JOAAEB
represented by Junior and Silk though he did add that it
might be that parties will change their minds after the
civil proceedings.
He felt that civil proceedings might be of assistance to me
in the sense that if the transcripts showed of anything
interesting, it might give me some guidance.
I thanked him for the indication of the timing that they
had in mind and I said I would certainly bear it in mind.
He confirmed that of course the weather or its effect
depended to a certain extent upon how many witnesses I was
calling and where they came from.
I explained to him that it was quite a difficult problem in
that there were many factors to consider, not least the
retention of the Coronal West Midlands Police Team, but on
the whole I would not want to see them disbanded and then
re-constituted as we would lose momentum and that I felt
that a lot of the credit for the "success" of the Interim
Inquests was due to the excellent way in which the team had
worked.   Mr. Frazer entirely agreed.
We talked for a little while about the form of the Inquest.
He told me that there was quite a lot of strong feeling at
the moment about the D.P.P's decision and that in some
respects a delay in the resumption might help for the
feelings to die down.
He wondered whether I would hear representative witnesses
of certain of the deceased, or what I was proposing to do
though he agreed. He volunteered that it was of course my




JOAAEB
decision as to whom I called and how I ran the Inquests.
I said in some ways it   seemed rather annoying but that we
would probably have tore-hear a part at least of       Lord
Justice Taylor's Inquiry.    He agreed with that.    I said it
was my feeling thatat the moment that I would probably want
to select witnesses from different locations and different
classes, e.g., police,   supporters, club etc.,who would
give generic evidence.      These witnesses wouldnot
necessarily be associated with any particular deceased
person, though there were some at least who one might have
to call because they were relevant, who did have some
connection with somebody who had died.
Mr. Frazer felt that this was a sensible way of dealing
with it. He thought it would perhaps be unwise to be
selective and allow individual witnesses to be called who
were specifically irrelevant to individuals.     He confirmed
that we had very extensively dealt with the question of
who, when and where and that we were really only
considering the how.
I took the opportunity of mentioning that it was important
for people to understand the limitations of an Inquest and
the rules against incrimination etc and that it was
important that people should not come with higher
expectations than what could in fact be achieved, as
otherwise there would be great disappointment.      I said even
if people knew what we could do they might still not be
happy, but at least they would understand the reasons.




JOAAEB
Mr. Frazer mentioned that it was important that I explain
this because the relative informality of the Interim
Inquests would not be repeated at the resumption.
I took the opportunity of mentioning to Mr.      Frazer that I
had heard from Mr.Hicks in his capacity as Chairman of the
Supporters Group, and that letter had been written before
the D.P.P.   had made his announcements.   Mr.   Frazer was
not aware of this but he said that he would be seeing Mr.
Hicks in the next few days and in fact that he, Mr.     Hicks,
was one of his clients in a personal capacity.
I mentioned to Mr. Frazer that I had had it in mind that
once I had decided who of the witnesses at the scene I
would want to call, that I was going to write to solicitors
and ask them if there was anybody in particular whom they
wanted me to consider, reserving of course the right to
make the selection finally myself. Mr Frazer thought
this was a good idea but felt it might be better if I were
to circulate a list of proposed witnesses as this would
indicate to them who I had in mind.   He thought that it
would be quite sufficient if the list was sent to them as
The Steering Committee and they would communicate with the
individial solicitors.
I asked him if Mr. Makin was yet a member of the group. He
said "no he wasn't though in fact they circulated him with
the literature.   I asked about Mr. Cox.   He said as far as
he knew, he had seen solicitors but he had never made any
contact with the Committee. I asked him to let me know of




JOAAEB
any other firm that he might know of who were outside their
umberalla.    Mr. Frazer said that he felt that on balance,
Counsel would prefer rather more notice than less, in that
they would find it easier to have three or four months
notice of the resumption, rather than six or seven weeks if
I were to start again in November.     Mr. Frazer confirmed
that if I wished him to come over to meet with me either
informally of formally with or without other legal
representatives he would of course be very pleased to do
anything he could to make things easier.     I confirmed that
I had felt that the relationship between us, and indeed all
the legal representatives had been good and I hoped this
would continue, as it was in everybody's interests that it
should do so.
Mr. Frazer at one point mentioned that the proceedings
would be adversarial.     I pointed out to him that that
wasn't strictly right and in in fact agreed and said that
they would obviously be inquisitorial though clearly the
fact that there are parties with different interests is an
important factor.     I took the opportunity of pointing out
the limitations of coronal inquests.
I inquired in passing how Mrs. McBrien was.    Mr. Frazer
said that as far as he could see, she had not changed.        I
said I had hoped that perhaps hearing the Interim Inquests
might have helped her.     Mr. Frazer said he didn't think it
had harmed, but neither did he think it had made very much
difference.     I said I was sorry.

TIME 17.52 to 18.11____________________________________
I spoke to Mr. Metcalf.     I explained to him that I was not
in any sense trying to influence his decisions. I was
                                           ^ if
merely trying to find out what the state of po‘was so that
I could try and take decisions which were as helpful as
they reasonably could be.    We discussed the timings.   Mr.
Metcalf said that in some respects, certainly as an
outsider looking in, one would have thought that the
Inquests ought to take precedence over the civil
proceedings, bearing in mind that they dealt with the
deaths of the deceased, whereas the civil proceeding was
dealing with contribution between parties.    This was
perhaps even more so bearing in mind that the bereaved
weren't even involved in the civil proceedings, but they
had already been or were being compensated by one of the
parties anyway.   He also said that he realised that there
were possibly difficulties with regard to evidence for
certain witnesses, particularly if the Inquests had not yet
been completed.   On the other hand he felt that they had
got so far down the road with the civil proceedings that it
would be a good thing to get it out of the way.    He didn't
think that the other parties would agree to a joint
application for adjournment (incidentially he said it was
only the Club and Eastwoods,        apparently are not
involved).   I said that obviously it was entirely a matter
for him but it seemed to me that it might have been better




JOAAEP
it seemed to me that it might have been better if the
Inquests were taking place, and then depending upon the
outcome one would see whether or not there would be a
referral back or whether any other steps would be taken.
Once those things had then been sorted out, it would be
possible to have a clear run on the civil side.     Mr.
Metcalf conceded this but repeated what I had written
earlier re the other part^' In addition, he said that they
had in fact tried   to stay the action sometime ago and had
amongst other grounds suggested that the Inquests had not
been completed.   That had been rejected by the then Judge,
not out of hand but more on the basis that is was
premature.   In some ways, whatever he did it would always
be premature because he wouldn't know which way the civil
proceedings would actually go.   He suggested that it might
possibly be a good idea if I sought legal advice on the
precedence so to speak of the proceedings, but reiterated
that if in fact there was no compelling objection, he would
probably wish to go ahead.   I said that there was no way in
which we could possibly start in October.   That we were
meeting next week to discuss the whole question, and try to
formulate some plan.
Mr. Metcalf said that the pre-trial review on the 21st has
been scheduled at the request of the Judge although there
are one or two matters which need to be discussed, he isn't
entirely clear what the Judge actually intends to do at
this meeting.




JOAAEP
He confirmed that he would let me know of any developements
and any additional thoughts which might come to him and
that he would be quite happy to attend any meetings which
we might arrange to discuss procedural aspects.
We discussed whether the witnesses could be compelled to
answer questions in the civil proceedings.   Mr. Metcalf
said he wasn't entirely sure though he thought that if the
Judge wasn't satisfied with the reason for not answering
and the witness still refused, that they could possibly
face a contempt of court proceeding._____________________
One of the problems that occurs to me is that if the civil
proceedings precede the Inquests they will in effect be
further re-run with a lot of the witnesses whom I would
have to call at the Inquest.   Quite apart from the fact
that some of these witnesses will then have given evidence
and in fact three times over, it would seem a terrible
waste of time and effort.

FILE NOTE DATED 7.9.90. TELEPHONE CALL FROM MERVYN JONES AT

ABOUT 9 A.M.__________ _____     ___

I told him that I had spoken to Mr. Metcalf who
substantiat©«£the same as to him.       I had also spoken to
Counsel and I more or less recountered what had been said
in brief.     I said that on balance, I felt we should either
start mid-January or at the very latest beginning of
February because I did not want to run over the 15th of
April whatever happened.       I also said that another
possibility would be to start in December and have a break
on the 19th or the 20th of December, a good two, two and a
half weeks.     It had various advantages, but of course it
did mean that we would be having hearings in the Christmas
month which might have an emotional impact.
I said there were of course several other considerations
apart from the civil proceedings e.g., the disciplinary
hearings, the West Midlands Police Team.
Mervyn said this was a very important point because there
was apparently some very real problems with regard to
finances.     The Home Office had apparently indicated that
the cash could be carried forward to this year but they had
now gone back on this and South Yorkshire were in
difficulties and there was some discussion already taking
place as to why West Midlands were handling the Inquests.
He said, and we both agreed that there were very many
reasons why the matter should continue as it has done but
there was no way in which money would be able to be carried




JOAAES
forward into the year 91/92, and also it was important to
be able to demonstrate that people's time was not being
wasted.
Mervyn was anxious that I should talk to the local
authority to make sure that they understood that there
would be substantial costs falling on them.     I said that I
didn't see any problems, but that I would talk to them.     He
was going to talk to Mr.    Wells about the financing and
would come back to me if anything transpired.    We were
meeting on Monday anyway.    I said that we would have to
make up our mind then about the timings if at all
possible.

FILE NOTE DATED 6.9.90. TELEPHONE CALL FROM MERVYN AT ABOUT

HALF PAST 5 AT HOME.




He had had a long talk with Mr. Metcalf.   In a nutshell,
Mr. Metcalf had said that whilst he could see some
advantages in adjourning the proceedings till after the
Inquests were over, particularly as he might have some
difficulty with some of his witnesses, he was also inclined
to feel that having got the dates and done the preparatory
work, he ought to go ahead, in which case of course he
would'nt want us to start until they were finished.   The
time schedule was 6 weeks. Mervyn and I spoke for a few
minutes talking about the problems which was facing them,
namely the evidential difficulties, and I said although I
did not really think this had anything to do with me, it
did seem that if I were in his shoes I would have preferred
to have had the matter adjourned and allow the Inquest to
proceed.   I said I thought that if all the parties
requested a Judge for an adjournement I could not see the
Judge not agreeing to that.
We discussed whether it might be a good idea to have a
pre-Inquest meeting, possibly with a open agenda for people
to chip in and make any comments or contributions regarding
the running of the Inquests, but apparently there was a
pre-trial review on the 21st of September and obviously if
he wanted to influence the civil trial, we should arrange

for the meeting before that date.   This really left very
very little time.   In the end I said that I would have a
word with Mr. Metcalf myself to see what I could make of
him in the

           Dear Doctor Popper

          HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

          Many thanks for your letter dated 31 August 1990 in which you set out your
          reasons for wishing to delay releasing the DPP file and statements to the
          South Yorkshire Police until after the completion of the Inquests.

           I am in consultation with the Police Complaints Authority but that process
           is unlikely to be completed until after 10 September 1990.  I will then be
           in touch with you again.


           Yours sincerely




           Chief Constable
           Investigating Officer

                                                                           7
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL



MEETING HELD ON 31 AUGUST 1990 AT NECHELLS GREEN POLICE STATION TO DISCUSS THE
PROPOSED INQUESTS INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 1989


Present:       J M Jones, Deputy Chief Constable, Cheshire Constabulary
               Detective Superintendent Beechey
               Detective Chief Inspector Tope
               Detective Inspector Perkins




In the light of the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions that there
is insufficient evidence to support a prosecution against any party involved in
the Hillsborough Disaster, the following are issues which will have to be
considered for your Inquest


                        1.   VENUE

                        Obviously Sheffield will be the site where the Inquests
                        will be held, however, it is our opinion that the Medico
                        Legal Centre is probably unsuitable for the purpose
                        because of its size. Our reasoning is that there is
                        likely to be a fairly large number of solicitors/
                        barristers representing the various parties to this
                        disaster and they will take some considerable amount of
                        room to accommodate.  Secondly, there is no doubt that
                        the Inquests will generate a considerable amount of press
                        interest and again, there is insufficient room. Thirdly,
                        a number of rooms will have to be made available to
                        various parties i.e. witnesses, West Midlands Police,
                        Solicitors, Press, Jury, welfare support staff etc.

                        Consequently, we recommend to you that we search for
                        suitable premises in the Sheffield area which could
                        accommodate your Inquests.  In anticipation, therefore,
                        we have already put this matter in hand.

                        The usual considerations in so far as security,
                        transcripts, relaying/recording proceedings will have to
                        be considered.

                        The costs again for the provision of this accommodation
                        will have to fall upon Sheffield City Council and we
                        assume that you are going to make them aware. Before any
                        bookings are made our findings will be fully discussed
                        with you and your agreement sought.
2.   TIMING

At this stage we feel it is inappropriate to fix a date,
such as early November, as has been suggested, but rather
that we should carry out a sizing operation which can
only be fulfilled once we have made contact with the
various parties to the disaster as well as considered
what material you and we feel ought to be presented.
Therefore, we recommend no announcement be made for the
time being when the Inquests are going to take place.

Another factor affecting the length of the Inquests will
be whether we have to run through all the previous
evidence given at the Interim Inquests into the deaths of
the 95. If the same jury cannot be re-convened or a
substantial proportion of them, then you will have to run
through all the previous evidence. We are not sure how
you will do this or what time it will take, but it is a
consideration.

Having said that, we are of the opinion that the sooner
the Inquests take place the better and if we can start
them in the late Autumn that would be most acceptable.

A related issue is how long the Inquests will last. We
anticipate that they are likely to last as long as Lord
Justice Taylor’s hearing, which was 31 days, over 6
weeks, if not longer. We also anticipate that you will
probably, have as many witnesses as did he; 174.
Furthermore, there will probably be a number of requests
for full Inquests into how their loved ones died. We
believe this has already been indicated to you by Mr
Devonside and Mr Hicks, but we cannot think that these
will be the only ones who will want to trawl over the
evidence. You will probably be able to identify these as
well as ourselves.

Taking all this into account we see that the minimum
length of your Inquests is likely to be six weeks but
nearer twelve.

Another consideration of course will be whether your
Inquests are interrupted by unusual weather on the
Pennines, which if the experiences of the last two years
is followed, should not present too much difficulty.
However, we will seel
3.    CORONER* s POLICE INQUIRY TEAM

In terms of staffing we would propose the following


Deputy Chief Constable         One
Detective Superintendent       One
Detective Chief Inspector      One
Detective Inspector            One
Detective Sergeants            Four
Police Constables              Five
Civilians                      One
Press Officer                  One
(Rank to be decided)


The above obviously can be expanded according to need.
In addition, on a consultancy basis we have one Detective
Superintendent (Holmes Unit) and two Detective
Constables.

However, we believe if we fulfil the planning properly,
the staffing levels recommended should be sufficient.
However, if the time is compressed and you wish to start
early, obviously more people will have to be brought in.
There is a consideration here with regard to financing
the operation. As you know South Yorkshire Police are
responsible for meeting the West Midlands Police costs
which they have agreed to do. However, such is their
financial position that they are to say the least
embarrassed.  Secondly, if we were to increase levels of
expenditure we could find that there could be
difficulties in South Yorkshire; we say no morel

DEPLOYMENT LOCATIONS - We would propose to carry out
most, if not all, preparation work through the Nechells
office in Birmingham. As we near the time of the
commencement of the Inquests we would then move most of
the team to Sheffield where they would be accommodated
at Furnival House, as before. We would install a Holmes
Incident Room at Furnival House linked back to Nechells.
All of the documentation that we would require for the
Inquests to be taken to Sheffield, but if more was
required it would have to be relayed to Sheffield.

LIVERPOOL - Whether we would post any officers to the
Liverpool office at Knawsley Hall will be determined
nearer the time when we know who we are calling and their
place of origin.
It is not proposed to have any other officers deployed to
any other areas in the Country at this time. However,
during the course of your Inquests, follow-up enquiries
may become necessary and we will have to have a
contingency where we can obviously search the material
that we have already have as well as deploy officers to
locations in order to see "new evidence".

ACCOMMODATION - The officers, during the preparatory
time, will occupy their normal place of residence in the
West Midlands area. However, as the Inquests approach,
perhaps the week before, we will have to take up
residence in Sheffield with most of the team.   We would
prefer a suitable hotel in Sheffield and the Moat House
seems adequate for our needs. We would probably be able
to negotiate special rates again. Of course, you would
be welcome to join us. Bearing in mind that our team
could be there for something in the region of three
months I do believe that all officers should enjoy the
privacy of single occupancy rooms.

TRANSPORT - At the present time all hired vehicles have
been returned. However, there will be a need for some
vehicles both for the preparatory work, as well as being
available in Sheffield during the course of the
Inquests. Of course, some officers will have car
allowances and a policy decision will have to be made as
to how these will be used in conjunction with hired
vehicles.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT - Miss Diane Henderson will
continue’ to provide the Administrative support to the
Inquiry, which will include the payment of expenses,
recording of overtime, hiring of vehicles, booking of
accommodation etc.

In respect of the hours of duty - the work undoubtedly
will be intensive during the preparatory stages as well
as during the Inquests.   It is likely, therefore, that we
will have to return to 12 hour working days. However,
the PNB advice still stands as regards the non-payment of
the 16 hours payment of. officers accommodated away from
home. We would propose that this agreement continues.

COMMUNICATIONS -    Radio pagers and portable telephones
will have to be made available as required.
4.     TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT

Questions that will have to be addressed are:-

1.   Do you intend to show any video of the layout of the
     stadium or the match?

2.   Do you intend to   record the proceedings?

3.   Will there be a need to relay the proceedings to
      other locations (this will depend upon the location
      itself).

4.   Amplification of   verbal evidence.

5.   Transcripts - we   assume that will be the   same as
     before?

6.   Holmes equipment will be moved under the direction
     of Detective Superintendent Cobb and Detective
     Inspector Perkins.

7.   The colour photocopier is now deployed within
     the West Midlands Police area at another location.
     Obviously, we will have access to it but it will
     not be located on site in Sheffield.

5.     BACKGROUND MATKRTAT.

We will have available in Sheffield for your use,
possibly’ in court, a full set of the transcripts for the
earlier Inquests and Lord Justice Taylor’s hearings.
Lord Justice Taylor’s two reports and the 95 body files
will be available. All the photographs in our
possession, together with all of the video material will
also be taken. However, we would not propose to take all
the documentary evidence other than what we anticipate
will be required. However, this can be made available at
fairly short notice and delivered to Sheffield within one
working day.

WHAT EVIDENCE WILL YOn TTKAB     THE INQUESTS?

Our thoughts are that you will have to restrict most
carefully the amount of evidence you will hear and on
what subjects. However, parties to the event may have
different ideas.  It is worth considering what each of
their motives are:-
1. South Yorkshire Police Authority (through their
Insurers).

Will be seeking to establish as much evidence as they can
so far as the culpability of those who attended the
match- They will no doubt seek to illustrate that the
fans contributed to the outcome and that drunkenness and
disobedience to directions played a major part.   They
will also be attempting to illustrate the number of
ticketless fans who were perhaps motivated to force the
situation where the gates were opened.  South Yorkshire
Police Authority and Force will also be seeking to
illustrate the culpability of the Club as far as
capacity, signing, stewarding and issuing of tickets are
concerned. They will also be seeking to place
responsibility on Eastwood and Partners on barrier and
turnstile issues. They will also attempt to show the
nepotism of Sheffield City Council in the licensing
arrangements. All this will be motivated to assist their
civil case which may be heard by the time the Inquests
take place. If they have been heard then their role may
be more defensive as opposed to attacking defensive. As
far as the civil case is concerned we have already
attempted to find out what is happening but we have not
been terribly successful. You may think it appropriate
to write to the solicitors, Hammond Suddards, and
indicate your intention to start the Inquests and ask
them formally what the current position is.

2.   South Yorkshire Police Federation.

Will no doubt be attempting to gain additional
information to assist in civil claim against the Chief
Constable.

3.   South Yorkshire Police Officers as individual
represented.

As you are aware all the senior police officers who have
been interviewed have been legally represented and they
may well retain these through the Inquests.  Their
motivation will be to defend themselves against any
police disciplinary proceedings and, of course, any
criminal proceedings which may follow a voluntary bill of
indictment.  (Attached to this note is a list of
Solicitors representing the parties - Appendix A . )
Of course, we have grouped together the relatives and
fans in general, but it may be that they are sub-divided
when it comes to the Inquests and may be group or
individually represented.  The Football Association would
probably be keen to be involved, which could lead to
Football Association and Football League representatives
being present.

4.   Sheffield   Wednesday Football Club.

To maintain the status quo so far as Lord Justice
Taylor’s hearings are concerned and to defend their
liability against the South Yorkshire Police Action.

5.   Sheffield   City Council.

To defend themselves as per (4) above.

6.   Eastwood & Engineers.

As per (4) above.


We feel that your Inquests should now concentrate on
"how" people came to meet their deaths at Hillsborough.
To a certain extent we have already dealt with the "why",
"where" and "when", in the preliminary Inquests. As has
already been said we may have to re-open those to satisfy
certain individuals, but generally speaking we should be
able to dismiss fairly quickly those aspects of your
Inquests.

As far as "how" is concerned we would suggest that you
concentrate on the period between say 1420 hours when the
crowd had noticeably built up, through to Superintendent
Greenwood running on to the pitch at 1505 hours plus to
stop the match. We would say that the Anacapa, or
perhaps a newly prepared schedule, listing the
appropriate witnesses would be able to take you through
this time sequence.

The difficult bit is what additional evidence to lay.
Haw far would you want to go back as far as background is
concerned?

You may wish to address this in a general sense giving a
flavour of the evidence, with perhaps some expert
evidence from a West Midlands Police officer as to haw
proportionate that is to what was taken.  In respect of
the latter we think particularly in respect of the amount
of drunkenness and unruliness during the build up to the
crush outside the ground at about 1420 hours onwards.
In addition, you may wish to take representation from the
various parties listed above, and any of those we have
missed, should you wish to pursue a particular line. You
will no doubt then decide whether you think it is
appropriate to hear that evidence.

We have noted that you intend to ignore Lord Justice
Taylor’s earlier hearings and report findings. We think
this is correct, albeit during the natural course of the
Inquests no doubt legal representatives will refer back,
which is probably unavoidable.

You will also require expert evidence with regard to a
number of technical aspects.  The barrier will be a major
point of concern. You will obviously require the Health
and Safety Executive and possibly the Forensic Science
Service evidence.

The turnstile layouts and the pen arrangements will also
be of concern. Again the Health and Safety Executive may
help.

Also the behaviour of people in crowds and crushes is one
that we do not think you ought to ignore. We are already
researching the possibility of finding an expert on crowd
psychology and adaptive behaviour.

THE PROPOSED PROGRAMME

We feel that the next stage is for you to write to the
various legal representatives indicating that you have
heard the Director of Public Prosecutions decision and
that you intend, at some stage, hopefully in the not too
distance future, to re-convene the Inquests in
Sheffield. We feel that you should indicate that you
will decide what evidence will be heard, but before doing
so, we would welcome any thoughts that they have, in
writing, about aspects that they would like aired at your
Inquests. Of course, your invitation will be without
prejudice!

Once you have received the responses to those letters
within a certain deadline, we can then consider their
representations in the light of thoughts we have had in
the meantime as to how we progress the Inquests.   The
product of those details will then create an agenda for
staff at' Nechells to develop the preparatory work as well
as the logistical work to which we have already referred.

You may consider a role that we could adopt is as acting
as a "buffer" between yourself and the legal
representatives. We could usefully follow up any letter,
on an informal basis, in order to ascertain precisely
what they are expecting and what the likely requirements
are to acceding or denying their individual requests.

Another aspect we would like to direct your mind to is
what kind of questions you are likely to ask for the
information held in the HOLMES system. Much of the
information is readily accessible but can be more
difficult in some areas when we have no theme. We will
need the maximum amount of notice to be able to address
these issues in good time for your Inquests.

One final point in this section is your legal
representation. As we recall you have already consulted
with Mr Michael Powers and you may wish to engage him
again for the Inquests on your behalf. Indeed, there may
be questions that may come out of our preliminary
enquiries which will have to be addressed to him so that
you can be appropriately advised.

OTHER CONSTnfflttATTOMS

As was the case with the earlier Inquests, we will have
to consider the role of the various welfare support
services', witness warning, transportation and
accommodation.

We also believe that there will be considerable press
activity at the beginning and during the course of
certain notable witnesses and at the end of the
Inquests.  The extent to which this will become a problem
will be determined by "other news" of the day. However,
we believe that the families of the deceased will be
doing their utmost to engage the media machine to
publicise their case. Again we intend to service the
press professionally with a dedicated officer.

 Dear Mr. Sharp,

                                     Hillsborough Inquiry

 Thank you for your letter of 30th August following my telephone
 conversation with you earlier that date.

 I was aware of the matters mentioned in your second paragraph except
 for the PCA statement which you refer to.

 I am aware of the complex and intertwined relationships between the
 various investigations that have been carried our on behalf of Lord
 Justice Taylor, myself, the PCA and the DPP. I am also conscious of
 the need to minimise delay in sorting out the disciplinary aspects for
 the reasons which you mention.

 Nevertheless as you know I asked you to reconsider releasing the DPP
 file and statements to the South Yorkshire Police until after the
 completion of the Inquests.

 The Inquests having begun proceeedings are sub judice until the
 matter is completed. Inquests are not adversarial and in that sense
 there are no parties to them. Nevertheless certain persons have
 various rights under the coroners rules and there can be little doubt
 that individual officers and probably the SYP force would fall within
 the terms of of the rules.

  I think that to disclose to one party information and statements some
  of which at least would form the basis of the the evidence which will
  be used at the Inquests
     i.   gives that party a potential advantage
     ii. does not appear to be fair and
     iii. is or gives the appearance of being against the rules of
          Natural Justice
Generally speaking I have been against early disclosure though it may
be necessary for the smooth running of these very complex inquests to
modify my practice a little. However in principle I feel that if
disclosure is made to one party then one would have to be prepared to
let others have the opportunity of studying the documentation too.
There are restrictions on the power of the coroner to release police
statements which have not been given in evidence but it would be
difficult I think for me to resist a request to confirm that I had no
objection to WMP releasing copy statements if I knew that they were
already in the possesion of SYP.

The scope and form and content of the evidence and the verdict of the
jury cannot be predicted. It follows that after the completion of the
Inquests it may be that a further look might have to be taken by other
parties at various aspects in the light of what might have been said
or done at the Inquests. This could include questions of discipline. I
would have thought it better and more cost and time effective to say
nothing of reduction in trauma to the officers involved if the
question of whether there have been any breaches of discipline were
dealt with at the end of the Inquests when the matter hopefully could
be dealt with once and for all rather than have the uncertainty that
the matters might have to be reopened.

The following considerations are strictly nothing to do with me as
coroner particularly as there is a division between your
responsibilities so that you are dealing with the DPP and PCA
side of thing . You might however like to weigh the following:

   1.   The position with regard to the Hillsborough disaster
        is already highly charged and I am anxious that nothing should
        be done which could upset or inflame rightly or wrongly a tense
        situation. I fear that if it became known that there had been
        disclosure to one party before the Inquests are completed it
        would generate a great deal of upset.

   2.   I am not fully conversant with the rules and provisions of the
        PCA but I seem to understand that public interest immunity
        might have to be considered. This raises a rather interesting
        thought as to the interrelationship of this with the duties of
        Discovery in civil proceedings. I do not know the answer to
        this but no doubt your legal advisors would be able to offer
        guidance.

In the final analysis the decision as to what should be done will have
to be yours but I hope that the points made above will be helpful in
your discussions and decision taking.

Please let me know what your decision is in due course.

I should perhaps add that I am active considering the timing for the
start of the resumed inquests but am not yet able to give you a date.
I hope however that it will be possible to commence in the relative
near future though the intervention of Christmas and winter does
present some problems.


Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper.

Dear Mr, Sharp,

Thank you for your letter of 30th August following my telephone
conversation with you earlier that date.
1 was aware of the matters mentioned In your second paragraph except
for the PGA statement which you refer to,
I m aware of the complex and intertwined relationships between the
various investigations that have been carried our on behalf of Lord

There are restrictions on the power of the coroner to release police
statements which have not been given in evidence but it would be
difficult 1 think for me to resist a request to confirm that X had no
objection to WP releasing copy statenents if I knew that they were
already in the possesion of SIP*
The scope and fora and content of the evidence and the verdict of the

              Dear Doctor Popper

              HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


              I write following our telephone conversation of 30 August 1990 during which
              you requested that I delay sending my report and supporting evidence to the
              Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.

              You are aware that my report and all supporting evidence has been sent to
              the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the Police Complaints Authority.
              You are also aware that the DPP has decided that there is insufficient
              evidence to prosecute any person or organisation for any criminal offences,
              and that the PCA has issued a statement certifying satisfaction with the
              manner in which the investigation has been carried out.

              What I must do next is submit my report and the supporting evidence to the
              Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police so that he, or his Deputy Chief
              Constable, can consider whether any officer should face disciplinary
              charges.
                                  *                                                      r
              Of course, it is possible to delay any disciplinary action until any civil
              proceedings, including the inquests, are concluded, but such a delay needs
              careful consideration.    Possible effects on the proceedings, on force
              discipline, on the interests of complainants, on the welfare of the
              officers, and the general public interest, are just some of the issues
              involved.
For the moment I have delayed sending my report and supporting evidence, to
South Yorkshire Police, but it would be helpful if you would write to me
setting out your reasons for seeking the delay.

I shall be seeking the advice of the PCA on Monday 3 September 1990 so an
early   reply from you would     be  appreciated,  perhaps  by  Facsimile
Transmission.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely_____________

Bear Dr. Scraton,

Further to ay letter of the 27th of April, I aa still
considering your request of the 23rd of April.

Before I finally make up ray mind, I would value your coaments
on the following two pointsi-

          a. You will appreciate that thfci Inquests ara atill
             ongoing and therefore subjudice. Can I have
             your confirmation that if oopies of the transcripts
             are supplied, no publication will take place until
             after completion of the Inquests.

       b.     I aa very concerned about the question of confidentiality
              if transcripts are aupplied to you aa a research
              organisation. In particular I am concerned about the
              fact that publication of details relating to individual
              cases may cause upset to members of the bereaved families.

I would be grateful if you could please confirm to me that should
yourpresentation be prepared in such a way aa to identify individual

Dear Dr Popper,
As part of the broad remit of the substantial research project,
Hillsborough   and After:___ th e L iv e r poo l E xp eelfln gfi, we are
attending the    inquests of the ninety-five people who died          at
Hillsborough.    As part of this work it is important that            we
obtain transcripts of the proceedings currently taking place.          I
would be grateful if the project researcher attending the
inquests, Sheila Coleman, could be provided with the transcripts
as they are made available. The project will reimburse your
office accordingly.


Many thanks in anticipation.

Yours sincerely,

             I have agreed with Dr Popper, the Coroner, that we will prepare the
             copies of the original transcripts and the accompanying !C ! referenced
             plans.  The costs of preparing these will be re-charged to the Coroner,
             except those specifically prepared for us.  Sergeant John Killoch should
             assist us in this task in conjunction with Mrs S Harper, Principal
             Administrative Officer.

             Dr Popper will supply us with the full set of transcripts, together with
             a list of 'C' reference numbers in respect of the plans produced. Once
             in possession of these transcripts copies should be produced by our print
             room as liaised by Mrs Harper.  The numbers required are as follows:-

             Day 1              100 copies
             Day 2 - 1 2          50 copies
             Day 13            1 00 copies

             Further, in respect of the Coroner, myself and Detective Chief
             Superintendent Foster, the following will be required for each of us

             Volume I          Transcripts of Days 1 - 1 3 inclusive with deceased index.
                                (May have to be in parts if too bulky in o n e ) .

             Volume II         Exhibits marked    up with 'C ' numbers in numerical order      with
                                deceased Index.

             Volume III        Photographs referred to in exhibits above in an appropriate
                               order (I take your advi ce ) and an index by deceased.

             Mr Sharp may also wish a c o p y , but I leave you to ask him. Please make
             sure this task does not frustrate the progress of Mr Sharp's

HILLSBOROUGH

Telephone conversation with Mr. Natrass 2.5.89. He confirmed
that he had taken legal advice and that although there was
overlapping legislation it was apparently felt that because
the primary and principal responsibility lay with the Local
Authority in connection with the crowd control and safety at
i         Hums etc. the incident was not reportable to the

The consequence of this was of course that they would not have to
attend the inquests as far as I was concerned.
He did confirm that the research laborotory and service division
of the Health & safety Executive was looking at the metal work
but that this was a different department to his. Apparently the
man in that office is Dr. ClAs Nicholson.

  FILE NOTE     -    INQUEST 4 MAY 1990




I realised that I had forgotten to ask the solicitors
whether they wanted to say anything.       I immediately asked
Mr. Jones to go back to enquire whether they wanted me to
reconvene before the jury left.      I received the message to
the effect that Mr. Fraser said he was quite unable
to say anything, but in fact legal representatives came to
see me afterwards.     Mr. Fraser thanked me and shook me by
the hand.     He confirmed that the only thing he wanted to
say was to thank me personally, and he was quite content
with the situation.


Mr. Catchpole, Mr     -fcynn. and Mie-s Addlesby said that they
did not want to say anything but thanked me for the way in
which the Inquest had been conducted. Miss       Addlesby, in
                                                                  ^nd
particular said that she was impressed with the sensitive/          judicial
way in which the matter had been dealt with.


I enquired as to their whereabouts.       Mr. Catchpole comes
from London, Mr. Limb, I think was from Nottingham and Miss
Addlesby was from Leeds, or was it possibly the other way
round, I am not quite sure.




REVAAG
MEETING WITH SOLICITORS AND COUNSEL PRIVATELY ON THE THURSDAY
  /                           z7“
2tbh of APRIL 1990. DICTATED       of APRIL 1990.__________

I was approached during the morning by my Officer to say that the
TiogftT^ftiro^tlvoa would like to have a private meeting with me about
one or two points which they were concerned about. I agreed to meet
them during the lunch hour. We met in the lunch hour. Present
was myself, Mervyn Jones, Stan Beechey as well as the representatives
for the Federation, The Chief Constable of South Y0rkshire, Sheffield
Wednesday Club and Mr. Frazer for the bereaved. There were two issues
which were raised. The first one was the question of facts. The
Police representatives on the whole found it hurtful that civilians
were sometimes picked out in contrast to police dfficers and they
wanted thanks either not to be given or to be given generally or
at least to be given in such a way that everybody was included
with individuals perhaps being picked out. Mr. Frazer was asked
to give an assurance on this. He had already indicated that he was
quite willing to talk to the families about the thanks but in the
final analysis if a family wanted to thank somebody in particular
and not somebody else he was1going to do what he was instructed.
My view was that we could not force families to thank people they
did not want to. It was perfectly proper for them to thank people,
but I had been conscious of this anomaly myself and that itrhad jarred
mme, but that the familes had to do what they felt best. In the end
I was listening and hearing the evidence and in due course I would deal
with it as appropriate. On the whole it was felt that this was not
likely to be a real problem.
The second concern was something concerning the Ian Whelan Inquest.
On that occasion Mr. Frazer stood up and asked why had it had. taken
so long for the family to be notified of the death. Although I
made it clear to the Jury in the course of the Inquest,/^•ar?ous
comments were made that this was outside the terms 6f the Inquest,
I did note that it was obviously very upsetting for the family
and I mentioned that problems were experienced, not just at Hillsborough
but everywhere with Incident Bureaus and emergency Telephone Numbers
and these were things which clearly needed looking at at some point.
I also raised the point that one of the officers did mention that
Ian cqrried a card with his name on it, but that there was no indication
in the statement that it also carried the address. The family wstaowledgc
that there was an address on it. What was upsetting the representatives
was that there was criticism^ or at least an implied criticism of the
officer involved and that j&ey had said that this was not going to happen.
I noted the point and pointed out that I had clearly said that this
had nothing to do with the Inquest and that as far as I was concerned,
I was looking at it in more general terms though I could see the
points they were making and that perhaps on reflection it might have
Been b e tte r to have handled i t somewhat d iffe re n tly . T he;legal
rep resen tativ es were anxious to obtain an undertaking from Hr.
Frazer th a t he would not ask questions which they f e l t inappropriate,
otherwise they might be compelled to r is e and ob ject. Indeed I
pointed out to them th a t they were fre e to do so i f they f e l t
th a t something was said but they were re lu c ta n t to do so because
obviously th is might r e f le c t upon th e ir c lie n ts . I made i t
quite c le a r th a t I did not fe e l i t rig h t th a t Mr. Frazer
should be muzzled in the form of the questions th a t he was
allowed to ask and th a t i t was my task as fa r as possible to
accaae .them and take a decision as to whether or not they f e l l
w ithin the scope o f the Inquest a t the#time, and th a t I would
obviously do my best to get th a t rig h t.
The main spokesperson was the Counsel fo r the Federation and
Belinda N o rth cliff also made a contribution. I do not re c o lle c t
any p a rtic u la r contribution fo r the rep resen tativ e o f S heffield
Wednesday. Mr. Frazer took the view th a t w hilst he fu lly
appreciated the points which they were mafeing, he in the end
had to put what he was in stru c te d to do.
The rep resen tativ e fo r the Federation did not re a lly accept
th is . He said th a t on occasions people had to t e l l th e ir c lie n ts
th a t they could not put c e rta in th in g s. As I have said before, I
made i t c le a r th a t I was not prepared to muzzle Mr. Frazer.
During the course o f the discussion I did agree th a t the way
in which that point had been handled could have perhaps been d e a lt
with ra th e r b e tte r, but upon re fle c tio n , bearing in mind what I
said to the Jury and              I t n li l tiln m~fli nt nn will; I think
in fa c t on the whole i t was sa tis fa c to ry .

Sir:

It is not a question of whether        )
or not the Hillsborough victims
had consumed alcohol, but rather
the drunken louts who caused the
disaster by squeezing into the
ground and who will never be
punished,
Fven if ALL the victims HAD been
drunk, this would not have con-*
tributed to their deaths since it
was the drunks who squeezed into
the ground who caused their deaths,
but TH.FIR blood cannot be tested !
Drunk or sober, the victims would
still have been crushed !! The
evidence of the chemical pathologist,
therefore, is irrelevant.
If you or I had found the stadium
full, we would have turned round
and gone home. The drunken mob,
however, was determined to get in
a t a l l costs..
THAT IS HOW t f F VICTIMS DIED. The
culprits will never be punished, but
the police will be used as scape­
goats.
I remain, Sir,
Pespectfully yours
                                                                        1*1

D ear Dr. Popper,


It is with a deep sense of bew ild erm en t, and anger t h a t I hear the "Hillsborough
Dead" inquests are proceeding!

1       Bew ilderment: Because I understand t h a t you are not going to allow the
        jury to r e t u rn a verd ict. It makes th e hearings worthless; like having a
        football m atc h but instr ucting th e players t h a t they may not score.

2       Anger: T h a t y e t more public money is being spent on a m a t t e r which
        has already been in ve stig ated by a Rt.Hon.Lord J u s t ic e AT VAST
        COST. I am heartil y sick t h a t th e r e seem s to have been formed a
        "Hillsborough D is as ter Industry". This surely b e n e f its only one s e c t o r
        of the com munit y: th e legal profession.

It is cle a r as daylight from the Taylor R eport t h a t the d e a t h s were
ACCIDENTAL. Any breach of a d u t y - o f - c a r e t h a t took pla ce: by e i t h e r the
police or Sheffield Wednesday club offici als I feel is very r e m o t e - because
nobody could have pred icted the conseq uen ces of rel easin g the phalanx of
la te com m ing Liverpool fans in Leppings Lane!

As all the deaths were caused by t r a u m a t i c asphyxia: th e alcohol c o n t e n t in the
blood of the dead is ir e lle v an t and insults the memory of those d e a r d ep arted
ones! I rem ain,

   Policy Note by Det. Superintendent Beechey


                       Miss NORCLIFFE representing the Chief Constable of
                       South Yorkshire Police asked if the legal
                       representatives could have a meeting with the Coroner
                       out of Court to discuss certain questions arising from
                       selected persons being thanked by families for their
                       actions at the Hillsborough ground and also their
                       support since the tragedy.

                       At 1335 hours, Thursday, 26 April, Dr Popper, Coroner,
                       met in the Medico Legal Centre.  Present

                       Doug Fraser              Family Support Group
                       Miss Norcliffe           Chief Constable, South York. Police
                       Mr Catchpole             Sheffield Wednesday F.C.
                       Ms Addleman              Police Federation
                       Mr Limb                  Chief Constable, South York. Police
                       D/Supt Beechey

                       Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Jones arrived ten
                       minutes into the meeting.

                       Miss Norcliffe said that questions were being put to
                       Presenting Officers that were outside the parameters
                       set by the Coroner, by Mr Fraser, on instructions of the
                       families of the deceased.  She was referring to the
                       Inquest of Ian WHELAN, (No. 6) where in Paragraph 3 it
                       mentioned PC 106 Philip Goss had helped carry Ian to
                       the temporary mortuary where he later found property
                       on the deceased which would identify him, but there
                       had still been a long delay before his parents were
                       informed he had died.

                       They realised that those questions could not be
                       answered at this court, but felt that the officers
                       concerned were being identified - which was unfair in
                       the circumstances to them. They, meaning Miss
                       Norcliffe and Ms Addleman, suggested questions of this
                       nature should not be asked.

                       Mr Fraser replied to the effect that if the families
                       he represented instructed him to put forward these
                       points he would do so. Dr Popper said that if the
                       question put was outside the parameters he had given,
                       he would not allow them to proceed. Ms Addleman then
                       spoke regarding families instructing Mr Fraser to
                       thank selected persons or specific groups for thier
                       actions on the day of the tragedy or since whilst
                       gathering evidence and information leading to these
                       Inquests.
She added that a general all embracing type of thanks
could be accepted but not those to individuals.

This was agreed in principal by Mr Fraser but he
maintained his right to comply with families
instructions to him.

         Dear Dr Popper

         Following your request in relation to a possible breakdown of the times
         where the deceased entered the Stadium, research has established the
         following details


              Twenty deceased entered the Stadium before 1430 hours.

              Fifty-nine deceased entered after 1430 hours.

              Three deceased entered at 1430 hours.


         It has not been possible to establish any times the remaining thirteen
         deceased entered the Stadium.

         Yours sincerely




         K V Tope

FILE NOTE DATED 12.4.90    -


TO BE ADDED TO FILE NOTE OF MR. NATTRESS.


I asked Joan Taylor to ring Keeble Hawsofll, solicitors for
the Sheffield City Council, to check whether they would be
attending on the 18th.    She rang me back to say that a
letter was in the post confirming that they would be there.
In the circumstances I think this would         neet any
suggestion that a representative of the         authority
was not present, assuming that one could establish that
the local authority was(enforcing authority within the
Health and Safety at Works Act 1974, which does not appear
to be the case.

 Dear Dr Popper
Thank you for your letter of 6 April concerning the
inquests on the Hillsborough Disaster. I note that
you wish me to attend at 12.15 p.m. on Thursday 19
and Friday 20 April, These dates and times are
satisfactory. I understand from your officer that
the hearings on Thursday 19 will be held at the
City Hall and those on Friday 20 at the Medico Legal
Centre. I hope that these venues are in fact correct
since they are not shown on the schedule which you
sent me.

          Dear Sir,
          Re: Hillsborough Inquests
          We thank you for your letter of 26th March, 1990, and note its
          contents. Further to your letter and your conversation with Mr.
          Davidson at this office, we acknowledge that the first two days
          of Inquests will be held at the Memorial Hall, City Hall,
          Sheffield, commencing on Wednesday, 18th April, 1990, at 10.30
          a.m.

              Mr. Davidson will arrange with your secretary in the near
         future to visit your Court in Watery Street to examine the
         facilities required for the shorthand writers. We also should be
         glad to know which member of your staff we should contact
         regarding the borrowing of any documents referred to at the
         Inquests, which will be necessary when preparing the transcripts.

Mr. H. Mlchi*,
Assistant Director of Health & Consumer Services,
Town Hall Chambers,
Barkers Pool,
a a ttu u u,

Bear Soger,
I enclose a copy of a letter from J.L. Harpham together
with a copy of my reply.
There will be quite a lumber of persons or bodies who will
have to receive copies on a Free of Charge basis e.g.,
the West Midlands Police.
If the corporation re<£ares a oopy technically they should be
oharged but it seeas to be a rather unhelpful exceacise in
view of what I am going to say below.
In addition, I have been approached by the Hillsborough Family
Support Group who have requested a oopy of the transcripts
for their records and files.
This is a little bit aore difficult. I have not yet decided what
ay view with regard to this request is, but I would value your/the
Council*s opinion as to whether if I felt that a transcript should
be provided to then, this should be done in a Free of Charge
basis or whether the noraal charge or some modified version of
it should be made.
As you know, the charge for oopy transcripts is usually paid to ate
and I retain the s u b . Apparently it is and has been ay praotice
to pay one third of the gross receipts to the City and to make
certain payments to Joan and Pauline.
With regard to Hillsborough oases, subject to you being able
to check that I would not be liable to any tax, I would be
prepared for the cheques to be made payable direct to the City
of Sheffield and to waive ay claim to the money in respect of the
limited Inquests, which we are holding, starting on the 18th of
April and hopefully finishing around the 4th of May.
I reserve agr position with regard to any transcripts of any
future proceedings which sight take place.
                                                                cont*d




                      )
                                             26th March        90.
                        - 2 -




I am taking this view for two reasons. 1. I prefer not to
make a direct financial gain out of the sale of the transcripts
of the resumed Inquests as indicated overleaf and 2. I redipise
that the cost for obtaining these* and indeed the total cost of
the Hillsborough Disaster is a substantial one as far as the
City is concerned and this may be a way to recoup a possibly
small proportion of these extra expenses to which the City has
been and will be put.
If any of this is not clear to you pklase let me know. Perhaps
you could make appropriate inquiries about the tax position as
soon as possible. The point about the tax is of course that
the person entitled to make the charge is me, rather than the City,
but it would seem rather unfair if I have to pay Income fax on
income which I do not actually receive. I suppose if the worst
came to the worst and an Inspector assessed me, you would have
to refund at least the amount that I would need to pay the tax
but I expect your tax experts will be able to sort it out.
Tours sincerely*

Dear Stefan

Re: Accommodation - Hillsborough Inquests

Thank you for your letter of 7 March concerning the changes which may have to be
made during the period of the Hillsborough Inquests which I gather will start in
mid April and finish late in May.

I take it that the use of the Museum/Symposium Room would be confined strictly
to the times when inquests were being held there and that it would be possible
for my postgraduate student(s) to use the room at all other times?

The Police Surgeons' suite would, I presume, be Police Surgeon 2 - the use of
the interview part of the suite as an office would not inconvenience Drs
Everson, Leigh, Cox, Kitlowski etc since their use is mostly nocturnal, but Dr
Leigh examines police recruits there on Tuesday afternoons and Drs Leigh and
Everson examine taxi drivers there, generally on a Thursday. It might be
possible to accommodate these two doctors by giving up my interview room at
these times as, bearing in mind the singularity of the circumstances, I would be
willing to do. We could not, I think, give up the use of either of the
examination rooms if this   meant moving out the examination couches since these
are not infrequently used   to examine a victim and    an attacker in cases    ofrap
and simple assault.

I am afraid that my staff were less than enthusiastic about giving up the
upstairs staff room, which is, as they point out,     the only    place which is
provided for them to have   their coffee breaks and   lunches,    and this is
apparently a legal requirement. Perhaps John Batley can suggest a solution, as
you say. Since the pathology side of the operation has so far gone well (I
think), I am very anxious that the formalities which succeed it are similarly
successful.

I would be glad to discuss this matter with you at your convenience.

Yours si y^erely

        Dear Mr. Cox,

        as f a r as the Inquests are concerned.
        In order to ensure th a t you are fo lly informed as to what
        i s happening, I enclose a copy of my l e t t e r dated the 14th
        o f March 1990 which has been addressed to the s o lic ito rs
        who represent other bereaved fam ilies. The contents of
        th a t l e t t e r are o f course self-ex p lan ito ry .
        As you w ill glean from the l e t t e r , we are in the course
        o f preparing the stannaries which w ill be presented to
        the Inquest when i t i s resumed.
        As I am anxious to avoid causing any additional d is tre s s ,
        1 am on the whole re lu c ta n t to send the summary d ire c tly
        to you through the p o st. However, I would not wish to
        deprive you o f the opportunity o f seeing i t p rio r to the
        l is t in g o f the Inquest.
        I would therefore be g ra te fu l i f you could please l e t roe know
        whether there i s someone who you would wish me to send th is
        document to , so th a t you can look a t i t should you wish to do so.
        Obviously i f you would p re fe r th a t i t i s sent d ire c tly to you
        through the post, then please say so and I w ill arrange fo r th is
        to be done when the summary is ready.
        The other m atter th a t we need to have some inform ation on is
        whether you would wish to attend the Inquest when i t has been
        lis te d .
                                                                                  co n t'd ........

To s o lic ito rs on the record
acting fo r Bereaved re la tiv e s ,
and to the Hillsborough Steering Committee.

Dear S irs,
                   Limited Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough
You w ill of course be aware th a t I have decided to resume the Inquests
(on a lim ited basis) into the deaths of the persons who lo s t th e ir
liv e s on 15th A pril 1989 a t Hillsborough.
You w ill also be aware th a t the in ten tio n i s to take the post mortem
evidence together with a summary of the evidence as i t re la te s to
location of the deceased, the time of death as fa r as i t can
reasonably be established and to clear up any minor m atters such as
sp ellin g of names.
The basic format for the inquests w ill be th a t the evidence w ill
be presented e ith e r by way of documentary evidence eg. post mortem
rep o rt or in the case of the summary by presentation by a West
Midlands Police o ffic e r.
The evidence w ill be presented in a non ad v ersarial fashion and is
intended to give to you and in p a rtic u la r your c lie n t(s ) non
controversial evidence as i t re la te s to each individual deceased
which is available. I am sure th a t you w ill appreciate th a t the
qu ality and quantity of evidence which i t has been possible to obtain
varies from person to person.
I t must be clearly understood and i t i s the basis on which I have
decided to resume the inquests a t th is stage th a t no evidence w ill be
taken nor w ill questions or comments be perm itted which could be
considered as attacking or c r itic is in g anybody or person incorporate
or otherwise or which could in any way be construed as obstruction or
compromising the investigation which i s s t i l l being undertaken by the
DPP and on which to date no conclusion has been reached.
In order to enable you and i f you so wish your c lie n t(s ) to be aware
of the scope of the evidence a copy of the summary w ill be sent to
you as soon as possible in order to enable you to consider i t and in
p a rtic u la r to enable you c lie n t to be prepared fo r the evidence.
Although i t w ill not be possible to recast the summaries in to a
d iffe re n t format i t may th a t in some case there may be a p a rtic u la r
point which is not clear to you or there may be some question which
your c lie n t i s p articu larly anxious about and which i s not clearly
dealt with on the summary or the post mortem.
In such a case please l e t me know the point or question th a t you wish
to have more information on. I cannot give any undertaking th at
questions submitted can or w ill be d e a lt with but provided th a t the
points or questions f a l l w ithin the parameter of the resumed inquest
  an they w ill be sym pathetically considered and i f i t i s conveniently
possible to deal with them a t the hearing i t w ill be done.
I t may also be th a t e ith e r you or your c lie n ts may be aware of other
w itnesses who are not referred to in the summaries. The case f ile s do
not contain every witness statem ent which has been obtained.
Statements which are thought not to advance the evidence have been
excluded from the f i le s prepared for me. However i f you wish me to
consider any p a rtic u la r statem ent which you are aware of and which
i s not mentioned in the summary please l e t me have d e ta ils so th a t I
may consider i t .
I think th a t in the m ajority of the cases i t w ill not be necessary to
c a ll the pathologist to the inquest but there may be a few cases where
a c lie n t p articu larly wishes to hear the pathologist in person. I f
th a t applies to any of your c lie n ts please le t me know as soon as
possible. I w ill then consider the evidence in the lig h t of th is
req u est.
I have to make i t clear th a t under no circumstances w ill any South
Yorkshire Police o ffic e r be called to give o ral evidence a t these
resumed hearings. From my assessment of the f ile s to date I think i t
i s unlikely th a t I w ill be c allin g any w itnesses other than WMP
o ffic e rs and possibly in a few cases the pathologists to give o ral
evidence.
The case f ile s are in the course of being prepared and in order to
give you as much time as possible and also to spread the load over
a period i t is proposed to s t a r t sending out the summaries towards
the end of th is week or the beginning of the next. A consequence of
th is is th a t some fam ilies w ill be aware of the contents of the
summaries before oth ers. I would be g ratefu l i f you would make i t
c lear to your c lie n t(s ) p a rtic u la rly i f they are the ones whose
summary has not yet been sent out th a t there i s nothing s in is te r in
th is but th at i t is simply a question of lo g is tic s .
I am not yet in a position to l e t you know when any p a rtic u la r inquest
w ill take place. I w ill of course try to l e t you have as much notice
as possible but I am sure th a t you w ill appreciate th a t th is i s quite
a complex operation and th a t you must be prepared fo r a lte ra tio n s in
lis tin g information even a t the la s t moment. I appreciate the
inconvenience th a t th is may cause and I w ill try to minimise i t but I
fear th a t i t is in e v ita b le .
In th is    connection I would be g ratefu l i f you would please l e t my
lis tin g   o ffic e r whose address appears on the attached sheet know
whether     you are presently aware of any of your c lie n ts who do not
wish to     attend the inquest re la tin g to th e ir loved one.
Please also l e t my lis tin g o ffic e r know whether there are any major
committments of your c lie n ts which might make i t d if f ic u lt for them
to attend on any p a rtic u la r dates. Whilst I w ill try to take such
information into account i t may not be possible to meet a l l wishes
and the fin a l decision on timing and date w ill be taken by me and my
o ffic e rs .

To solicitors on the record
acting tor rereaved relatives,
anci to the hillsborough Steering Committee.


b e a r oirs,

                    Limited Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough

You will of course be aware that I have decided to resume the Inquests
(on a limited basis) into the deaths of the persons who lost their
lives on 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.

You will also be aware that the intention is to take the post mortem
evidence together with a summary of the evidence as it relates to
location of the deceased, the tisue of death as far as it can
reasonably be established and to clear up any minor matters such az
spelling of names.

The uasic format for the inquests will be that the evidence will
be presented either by way of documentary evidence eg. post r-ortc”.
report or in the case of the summary by presentation by a west:
Hidlands Police officer.

The evidence will be presented in a non adversarial fashion and is
intended to give to you and in particular your client(s) non
controversial evidence as it relates to each individual deceased
which is available. I am sure that you will appreciate that the
quality and quantity of evidence which it has been possible to obtain
varies from person to person.

It must be clearly understood and it is the basis on which I have
decided to resume the inquests at this stage that no evidence will be
taken nor will questions or comments be permitted which could be
considered as attacking or criticising anybody or person incorporate
or otherwise or which could in any way be construed as obstruction or
compromising the investigation which is still being undertaken by the
DPP and on which to date no conclusion has been reached.

In order to enable you and if you so wish your client(s) to be aware
of the scope of the evidence a copy of the summary will be sent to
you as soon as possible in order to enable you to consider it and in
particular to enable you client to be prepared for the evidence.

Although it will not be possible to recast the summaries into a
different format it may that in some case there may be a particular
point which is not clear to you or there may be some question which
your client is particularly anxious about and which is not clearly
dealt with on the summary or the post mortem.

In such         c     please let me know the point or question that you wish
to have         r, information on. I cannot give any undertaking that
questiont       rmgr itted can or will be dealt with but provided that the
points or       questions fall within the parameter of the resumed inquest
then they will be sympathetically considered and if it is conveniently
possible to deal with them at the hearing it will be done.

It may also be that either you or your clients may be aware oI other
witnesses who are not referred to in the summaries. The case files do
not contain every witness statement which has been obtained.
Statements which are thought not to advance the evidence have been
excluded from the files prepared for me. However if you wish me to
consider any particular statement which you are aware of and which
is not mentioned in the summary please let me have details so that I
may consider it.

I think that in the majority of the cases it will not be necessary to
call the pathologist to the inquest but there may be a few cases where
a client particularly wishes to hear the pathologist in person. If
that applies to any of your clients please let me know as soon as
possible. I will then consider the evidence in the light of this
request.

I have to make it clear that under no circumstances will any South
Yorkshire Police officer be called to give oral evidence at these
resumed hearings, from my assessment of the files to date I think it
is unlikely that 1 will be calling any witnesses other than WMP
officers and possibly in a few cases the pathologists to give oral
evidence.

The case files are in the course of being prepared and in order to
give you as much time as possible and also to spread the load over
a period it is proposed to start sending out the summaries towards
the end of this week or the beginning of the next. A consequence of
this is that some families will be aware of the contents of the
sumiraries before others. I would be grateful if you would make it
clear to your client(s) particularly if they are the ones whose
summary has not yet been sent out that there is nothing sinister in
this but that it is simply a question of logistics.

I an not yet in a position to let you know when any particular inquest
will take place. I will of course try to let you have as much notice
as possible but I am sure that you will appreciate that this is quite
a complex operation and that you must be prepared for alterations in
listing information even at the last moment. I appreciate the
inconvenience that this may cause and I will try to minimise it but I
f«ar that it is inevitable.

In this    connection I would be grateful if you would please let my
listing    officer whose address appears on the attached sheet know
whether    you are presently aware of any of your clients who do not
wish to    attend the inquest relating to their loved one.

Please also let my listing officer know whether there are any major
committments of your clients which might make it difficult for them
to attend on any particular dates. Whilst I will try to take such
information into account it may not be possible to meet all wishes
and the final decision on timing and date will be taken by me and my
officers.

Dear Sirs,

Re HILLSBOROOUGH INQUESTS.



I refer to my telephone conversation with you on the 7th of March 1990 in
which I told you that I am now pretty confident that we will be resuming the
Inquests into the deceased (on a limited basis) on the 18th of April 1990.

I would like to have the proceedings taken down in shorthand and transcribed
for me, though it will not be necessary to have a next day transcription
service.

The present plan is to begin on the 18th and hopefully to finish on or before
the 4th of May 1990.  We have also reserved another week beginning the 2lst
of May 1990 to deal with any overflow.

You will of course appreciate that whilst the above dates are what we hope
to achieve, court proceedings are notoriously difficult to predict, and
alterations may have to be made.

Mr. Davidson, when I spoke to him last week, indicated that you could let me
have a revised quotation and I would be grateful if you could please forward
this to me.

Perhaps I should mention that we intend to start at 9.30 on the morning.

It is difficult at this stage to predict when we will end in the afternoon.
That depends to a large extent at the rate in which we manage to proceed with
the cases which we schedule for any particular day.

I look forward to hearing from y ou as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully,


S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

  MEDICO LEGAL CENTRE - MEETING WITH SOUTH YORKSHIRE FIRE SERVICE

  As you are       aware, Mrs Harper made arrangements for the Fire Prevention Officer,
  from South       Yorkshire Police to attend the Medico Legal Centre, on 28 February
  1990. The        aim of the meeting was to discuss safety arrangements required in the
  event that       the Medico Legal Centre is used as a venue for the Hillsborough
  Inquests.

  Station Officer Vickery conducted a tour of the Medico Legal Centre with
  Mrs Harper and Inspector Sawers. He confirmed that the building was suitable for
  accommodating the anticipated number of visitors with the proviso that numbers in
  the Court Room should not exceed the seating capacity therein. He made a number
  of observations which I have listed below:-

       (i)     There should be no partitions placed in the Foyer as these create a
               combustible risk.

     (ii)     Whilst the Womens Royal Voluntary Service may serve refreshments from the
              reception, the 'counter1 should be restricted in size and numbers waiting
              for food and drink should be controlled to avoid congestion.

    (iii)      Regular cleaning of all areas should be carried out to eliminate excess
               build up of paper, litter and obstructions.

     (iv)      A large number of metal ashtrays and/or sand buckets should be placed in
               waiting areas for the safe extinguishing of cigarettes.

       (v)     Use of portacabins would not cause a safety problem providing:-

               (a)      they are sited more than three metres from the main building.



                                                                                                          /Continued ..,

         (b)   any electrical/audio connection wires do not trail into public
               areas;

         (c)   each was supplied with at least one carbon dioxide extinguisher.

  (vi)   Additional fire exit signs to be displayed -

         (a)   panel above door leading from court room (outside interview room 1);

         (b)   main corridor, 1st floor, indicating alternative exit down corridor
               (past Coroner's Office)

 (vii)   Lightbulbs to be replaced on rear fire escape staircase.

(viii)   Small hammer to be sighted next to ’break glass' panel on rear exit door.


I forward these details for your information and reassurance as to the suitability
of the Medico Legal Centre. You may wish to pass a copy to John Batley in order
that points (vi), (vii) and (viii) may be addressed.

As agreed with Mervyn Jones, I am oontaoting you in connection
with any detailed aaondwmts which I think perhaps should be
made to the Hies.
I have already mentioned to Inspector Tobe that the summaries
are fine, soy only reservation being because they are in the
third person and do not oontain quotes may give rise to perhaps
some extra questions from solicitors. However, as the format
has already been settled, and I believe that the majority of
oases have already been drafted, I do not think that there is
very such we can do about it at this stage.
I have now managed to read through several files and would
like to draw the following points to your attentions~
                    .

On the summary shoot •& the front of the file, Z notice that
the next of kin aso given aa Bllen Holbeck a sistor. Z think
strictly speaking, the next of kin are the children. Z wonder
whether wo ought to, in this particular case, put the children
in braokets agaiftst next of kin. On the summary shoot paragraph
4* Z think it sight perhaps ho a good idea to add a sentence
to the offsot that Gary Oyiteoh saw Inger Shah within the Pen
aftos a final aoiSeSr and formed the laproooion that she was
obviously dead (Page 24).
With regard to the time of death (referred to in the outlined
summary shoot and also in the summary itself at Paragraph 8)where
%a r o is a specific time of 1555 hours given, Z canoot find the
evldonoo for this as Hr. Ball merely seems to say that he
oortiflod various people between 1550 and 1650 hours.
There may be some simple explanation for this but I think
it may be wiser to give the time bracket, unless there is evidence
from say a police officer (as there is in one or two of the other
casos) where a specific time is actually mentioned.
                                                                 cont'd

                                                                12th Maroh      90,

                                             -   2   -


           There are one or two other points in some of the statements, at
           least in one of the statements which I do not find quite right,
           but they are not relevant as far aa these Inquests are concerned
           so I will not refer to them.
           ■ f t i P J i S L M m Kg..,2. GaCT...Hffir£iagaff,
           Page 16 of the statement. The statement from Simon Weigold
           seems patently Incorrect as the body appears to have been identified
           to him initially by number only, the full identification not having
           taken place until the Sunday.
           X think that this is probably just wording but it might be
           better at some point to correot this.


           In the summary Paragraph 2, I think we should specify the time
           when they entered the Fen whioh appears to have been at about 1438
           (see Page 10).
           SmimLMtMmsLMiM                   BmaigiU..
           Page 20 of Peter Muir's statement sews to have a patent error on it.
           Be says that an ambulance collected the body from the temporary
           mortuary at 5.25p.m. and took it to the Medico Legal Csstre where
           he fttayed and identified it to someone as Body SI.
           That X think is patently wrong in that the polaroid photographs
           were not taken until well after that* The summary seems to have
           got it right, but I m not quite sure how.
           I m b of oourse open to correction on any comments whioh I may
           make to you. In addition, the onjry ones that are really urgent
           are any typing oorreotions to the sianary sheets.ae those are
           the documents whioh will have to be sent out.
           Iter the next few days I will not be at the Medico-Legal Centre
           bat you will be able to ooataot me at my home where I will be
           a good bit of the time. The phone ntafter is 0602 - 233344

FILE NOTE DATED 11.9.90. TELEPHONE CALL TO MR. STURTT.

0304-240250     TIME   23 minutes - 10.20 - 10.43 approx.

I discussed with Mr. Sturtt the Hillsborough Inquests, in
particular I wanted to get his feeling about calling the
evidence again which was included in the summary and which
dealt with what in short we refer to as the 'rescue'.
His initial re-action was that we might have to repeat that
because it might go to causation, but upon further
reflection, he agreed with me that one could certainly
argue that it was post incident and therefore not necessary
to repeat it.
He confirmed to me that he took the view that this inquest
had the potential of getting completely out of hand and it
was essential that I should keep very afirm control on it
and on the length of the proceedings.     He felt that the
parties had to clearly understand the necessity for
control, that fact that it was with me.    He also drew my
attention to the judgement in his case whether the judge
had pointed out that a line had to been drawn somewhere.
He also pointed out that I should not overlook the fact
that Lord Justice Taylor had had an Inquiry, and that was a
very relevant factor to the extent of the Inquisition.       He
reminded me of his illustration of drama and backdrop, and
indeed he thought that the 'rescue' so to speak could well
be treated as part of the scenery or stageing, whereas the
action was the bit that had to be looked at in greater
detail but even that, on a selective basis.

I asked him what his view was with regard to meeting with
the lawyers and in particular in camera and excluding Press
etc. He was not very keen on this.   He said he had met with
                tu yruk             \
the lawyers =nrfclie Inquest Review /but he put no
restrictions on people there but he did make an order that
the proceedings should not be reported.   He was not keen on
talking to laywers. He thought it was important to keep a
distance and be rather magisterial.
He confirmed that he would do anything he could to help and
that I should not hesitate to contact him but he was
anxious that I should do it at the office rather than at
his home, and that we should correspond with him at the
office rather than at his home.

FILE NOTE DATED 6.^.90.


Following the pre-inquest review meeting I had a chat with Mr.
lic k s , Mr. Devonside, Me. Pemberton, I think Mrs. Joynes and
maybe one other member o f the bereaved fam ilies who had been
present a t the hearing. A fter introductions some concern was
expressed as to thePress and in p a rtic u la r what could be done to
p ro tect the fam ilies immediately a fte r th e ir Inquests. wJ ^ ° ° k
the opportunity to show them the proposed arrangements/ which the^r
appeared to :be well s a tis fie d .
Mr. Devonside and Mr. Hicks said th a t i t would be helpful i f
uniformed o ffic e rs were not in the rooms where the fam ilies were
but they accepted th a t they would have to be present in public
p a rts o f the building. I said th a t we were not expecting to have
o ffic e rs in uniform in the rooms where the fam ilies would congregate.
I was asked whether we would be using a d iffe re n t Jury fo r each Inquest
or whether i t was the same Jury. I thought i t would be the same.
I explained th a t should the Inquest be resumed and obviously I did not
know whether i t would be, i t would be an awful lo t e a sie r i f we had
ju s t one Jury, fo r generic evidence.
The fam ilies seemed to be very appreciative of a l l the a tte n tio n
to d e ta il which was being paid. I explained th a t I did not expect
things to be p erfect but th a t we would endeavour to make things as-
easy as we eould in a l l the circumstances given the lim itatio n s o f-
space which we had. Another concern ’which the fam ilies expressed
regarding the Press was entry in to the building. I explained th a t
we hoped to have accommodation av ailab le fo r them but they were concerned
th a t they would have to id e n tify themselves a t the reception desk
and th a t th is could create problems. I said th a t there was a back entrance
to the building and I would c e rta in ly consider th a t aspect o f the m atter.
I also made i t c le a r th a t I was hoping to make i t c le a r to .the Press
th a t I did not want the re la tiv e s troubled w ithin the         o f the
building though obviously once they were out in the s tre e t there
w asn't very much I could do about i t . This seemed to be c le a rly
accepted and understood.
A fter a while Mervyn Jones came to c o lle c t me and we contined our discussions
in my o ffic e .
Mr. Devonside knocked a t the door and wanted to have another word with me.
I said I would come out and have a quick chat with him. He wanted to
know why i t was th a t West Midlands were actin g as Coroner's O fficers,
ra th e r than South Yorkshire. I was a l i t t l e surprised a t the question but
explained to him th a t when Lord Ju stic e T aylor's Inquiry commenced
and West Midlands were asked to deal with i t , i t was agreed rig h t from
the beginning th a t they would also a c t as my Coroner's O fficers. I also
said th a t i t would have been d if f ic u lt to have vised South Yorkshire p a rtly
because i t would have meant duplicating a l l the work and p a rtly because
                                -   2   -

i t might have been exceedingly d if f ic u lt fo r them to get hold o f the
neqessary evidence, bearing in mind the 3).P.P. in v estig atio n .
Hr. Devonside wanted to know whether th is was a unique situ a tio n and
I said I ju s t did not know, which i s e n tire ly tru e .
PRE/INQ/REV                       dated 6th March 1990                    .

Notes of ground to be covered at Pre Inquest Review on 6th March
1990 at 2 pm at the Medico Legal Centre Water St. Sheffield.          ■ _/*


1. Refer to Previous meeting on 28.02.90 with Mr. Kennedy,
 Hammond Suddards, Solicitors for SYP and Mr. Frazer of the
Hillsborough Steering Committee Mr. M. Jones ACC WMP and SLP.


2. DPP.                 a. Definitely No information as to DPP decision
                        b. in any case No decision yet taken
                        c. All papers not yet submitted and therefore not
                           possible for decision to be taken..
                           Present time scale would not permit DPP final
                           report to be submitted until after commencement
                           of proposed resumed limited inquests.

3.Possible Scenarios:
  a. Prosecution -                              Sec. 16 CA 1988.
  b. No Prosecution butPrivate Pros.     -      Sec. 16 CA 1988
  c. No Prosecution -                          Inquest

4. Pre Inq Rev. has arisen as a direct result of letter from Miss
Steel outlining certain difficulties, correspondence from Hammond
Suddard, previous thinking about matter natural anxiety for
information.

5. Resumed Inquest to be of limited scope. Under no circumstances will
we deal at this stage with How and even less with Why or Whom to
blame.

In particular no attack or criticism of any individual(s) or body(s)
Nothing that may be detrimaental to DPP enquiry.

This is necessary
a. DPP has only agreed to limited inquest at this stage
b. In the interests of justice not least that of the bereaved..

6 . Scope of Inquest.

    Medical Evidence Alcholol levels will be revealed for each person
    for whom they are available.

    Evidence of movement of the deceased as far as possible.
    In particular we will try where that is possible to indicate
    where the deceased was seen in a particular pen.

    Identifications are more satisfactory for some than others
    ofcourse.

    At the end of the hearing bereaved should hopefully know where
    it has been possible to establish it the when and where of death.

7.Method of producing the evidence.

   a. Post Mortem Reports, subject to representations I think
      it may be possible to deal with many of these without
      calling the Pathologist.
                                  Page   1
    b. We will not call Dr. Forrest to each inquest to prove
       alcohol levels but will have him present at the beginning
       to deal with his findings. In any individual case where
       I think it necessary I will ofcourse call him.
    c. We will not call any SYP officers of any rank
    d. In each case a WMP officer will have prepared a summary
       of each individual file which together with the file
       will be submitted to me. The officer will present his
       summary. It will to the best of ability be factually correct
       but will be non adverserial in tone and content.
    i. I will have seen the summaries and the complete files before
       each inquest and it is my intention to have read each of the
       95 files before the inquest.
    ii. The summaries will be circulated to HSC and probably to
       Hammond Suddard before the hearing but not to others but
       not to others who will ofcourse hear it at the Inquest.
    iii. The purpose of early circulation is:
        1. to enable Sol to indicate
        whether they are content with summary or whether anything is
        not clear so that if it is possible that can be elaborated at
        the hearing.
        2. To enable solicitors to share information with families
        so as to give pre warning of the evidence and lessen if
        possible distress

    e. We will also have available Annacappa reports which are a
       different form of summary but it may not be possible to
       circulate these.

    f. I do not intend to use Video at this hearing.

    g. I will avoid using photographs or video stills whereever
       possible. Instead I intend to use either the summarising
       officer or other police officers to indicate on plans the
       positions where deceased where seen either alive or dead.

      Most families have already seen the photographs and confirmed
      the identifications.

       Relevant stills will be available if needs must.

   h. I may use other evidence from witnesses either viva voce or
      documentary if I think that it is necessary but do not expect
      to do so often as the summaries should give the information
      in adequate form.

8 . I intend on the opening day to take evidence from some witnesses
    eg Dr. Forrest, Prof Usher Insp. Layton which will help with
    understanding of the generality of the evidence and the method of
    presentation. It may also help with the length of the
    proceedings.

9. Listing. This is going to be difficult. We are starting off with
   pathologist order but we anticipate that there are many factors
   which will influence the order eg two deceased in one family.
   Listing will appear random but will in fact have had considerable
   thingking put into it. Whilst we would not wish to deliberately
   incovenience anyone the listing will be done by me/or undr my
   authority.

                                  Page    2
   We are aiming to do 8 Cases per day.

10. Jury. We will sit with one. Not much that they will be able to do
at these hearings but I think that it would be unwise to proceed
without them. It must be remembered that Inquest are by definition
non adversarial and these limited hearings even more so.

11. Location. Medico Legal Centre.

12. Transcripts. Will be available. Not next day service.   Will have
to be paid for.

13. Hillsborough Support group. Aware of the involvment of social
workers. We will endeavour to inform a liason person in the group of
the proposed listing but would expect that detailed liason will be
done through the bereaved family's solicitors or HSC. ie Communication
Coroner- HSC/Sol - Social workers etc and others.

14. We will endeavour to give as much warning as possible but it may
be difficult and there may have to be last minute changes.
We intend to notify solicitors who we expect will let their clients
know. We will also endeavour to warn at least one family member direct
either by post or viva voce.

15. Because of pressure on time if some one does not turn up on time
we will proceed without them.

16. We will endeavour to have coffee and biscuit facilities on site.

17. Press will be entitled to attend, but because of spaceconstrains
press passes will probably have to be issued.

18. Comments from floor.

19. Representation of interested parties.

20 Any other business.

21. Date for resumed inquest.

22. Starting time of resumed inquests.

S ear S ir ,

Re HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

As you will be aware from earlier correspondence, I had decided to
postpone my inquests into the deaths of the persons who died as a
result of this event until sometime after the Director of Public
Prosecution had announced his decision as to what actions if any he
might wish to take.
In the light of certain representations which have been made, I feel
that it may be possible prior to that event to resume the Inquests on a
strictly limited basis in order to take certain evidence relating to
the movement of individuals on 15th of April 1989» as well as the medical
cause of death.
It must be clearly understood that neither the form not the content of
the evidence will be such as could in any way impede or hinder the
investigation being undertaken by the Director of Public Prosecutions
and/or which might reflect on the conduct of any person or persons
corporate or otherwise. This is the strict condition on which the
Director of Public Prosecutions would agree to such a limited inquest
taking place.
Prior to deciding whether it is possible to resume as aforesaid, I
think that it would be helpful if a "pre inquest review" were held.
The intention of this hearing would be to elaborate the contents of
this letter, to deal with any questions of representations, to consider-
administrative matters, to listen to any proposals or suggestions
from legal representatives and to deal with any other matters regarding
the conduct of the inquests which I may feel is appropriate at the time.
The date for this review has been fixed for the 6th of March at 2p.m.
at the Medico Legal Centre. Watery Street. Sheffield.
Following this review; I will announce whether it is possible to resume
the Inquests on the basis described and to announce the date for such
resumption. For your prior information, it is my present intention that
subject to being satisfied that the objectives outlined can be achieved
to resume very shortly after Easter.
I understand of cours® that representation in respect of the large
majority of the deceased will be co-ordinated through the Steering
Committee. In order however to ensure as far as possible that all
parties are aware of what is going on, I am arranging for this letter
to be sent to each firm of solicitors who are on the record with me.
In addition, I am also sending a copy of this letter to those solicitors
of whom I am aware who were represented before Lord Justice Taylor's
Inquiry.
I would be grateful if addressees would let me know as soon as possible
if they wish to attend.

particular do we invite
representation from bodies or
people who have not contacted the
Coroner eg
Police federation

etc.

Maybe should be invited to pre
inquest review.

Location for inquest.

a. Medico Legal centre
   advantage:
convenient court
some facilities for solicitors to
see clients
facility for tea and coffee in                    !Z -      v
entrance lobby.
recording facility as back up
                                                 \ t
available.

 disadvantage.                              $I
Court rather small if lots of press               C
and solicitors present.

Circulation area limited and
potential for congestion
? sensitivity as most families
attended to view bodies and
therefore would bring back
memories very vividly

clash with ordinary work
if this could be done in
museum then may be possible
otherwise not.

difficulty of segregating
Hillsbough teams from staff
dealing with ordinary work

May not be enough space for
support workers.

Superficially very attractive to do
inquest at MLC but fear that area
too small.

Investigate availablility of
alternative accommodation. If none
available than MLC would have to
be used irrespective of
convenience.

Financial assistance for families
to attend. Probably not unless
called as witness.

Circulation of evidence pre hearing
in particular :
precis ^
any statements to be used as
documentary
decide whether any statements
included within precis would be
released and if so by whom?

If such statment contain "DPP
sensitive" material would have
to be edited prior to release

Editing to be done by WMP?

Photographs and videos not
suitable for circulation.

Circulation of documents to
deponent possibly and to parties
who one might assume might take
objection to contents. Most of the
evidence will only be of real
interest to the representatives of
the deceased.

Consider method of notification
Draft letter.
          Consider desirability for press
          release. Draft release. I think
          needs some improvement.

          People to be contacted or notified.

          Interested parties:

           a. Legal representatives of
           deceased
           b. families of people not
           represented

PRE INQUEST REVIEW.

Objectives:
a. to make sure that
representatives understand the
scope and limitations of the
resumptions

b. To deal with options for
further resumptions on the basis
of:
1. DPP brings manslaughter charges
against anyone. Deal with
subsection 16. 1 . a and b.
and effect on inquest.

2 . consider mentioning possiblity
of private prosecution if no action
taken by DPP. ie section 16 would
be brought into play again.

3. If no action taken and no
private prosecution started Inquest
will have to be resumed but scope
and extent will be determined by
me.

4. Other possibility is minor
charges but not likely to influence
date of inquest.

c. to sort out any
questions of representations

d. deal with the question of Jury
Not intended to have jury for the
interim resumption as they will not
be asked to make any decision and
if one were to resume with a jury
one would probably have to repeat
the evidence again anyway to
refresh jury memory.

e. to explain principle of order
of hearings.
This would be in order of
Pathologist subject to the
overiding requirement that members
of one family would be dealt with
on the same date
subject to this the order would
be governed by
i.overlap of witnesses to minimise
                 Page   6
attendance
ii. If possible parties and
solicitors convenience and
commitments would be considered
if notified early enough but in
view of number of cases and need
to complete within limited time
it would not be possible for this
to be overidding.
f. format of inquest
Documentary or precis where
possible
To assist will circulate
copy of document to deceased
representative (ie steering
committee) for them to confirm
the use of this document
sort out whether this is acceptable
 whether all parties wish to see
documents beforehand. %
          photographs ^ be present
by WMP.            •// Ac**,
It will not be-^jssible to obtain
copies of videq£jor ? photographs
WMP officers to give evidence in
terms as to location of deceased,
this will then form part of the
trancript.
One set of the ^ld&o used in the
court will have to/be available for
the coroner for filjag with his
records.
Ditto—fac_apy photographs produced. ^
g.Viva voce evidence from
pathologist.
ascertain whetheiythis is required
by representations.
Dr Forrest and anyone else in same
class to be taken initially so that
he does not have to be present
throughout inquest.
Explain that in some cases where
parties felt that they wanted to
hear him again he could be called

? do we need to prove the videtSs
and photographs
                 Page   7
 h. Proceedings to be
transcribed and copy transcripts
available at the appropiate charge.
Not intented that transcripts will    *
be available on next day as for
practical purposes individual
inquests at this stage.
subject to practicalities each case
will be collated seperately
and therefore only so much as is
required by individual firm need be
ordered and not total transcript.
i.Explain that it is the intention
to have available at the locus
1. refreshment facilities
2. Hillsborough support team
members
we would notify if possible a
liason officer inthe the team of
the dates when the individual
inquest take place so that they can
make arrangements for suitable
support to be available to each     f/ L (   L .
family witness etc on the day. — *           I/***' ’

achieve after inquest if held
at MLC.
4. room for families to be on their
own with H. Support team member or
on their own both before and after
inquest.
5. sufficient Ushers or other staff
to steer families in the right
direction
6. Legal representatives must
consider that if they wish to see
family after their inquest they
must have other representative
available to deal with the next
inquest.
j.Family members not called as
witness will have to finance their
own journey and expenses
k. right of press to be present at
1. to listen to any points

         FILE NOTE BATED 1 2 .7 .8 9 .   ’S.40p.m. aryproximately.


         TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. ERASER OF SILVERMAN AMD LIVERMORE.

1.       He explained to me that they were various groups of solicitors
         representing various bereaved and deceased people and that they
         were the representative firm for their particular group which
         involved around 40 deceased. He explained that it had been Lord
         Justice Taylor's direction that one firm/counsel should represent
         the bereaved and that he would hope that I might take a smmilar view.
         I said that as far as I was concerned, I would very much prefer that,
         though I felt that if there was anybody who wanted to be individually
         represented I wouldn't be in a position to gain say that.
         He agreed and he said that there might well be some people who wanted
         to be individually represented.
         He indicated that he would like to come and see me to discuss some
         of the practical problems relating to the Inquest. He said he wasn't
         entirely sure about whether this was in order or not, but if I was
         willing to see him he would like to come whilst they of course had
         to protect their client's interests they were merely wanting to talk
         about the practical organisation of the Inquest. I said that I
         had wondered about this as well but if the discussion was limited
         to sorting out timings and logistics and general matters, then provided
         the meeting was properly liaadES" so that there would be no suggestion
         that anything was done which was not above board, I couldn't really
         see any objection why I should not meet with him. We agreed that
         we would meet at 11.a.m. on the 21st of July, that is a Friday.
         We then spent a few more minutes disuccing one or two other matters.
             a. I said that I was minded -to release the p.m. reports
                 but that I would like to <®efer detailed discussion of
                 this until the 21st.
              b. I said that I didn't think that I would be willing to
                 release information regarding location of the diseased,
                 but to deal with this at the Inquest.
              c. I indicated that my present thinking was that the Inquest
                 should commence on the 15th of January.
              d.    Mr. Fraser felt that it might be possible to either take
                    as read some of the evidence which was given at the
                    Public Inquiry. He wonders whether a way forward to
                    cut down on the quantity and volume of evidence would be
                    to ask"various interested pazjties to nominate a number of
                     key witnesses whom they would like to give evidence with
                     regard to the background information. He envisaged a
                     situation where each individual Inquest was dealt with
                     and where there was a sort of general background discussion
                     of what had happened, which was covering the ground of the
                     Public Inquiry. I indicated to him that this was more or
                     less in line with my thinking. That I was anxious neither
                     to waste money, nor to have in Inquest which was longer
                     than necessary, but by jhe same token neither did I want
     it suggested that a full Inquiry had not been undertaken and
     this was of course something which his clients would probably
     be more interested in than anyone else.
I asked him if he had some idea of how many people were likely to want to
attend the Inquest. He said the general opinion of the Steering Committee
and the Solicitors involved was that people would not want to come
to the generic part of the Inquest, as this would be a repetition to
a certain extent, but that they would probably want to come to their
own individual bits. He felt that if they could be timetables so
that they would know when to expect to have to attend, this would
be helpful. I said that it was my intention probably to timetable,
but not too tightly.
I explained to Mr. I*razer that as a personal view, I felt that it
would be better in cases such as this, where public inquiries took
place, Inquests could be dealt with in the same way as they were in
cases of Murder, but unfortunately that was not the present law and
so we had to live with that.
We agreed to meet on the 21st of July.

Meeting w ith Mark Webster, Legal Department (Telephone Ho.
734018), David Purchon and Pat O'Heil a t about 10.20a.m .
We d iscu ssed the procedures r e la tin g to the m atter.
Mr. Webster sa id he would l e t me have a synopsis o f the
le g a l p o sitio n as he understands i t , but i t appeared to
him th a t a t the present tim e, mine was the on ly o f i c i a l ly
            inquiry in fo r c e , a J u d icia l inquiry was a n tic ip a ted .
In ad d ition to th a t, apart from the Environmental H ealth,
would be h old ing th e ir own inquiry and in p a rticu la r they were
concerned about the sa fe ty a t the s i t e .
They requested th a t I should                     ew any vid eos which e x is te d
r e la tin g to the area between the t u r n s tile s and the tun n el,
so th a t they can determine whether any a d d itio n a l sa fe ty
b a rriers were needed.        I sa id th a t I would tr y and fin d
out what vid eos we had and would see th a t arrangements
»■
would p o ssib ly be mai s .      I could see no o b jectio n to i t .


I explained th a t I m yself wanted to be as co-op erative as p o ssib le
and i t had to be c le a r ly seen th a t I was independent o f the
Council, p a r tic u la r ly as the Council were to a ce r ta in exten t
in volved in the s itu a tio n because o f th e ir lic e n c in g r e s p o n s ib ilite s .
This was agreed and accepted.


We d iscu ssed h elp and support and in p a rticu la r the so r t
o f Inquest we we would run.           I sa id th at I had n ot y e t decided
because i t depended to a ce r ta in ex ten t upon the announcement
 to-day but I a n ticip a ted th a t we would need q u ite a lo t o f
 space.      I did not think th a t the Inquest would be h eld in the
very near fu tu re.        I o u tlin ed b r ie f ly my thoughts and how to
 organise th in gs and explained th a t we would open Inquests on
 Tuesday.      I a lso sa id th a t I a n ticip a ted th at we might need
 le g a l h lfp in the form o f Counsel to the Inquest, more
 se c r e ta r ia l help and various other th in g s, but th a t I would
 be in touch and d iscu ss t h is as the need a rose.             Ho o b jectio n
 was taken and indeed everybody confirmed th at they would want
 to be as co-op erative as they p o ssib ly could in the m atter.


 I to ld David Purchon th a t apparently the Undertakers from
 Liverpool had been in touch w ith us and sa id th a t they did not
 want us to move the bodies in b lock s, but they wanted to come
 and c o lle c t them them selves as th a t they were not maki ng any
 ex tra charge to the r e la t iv e s fo r the excess jeu m ey.           He
     sa id th a t he would be in touch w ith Graham to fin d out who
 had been on the phone and th a t the Council would do a l l the necessary
n eg o tia tio n s in th a t f ie l d , so th a t I d id n 't have to worry
about i t . ,


I sa id th at they were more than happy to a s s is t w ith anything
and even in p a rticu la r the P ress O fficer o f S h e ffie ld would
be very happy to h elp and would be in touch w ith me to
see what needed to be done.


The next question I put to him                                      was the 2?th
o f A pril and i t i s urgent th at Council makes d ecisio n s as to
what a d d itio n a l recommendations regarding b arriers or sa fe ty
requirements should be implemented before th a t.




I spoke to C hief Superintendent Addis who rang me.                He confirmed
th at as fa r as he was concerned there were now no p o lic e ob jectio n s
to the removal o f the item s o f equipment.           I pointed out to him
th at i f West Midlands were going to in v e stig a te the m atter,
they might want to have sig h t o f the locu s without movement.
He sa id th at he s t i l l d id n 't know whether West Midlands would
be d ealin g w ith the case and he would l e t me know as soon
as he knew who the con tact man was.           In the meantime, I sa id
I might g et in touch w ith him m yself and he sa id th a t i t was
a m atter fo r me.
I took the opportunity o f exp la in in g to him th a t the hiccup
w ith Kenyons w asn't r e a lly as serio u s as he might have thought,
because even i f we had asked them to come, there would have been
a t le a s t an a d d itio n a l three hours d elay, as th e ir turn out
tirm i s around 4 hours according to t h is sh ee t.
Mr. Addis w asn't sure whether West Midlands would be merely looking
a t the P o lic e , whether they would be a ctin g fo r me or what the
p o sitio n would b e.   He would keep me informed.




Telephone c a ll from Mr. Rice          734643* one o f the A ssista n t D irecto r's
o f Environmental H ealth.         Apparently i t had begun to ra in a t H illsborough
and the engineers were sayin g th a t i f they d id n 't remove the metalwork
str a ig h t away i t would be very d i f f i c u l t to make a proper assessm ent.
I sa id I thought th a t I had been to ld th a t i t had been p rotected .
He sa id yes but on ly as w ell as one could.           I explained th at i f
there was a J u d ic ia l Inquiry, the Judge might w ell want to see
lo cu ses indeed the P o lic e .     I sa id th at I would come back to him.
I telephone Mr. Hat tr e s s and asked, and d iscu ssed i t w ith him.            He
explained the r e la tio n sh ip between h im self and S h e ffie ld C ity
Council and sa id th a t w h ilst there was some overlapor le g is la t io n
as they had a more s p e c ific r o le , i t was agreed as i t was th e ir
general p o lic y th a t S h e ffie ld should be doing the in v e stig a tio n s ,
but th at he would check, w ith the mechanical engineers as to whether
i t was a b so lu tely e s s e n tia l fo r the metalwork to be removed.      I
l e f t the dilemma to him.     He sa id he would come back to me as
soon as p o ssib le .


Telephone ced i to C hief Constable o f the West Midlands P o lic e
A uthority - 021 236 5000.
I spoke to A ssista n t C hief Constable Jones, Mr. Jones, who informed
me th a t i t had not y e t been d e f in it iv e ly decided th at they would
be in charge o f the task , nor had the terms o f referen ce been
agreed, but as fa r as he knew d ecisio n s had to be taken by Jp.m.
S im ila rly he was not y e t in a p o sitio n to say who the Judge,
i f any would be heading the in q u iry.        I explained th at the reason
fo r my c a l l was th e urgency in r e la tio n to the metalwork.


Mr. Jones from Birmingham rang back.            He sa id th at they were
s t i l l not in a p o sitio n to express a d e fin itiv e view , but
h is C hief C onstable's advice was th a t he f e l t th a t both they
and the Judge would want to see the locu s and th a t the metalwork
should not be removed u n til th a t had been done.           He assumed
th a t they would be v i s i t in g to-morrow, i f they were appointed.

I telephoned Mr. B ice, spoke to him and David Purchon.                I explained
to him what h at been sa id in Birmingham and asked them to take
whatever step s were n ecessary to preserve the scen e, in clu d in g
ere c tio n o f the te n t what have you (su g g estio n from Birmingham).
Mr. B ice sa id th at he would g et in touch w ith the ground and put th in gs
in hand.    In ad d ition he mentioned th a t they were a l i t t l e concerned
about the se c u r ity o f the s i t e as some people seemed to be wandering
around.


I telephoned, Mr. H attress telephoned me back.              He confirmed
th a t the engineers would cover t h is w ith some p ro tectiv e m aterial
and ob viou sly they wanted to do th is as quickly as p o ss ib le .          I
to ld him th a t I had suggested to Environmental Health Department
to make sure th a t i t was properly covered, and th a t a te n t was rected .
He f e l t th a t they would not have the ca p a city .      He suggested th at the
Club should be asked to do i t .        Mr. Macarel, Club S ecretary,
T ele Ho. 343122.


I telephoned Mr* Purchon again and spoke to him.               I asked him whether
he thought th a t he had expressed to deal w ith t h is , so th at I
could r in g the Club but th at I would p refer not to do so , bearing
in mind th a t i t was th e ir equipment we were ta lk in g about.            David
sa id th a t the m atter was in hand and th a t whatever was needed to
be done would be done.


Mr. H attress a lso mentioned th a t he was a b it concerned about the
situ a te d s i t e .


I telephoned Mr. Addis and spoke to Mr. Barden h is a s s is ta n t,
Mr. Addis being o u t.           I to ld him what was happening w ith regard
to p reservin g the s i t e and mentioned th a t there was some concern
about the se c u r ity . I sa id would he p lea se make sure th at
no un-authorised persons had access to the offen d in g area.
He sa id th a t t h is would be put in hand.


I spoke to Mr. Tidy, Coroner's O ffice fo r Dr. Kingman. Dr. Knapman
b ein g o u t,     I asked him how they s e t about adjourning the Clapham
Train D isa ster In q u est.        He sa id th at a t the opening they adjourned
i t sin e d ie .        They then resumed i t in January w ith s o lic it o r s
and had a furth er resumption in February when formal id e n tific a tio n ,
evidence and pathology was taken.               I think th is was in fa c t
before a Jury.            I t now stands adjourned again.


I had a conversation w ith the Vicar o f Grenoside, Bev.                             .   We
d iscu ssed procedures.           Isa id th a t we were not planning to have
fam ily here to-morrow or Wednesday, but we would no doubj have them
back a t th e main Inquest but th a t there was p len ty o f time to do planning fo r
th a t.


Mr. Derek                   Superintendent, John Charles D et. Inspector
norm ally sta tio n e d a t Rotherham but now attached to Hammerton Road P o lic e
S ta tio n 852211 Extn 3201 came to see me.              They had been charged
w ith d ealin g w ith the inquiry and a s s is t in g me and they wasted to
know what was happening as fa r as the opening was concerned and in
p a rticu la r whether I needed the o f fic e r s or any other w itn esses
a t the opening.            I sa id th a t as fa r as we were concerned we were
deeding w ith documentary by way o f documents, th a t we had a l l
the n ecessary paperwork and th a t we d id n 't need anybody e ls e there
except th a t I wanted a l e t t e r from him confirm ing th a t there was no
ob jectio n to r e le a s in g the body.
We d iscu ssed the in te r a c tio n o f the various in q u ir ie s and the need
fo r statem ents.           I sa id th a t as fa r as I could se e , provided th a t
statem ents were taken, I could see very l i t t l e advantage in
d u p lica tin g th e se .     Obviously a t some p oin t I might w ell want to see
them.
We d iscu ssed id e n tific a tio n o f lo c a tio n o f th e various deceased.
I was explained to me th a t there was considerable d if f ic u lt y w ith
co n tin u ity because bodies were carried by a l l and sundry.               A ll
some o f them were ju s t dumped a t the mortuary but no-body knew p r e c is e ly
whether those people had been standing who had been k ille d .                  There
were photographs but i t would be an a b so lu tely enormous task to
try and id e n tify where the people were lo ca ted , assuming th a t I
wanted th a t done.
We d iscu ssed t h is fo r a w hile and I suggested th a t they should look through
the photographs to see whether they «ould fin d some good ones
o f the p a rticu la r lo c u s.   These could then be enlarged and in d iv id u al
photographs taken w ere/seii? to the fa m ilie s who might be able to
id e n tify th e ir own loved one much more quickly and more e f f ic ie n t ly
than any p o lic e o f f ic e r cou ld .    They thought th at t h is was an
e x c e lle n t id ea and were going to look in to i t .      Although i n i t i a l l y
I thought i t w asn't te r r ib ly important to know p r e c is e ly where the
people were, the more we talk ed , the more i t seemed th a t th is
would be a good id ea , not only from the p oin t o f view o f the inquest
but a lso because i t might g iv e an answer as to what was a c tu a lly happening.


Both o f fic e r s o ffered me th e ir f u l l co-op eration fo r which I thanked
tbem.

I immediately to ld them about the problem w ith the videos and asked
i f they would be kind enough to fin d out p r e c is e ly what th ey did
have p a r tic u la r ly w ith vid eos o f th at area and l e t me know.         I sa id
t h is was urgent and they understood t h is .           Apparently there i s an
o f f ic e r who i s summarising the vid oes and w ill l e t me have a copy
o f the statem ent.


Apparently the B .B .S. have refu sed to r e le a se th e ir footage.


I asked them i f they could p lea se ob tain a copy o f the lo g from
 Inspector Jackson when he rang me on the Saturday afternoon, so
 th a t I could g et the co rrect tim ing.


 I spoke to Michael                         301671           1199,    we discussed
 arrangements for the openings so that we will have people available
 in case relatives turned up.
 I spoke to P h ilip Dent P ress O fficer, 734052.            I read him the d raft
 p ress statem ent which he thought was very good.              He sa id he would
 come back to me as quickly as p o ssib le as to how i t would be b est
 to r e le a s e i t .


 I spoke w ith Mr. Dent again.             The P ress Conference i s a t 6 . 3O,
 David Purchon thought i t would be a good id ea i f r l was present
 but th at he would say th a t I w asn't answering any q u estio n s.
 I sa id th at i t would be very d if f i c u l t fo r me to be there a t 6^30
 and in any case I w asn't sure th a t I wanted to b e.              We agreed th a t I would

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.



19.19 hours telephone conversation with David Purchon.



     1. David Purchon informed me that the Council had agreed to
        fund the transportation of the bodies from Sheffield to
        Liverpool or wherever else they were going, and they
        wcrald make the appropriate arrangements as soon as I
        was in a position to tell them when it would be
        possible and what my thoughtson the matter were. &
        also said that the Council thanked me for the suggestion.

    2.   Apparently the investigation into this incident will be
         undertaken by some force other than South Yorkshire, who
         will be responsibile for investigating the matter.   That
         force has as yet not been identified.

     3» In the circumstances, I said that we would have to wait
        a little while before we could release the items from
         the ground and that force might have different views
         from Hr. Addis as to the suitability of releasing the
        articles. In any event, Mr. Addis had not yet come
        back to me. Mr. Purchon said he didn’t consider it to
        be a particular problem, though he assumed that he would
        want the things in their laboratory by the end of this week.
        I said I couldn't see any real problems with that.

    4. I explained to him what ay plans were with regard to the Inquest.

    5. I mentioned to him that I thought that the pathologists should
       probably be paid at a special rate, this is what Stephen Jones
       told Bfijtoppened with the disaster at Kegworth. I said I
       w o u l d I word with the Loughborough Coroner about that.

    6 . I also told him that we were doing exceedingly well and
        that everybody had worked exceptionally hard. He said he
         could certainly consider special recommendations for
        his staff. Mr. Purchon also said that it had been agreed
        that Mark Webster would be the spokesperson for the Council      o
        in respect of legal matters. David-Purchon in respect of
        technical matters, and Clive Betts/on pBfixical matters, and
        that they were interested to speak to me, Mark Webster and
        himself to-morrow morning i.e., the 17th in order to discuss
        their role, particularly in respect of how it hinges upon to.
        I agreed that we would meet at 10.20 in ay office.

         I said that when we knew what was happening with regard to
         inquiries and when the dust settled, I would try and decide how best
         how to deal with this particular matter. I would then be in
         touch with him and discuss various aspects, which might be relevant
         with regard to cost. David Purchon said that he had already
         spoken to the         and they had said that they would like
         to hear proposals. He did not think that the Council would
         want to be seen to be ungenerous in a'situation such as this.

         He also said that on the whole they would prefer a Select
         Committee rather than a Judicial Inquiry, because of the
         time factor.

the moving o f the bodies who were a t th at p oin t stored i f

the gymnasium a t the fo o tb a ll ground.       He did not think th at

H eath's would be ab le to cope and in the circum stances I

agreed th at Kenyons could be authorised to come and do the

I telephoned David Purchon.           I spoke to h is w ife , he was already

me to con tact him as soon as p o ssib le in connection with

 the moving o f the b od ies.       I to ld him th a t I was on my way
and that I would be in touch as soon as possible


                        C>
I set off for Sheffield shortly fceftare 5p.m. with Geoffrey who

accompanied me and handled the phone in the car where necessary

(two calls, 1 from Inspector Jackson and 1 to Hr. Purchon mentioned —

above).



Arrived in Sheffield at about 20 to 6 at the Medico Legal Centre.

There present was, Norman, David Slater and Professor Usher, David Hinchliff,

Professor Stephen Jones, Dr. Holden, Dr. James Burton (University

Health Service), myself and my son Geoffrey.      Graham Marsden

joined us a short while later.

Dr. Holden, Dr. Burton and Geoffrey took no part in the conversation.



We discussed the situation.   Dr. Stephen Jones pointed out that it was

essential that we have some sort of plan with regard to identification

and procedure, otherwise               considerable              difficulties.

He had had recent experience of the            A *.                crash

at          . He thought it would be desirable to prepare a check

list of things that needed to be done including fingerprinting,

ordontology and so on if that was necessary.      We discussed

the possible need for X-rays and deferred any decisions until after

we had seen the situation in situv



Norman informed me that the ambulance service had agreed to ferry

bodies between the temporary mortuary and the Medico Legal Centre.

He also informed me that it was thought that we had sufficient capacity

for all the dead, provided that we used the special p.m. room as a chiller.

Arrangements were in hand tolower the temperature.      As far as the local

authority were in attendance including, initially excluding John Batley

but he joined us as soon as he became available.      Roger Michie was
  13* It was agreed that we would proceed to Hillsborough and Professor

       Stephen Jones, myself, Professor Usher, David Slater and David

       Jarvis proceeded to the ground.



  14* Detective (Thief Superintendent Addis was in overall charge of the

       situation.   He informed us that at that time, he had around 80

       bodies all laid out on the floor of the gymnasium, soi*e in body

       sacks and some wrapped in blankets.     Each body had <x {p-& LiO

       attached to it and they all had numbers affixed to them.      At that

       point he was still expecting Kenyons to come.      I told him that

 £     in view of the offer of the ambulance service, we had decided

       that we would not after all, need them. Mr. Addis said that he

       had not made arrangements for viewing, as he assumed that Kenyons

       would be going the necessary preparation.



 15*   It was agreed that we would retain the numbering system already

       commenced, which started at 1 and went upward sequentially.         Mer |

       asked that the number should not merely be stuck to the outer clothing

       of the deceased but should be written on an exhibit tag which should

       be F&yBiitally fastened to the body of the deceased.     It was agreed
                         US)
       that all the etiaer^identified dead could be photographed with

       poloroid cameras and that their photographs would be appropriately

       numbered and displayed on a board, for viewing by relatives, so

       that they could pick out their own deceased and not have the trauma

       of having to walk between the bodies, looking for their loved one.



16 .   In order to ensure that no-body was missed, 4he-«rt¥Ies were made for

       the dead bodies thatfwe^e then lying at the Northern General and

       the Hallamshire^JLl and(3 respectively to be transferred back to

       Hillsborough and Hr. Hopkins of the ambulance service organised that.

       Viewing could not commence until all the bodies were in situ and

       all photographs had been taken.   Arrangements were made for a viewing

       area to be prepared, screened off from the temporary mortuary, and

       at the other end of the   gymnasium   as far away as possible from the

       mortuary end.   Other procedure agreed was that the families who at
that time were being accommodated at Hammerton Road Police

Station would be brought to the site in a coach and would

then be taken one at a time into the photographic viewing

gallery.   Once they had identified their loved one, they would

be taken to the viewing area and the body be brought to them

   appropiately displayed i.e., the head, so that it could be

positively identified.   As soon as this identification had been

positively done the officer responsible for that body would

accompany the identifier and take a written statement from them,

giving the identification.    It would be the responsibility of

the officer to accompany the body to the Medico Legal Centre

and to hand it over to the staff.   Transportation would be by

ambulance service        at the time.



Professor Usher had to leave to go and look at a suspicious death.



Stephen Jones       I stayed for a few more minutes and then returned

to the Medico Legal Centre.    Professor Jones was returning to

N0 ttingham(and he took Geoffrey with him) and I stayed on.



Ve were somewhat concerned as to the number of pathologists we would

accommodate because of problems with our morticians who of course

would be working very hard during the night receiving bodies and

one of whom unfortunately was ill so we were rather low on numbers.

Dr. Sl&ter agreed to bring his own technician and Professor Stephen

Jones also agreed to bring his own team.



It was agreed that we would do 3 post mortems sessions, 9 to 12.30,

2 to 5 and 6 to 9p.m.


We decided that at that stage that we would only be able to run

 three tables in the morning (Proff Usher, Proff Jones and Dr. Slater)

 and the same team to work in the afternoon.   At that point we felt that

 we would only run 1 table at night unless we could raise some N.l.S.

 technicians.>
Mr. H in c h liff and m yself v is it e d the Accident & Emergency Department

o f the Royal Hallamshire H ospital and the Horthem General.                 At the

Northern General we saw Mr. Wardrope the Consultant to whom I

expressed ap p reciation fo r a l l the work which had been done by

him and the s t a f f .     Sim ilar comments were expressed to the charge

nurse in charge a t the H allam shire.         Mr. H in& liff and I then

proceeded to H illsborough where we were to ld th a t the

was more or le s s complete and th a t vi4w i ig would commence sh o r tly .

The f i r s t r e la tiv e arrived w h ilst we were s t i l l th ere.   We returned

to the Medico Legal Centre.



 P                   f e i t th a t i t perhaps might be a good id ea i f we

obtained a ssista n c e from the Forensic P a th o lo g ists a t Leeds and
t*
gbe rang Mike Green who was out but he l e f t a message fo r him

on the ansaphone.



In the meantime maiy o ffe r s o f help had been received in clu d in g

Dennis Cotton, P rofessor Underwood, P rofessor Henry, S te v ie Beck

and o th e rs.   O ffers o f h elp had a lso been received from Mr. P otter,

Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Hatch, a l l Coroners.



With a view to tr y in g to ease the trauma fo r the fam ily, and to speed

up the openings o f the Inquest, I thought th a t i t might be p o ssib le

to do th is w ith documentary evidence and a form was designed w ith a

view to enableing the p o lic e office*'who had accompanied the body

to g iv e e s s e n tia l id e n tific a tio n evidence so th a t the body could

be relea sed on documentary evid en ce.


                                                             a
I saw Mr. Michie and explained to him th a t th is would b e/very very expensive

m atter and th a t I took i t th at the Council would be w illin g to fond

whatever was n ecessary in connection w ith t h is Inquest and Mr. Michie

confirmed t h is .



Later on th a t evening I saw David Purchon who sim ila r ly confirmed

the p ro p o sitio n .    We a lso d iscu ssed the moving o f bodies from S h e ffie ld
                                              - 6 -



          to Liverpool, .LaiL   hu iiuuHuii                   . I thought that

          it might possibly be nice if the Council over here and in Liverpool

          undertook to fund the excess costs arising out of the transportation

          of that.    He said no doubt the Councils will be thinking about

          things like that.



    28.   We had some trouble with,technical problems with identification in

          that the individual police officers would not be available to identify

          all the bodies to the pathologists.      Arrangements were made for each

          individual officer to identify the body to one receiving officer

          who in turn would be responsible for identifying the bodies to the

          pathologists.



29.       David Hinchliff had suggested that it might be worth looking into

                        holding the Inquest at Liverpool if the bulk of

          the people actually came from there. We thought that probably would

          not be possible, but it was certainly a good idea from the point

          of view of saving people travelling inconvenience.



50.       I left the Medico Legal Centre at half past twelve or so on Sunday

^         the l6th.



          SPUMY THE l6TH lERIL - MEDICO LEGAL CENTRE .



          In the morning about 8-o-clock all bodies have been received.      94 in total -

          16 were Identified at that point.       Arrangements were in hand for

          identifications of these bodies to be completed.



    51.   I considered the need for post mortem in these cases, bearing in mind

          that visual inspection indicated that a probabljg. conclusion would be

          Traumatic Asphyxia and bearing in mind that many of the deceased were

          young people.    I consulted with Ken Potter, David Hinchliff and Professor

          Usher, all of whom felt that it would be advisable to, despite this,

          to have a post mortem.       Not least to exclude any problems should there

          be any civil litigation with regard to say life expectancy or if there

          should be criminal prosecutions arising out of this matter.
I c a r e fu lly considered the p oin t and decided in the f in a l

a n a ly sis th a t in view o f the nature o f t h is d isa s te r , the

d e fin itiv e n e ss o f a p ost mortem , the c i v i l and crim inal asp ects

o f the m atter, and the p ro visio n s o f the Coroners A ct, paragraph

21 (th a t i s on the assumption th a t a Jury were to r e c a lls)

and the d e s ir a b ility o f having d e fin itiv e d iagnoses, th a t i t

would be inappropriate in thfo Sansc n e t to proceed*with a p ost

mortem.      I telephoned Norman and to ld him th a t should there be

any p a rticu la r fam ily who very strenuously o b ject to a p.m.

he w aa'toconsult w ith me about th at in d iv id u a l ca se.      I a lso

spoke to Norman about the fa c t th a t R rofessor Usher had sa id

th a t they were s t i l l wcdting fo r b o d ies.    He to ld me th a t Graham

was on the p oin t o f r e le a sin g s u f f ic ie n t bodies fo r them to

g et sta r te d .



I arrived a t the Medico Legal Centre around 10 p ast 11.                  There

were gfete p a th o lo g ists working, P rofessor Usher, P rofessor

Stephen Jones, David S la te r , P rofessor Unddrwood, whom I

had phoned the previous evening and asked i f he could make

arrangements to come in and a lso to see i f he could rake up

some tech n icia n s, and Dr. Clark from, Forensic P a th o lo g ist from

Glasgow form erly o f Nottingham.         I was to ld th a t three N.H.S.

tech n ician s would be coming in the afternoon, evening, and th at

Da^r-Sandy and Dr. John Shortlasnd would a lso be coming in the evening.

I had a message from Dr. Green to the e f f e c t th a t he could

come in the evening w ith as many p a th o lo g ists as we would lik e .



I obtained Dr. Green's telephone number and I phoned him.                     I

sa id th a t on the whole we had enough p a th o lo g ists but we would

be p leased to see one o f them.         He sa id th a t Dr. Seva would come

down togeth er w ith a collea gu e o f h is .        That h e, Dr. Green would

 sta y to hold the fo r t and cover i f P rofessor Usher wished i t .



 I saw Mr. Addis a t the Medico Legal Centre.             I thanked him fo r a l l

 the th in gs he had organised and done and asked him in p a rticu la r to
                                              - 8 -



          thank all the officers who had had a very difficult task and who

          as far as I was concerned had done It well, and that this particular

          applied to the officers who had toughed the bodies.


                                          from the football ground.
46 .      I had a telephone call from Mr. f'urchon./ He was there with Mr. Nattress

          and two en gin eers, Mr.                  and Mr. N icholson.    These were

          Health & Safety Executive people.        Videos and photographs had been

          taken of the stand including the damaged crash barriers and he wanted

          permission to move theseto the laboratories for microscopic and other

^         examinations.     I said that as far as I was concerned I had no objection

          but that I wanted to confirm that the police had completed all their

          inquiries before authorising their release.          I also suggested that

          it might be worth checking the other crash barriers which had

          not given way to see whether what strength they would sustain.           He

          said that Sheffield had various insurers and structural engineers

          were actually on the site and were measuring the tension pressure

          on the crash barriers.. He also said that these had been tested last

          July and found satisfactory.        Apparently they were tested to about 1.4

          to n s.   I rang Mr. Addis a t Hammerton Hoad P o lic e S ta tio n as

^         he had left the Medico Legal Centre.        Mr. Addis said that he

          was not prepared at this stage to let any ^ n U fJ ($0 , as further

          inquries had to be made and possibly measurements and photographs taken.

          He would let me know as soon as he was in a position to authorise the

          removal o f the



47*       I telephoned David Purchon who wasn't there.          I left a message with

          Chief Inspector ?                      to this effect and asked him to

          pass it on to Mr. ^urchon who was on the site somewhere.



    48.   Message to contact Mr. Podmore, which I did.          Mr. Podmore explained

          that he was anxious to know what arragements had to be made if any

          with regard to the moving of the bodies.          Were they expected to move

          them             . I told Mr. Podmore that ^we were making ailil

          progress with the post mortems and I was hopeful that these would

          be completed by Tuesday,all being well, I was planning to open the Inquest
with documentary evidence and without the need for the attendance

of the relatives on Wednesday and Thursday.   I explained that

I had already thought of this problem and had dieussed it with

Hr. Purchon the night before, and that it was a matter of deciding

what could be done to assist the relatives in this respect.      I said

that   po        try and move them in bulk from here which would

be inconvenient in some ways but arrangements would have to be made

as to the distribution to Liverpool or elsewhere.   The alternative

would be to allow relatives to make their own arrangements with

their own undertakers who would then have to come and collect

them in the conventional way.   Arrangements would be made in respect of

this if the Council wouldn't mind bat clearly this is something

which I couldn't authorise.   Hr. Podmore told me that the Council

were meeting that afternoon and that a Disaster Appealwas about
                        V
to be launched.2/-      _give him any further information if

he wanted to contact me and I gave him my home telephone number.



In the afternoon we had two pathologists, Dr. Shortland and

Professor Henry turned up.  I was expecting them in the evening.
                                   were very useful
They did however come with three^technicians who/ . In the end

the pathologists sorted themselves out and             continued

to be operational in the afternoon.



Dr. Slater said that he would come on Monday and bring his own team again.

Professor Jones was unable to come on Monday.



I discussed the removal of the bodies from Sheffield with Graham.

Obviously there were advantages either way, in bulk or individual

removal.    In the end we decided to wait Council's decision and

also play it a little bit by ear. We agreed that we would aim

 to open Inquests Wednesday Thursday and Friday.



David Hinchliff agreed to cover Barnsley for Wednesday and Thursday

 afternoon.
         Arrangements had been made by the officers for food to

be brought in to the Medico Legal Centre and of course all

the necessary work with the Gen Id's documentation and so

on was all undertaken by the officers.



There was one possible hiccup and that was to do with Kenyons.

I had initially said that we should instruct them to come

about three quarters of an hour when I arrived in Sheffield,

it was an hour later when I arrived in Sheffield, I was told

 that the ambulance service had agreed to move the bodies.

In those circumstances, I felt that it was unnecessary for

Kenyons to be instructed and I said that we should canael them.

Norman telephoned Sontrol and told them this.     He ascertained

 that in fact Kenyons had not been instructed to come, it was

 therefore unnecessary to cancel them,   gather when I went

 to Hillsborough, Det. Chief Superintendent Addis was under the

 impression that Kenyons were on their way and for some reason

                   between him, Control and myself had broken

 down.



Professor Jones suggested that each pathology team should consist

 of a pathologist, exhibit officer, a technician and a secretary.

 In addition adequate photographic cover had to be available.

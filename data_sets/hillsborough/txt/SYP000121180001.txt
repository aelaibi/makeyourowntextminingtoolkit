                   SUBJECT:
                                  SECURITY OF STATION




                   I recently asked Detective Constable Hutchison of the
                   Crime Prevention Department to conduct a survey on
                   security at Hammerton Road Police Station.  The physical
                   nature of the building makes security appallingly
                   inadequate.  Some of his findings will be addressed by
                   fitting security measures to certain windows and doors.
                   Others are not economically viable and we must adapt our
                   practices to take account of the remaining security
                   limitations.

                   Detective Constable Hutchison reports several practices
                   which can easily be changed to enhance the level of
                   security around Hammerton Road Police Station.  These are
                   listed below and I would like all officers to follow
                   these measures at all times:

                   1.   The rear door, which is now fitted with a box key as
                        well as an electronic release, must not be left '
                        wedged open at any time.  The door is overlooked by a
                        CCTV monitor in the Control Room and the Control Room
                        Sergeant should ensure that the door is never left
                        ajar.

                   2.   During the summer external doors and windows were
                        regularly left open for some fresh air.   It is
                        obvious that all windows and doors should be secure
                        when leaving any part of the building unattended^.
                        Some windows of particular concern (such as the CID
                        office ground level windows) will be fitted with
                        restricter bars so that entry cannot be gained even
                        when the windows are open.

                   3.   The fire exit door from the portacabin annex is
                        frequently left open.  This must not continue and
                        officers (particularly Sub Divisional Support Group
                        staff) should secure the door when leaving their
                        office unattended.  I have asked for a box key lock
                        to be fitted to this door as a convenience.




  GEN/2
   •’Vehicles parked in the station yard (or anywhere else
     for that matter) must be secured at all times when
     left unattended.  There has been evidence of vehicles
     being left unlocked and, during the hotter months,
     with windows wound down.

    Inspector Bullas has responsibility for station
    security and I have asked him to monitor these
    practices to ensure that Hammerton Road Police
    Station remains secure.  Your assistance is sought in
    achieving this.

                  SUBJECT:   Hi l l s b o r o u g h   enquiry   security   of     material


                  In July 1991 the material collected by the West Midland Police
                  enquiry was handed over to the South Yorkshire Police.   This
                  material was collected from Furnival House and deposited at
                  Hammerton Road Police Station in the 'Old DHQ Building'.

                  Prior to the transfer the rooms identified within the building
                  for the storage of the material were made secure by window
                  locks and an Alarm System being fitted.  The instalation of
                  the alarm system was carried out by Smart Alarms.

                  In October 1991 the Enquiry Team took occupation of one further
                  office within the same building.  This office was also secured
                  by means of window locks and an Alarm System.

                  It would appear that no order number was issued to authorise
                  the work prior to its commencement.

                  Attached please find 2 invoices received from Smart Alarms
                  in respect of work carried out by that company.

                  I request that an order number be allocated for this work in
                  order that payment can be made in respect of the invoices.

           SUBJECT:   Hillsborough inquiry _ Old DiiQ building

               '..'ith record to the alarm system covering the offices in the old
                211r building used by the Hillsborough enquiry tean.    At the
               --resent tir.e the alarm is showing a fault condition on the indicator
               ~anel in the control room and Guporintendent Fell has instructed
               me to ensure that all officers are aware of the existance of the
               alarm system and of the response procedures.

               Although showing a fault condition on the control panel, the system
               will still give the audible indication should there be an intrusion
               to any of the offices used by the enquiry teara.and the appropriate
               response should be given.

               On an audible indication of an alarm condition the following steps
               should be taken:-

               1) an officer should visit the building and check doors and windows
                   are secure and there is no sign of entry.

               2) one of the keyholding officers should be informed - Inspector

                   experienced in contacting any of these officers the Complaints

              AFTER THE HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

Further to our discussions today I felt it would be useful to set out
intentions and circulate to all persons who have been involved in the
various initiatives relating to the Hillsborough aftermath.

If you are to be responsible for the Hillsborough material, with me doing
the necessary work involved, it is important that all initiatives and
decisions are made known to me that might effect the planning and
implementation. I would ask that this policy operates forthwith.

I believe that there are different types of material involved as follows:-

A.   Documents of the Dear Enquiry

B.   Material supporting the Dear Enquiry

C.   Property of the deceased

D.   Property collected at the scene, identifiable and unidentifiable

E.   Documents of the Wain Enquiry

F.   Material supporting the Wain Enquiry

I believe A, B, C and D material is indexed using the "West Midlands"
computer and E and F material is indexed using the "South Yorkshire"
computer.

1.   With the co-operation of West Midlands Police the plan is to bring
      material C and D to Hammerton Road, set it up in order, check it
      and accept it. Target time is week commencing 3 June 1991 with
      the work to be completed by 7 June 1991*

2.   Transfer material E and F from Castle Green to Hammerton Road, set
      it up in order, check it and accept it. This will require approval
      decisions and appropriate hand over from the person presently
      responsible for it. The timing of this needs to be decided by the
      person currently controlling and accessing this material. Will
      you please discuss this with DCC to resolve the unknowns.

3.   Obtain the "West Midlands" machine and data and set up so that the
      index is accessible from the VDU located in Complaints and
      Discipline. This work is currently being dealt with by Computer
      Section. Target time is now until 1 July 1991 when it should be
      finalised.

4.   Once 3 is finalised with the co-operation of West Midlands Police,
      training of personnel in the use of the "West Midlands computer
      to be carried out. It is anticipated this will take 5 days and
      the personnel involved would be Police Constable Greenaway and
     Miss Mackenzie. There may be staff implications in such a proposal
      that need considering.
5.     Once 3 and H are finalised with the co-operation of West Midlands
        Police, material A and B will be brought to Hammerton Road, set
        up in order, checked and accepted. Target for this is week
        commencing 8 July 1991 with work to be completed by 12 July 1991,

6,     As soon as material is housed in Hammerton Road, from that date
        the alarm system protecting the area needs to operate. Suggest
        keyholder for this should be officer in charge FI Control Room with
        the actual key housed in glass front holder (as with armoury key).

Will you formally approve this plan please or indicate those areas that
need modification, I will then circulate to interested parties and liaise
with West Midlands Police and others to secure implementation.

             HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY COMPUTER AND DATA


I understand that events have moved on from your memorandum of 22 May
1991 which awaited my return from annual leave today.

Would you please confirm:-

a)   The machine is now at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters

b)   The data is at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters

c)   The data will be accessible by interrogating the machine prior to
      1 July 1991

d)   After 1 July 1991» notwithstanding the World Student Games
      requirements, the Hillsborough data will still be accessible

e)   Interrogation for Hillsborough data can occur by VDU to be soon
      located in Complaints and Discipline Department office accommodation

In the event of any of the answers being in the negative, would you please
identify the problem in precise detail so that steps can be taken to
overcome it.

                  complaints of criminal and disciplinary conduct of officers of
                  this Force and as coroner's officer for HM Coroner's inquests
                  into the deaths will eventually come by agreement into the
                  possession of South Yorkshire Police.

             2. It is currently anticipated that all the property of which the
                 owners are known and of which the owners are unknown that came
                 into police possession at and subsequent to the time of the
                 disaster will similarly, by agreement come into the possession
                 of South Yorkshire Police.

             3. It is currently anticipated that all the other original evidence
                 that relates to Hillsborough that did not pass into the possession
                 of the Dear Investigation but which arose from the conduct of
                 the civil action will come together with that identified at
                 paragraphs (1 ) and (2 ).

             4. All the above material it is suggested is to be housed at
                 Hammerton Road Police Station and arrangements are advanced for
                 providing the necessary security, shelving and workspace for it.

             5. The material is believed at present to be lodged mainly at
                 Furnival House, Nechells Green Police Station in Birmingham and
                 at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters.

             6 . The quantity of material involved has caused it to be indexed
                  using a HOLMES system on a computer. That machine is in
                  Birmingham, shortly to be delivered to our Headquarters.

             7. The computer information has been extracted from the machine onto
                 disc and onto tape and so is not accessible. The information
                 is being retained at Birmingham and no decision has been made
                 for its release.

             8 . The World Student Games require the computer to be available and
                  if the Hillsborough material is to be fed into the machine, that
                  work will have to be completed before (say) 1 July 1991- If the
                  disc/tape material is made available in the next few days it will
                  be entered on the machine at the same time the machine is
                  commissioned. Otherwise the information will not be put into
                  the computer and so will not be accessible until after the World
                  Student Games and will take about six weeks to put on.
                  Effectively if it is not ready before 1 July 1991 it will not
                  be ready before 1 October 1991 or thereabouts.

             9. Although responsibility for the Paragraph (1) (2)and (3)
                 material, decisions as to access and return to owners of any item
                  and decisions as to disclosure of material is yours, there is
                . as yet no policy established.
GEN/2
  ____
10. The ability to access the material will largely arise from
     interrogation of the HOLMES computer. No one in this Department
     has as yet received the necessary training to do this.

11. The nature of Paragraph (1) (2) and (3) material is such that
     it needs to be carefully documented and checked so that there
     is written agreement as to precisely which items have been
     received by the Force.

12.   The logistics of handover demand, I suggest, that West Midlands
      Officers, assisted by South Yorkshire Officers remove everything
      from Furnival House and set it in position at Hammerton Road in
      a proper order to be accessed. When this has been done the two
      forces can check and agree what there is and an official handing
      over can occur that is documented and cannot give rise to any
      future embarrassing dispute.

13.   There needs to be agreement by letter between the Forces (and
      perhaps PCA?) of the decision to handover, the logistics of the
      handover and the agreement that the handover has occurred.

14. If it is true that the documents, statements, films, photographs,
     some of which will be subject of copyright and owned by BBC, ITV,
     pressmen, etc, are only retrievable by reference to an index
     held on computer the handover cannot satisfactorily occur until
     the computer is capable of being accessed.

15. I recommend that these problems be addressed without delay, the
     necessary decisions made, confirmation of agreements set down
     on paper so that all matters are clear to all involved parties.

        SUBJECT:         HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


        On 27 March 1991, you issued -the attached memorandum in relation to the
        handover of paperwork and equipment from the West Midlands Inquiry Team
        to South Yorkshire and at that time it was thought that the paperwork
        could be accommodated in the basement store room (Room 13).

            It now appears that there is insufficient space in the basement store
            room and that the only possible place in which to house all the inquiry
            paperwork and property is in the empty ex divisional headquarters rooms
            at Hammerton Road.

            Your approval is therefore sought for this course of action.

                       SUBJECT:       hillsborough file   -   accqhhodatiou


                       On the morning of Thursday, 9 May 1991, I visited Hammerton Road Police
                       Station in company with Police Sergeant Morgan and inspected the premises
                       with a view to accommodating the Hillsborough File there as and when
                       it is handed to us by the West Midlands Police Force. The accommodation
                       as shown on the attached sketch plan would appear to be ideal and consists
                       of the following

                       The room marked as the office is 9' x 6 ' 10" and can accommodate telephone
                       points and computer points. It can be made secure with a passive beam
                       alarm and the addition of window locks to the 2 large windows in the
              //       office.

                       The room marked property store is ideal, will accommodate all the property
                       involved, is totally secure, there are no windows to this room and the
                       door would simply need providing with a secure lock.
/)u.* v-it>*v if
                        The main file room is 18' 8 " x 11' 10" and with suitable Dexion shelving,
                        which will be referred to later, will accommodate quite easily 1,300
                        files. The following measures would have to be taken to make the room



             //
                        secure. The existing external door, which would not be required, would
                        need to be made Totally secure by either being blocked ofF~or screwed
|\JU^                   up^ The 4 windows to the room would require window locks and "the main
                       "cloor into the~room would require a substantial lock- andJ a contact alarm.

                       The file room B is 13' 8 " x 11' 3" and would be ideal for the remainder
                       of the file. There are 2 windows to this room, but arrangements are
                   H   in hand to have them boarded from the inside which would make the room
                       totally secure if a suitable lock and contact alarm point was placed
                       on the door.

                       The equipment needed to make the accommodation feasible would obviously
                       be an office desk capable of taking the computer and an electric
                       typewriter and 22 Dexion units, 3' wide x 15" deep x 7' 6 " tall and a
                       telephone.

   To   :   Acting Chief Superintendent Fell                                               Date:       y M ay 1 9 9 1



            SUBJECT:      H i l l s b o r o u g h e n q u i r y f i l e /p r o p e r t y

            1 was recently given the responsibility of accepting the property
            relative to the Hillsborough Enquiry as and when the Police Complaints
            Authority announce their findings and the West Midlands Police Force
            hand the property to South Yorkshire Police.

            As a result I have liaised with Police Sergeant Morgan and Police
            Constable Greenway who have the responsibility for the South Yorkshire
            end of the enquiry.  I have also liaised with Superintendent Beechy
            and Police Constable Landers of the West Midlands Police FoKce.

            As a result I have ascertained that the property will no doubt fit
            in the property store allocated at Ecclesfield Police Station.
            However, the file itself is considerable in bulk and includes 1080
            lever arch files, 300 - A4 size boxes approximately 4 inches deep
            containing original statements, 2 5 large boxes approximately
            2 foot x 2 foot x 2 foot, containing videos, photographs etc.


             To date we have been offered various accommodation for the material
             which will become the responsibility of the Complaints and Discipline
             Department when the Police Complaints Authority announce their
             findings.  None of that accommodation has been suitable either because
             of its size or its lack of security and the fact that other material
             is presently stored there and those responsible appear reluctant to
             dispose of it.

             Wherever we store the material needs to be accessible and secure and
             should in my opinion be in one location.  I respectfully submit that
             we should identify the location as soon as possible in order that we
             can make the necessary security arrangements in order that the 'hand
             over' can be carried out speedily and efficiently.  To this end I would
             ask that the old Headquarters Buildings at Hammerton Road Police
             Station be considered.  If accepted all the material including the
             property would be available in one location and we could set about
             preparing the storage and security as soon as permission is granted.

             Another consideration is the location of the computer and its operator
             who I understand is to be Police Constable Greenway.  If we can
             establish whether he and his equipment is to be based at Headquarters
             or elsewhere we can make the necessary furniture arrangements etc.

             Purely for your information t h e ^ f 4 T e a n d property at present located
             at Furnival House, SheffipM'Tias been photographed and the photographs

          SUBJECT:           THE HILLSBROROUGH INQUIRY

          It is anticipated that the Inquest into the Hillsborough tragedy will
          end; soon and unless there is a need for a criminal investigation the
          West Midlands Inquiry Team will commence the handing-over of paperwork
          and equipment to South Yorkshire as soon as possible thereafter.
          In order that the hand-over can be properly controlled, the lease
          on Furnival House will be retained until the end of April.

          Assuming that hand-over can commence as indicated above, it is proposed
          that  the  Assistant   Chief  Constable  (Staff  Services/Discipline  &
          Complaints) take over responsibility for all residual inquiries for
          production of or reference to documentation or exhibits.      Initially
          Sergeant 758 Morgan and Constable 931 Greenway will be attached to
          Discipline & Complaints Department to deal with matters under the
          supervision of the Head of the Discipline & Complaints Department.
          It may be possible to release Sergeant Morgan from these duties at
          an early stage but in any case the situation will be monitored to
          determine the continuing need to retain either or both officers.

          Once it has been established that hand-over can take place,       Sergeant
          Morgan and Constable Greenway should liaise with the West         Midlands
          officers with a view to arranging:-

                    the hand-over of the Inquiry paperwork, property and computer;
                    and,
            b.      the necessary training so that they can input the computer
                    index records.

          Arrangements have been made for five bays to be available in the
          basement store room (Room 13) to house ’the paperwork.    The property
          will be stored in one of the empty ex-divisional Headquarters rooms
          at Hammerton Road.   A security alarm will be required to be fitted.
          The property should not be accepted from the West Midlands team unless
          and until it has all been properly documented, indexed and accounted
          for.   It is suggested that this property be retained for two years
          after which time disposal will be considered.

          The computer used by the West Midlands team is to be located in the
          Computer Room at Force Headquarters and all arrangements for this
          transfer are to be made by the Communications & Computer Department.
          The need for a computer terminal and its location should be considered
          by the Head of the Discipline & Complaints Department.

          The cancellation of all services to Furnival House (electric, cleaning
          e t c . ) will be the responsibility of Management Services as will be
          arrangements for the removal,       storage, disposal of equipment and
          furniture (other than the computer).

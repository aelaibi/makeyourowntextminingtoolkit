1.        I was born on 11th September, 1943.

2.        I am a Qualified Ambulanceman.                  Ihave been    with SYMAS for

          23 years.         I have been based at C o r p o r a t i o n            Street,

          Lodgemoor and, since 1981, at Mlddlewood Station.

3.        On Friday I worked from 0600 hours to 1400 hours.

4.        Saturday 15th April,              1989 was my     day off but it       had been

          agreed that I would work a shift of 1000 hours                          to 1800

          hours.          My    driver            was                   [   a   Qualified

          Ambulanceman.

5.        We did a couple of jobs and were then waiting at Middlewood

          Station which is about one mile from the ground.       We had

          two other crews out in the hour prior to the game and we

          were being held back for the football.

6.        Someone had put the television on and I heard a comment that
                                                                           / S o y (TZad* i2 ^

          Leppings    Lane but instead went straight down Parkside Road

          but it was very busy on Penistone Road.               (sJt'Qcfc fa

We went through the secondsentrance into the^ground and were

directed in by a policeman.                       There appeared to be no

particular urgency with anyone at the ground.                          We drove

into the gymnasium yard and reversed under the North Stand

next to the first aid room.                      There was a police control

vehicle nearby and some large police buses.                     We did not see

any other ambulances at this time.

           Iwent over to the first aid room where there was

someone with a broken arm.                     I stood outside.      Almost at

once    some         St   Joh n ' s   personnel    and   a couple of police

officers came running round from the pitch direction with

someone on a stretcher.                  They came past us and put him down

and then ran off with another stretcher.                       Almost at the

same time another stretcher arrived carried by police and

someone said that they needed more stretchers.                     We took the

first patient off the stretcher and put him on a blanket and

did the same with the second.                    The second patient had bad

bruising around the abdomen and could have had internal

injuries but both were talking.

Suddenly we were overwhelmed by 10 or 12 patients arriving

at once.             They were either limping or being carried by

police.          At this point I realised that something serious

was wrong and that we needed to do something.                      Nurses were

laying people on blankets.                   >I went to the vehicle and used

I then got out of the vehicle and started assessing the 10

or 12 patients on the ground.

I tried     to make    sure that     all were breathing.             Some

casualties     were getting up and walking off.                  Some sat

against the wall in a shocked state.                                     any

I went to the front of the vehicle and the police were

bringing people round every few seconds carried on boards.

I am very muddled about the time and feel like there is an

hour missing out of my life.           It must have been about now

that the police brought a body covered with a coat.                 I went

to the body and it was a young lad who was obviously dead.

I did a quick check on him..   This was the, first dead body I
       oL-j-tfct  .byyCtj                                  AjU/C-
had seenA and so I realised that we certainly had a Major
          A
Incident on our hands.       I still had not seen any other
       ambulances.      I wanted to make sure Control knew we had a

       Major Incident.       I had a handset during this time but I

       could not get through on it.                          I went back to my vehicle and

       used the radio which was now on ERC.                          Just before I called

       I heard a message saying that the radio was only to                            used

       for priority messages.              I called Control/^wllh my number— of

       I am afraid that I am very confused about what happened

       next.      I remember discussing with a policeman about getting

       the dead body into the gymnasium although I did not know at

       this point that it was the casualty clearing point.                           Also

       there were a lot of police who came running out of the

       gymnasium and into the ground.                         Control had acknowledged my

       message and I said that there was a Major Incident and I

       needed an Officer.     I said that I was between the gymnasium

       and the first aid room.                   I thought that there must be an

       Officer somewhere in the ground.                          I also requested medical

       staff.      Control said that there should be an Officer where

       I was and I said that I had not seen anyone.                         I repeated my

       location.      Control then sent out Alpha signs which are for

       Station Officers.      I then left the radio and felt that at

       least Control knew where I was and that they were trying to

       obtain Officers.      I also said in this message that we were

       putting bodies into the gymnasium.

16/.   About this time I remember someone saying that he was a

       doctor and saying that there was a patient who needed moving

       quickly.      The doctor asked whether my vehicle could go and


                                   £^0(3
I said no as my vehicle was the Incident Vehicle because I

still had not seen any other vehicle.              I had handed out a

lot   of   equipment    by      this   stage,   such as blankets    and

airways.       I remember one body was brought out with the

police doing mouth to mouth resuscitation and someone giving
1cardiac   massage.
                           I
                   Sgmeohe got an automatic resuscitator off
                      y\
the ambulance and used that on the patient.    A doctor then

came round and said that the patient was dead.               The police

then took the body to the gymnasium.                It was about this

time that someone asked me to go to the gymnasium to see a

patient     who   needed       resuscitation.       I went    into the

gymnasium and saw that a fireman had a resuscitator on the

patient and there was a doctor who said that the patient

must be taken to hospital.             I had a bag and mask.       The

fireman's resuscitator ran out of oxygen so while he was

changing the cylinder I used the bag and mask.            I said that

we would move the patient as soon as we could and then I

left them.        I also remember seeing Officer Morley at some

stage in the yard outside the gymnasium directing ambulance

vehicles to be loaded.              I went to Morley and told him

about the casualties by the first aid area.                   I cannot

remember his reply.            I then went back to the ambulance and

to the casualties behind it to check on their condition.

I remember Mr Hopkins was also there by this stage.                 He

went into the gymnasium.           I went in as well but I do not

think I spoke to him.             I spoke to Ambulanceman          who

came in.      By this time patients were being moved from the
first    aid    area   into    the    yard   and   being    loaded on to

ambulances.

I probably tried to resuscitate about five people.                If they

were dead      they were taken to the gymnasium.

I had no contact with Control or the Officers at this stage.

I was receiving casualties and decided whether they were

dead or not.

I di d   not    have   a driver       at this   time but     a policeman

volunteered to help.          I spoke to Alan Hopkins who said that

I could use the policeman as the driver.                   We then loaded

two patients onto the vehicle together with a doctor.                  We

then set off to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.                 From what

I can remember it was a good journey and the policeman was a

proficient driver.            We came out onto Penistone -Road and

back down Leppings Lane./'           We were stopped once by a police'll

vehicle blocking the road but once we were past Leppings

Lane it only took about 10 minutes to get to the hospital.

We unloaded at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.                  They were

well organised and this made me wonder how long I had been

down at the ground.       The doctor asked if I wanted him to go

back to the ground with me.             I said that it appeared that

the ground was now under control and so he would be more use

at the hospital.

I then called Control to say that we were clear.                   I told

them that we had a police driver.            They told me to keep him

and to make our way to Netherthorpe Road.                    When we got

there we found two or three ambulances already present.
        Control   then told us to go to Herrles Road Bus Depot.

        There were already a few ambulances at the Depot and matters

        were obviously organised.        I spoke to Station Officer Eason

        who said that he would get me a colleague.

        joined me and the policeman left us.           We waited for about

        30 minutes.       Eventually the first three vehicles, of which

        we were one, were told to go to the Penistone Road gymnasium

        entrance.        We set off and     I drove.     I parked    in   the

        gymnasium first aid area.           I then s a w ______________ I, my

        original colleague, who said that he had been with Hopkins

        most of the time.

        David Jones then called everyone together and split the

        crews into groups depending on who was supposed to be on

        duty and what shift.      It was now 1758.       This was my first

         recollection of what the time was.
 'S /
^2fl.   We were then told to return to base.           I stayed until 2200

        hours and carried out three transfers from Royal Hallamshire

        Hospital to Northern General Hospital for scans.

        I have heard of the Major Accident Plan but have never heard

        of the Hillsborough Plan.

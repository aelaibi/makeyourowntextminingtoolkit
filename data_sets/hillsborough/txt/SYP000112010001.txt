fans    were       then        directed                by o t h e r             officers              to    turn       r i ght     down Herries

The    idea,       of     cou rse,             was          to       direct          the N o t t i n g h a m           fans      away      from       the

The    Liverpool               fans,         with       police        escort,          came          from          the     Station            and

turned         rig h t        i nt o    Leppings           Lane .          They were             boisterous,                  as     one w o u l d

expect,         but       there         was       no    c a use      for     concern          so        far as             could     be       s e e n at

that      time.

I remained               in the         vicinity           of     the      bus    depot          and P en istone                   Road        as       the

very      heavy.              These         f ans      were     prevented           from          continuing                 along

supporters,

I recal l            that    about          2 . HO     pm a n        order        came       over       the P e r s o n a l        rad i o      for

Leppings             Lane    to       be    closed          to    vehi cj>i'ar t r a f f i c             because          of    the       build

up    of      pedestrians.                  I pa r t i c uj^afrl y           re-call          t hi s     because          I was

instructed             to    inform a SJ^ffield                         Transport             Department             official             (Mr.

Middleton)             of    this          arfci i n f o r m      him       that    service             buses       would       h ave      to

be    diverted.              I ydfelivered this                      message        within          two m i n u t e s          and

informed             conjfc'rol.           I returned             to    the       Traffic          I s l a n d at     the       Penistone

Road       end ef-f L e p p i n g s           Lane.            There        was    no     congestion            of L e p p i n g s         Lane

by    pedestrians                at    t ha t     end       but      I did        notice       there were             a    large          number
       ' f'

a n d jfiany of          these         seemed          the w o r s e         for    drink.

I would          like       to     emphasise               these       fans       were       not    fighting          drunk          or    in an

u g l y m o od,        they were              just what              I would        describe             as    being       stupidly

dru n k ,       in f a c t       many were             sti l l       actually           drinking.              I clearly             remember

thinking             I had       never        seen         so m a n y       in s u c h a        state         before.

The    police           officers             on L e p p i n g s        Lane       and Penistone                R o a d at       t hi s     time,

were          coping     adequately               and,         after        speaking          with       the    officers             on d u t y

at    the       bus    de p o t ,      I walked along                   Penistone             Road        towards         the      g round .

I had         occasion           to    speak          to    two      young        fans       outside" a n           off    licence           n ear

the    ground,           who       a p o l o g i s e d as         some       drunks          <£0 for       their      behaviour.                  I

then       entered          th e      ground          via      the     gate       lading           to    the S p o r t s        Hall.

It w a s        at    this       time        I heard           radio M e s s a g e s          about        gates      being          opened

at    Leppings           L a ne.           I am       s ure      jtfiis w a s      after        I had         heard       the      roar      of
                                                           X                                                                   X
the    crowd          signalling              that/the            teams       had       come       o nto      the    playing          area.

I distinctly                remember there was                         an    urgency          or    even       p a ni c    in the          voice

or    voices          passing^the               messages.

I definitely                h/ard          ’G a t e     C'       and    either          'a G a t e ' or        'Gate A'.           My     first

thought          was     they were              to      open       the      gate        or   g a t e s to a l l o w p e o p l e           out

b e c a u s e 'of the            crushing,              but       I quickly             r e a l i s e d t h i s w a s not          the     case,

Before          I actually             reached             the    playing          a r ea,      I heard a message
                                                                                                                                   PAGE

instructing               all      available           officers        onto       this    area.           Knowing         there

would         be m a n y         officers, in the S p o r t s               Hall    at    t his     time,        I ran there,

shouted an               instruction             for    officers         to      comply with           the      radio m e ss a g e

and      then       ran       to    the    playing         area.

I saw         the       trams       just    disappearing             back        into    the     players         tunnel            and       on

looking        1/owards the W e s t ( L e p p i n g s L a ne) S t a n d I saw s o m e f a n s                                      on the
             //
p l a y i n g a r ea.  I a l s o s a w s ome c l i m b i n g or a t t e m p t i n g to c l i m b                                   the

perimeter               fence       onto    the       playing area            and    s ome     scrambling             from         the
     /   .
j/rrace            up    into       the    Stand.          I t ook     this       in as       I was       running         across

the      pitch.

On    reaching             this      fence       I assisted a youth                  over,       t his      y o u t h was          in a

very         distressed             state.        It w a s      then     I noticed            the    faces       of      the       people

pressed against                     the    fenc e.         I quickly          helped       another          youth        from        the

t o p of       the       fence       and    then       ran    to   the      emergency          e xit      gate      in    this

fence         which        l e ads      from     the    terrace        to     the    playing         a r ea.        I was wi t h i n

a few         f eet      of      this     in a n y     case.       For      some     reason         I thought            the P o l i c e

officers            at     this      gate       were    not     removing          people       from       the    terrace             fa st

enough.             I actually             remember          pushing        one     officer         aside       and      shouting
l)                                                                                                                             •
 words        to    the       effect       ’get       them    out.’         The     officer         replied         they were

trying         but       were       unable       to do       so.     There        was    a tremendous               crush          of

people         at       t ha t     gate.        One    reason        for      this      w a s the d r o p      of   about           two

feet         from       the      perimeter        track       to     the      floor      of the T e r r a c e .           People

were actually                    bent     over    t hi s     ina     pile.

I took         hold        of a y o u n g        man    by    the a r m s        attempting          to     pull      h i m out          and

then         realised what                the    officer        had m e a n t .         I found        it    impossible                 to

move         him,       I then       realised          he w a s    dead.

I then         t ook       hold      of    the a r m s       of a n o t h e r     young man and              tried        to       pull

him      out       but     I felt         him    slip away and              could       not    maintain          my      hold       on

him.          The       crush       seemed       to    increase.            We    managed        to a s s i s t       a f ew         out

over         the    others         and     I then       sa w a m a n        in a b s o l u t e      panic,       he wa s

literally           throwing          himself           on the        backs          of    other        people      and    I shouted

at    him     to    stop.           It w a s     at     this     t ime         I saw       two    p o l i c e w o m e n at      the

rear    of       this     crush.           These        officers           were       attempting            to    pull     people

back.         There       was       room     for      t his    by     this          time    but    the      panic        was    such

that    the        two    officers           were       finding         the         task    very        difficult.

It w a s      about       this       t ime      the     fencing         was         forced and           people      were       removed

from    the T e r r a c e .           Many were             dead      or       seriously          inj u r e d .

I remember              using       my Personal             Radio       to a s k          Control        to a l e r t     the

hospitals           as    we    had a major                 incident           on    our    hands,        although          I did         not

realise          the     enormity          of    the        situation           at    that       time.       This        r a dio

message          was     not    acknowledged.                  During           this       period        I spoke         to a m a n

who    identified              himself          as a d o c t o r        and         whom    I saw        certify         the    death

of    s ome      and     assist       with       others.

Police,          First        Aiders       and     others        were          attempting           to     resuscitate              many .

become        the       temporary          mortuary.             Many^fans                assisted         in the        removal          of

the    dead        and    injured          from       the     f L^ l d .        Even       at    this     stage      a    few       f ans

vented        their       anger        on me.           It/was        about          this       t ime    t hat    Chief

Superintendent                 Nesbit,          whc/I        re-call           seeing       at    the W e s t       Stand

considered              this    a    sensible           move     as     the         Nottingham           fans     had     initially

jeered and              cheered,        not      realising            what          had    taken        p l ace   and     from       there

Stand       it     no    d o u ^ appeared a                  pitch      invasion was                taking        place        by    the

Liverpool           fans.           It w a s     at     this     time          I went       to    the      players        tunnel          to

enquire          whether        or    not       the m a t c h       would           re-start        and ac t ua l ly           spoke        on

this    subject           to Mr.        Lock       an       ex-police           officer,          and      currently a

Sheffield           Wednesday           employee.

I then went              to    the     line      of P o l i c e       officers             and    spoke       to Mr.       NESBIT.

   Everything          appeared         in order,           in f act             everyone        seemed         stunned.              I

   seventy       eight       bodies     at     that       time.

   I was       informed        shortly after              t ha t       some       police       officers          at     Niagara

REPORT
Chief Inspector D T SUMNER   ’F2*
FA Cup Serai-Final   -    Saturday 15th April 1989


On the above date X commenced duty at 8.0am at ’F2*.
Following the morning briefing I cleared ray desk then
accompanied Superintendent Chapman to the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club ground, for the briefing at
10.0am.
I was to work with Superintendent Chapman on Sector
Three (Nottingham Forest), being in charge of Sector
3A, Serials 52 to 56 inclusive.
Following the briefing I had a discussion with Superintendent
Chapman, then spoke to several officers in the Serials and,
shortly before 11.0am, went to my area of responsibility.
This area included Herries Road South, Herries Road and
that stretch of Penistone Road joining those two roads.
There is a Traffic Island situated in Penistone Road
at its junction with Herries Road.     The other road leading
to this Island opposite Herries Road is Leppings Lane, which
is the road where the West Stand of the ground is situated
and also where entrance to the North Stand is gained.       Both
these stands being for the Liverpool supporters.
Looking along Leppings Lane from Penistone Road/Herries
Road, it is not possible to see the North and West stands
or the entrances to same because of the turns in Leppings
Lane.
I was on the side of the ground where the Nottingham
supporters were expected to arrive.      In fact the majority
of coaches, over eighty, carrying these fans parked in the
Sheffield Transport Department Bus Depot, which is situated
in Herries Road near to Penistone Road.     One task for the
Serials employed in this area was to direct the Nottingham
fans along Herries Road, away from Penistone Road.       These
fans were then directed by other officers to turn right
down Herries Road South, towards that part of the ground
that had been allocated to them.      That is the Kop and
the South Stand.

                                                continued

The idea, ©f course, was to direct the Nottingham fans
away from the Liverpool fans, many of whom would approach
the ground from the Wadsley Bridge side, that is down
Penistone lead and right along Leppings Lane.     The Liverpool
fans using the special train stopping at W&dsley Bridge
Station, would also use that route.     This was the same plan
as the previous year.
The Nottingham coaches started to arrive around noon.        The
system was working well with the odd hic-up, in that a few
coaches had unloaded prior to arriving at the bus depot but
steps were taken to put a stop to this.
It is true to say the majority of fans were in a bwsyant
mood and complied with police requests as to their approach
to the ground.
In addition to the Serials at this point, there were two
police horses, these played a most useful part by pointing
the fans in the right direction.      One of their tasks was to
ensure the Liverpool fans did not encroach onto this area
but this never occurred.
Many private vehicles carrying Nottingham fans were also
parked in this area.
As the build up continued it was obvious many supporters
had been drinking as dozens were obliged to relieve
themselves in a small woodland area opposite the bus
depot.   I gave instructions that this was to be permitted
as there was no public toilet in that area.      I wish to
emphasise that even at this stage the mood was still generally
buoyant and a word from a police officer to the occasional
transgressor had the desired effect.
I had walked around my area and spoken to many officers,
there were no serious problems and the atmosphere wss as
one would expect on such an occasion

    I saw there were no problems at the turnstiles on Penistone
    Road, which give access to the Kop and everything seemed to
    be proceeding to plan.
    I remember about 2.0pm hearing on ay Personal Radi© that the
    Special Train from [Liverpool had arrived at Wadsley Bridge
    Station.       I believe this had arrived early.
    As the fans from the Special Train would be escorted along
    Penistone Road, past the junction with Herries Road, I made
    my way to that junction to await their arrival.        So far as
    I re-call it was around this time, or shortly after, there
    were radio messages directing Transit mobiles to areas where
    fans were causing problems.        These included Kilner Way,
    just above Wadsley Station, the Horse and Jockey on Wadsley
    Lane and the Royal on Penistone fioad.
    The Liverpool fans, with police escort, came from the Station
    and turned right into Leppings Lane.        They were boisterous, as
    one would expect, but there was no cause for concern so far
    as could be seen at that time.
    I remained in the vicinity of the bus depot and Penistone
    Road   sub   the pedestrian build up down Penistone Road and
    along Leppings Lane was very heavy.        These fans were prevented
    from continuing along Penistone Road or turning into Herries
    Road, as they were Liverpool supporters.
    I recall that about 2.20pm, an order came over the Personal
    Radio for Leppings Lane to be closed to vehicular traffic
    because of the build up of pedestrian®.        I particularly
    re-call this because I was instructed to inform a Sheffield
    Transport Department official (Mr Middleton) of this and
    inform him that services buses would have to be diverted.          I
    delivered this message within two minutes and informed Control.
    I returned to the Traffic Island at ftie Penistone Road end of
    Leppings Lane.       There was no congestion of Leppings Lane by
    pedestrians at that end but I did notice there were a large
    number and many of these seemed the worse for drink.



                                                             continued,

    I would like to emphasise these fans were not fighting drunk
    or in an ugly mood, they were just what I would describe as
    being stupidly drunk, in fact many were still actually drinking.
    I clearly remember thinking I had never seen so many in such
    a state before.
    The police officers on Leppings Lane and Penistone fioad at
    this time, were coping adequately and, after speaking with
    the officers on duty at the bus depot, I walked along
    Penistone fioad towards the ground.
    I had occasion to speak to two young fans outside an off
    licence rear the ground, who apologised as some drunks do
    for their behaviour.     I then entered the ground via the
    gate leading to the Sports Hall.
    It was at this tine I heard radio messages about gates
    being opened at Leppings Lane.      I am sure this was after
    I had heard the roar of the crowd signalling that the
    teams had come onto the playing area.      I distinctly
    remember there was an urgency or even panic in the voice
    or voices passing the messages.
    I definitely heard 'Gate C* and either *a Gate* or 'Gate
    A*.     My first thought was they were to open the gate or
    gates to allow people out because of the crushing, but I
    quickly realised this was not the case.
    Before I actually reached the playing area, I heard a
    message instructing all available officers onto this area.
    Knowing there would be many officers in the Sports Sail at
    this time, I ran there, shouted an instruction for officers
    to comply with the radio message and then ran to the playing
    area.
    I saw the teams just disappearing back into the players
    tunnel and on looking towards the @est (Leppings Lane)
    Stand, I saw some fans on the playing area.      I also saw
    some climbing or attempting to climb the perimeter fence
    onto the playing area and some scrambling from the Terrace
    up into the Stand.     I took this in as I was run ing across
    the pitch.



                                                              continued.

On reaching this fence I assisted a youth over, this youth
was in a very distressed state.     It was then I noticed the
faces of the people pressed against the fence.     I quickly
helped another youth from the top of the fence and then ran
to the emergency exit gate in this fence which leads from
the terrace to the playing area.     I was within a few feet
of this in any case.     For some reason I thought the police
officers at this gate were not removing people from the
Terrace fast enough.      I actually remember pushing one
officer aside and shouting words to the effect ’get them
out*.      The officer replied they were trying but were unable
to do so.      There was a tremendous crush of people at that
gate.      One reason for this was the drop of about two feet
from the perimeter track to the floor of the Terrace.         People
were actually bent over this in a pile.
I took hold of a young man by the arms attempting to pull
him out and then realised what the officer had meant.       I
found it impossible to move him, I then realised he was
dead.
I then took hold of the arms of another young man and tried
to pull him out but I felt him slip away and could not
maintain my hold on him.      The crush seemed to increase.
We managed to assist a few out over the others and I then
saw a man in absolute panic, he wa* literally throwing
himself on the backs of other people and I shouted at him
to stop.      It was about this time I saw two policewomen at
the rear of this crush.     These officers were attempting to
pull people back.      There was room for this by this time but
the panic was such the two officers were finding the task
very difficult.
It was about this time the fencing was forced and people
were removed from the Terrace.      Many were dead or seriously
injured.

I remember using my Personal Radio to ask Control to alert
the hospitals as we had a major incident on our hands,
although I did not realise the enormity of the situation
at that time.    This radio message was not aknowledged.
During this period I spoke to a man who identified
himself as a doctor and whom I saw certify the death of
some and assist with others.
Police, First Aiders and others were attempting to
resuscitate many*    The advertising boards were pulled
down and the dead and injured were removed on these
although some of the injured were removed by ambulance.
Those removed were taken to the Sports Hall, which was
to become the temporary mortuary.      Many fans assisted
in the removal of the dead and injured from the field.
Even at this stage a few fans vented their anger on me.
It was about this time that Chief Superintendent NESBIT,
who I re-call seeing at the West Stand perimeter fence,
organised a line of officers across the pitch.       I
considered this a sensible move as the Nottingham fans
had initially jeered and cheered, not realising what had
taken place and from their Stand it no doubt appeared a
pitch invasion was taking place by the Liverpool fans.
It was at this time I went to the players tunnel to enquire
whether or not the match would re-start and actually
spoke on this subject to Mr LOCK, an ex-police officer
and currently a Sheffield Wednesday employee.
I then went to the line of police officers and spoke
to Mr NESBIT.    It was then announced that the game would
be abandoned and spectators started to leave the ground*
To ensure there were a sufficient number of police officers
outside the ground, for public order purposes, officers
were sent from the line across the pitch*
I entered the Sports Hall*       By this time the injured had
been removed and I saw many bodies on the floor of the
Hall.   A line of police officers were preventing members
of the public entering the area of the Sports Hall*

I went into Penistone Eoad. to check on the public order
situation.   Everything appeared in order, in fact
everyone seemed stunned.      I only remained outside a few
minutes and then returned to the Sports Ball.      Things
were being organised and I did a body count.      There were
seventy eight bodies at that tine.
I was informed shortly after that some police officers at
Niagara Club were already suffering from stress.      I had
PC 583 Davies drive me there.      We only remained a few
minutes as there were no obvious problems and we returned
to the Sports Hall.
I remained in the Sports Hall, working with Detective
Chief Superintendent Addis.       I can fully describe the
procedure in this temporary mortuary should this be
required.    In addition to other duties in the mortuary
I found one of my main jobs was the counselling of police
officers, the explanation to relatives the procedure for
identification and liaising between Social Workers/Clergy,
relatives and police officers.
I was present when the last body was removed from this
temporary mortuary shortly after 5 .30am the following
morning, that is the 16th April 1989.

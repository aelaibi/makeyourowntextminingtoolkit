  loud       roar           from       the       crowd          as    a    Liverpool              player          had       nearby          scored.               I

  then      recall               looking             towards          the       Leppings           Lane          end    of       the       ground           and

  was     at     the         north          end       of       the    Leppings              Lane       end       and    it       appeared             to     be       a

  pitch         invasion.                   This          was    followed              by    the       players          leaving             the       field.

              It    was       then       that       people          including           Police          Officers          began       to    administer

              first          aid    to       supporters             who    were        lying      on     the    pitch          and    I    realised

              that       a    serious          incident             was    taking          place.         My    immediate             reaction         was

              to    go       and   assist           but       we    were     instructed             to    remain          at    our       location       to

              maintain             order       on     the      Kop.        This       was     required          as    tempered             had    become

              bit    fraid          between           the      two     sets      of     fans.           This    did       however          subside       as

              the    tragic,         circumstances                   became          known.

              was    cleared             of    supporters              and      I went        into       Penistone             Rd    to    maintain

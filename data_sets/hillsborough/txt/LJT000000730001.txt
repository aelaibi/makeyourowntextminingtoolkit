I should like to thank you most sincerely for your hospitality
at lunch yesterday. It was indeed most kind of you to invite
both Len Maunder and myself to join you, and most interesting
the hear your views - and I was pleased to learn that you
believe the new Advisory Design Council is progressing along
the right lines.
It was also a great pleasure to meet Sir Ian, and, with us
both having Merseyside connections, we had a lot in common.
I was sorry I had to dash away so quickly at the end,                  but
there was another meeting I had to get to.

With all good wishes for Christmas and the New Year.

Thank you for your letter of 16 March enclosing this one from

_______________ , Secretary of the Thorne & District Chamber of

Commerce about the cost of the Hillsborough Inquiry.



The cost of the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

carried out by Lord Justice Taylor was met in full from

central funds.



Therefore it would appear that Mrs Wakefield is referring to

the cost of the investigation carried out by west Midlands

police.



As you may be aware, the investigations undertaken by the West

Midlands force were originally started on the initiative of

the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire as they concerned the

policing of his area.   However in making the results of the

investigation directly available to Lord Justice Taylor, it

was recognised that although concerned with the policing of

events on the day and therefore the concern of the South

Yorkshire force, the investigation had been widened to cover

national aspects beyond the individual interest of the South

Yorkshire police.



It was also recognised that in view of the exceptional nature

and scale of the investigation, the likely costs could not be

absorbed locally without serious detriment to the efficiency

of the South Yorkshire force.
    The Government therefore made an additional special payment to

    the South Yorkshire Police Authority from central funds.                          This

    was to assist them with the additional costs faced in respect

    of the work carried out on their behalf by the West Midlands
                    ^tiferiiivawir mg),~
    police.  [The payment-represented *yo % of the additional

    The Government pays a sizeable proportion of the costs of

    policing in vgouth Yorkshire.    This is done through police

    specific/grant at 51% plus block grant.

 Eeax Sir,

             She ae&bers of the Ihome * Matzlet Chaaber of Cogwro* is*
 T O y concerned at the coat of th* Hillsborough Disaster Enquiry, vfaich
 understand will have to be paid for out of loeal rates sod polio# funding.

            We vould have thought that this vould be paid for out of
 Central Gorexsaent funds, especially as at this tlae police ftmds axe very
 ouch needed for noxe man-povsr.

            It is also the opinion of the seabers -that policing of Tootball
 pounds and sports etc. should be the reapcnsiblity of the dubs concerned
 leading the police to do the job they axe «ployed to do.

             Will there be any change in this policy?

             Looking forvaxd to youx constants,



                                Tours faithfully,




                                Seoretaxy.

 1                                              Tuesday, 7th October, 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Who is going to deal with this
 3         principally?      I have read the letter that you have sent
 4         me, both of you, and I have read the document that you
 5         have sent, including P.C. Wadsworth's statement and where
 6         are we going to go from there?
 7   MRS. ROBERTS:    This Wadsworth's statement is definitely new to
 8         us, we've never seen it before.       So where has it been held
 9         and why?
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is something that I will
11         obviously have to look into, but one of the things that
12         appears to me at any rate, and it may be necessary to look
13         at the other evidence.      Have we got the evidence we were
14         given on last week, the supplementary?
15   MR.   BONE: Volume 4?
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.   Because this was an issue
17         which was taken up with me last week by Mr. Alun Jones,
18         who was counsel for the Family Support Group.         You are a
19         member of that, are you?
20   MRS. ROBERTS:    Yes.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I asked   him about this because it
22         seems to me that there may well      be a mistake sofar as Mr.
23         Wadsworth is concerned?
24   MRS. ROBERTS:    How do you mean a mistake?
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       There are two â€”   the officer who
26         deals with your son â€”     have we   got this here or not?
27   MR. BONE: I do not think we have,   Sir Murray, no.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: There is another officer, I think
29         it may be P.C. Best?
30   MRS. ROBERTS:    His description does not fit Graham.
31   MISS ROBERTS:    That's definitely not Graham.      We had down
32         summaries originally sent to us about three weeks before
33         the mini-inquest, which was the first we ever had, and it
34         was statements P.C. Yates and P.C. Best.       They
35         contradicted each other and neither was Graham.
36   MRS. ROBERTS:    The descriptions are not Graham.


                                         2
 1   MISS ROBERTS:     This one from Wadsworth he stated with a high
 2         degree of certainty that he felt the man he gave mouth to
 3         mouth to was body 79, which was Graham Roberts.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The person he talks about giving
 5         mouth to mouth resuscitation to is somebody who went to
 6         hospital?
 7   MISS ROBERTS:     How did Graham get to the mortuary?   We don't
 8         know anything.    We've got no information whatsoever.
 9   MRS. ROBERTS:     We know nothing.
10   MISS ROBERTS:     All we know are the statements that we were sent
11         originally, the summaries of the statements were sent not
12         Graham.     We wrote some questions, which we asked the
13         Coroner if we could have mentioned at mini-inquest.
14   MRS. ROBERTS:      They were not allowed to be asked.
15   MISS ROBERTS:     They weren't allowed to asked.   Doug Frazer, a
16         solicitor, took us into a room before we went through into
17         the courtroom and he suggested that if we went ahead with
18         asking the questions it could cause trouble for ourselves.
19
20   MR.   ROBERTS:    I was even being threatened with being put into
21         jail at the mini-inquest.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Who suggested you should go to
23         jail?
24   MISS ROBERTS:     Doug Frazer.
25   MR.   ROBERTS:    We were asking Doug Frazer to ask our questions.
26
27   LORD JUSTICE: STUART-SMITH:       He was your solicitor at the time?
28
29   MISS ROBERTS:     He was representing a number of the families.
30   MR.   ROBERTS:    I persisted in asking---
31   MISS ROBERTS:     He suggested we would be in contempt of court if
32         we went ahead with asking the questions and you'll find
33         that our questions were never asked.
34   MRS. ROBERTS:     He did say they would be allowed at the main
35         inquest but at the main inquest they were still not
36         allowed.


                                          3
 1    MR.    ROBERTS:   We feel that there was never an inquest on our
 2           son, Graham.
 3    MISS ROBERTS:     All we've got is contradictory evidence.
 4    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Just help me about one thing, have
 5           you now got a copy of the body file?
 6    MRS. ROBERTS:      Yes
 7    MISS ROBERTS:     Yes, we received it about two weeks ago.
 8    MR.    ROBERTS:   That didn't contained Wadsworth's statement.
 9    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It is difficult to reconcile
10           Wadsworth's statement with Police Constable Best.       This is
11           a matter which was dealt with by counsel last week and I
12           asked for further information about it.     That does not
13'          prevent you from dealing with it now.
14    MISS ROBERTS:     We've asked for more information, we'd written
15           to Constable--
16    MR.    ROBERTS:   Did you not get a copy of the two police letters
17           we sent to you where--
18    MISS ROBERTS:     We were told there was no further information--
19
20    MRS. ROBERTS:     No information on Graham, in 92 that was,-wasn't
21           it.   You have got them in there.
22    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes, I have got those.
23    MR.     ROBERTS: Have you got that?     He states---
24    MISS    ROBERTS: It's not through want of trying, we weretold
25           there no further information and then by chance we get the
26           statement from Wadsworth about two or three weeks ago.
27    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I shall look into Mr. Wadsworth's
28           statement, but one of the things that strikes me
29           immediately about it is that he is talking about somebody
30           who was taken to hospital.
31    MRS.    ROBERTS: He said he went in an ambulance but that
32           ambulance could have just taken him to the mortuary      or to
33           the--
34    MISS ROBERTS:     Or he could have been put into the ambulance and
35           then realised that it was too late and taken out again.
36    MRS. ROBERTS:     They couldn't be carrying all the bodies,


                                          4
 1        apparently it was a good walk from where the bodies were
 2        according to Dr. Ashton in his report.
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     If I can help a little bit in terras of the
 4        sequence of events which demonstrates why this case in
 5        particular is significant.        The first thing that springs
 6        to mind is that if you look at the summary that is
 7        presented by the West Midlands Police at the inquest it
 8        raises more questions than-it resolves, particularly in
 9        conflicting statements of P.C.s Yates and Best.
10                The family want those inconsistencies dealt with,
11        which is what you would expect at an inquest.        They are
12        told by their solicitor that because it is a summary and
13        the evidence is not being heard orally that in that
14        situation they cannot ask the questions they want asking.
15        So effectively those two statements stand and they become
16        "reliable statements".     Then two years later when the
17        family has been persistent in trying to gain access to
18        those statements in full they find that not only are the
19        statement conflicting but they are contradictory and
20        probably neither police officer dealt with Graham.
21                At every level, the timings, the clothing, the
22        description, the statements are inconsistent but because
23        it has already been through the inquest stage those
24        statements are now set in stone.        They sit in the body
25        file.
26                So in trying then to pursue the case further they
27        asked the Chief Constable if there was any further
28        evidence and he writes and says:        "No", that they have
29        done a search of all the evidence that is available and I
30        think his words were:     "as far as we can go at this time."
31
32                Then just weeks before today, after the Scrutiny has
33        been decided upon and as a whole range of evidence now
34        falls from the clouds we have this handwritten statement
35        by a P.C. Wadsworth, that has not been shown before, in
36        which he makes a very positive identification of Graham.


                                        5
 1          I think everybody would accept there seems to be here a
 2          problem because Graham is put into an ambulance.        But
 3          those people who were unconscious, semi-conscious and died
 4          at the rear of Leppings Lane were actually, some        of them
 5          transported to the temporary mortuary.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       How do you know that?
 7   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     How do I know that?       Because that has been
 8          stated over and again.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can you--
10   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I will have to check, I will have       to go
11   back        through the ambulance officers' statements and search
12               them out, but I know that that exists in some of the
13               ambulance officers' statements.        There is another
14               problem while I'm on that--
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: If you can do that it would help me
16          a lot?
17   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I will
18   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   Because Ido not particularly        want
19          to have   to chase through all the ambulance officers'
20          statements.
21   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     There is another problem with this, which
22          I think you understand, is that the majority of statements
23          relating to ambulance officers have not been released.
24          The reason for that initially was because of the 3.15 cutÂ­
25          off. So families have had real difficulty trying to get
26          hold of   those statements.       It is only what you glean from
27          reading   other statements on other people's files that it
28          sticks in your mind that ambulances were used to
29          transport.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUARTt SMITH:      Just so I get this clear.     You are
31          saying that there is evidence from ambulance officers that
32          they were taking people from the Leppings Lane end where
33          the ambulances were round to the gymnasium.
34   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I am saying that I'm sure that I have read
35          that, I might be mistaken but I'm sure that I've read
36          that, that ambulances were used to transport people--


                                          6
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have not sen anything of that
 2        sort but that does not mean to say it does not exist?
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:   I'm trying to remember where I've read it
 4   as   well and I've read, as you can appreciate over the years,
 5        so much.   I don't want to get caught on this issue.          I
 6        will check that but I don't want to get caught on it.
 7             What I want to say is that the loading of that
.8        particular body into an ambulance should not be used as a
 9        single criterium for discounting the rest of that
10        evidence, particularly when the other two police of
11        statements that sit in the body file have been shown to be
12        not only conflicting but contradictory and almost
13        definitely, as much as anybody can be certain, not
14        actually identifying Graham.
15             I think you can see from that the reason why the not
16        only the Wadsworth statement, but it's a question of the
17        quality of the evidence as it already exists and the fact
18        that it was never tested.      In a normal circumstance, as
19        you know only too well, the family would have had the
20        opportunity to have cross-examine both P.C.s Best and
21        Yates and they weren't     allowed to do that.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have not at the moment,
23        unfortunately, got P.C. Best's statement here.         I have
24        seen them and I have read them.      But my recollection is
25        that he said that he was with the body when it was
26        identified.      Is that   right?
27   MISS ROBERTS:   No, not from what we got originally.        Best
28        wasn't with Graham when he was identified.
29   PROFESSOR SCRATON:   Can I just quote to you:     "Further to my
30        statement dated 8th May 19 89 on 4th August 1989 I was
31        shown an album of deceased photographs..."
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Who is this?
33   MISS ROBERTS:   This is Best.
34   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    "... and an album of clothing belonging to
35        the deceased by PCs Brown and Carrie of the West Midlands
36        police.    Having viewed the photographs I'm quite happy


                                        7
 1         that the man I previously referred to as NA79, Graham John
 2         Roberts, is the man who I assisted to carry out of the
 3         rear.   I remember that PC Sherwood was also present while
 4         I was involved with this person."     So he makes his
 5         identification from photographs in August 1989.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Which was the police officer who
 7         was with body when it was identified?
 8   MISS ROBERTS:     Was that Sherwood?
 9   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     It neither of the officers who--
10   MISS ROBERTS:     It's not Yates or Best.
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     It's neither Yates nor Best who are the 2
12         people who claim to have dealt with him and why that's
13         important is one of them states that when he came upon the
14         body the person was alive, the other says the person was
15         dead.   The contradictions run all the way through their
16         statements from then on.    How those 2 statements ever got
17         past the scrutiny of investigating officers as referring
18         to the same person I don't know.
19   MRS. ROBERTS:     One had a sleeveless T-shirt on and the other
20         had no shirt.    So how could it be the same person?
21   MR.   ROBERTS:    How PC Best could say he carried Graham to a
22         position, from A to B when he was still breathing--
23   MISS ROBERTS:     Left him and when he came back minutes later he
24         was dead.    If he carried whoever this person was, and
25         thankfully, in my view, it was not my brother, but whoever
26         it was he carried from A to B he had made the decision to
27         look after that person and why he didn't administer first
28         aid I '11 never know.    There was no talk of first aid, no
29         talk of leaving him in someone else's care, left him and
30         when he came back moments later he was dead.
31   MRS. ROBERTS:     He did say later that there was an ambulance man
32         around the area.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can you try not to talk at the same
34         time because it is going to be difficult for the shorthand
35         writers.
36   MISS ROBERTS:     Sorry.   Can I make another comment, please.    In


                                        8
 1         some of the statements I have read there was suggestions
2          that there were few St. John's ambulance and a large and
 3         growing number of casualties.       Were first aid provisions
4          on the day too sparse?     Or were the trained first aiders
5          prevented from attending to casualties as has been
 6         suggested by one of our local St. John's ambulance men who
 7         attend our netball matches?       I actually wrote to Sheffield
 8         St. John's Ambulance headquarters but was sent a
 9         non-committal reply, they wouldn't give us any
10         information.     So did any St. John's ambulance workers make
11         statements and if so what has happened to those
12         statements?
13   MR.   ROBERTS:   That's how the letter arrived at my daughter's
14         house, it's obvious the Sheffield ambulance people were
15         going to send a different letter to what eventually came,
16         arrived.   The letter has been put in there and they have
17         had to open it and the answer came back from London and
18         that was that letter.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      This was in here, in this envelope?
20
21   MR.   ROBERTS:   That's right.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The document headed "Press release"
23         was--
24   MRS. ROBERTS:    It was returned to u s .
25   MR.   ROBERTS:   This was the answer to my daughter's letter.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Let me look at the answer.     The
27         letter is rather long I shall have to read it later.
28   MISS ROBERTS:    You can have the letter I have written because I
29         have got a copy of it at home anyway, obviously the press
30         release, it's a shame, we didn't photocopy it. (The Judge
31         reads)
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.
33   MISS ROBERTS:    I know you seem quite keen to keep this 3.15
34         cut-off time but events that happened after 3.15 are of
35         concern to us.     As I say we know nothing of Graham's
36         circumstances whatsoever.        But we do know that there was


                                        9
 1         obviously great confusion.        One of Graham's friends
 2         identified Graham before leaving Sheffield, arriving home
 3         probably    around 6 o'clock in the morning, identified him
 4         at 2 o'clock and before he left Sheffield he said to a
 5         police officer please, please make sure you send one of
 6         our local police officers round to the Roberts' household
 7         because we couldn't bear to give them this devastating
 8         news. Gave telephone numbers, addresses, all the details
 9         of the three of us and yet it was only when they arrived
10         home from Sheffield, my brother's friends arrived home
11         that we found out the dreadful news.
12   MR.   ROBERTS:     We were never informed by the police.
13   MISS ROBERTS:Officially.     It was my       dad who went up to our
14         local police station to inform our local police that we
15         knew already because our local police station is within
16         walking distance.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that is a point that you
18         make in your letter.
19   MR.   ROBERTS:    Don't you think that that is disgusting?
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You say that I am keen to keep the
21         3.15 cut-off point, I am not either keen or unkeen.            The
22         point, I think, that you must appreciate is that â€”          were
23         you there yesterday or not?
24   MISS ROBERTS:     Yes.   My mum wasn't, we were only allowed 2.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I made the point yesterday that I
26         am not an appeal court from the Divisional Courts'
27         decision about this.     The Divisional Court made a ruling
28         about the 3.15 cut-off point upholding the Coroner's
29         decision.     I cannot just go back to the Divisional Court
30         and say, "Think that over again", without there being
31         fresh evidence which requires to be considered and which
32         might affect that decision.        Do you see?   That is the
33         point.     So it is not a question of my being keen or
34         unkeen, I am anxious to hear from you and you say that
35         there has been a complete mix up really so far as your son
36         is concerned.


                                        10
 1   MISS ROBERTS:   We know nothing.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   You do not know what happened to
 3        him and that the summary was not accurate and you do not
 4        think the documents that you have now got on the body file
 5        are accurate.
 6   MISS ROBERTS:   They bear no resemblance to him.
 7   MRS. ROBERTS:   He was certified dead at 4.25, so what's
 8        happened between 3.15 and 4.25?    This is what we would
 9        like to know.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I will do my best to find out.     I
11        must tell you really two things.    First of all, simply
12        because somebody is certified dead at 4.25 does not mean
13        that that is the time they died.
14   MRS. ROBERTS:  Surely the person who certified him dead could
15        say this person has been dead for at least an hour?
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I do not think they can.
17   MRS. ROBERTS:   I think they have got a good idea by the way the
18        deterioration is starting, rigor mortis or whatever, I
19        don't know.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I do not think anybody attempted to
21        do that.
22   MRS. ROBERTS:   I think they have got a good idea of a certain
23        time, from what I've heard of things anyway.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   That may be so but I think not.
25        The other problem is that if one is looking into this
26        situation now, we are now nearly 9 years after the event,
27        eight and a half years after the event, anybody who is
28        trying to find out what happened is only going to be able
29        to say, "Well, I made a statement at the time, I can't
30        remember any more than that."
31   MRS. ROBERTS:   No.
32   MISS ROBERTS:   I don't necessarily agree with that because if
33        someone was badly affected by this tragedy, as we were,
34        then events do remain fresh in your mind.     I phoned one of
35        my brother's friends last night to ask him a question and
36        he could relate the whole story to me, word for word how


                                        11
 1        he had done eight and a half years ago.        So I think with
 2        something as strong as this--
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Was he one of the fans who went to
 4        the match?
 5   MISS ROBERTS:     He didn't actually travel with my brother but he
 6        went to the match, in fact I have got a letter that I want
 7        to pass on to you at the end about a statement that he
 8        would now like to make.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think the impression made upon
10        some of the fans was obviously very vivid and will stay
11        with them for their lives.        I am talking really more about
12        the difficulties of people like ambulance drivers, police
13        officers being able to identify at the time, let alone
14        now, who they dealt with.     I     mean the fact of the matter
15        is there was a great deal ofconfusion, maybe        there ought
16        not to have been as much confusion as there was, but this
17        was a major disaster and I think it is easy to understand
18        the problems of identification and tracing people and so
19        on.
20               So although I will obviously try and do my best to
21        sort this problem out for you I am not actually very
22        hopeful about it.     I hope you understand that, it is not
23        for lack of wanting to help        you, I dowant to help you,
24        that is what I am here for.
25               Let me tell you this, that even though it may not
26        affect the advice that I am able to give the Home
27        Secretary a number of families have said to me, "We're
28        unhappy about how we traced the last moment of our son's
29        life" or, "daughter's life" and so far as I can I want to
30        try and help about that because I. understand the anxiety
31        that you have but I do have to say that coming to it now,
32        over 8 years afterwards, I am not optimistic that I shall
33        be able to get anywhere with it.        That may be bad news for
34        you.
35   MISS ROBERTS:     What about having the verdict quashed?
36        Accidental death - that's a joke.


                                       12
 1   MRS. ROBERTS:      Does an accident happen to 9 6 people on the same
2          day just going to a football match?
3    MISS ROBERTS:      Caused by police negligence and it's an
4          accident?
5    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We went into this to some extent
 6         yesterday.     I think at Professor Scraton's invitation I
 7         tried to explain to you that as the law stands at the
 8         moment a verdict of accidental death does not mean to say
 9         that somebody has not been negligent.      It may be that
10         there should be another verdict available to a coroner's
11         jury.    There is not.    There is nothing relevant to this
12         inquiry between unlawful killing and accidental death.
13         Some people think that that is very unsatisfactory.         Other
14         people take the view that the question of civil liability
15         is a matter for the civil courts and not for a coroner's
16         jury.    So it is a difficult issue.
17                 I do not know whether you have received any
18         compensation at all in respect of your sons?
19   MR.   ROBERTS:      We're not entitled to compensation because
20         Graham was over 18.
21   MRS. ROBERTS:      He was 24.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You are entitled to damages for
23         bereavement, are you not?
24   MR.   ROBERTS: N o .
25   MRS. ROBERTS:      It's only for youngsters under 18.
26   MISS ROBERTS:      This isn't about compensation anyway.
27   MR.   ROBERTS:     Can I just add, I'm sorry I haven't brought the
28         letters, but if you want them I'll bring them, we were
29         paid Â£3,500 compensation, now I'm contradicting myself,
30         but that is the law, you're not entitled to compensation
31         over 18.     We were paid Â£3,500 less doctors' fees.    Can you
32         help us out there, what's the Â£3,500 compensation?
33   PROF ESSOR SCRATON:     Was that not the settlement for the
34         insurance?
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That was in respect of damages for
36         bereavement.


                                         13
 1   MR.   ROBERTS:   It's a special compensation.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is what it is called, the head
 3         of damages is bereavement.
 4   MR.   ROBERTS:   I naughtily, if you like, told another bereaved
 5         family that I'd received it.      I wanted to stir it.    He got
 6         in touch with his solicitor and his solicitor wouldn't
 7         believe it.    I photostatted the letter and the cheque and
 8         gave it to this friend.     His solicitor in turn got in â– 
 9         touch with the insurers, the insurers wrote back to this
10         friend of ours and they said to him, and I've got copies
11         of this letter, that they paid us out wrongly, by mistake.
12         We donated that money to Graham's school.
13   MISS ROBERTS:    This is not about compensation.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not particularly want to get
15         bogged down in the question of compensation.      The fact, as
16         I understand it, is' that a number of families have
17         received compensation in one form or another
18   MRS. ROBERTS:    If they were attending the match I think they
19         were entitled to but we weren't with Graham.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I don't understand why you would.
21         not be entitled to damages for bereavement and if you were
22         dependant on     your son-
23   M RS. ROBERTS: We    were told if w e 'd been dependant on himbut
24         obviously his dad was working at the time, he's not worked
25         since but he was working at the time.      He didn't go back
26         to work.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am afraid cannot really get
28         involved in the questions of whether or not you received
29         the appropriate amount of compensation.
30   MR.   ROBERTS: Wedon't want it, we       just want justice.
31   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Can I just go back a bit because while we
32         were talking earlier I went back through the body file and
33         the police officer who was actually with, who says he was
34         with Graham before he was moved to the temporary mortuary
35         and it suggests, it does not say how he was moved to the
36         temporary mortuary, was a P.C. Sinclair.      It is not either


                                        14
 1       â€”   I knew it wasn't Yates or Best, I couldn't remember
2        which of the police officers it was.    It was actually
3        Sinclair.
4              So the issue still stands that the two police
5        officers who were actually dealing with, who say they were
 6       dealing with Graham I think it is pretty clear that their
 7       evidence is not reliable.
 8            What concerned me about the point that you were
 9       making over judicial review and conduct of the inquest is
10       that, if I interpret what yo u 're saying correctly and the
11       points were raising yesterday as well, it seems to me to
12        suggest that if in a situation where a family, such as the
13       Roberts', are saying quite categorically that their
14        inquest was flawed, indeed what was said a few minutes ago
15       was that the family felt they hadn't had an inquest, that
16       that is not really within your remit to comment upon
17       because the judicial review has already stated that the
18        inquests were exemplary.   Am I interpreting you wrongly or
19        rightly?
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I am not sure that that is
21        necessarily quite necessarily what I am saying.       What I am
22        saying is that the 3.15 cut-off point is a matter which
23        the Divisional Court has ruled upon and in order to look
24        at that again there has got to be fresh evidence which
25        bears upon that point.
26             This point which is now being raised I think may be a
27        separate and discrete question as to whether or not there
28        has actually been a proper inquest in this particular
29        case. But I think that is really all I can say.
30   PROFESSOR SCRATON:   If I can just make one other; point, which
31        strays from the technicalities of the evidence and
32        certainly reflects some of my conversations with the
33        family over the last few years.    It is a perfect example,
34        it is a very clear example to me of the essential lack of
35        depth that existed within the inquest, which people in
36        normal circumstances would have had as a matter of course.


                                      15
 1
 2            There is no questions here that the very basis of the
 3       case is about could Graham have been saved.     He was
 4       clearly brought out of the back of the Leppings Lane
 5       Terrace, he was placed somewhere in that region of the
 6       concourse area and in that confusion could effective
 7       proper first aid, medical attention have saved his life.
 8       I think that is the nub of the question and related to
 9       that is, of course, the issue of the family being very
10       keen to establish the precise circumstances obviously in
11       which Graham died.
12            There are two reasons for that as I understand it
13       from talking to the family over the last couple of years.
14       They know, they are only too well aware, that Graham
15       cannot be brought back.    That is clear.   But it is
16       essential that the circumstances precisely are covered and
17       it is also very important in terms of establishing
18       liability, responsibility as to whether or not an
19       intervention could have been made that might have saved
20       his life.
21             It is an exemplary case because there are several,
22       as you know again, there are several other cases that are
23       very similar.    I think that the family has clearly been
24        sold short in terms of the investigation and the inquiry,
25       the way in which the inquest, sadly, was held, the lack of
26        opportunity to cross-examine essential evidence and
27       basically they have been thrown back on their own
28        resources.   Had they not pursued the case, had they not
29        chased after the statements those statements would never
30        have been seen, the body file would never have been
31        released.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Can I just ask you about one matter
33        on what you have just said.     When you talk about liability
34        are you talking about civil liability or criminal
35        liability?
36   PROFESSOR SCRATON:   It would depend on the events.


                                     16
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    You are talking about the fact that
 2        the there might have been an opportunity to--
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    We were talking there about negligence, we
 4        were talking there about the appropriate first aid not
 5        being administered in the circumstances.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    By whom?
 7   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    That again, that covers the whole basis of
 8        who is responsible in those circumstances.    I can see
 9        exactly where we're leading, we were leading into a
10        discussion yesterday that civil liability has already been
11        admitted.   I can see where that is taking us.   But they
12        don't know the answer to that question.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I do not know that the answer to
14        that question.
15   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    Nor do I.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I do not think anybody will
17        discover the answer to it that is the trouble.    The
18        question one has to address on this is what difference to
19        the inquest verdict can it make?
20   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    You know from my submissions to you that as
21        the law stands it can make very little difference.      If the
22        Coroner's direction is accepted that the direction is an
23        accurate direction, and in fact it has been accepted, that
24        accidental death can incorporate within it a degree of
25        negligence then we are thrown into the civil test and
26        therefore we are talking about civil liability and you
27        will say to me: that has already been established and.
28        accepted by the authorities.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    The only relevance, and there was
30        an exchange between the Coroner and Mr. King about this
31        when he was dealing with the cut-off point, as I see it as
32        a matter of law would be if there was an nova causa
33        interveniens.    I do not know whether you have legal
34        qualifications, do you, Professor?
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    I don't have any legal qualifications but I
36        am well versed in law.


                                       17
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is a technical expression, but
 2        it means that there has to be a break in what we call the
 3        chain of causation between the original injury and the
 4        death.
 5             To give you a very simple and perhaps rather silly
 6        example.     If somebody suffered a relatively minor injury
 7        and they were for the moment unconscious on the pitch and
 8        somebody took a bottle of brandy and poured it down their
 9        throat that might be such a crass piece of negligence that
10        somebody who was going to recover actually died because
11        they were doused with brandy.
12             Please do not think that I am giving that as a
13        concrete example, I am just trying to illustrate that it
14        would take a very serious piece of medical negligence or
15        something of that sort to break the chain of causation
16        between the negligence of the police and the ultimate
17        death.
18             The police have never sought to run any such case.
19        They have never sought to say if these people had been
20        properly looked after by the Ambulance Service they would
21        not have died.     I think it is very difficult for you and I
22        to understand the very complexâ€™ legal things that govern
23        these various proceedings.
24             Please do not think that I am trying to tie you up in
25        technical knots, I am not.        I have tried to explain as
26        simply as I can the different sorts of proceedings and the
27        different relevant considerations.       But those are the
28        matters which I have to have in mind when I am advising
29        the Home Secretary.      I think it is as well that I should
30        try and explain it to you here, I tried to explain ,it
31        yesterday.      I can only operate within the law as it
32        stands.
33                 Is there anything that you want to say to me which
34        you have not said?
35   MISS ROBERTS:      I would just like to pass this letter on to you?
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Which letter is this?


                                       18
 1   MISS ROBERTS:     It is a letter that I have just personally
 2        written this morning.    Following yesterday's comments
 3        about fans arriving late I phoned one of my brother's
 4        friends, as I said before, it was because he gave us an
 5        extra reason why fans arrived later than they would have
 6        liked to.    Although saying that, he arrived at 2.40 and he
 7        was surprised at the lack of police presence at the
 8        ground.
 9                He can only imagine that it was because there was so
10        many police on the ring roads leading off the motorway
11        into Sheffield, stopping all vehicles and removing all the
12        alcohol from the vehicles.        Just another bit of evidence
13        that just shows that all the police were concerned about
14        that day was alcohol and thinking that people from
15        Liverpool are just drunken louts.        I don't agree with that
16        comment.
17                I go to Cliff Richard concerts, I will have drink if
18        I'm not driving and you never hear of Cliff Richard fans
19        being called drunken louts.        So why Liverpool football
20        fans?
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I would like just to say something
22        about that unfortunate incident yesterday.        As I have
23        already said yesterday, I regret that I made what was a
24        casual remark, which was not intended to be serious and it
25        appears to have been misinterpreted and misunderstood as
26        suggested that I have already made up my mind that the
27        reason why the police lost control outside the ground was
28        because of the late arrival of drunken fans.
29                That is completely contrary to the fact.     The truth
30        of the matter is this; that insofar as I have made up my
31        mind about the cause of the failure of the police to
32        control the situation outside the ground I have accepted
33        what Lord     Taylor said about that and I have said not only
34        yesterday but I said to the representatives who came to
35        see me last week that in my opinion at the moment there is
36        no further evidence which calls that decision and that


                                       19
 1       finding into question.
 2              So so far from making up my mind against the
 3       Liverpool fans on that point I have actually made up my
 4       mind in their favour.    This is what is so ironical to me
 5       and so absurd about the criticism which is made of me in
 6       relation to that. The matters that I am looking into have
 7       got nothing to do with what happened outside the ground at
 8       all.    They are solely concerned with what happened inside
 9       the ground. The most important question I think is
10       probably the question of the video tapes.      That bears
11       directly on police responsibility.      There are more complex
12       questions about the cut-off time, about what happened to
13       people afterwards.
14              I would like you to understand that so far as that
15        remark was concerned yesterday, so far from indicating
16       that I think that the cause of the problem was people
17        turning up late and being drunk that is completely untrue.
18        I do not think that.    I accept Lord Taylor's conclusion
19        and unless and until any evidence is produced which throws
20        any doubt upon that conclusion, and I do not think there
21        will be, that conclusion stands so far as I am concerned.
22
23              I hope that you will accept that because it is very
24        easy in that sort tumult of excitement yesterday to get a
25        very, what I think is a rather unfair view of my approach
26        to these things.
27   MRS. ROBERTS:   You said it half nine anyway and people weren't
28        asked to turn up ten anyway and everybody was there, I
29        wasn't there initially but--
30   PROFESSOR SCRATON:   I think---
31   MRS. ROBERTS:   People were there anyway.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I had not seen them, I did not know
33        where they were.
34   MRS. ROBERTS:   That's not what I'm trying to say in that
35        letter. In that letter I'm trying to say there was such a
36        great police presence in the ring roads leading up to the


                                       20
 1        ground area and Robbie Ollerhead actually only saw two
 2        police officers outside the ground, just all this
 3        confusion, lack of signposts.     Maybe it is something that
 4        needs more consideration.    An awful lot of the police on
 5        duty on the day weren't even at the ground.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am very anxious not to re-open
 7        the question of what happened and why the police lost
 8        control outside the ground because if we do that I have no
 9        doubt--
10   MRS. ROBERTS:    Surely that's all important, isn't it?
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    What you are saying, if I can paraphrase it
12        accurately, and I think you said it yesterday, was that
13        you are not contesting the context in which the disaster
14        occurred and the build up to the disaster; you are
15        accepting Lord Justice Taylor's position that the police
16        did lose control; that the issue of drunken, ticketless,
17        late arriving fans were in fact hares that were run by the
18        police; that whilst there might have been incidents of
19        each of those things that they did not add up to the main
20        cause of disruption; the loss of control outside, I think
21        what you are saying is, that that is established and you
22        are not questioning it.                    "
23                I think the only reason that people are so nervous
24        about that issue is because, as you are very well aware,
25        at the inquest and at Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry but
26        particularly at the inquest the Coroner used his
27        discretion to select an inordinate amount of witnesses to
28        what went on outside the ground and more than ran the
29        hare.     I think that was a very unfortunate issue and yet
30        never really examined the real evidence in terms of those
31        myths of Hillsborough, as they are often referred to.
32                People arriving late was not such a myth, people did
33        arrive in the last half hour in some numbers, but it's
34        only now that many of the police statements and ambulance
35        officers' statements are coming into the public domain
36        that what the fans had said all along as the main cause,


                                       21
 1       and i t's contained in that letter there, of late arrival
 2       had nothing to do with the fans being in pubs or doing
 3       other things, it was because they were delayed in their
 4       journey. I have evidence there again.
 5               I think that was what you fell foul of yesterday but
 6       it seems to me that what you are saying now is that you
 7       accept Lord Justice Taylor's conclusions about the fact
 8       that the police lost control, mismanaged the crowd outside
 9       of the ground.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Not only am I saying that now, I
11        said that least week to counsel and people who turned up
12       then.     I said it yesterday very clearly in my opening
13        remarks and I do not want to re-open that issue because it
14       will simply give rise to the same contentious evidence as
15       was given at the Lord Taylor's Inquiry, at the inquest and
16        so on and no doubt there are hundreds of other people who
17        did not give evidence on those occasions who will come in
18        on one side or the other.
19               As far as I am concerned that is a closed issue.      I
20        have made up my mind on that issue and I have made it up
21        in favour of the Liverpool supporters and unless and until
22        there is cogent evidence for me to re-examine that
23        conclusion I do     not propose to do so.
24               As I said,   the evidence   that I amlooking   athas got
25        nothing to do with what happened outside the ground, it is
26        all to do with what happened inside the ground and,
27        therefore, although I can quite see now that it was an
28        unfortunate remark, and one which I regret, I actually
29        think that it has been, well, I do not know, but I suspect
30        it has been misunderstood and misinterpreted because, as I
31        say, so far from making up my mind against the Liverpool
32        families I have     actually on that issue made it up in their
33        favour and I do     not propose alter that.
34               I am very sorry that there has been a
35        misunderstanding about it but in so far as I can that is
36        the position.


                                       22
 1              I think we ought to stop there.
2    MR.   ROBERTS:   Can I just say one partingword?
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes.
 4   MR.   ROBERTS:   I feel that we have been sadly let down coming
 5         here this afternoon.     I appreciate you're talking about
 6         you want new evidence.     Surely you must realise that there
 7         was an awful lot brushed under the carpet at the last
 8         inquest and it's not been allowed to be exposed.     We just
 9         feel gutted.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes, well, I understand your point
11         on that.
12   MR.   ROBERTS:   You can't do anything about it?
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We will see.
14   MR.   ROBERTS:   Thank you.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much for coming.

    swop        tickets       to get     in the Lappings Lane                end,    myself and S haun walked

    u.s t o r Lie k e i,s , /feeca u s e last year,             there were           several       people selling

    tickets™           The drstance          from where we       parked was about a mile                    I w ould

estimate               every twenty yards Liverpool                   supporters,           were    stopping and

asking            to buy tickets.             They    said that a lot of Liverpool                    supporters

were            expecting to buy tickets as they had                          last year.       One    particular

Liverpool               supporter        said that         he knew of three           full    coaches       that    had
                                  <7
come without                  tickets,       and ne said the          reason no one was              selling       at

that            time,    was       because    of the       roadworks      on the M62 and everyone                  was

delayed               there and       it was       chaos,    on the M&2        because       I wanted       to swop,

avid was asking                    people    to swop tickets.

Several               Liverpool       supporters a p p r o a c h e d me,        thinking       I was       selling

and            i was offered           25.00 for          each ticket       on two occasions.              I found a

N o t t i n g h a m Forest Sup p o r t e r who               had five       tickets     for the L e p p i n g s         Lane

6    nrt   7    and    I swopped four           for   four,    and. after       looking       for

particular               pub,       I went    to    last year,    without           success,       it was about

2. pm „ Where we                   parked the       car   there was P,o 1 icemen,            but    they weren't

actively               involved       in directions         or escort        of supporters,           but we were
      *
not            near any       coach    parks.       So about 2/20 we decided to make                       our way to

the            turnstiles as we got                into Leppdngs       Lane.        I was    still    being

approached               by people          to buy tickets,       and       I w ould estimate             there must

have           been a good four        thousand’ outside. I started to think to

myself,               there    seemed a l.o4, of people about, and I was won d e r i n g why

there was               so many       pevpye about at         that     time.    There was a

police w o m a n on horseback                      shouting at    people       to get off           the    road and

into           the ground,          because        of the   volume     of    people     in such a small

area,            couldn't       see any turnstiles            because        it was     just a mass         of

people    7    but everyone         seemed to be good humoured,                there    didn't       seem

to be any           problems at all         there was    no    crush at that timj-K'but you

were    stood shoulder             to shoulder with        people.      Two    blo4<es pushed         past me

at    this     point,     one says     sorry mate and as              ‘ y went    passed me,

1    felt my wallet          go a ut of my back         packet          looked                but    they

had disapp e a r e d       into the       crowd.    I found a unitorrn S                  t outside

the    ground and told him what                had happened he circulated                it over          the

raciio. He then took ail               four    of us    into    the    police    office       inside       the

I saw     people      climbino o

were    shouting at them to get                o u t , the area       outside was       not

c o n gested at       this    time,    I heard     people      saying,    that    lads were           S O . 00

to the operator           to get      in people were          still    were    coming    over       the

top of wax I s , and other             fans were       shouting at them to get                back.

M yself       and S h a u n were     sure    they were N o t t i n g h a m Forest       supporters,

so Sea n said         lets    get    into    the ground as we were             standing       between the

tunnel        entrance and the turnstiles               I didn't       see any    policemen at the

tunnel        entrance,      but    there were     three      or four    stewards around,             they

were    looking       t owards/the        people   climbing      over    the wall,       the    time was

about 2.35pm to £.4/6pro as we walked                    into    the tunnel       all    four       of us

went    into Pen 3,          /here was       no problem       in the    tunnel    it w a s n ’t

congested.          We stood at the back of Pen 3,                and apart       from the          usual

singing        chanting arid general           carnival     atmosphere         there was       no

problem,        a l t h o u g h we were     tightly    packed together          but you       could move

freely.        At about a quarter            to t h r e e . I became aware        that    the volume

of the        crowd was      increasing and        it was      starting       to become

uncomf o r t a b l e at this         point    I got    a s p erated from the other             three

b ecause       of   crowd movement          I noticed    that    people were       jumping          from

P en 2,       into Pen 3, a l t h o u g h Pen was        not as       packed as ours,          by

              this     time      it was           becoming        very u n c o m f o r t a h l e , but            I have       been     in

              crowds       that were              even tighter at             previous matches,                    you were         being

              pushed up and down the                       s t e p s , and from side              to side            it was       impossible

              to stand still,                but     because          of the      fencing      sectioning                the    pens off,

              there was          no outlet for the                    pressure        to be    relieved.              People ware

              still       jumping          over     from the          empty s e c t i o n s    to S e c t i o n 3.              I would

              estimate        the time            to be just           before/five          to three,              I was

              aware       now,     of a big surge              from tirte back,             vou    couldn't              stand still,

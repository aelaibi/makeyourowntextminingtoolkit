Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to thank you for your letter of
5 January, about which Roger Finnigan telephoned me yesterday.
                                                                             /WJ
I have discussed this with Lord Justice Taylor. He would like to
have the opportunity of viewing the film at Bedford Row. But as
he is presently writing his Final Report he will not be able to
do this in the near future.  I explained the current timetable to
Roger Finnigan: Lord Justice Taylor expects to complete his
Report this month. He will then send it to the Home Secretary,
whose decision it will be whether and, if so when, to publish.

Perhaps the best thing is if I come back to you in a week or so's
time when I might be in a better position to discuss a date for
Lord Justice Taylor to see the film.  I appreciate your problems
about scheduling, and will, of course, keep you informed about
progress at this end with that in mind.

All this is, of course, without prejudice to the undertakings you
have with Mr Dear and to any considerations relating to criminal
proceedings which Mr Mervyn Jones may wish to put to you.

          Dear Sir Peter

          My agreement with Mr Geoffrey Dear covering filming of his
          force's role in the Hillsborough Inquiry included a provision, as
          a courtesy, for you and he to see the film before transmission.

          As agreed, we hope to transmit the film on or after the day of
          publication of your final report, and with that in mind, I would
          like to offer the opportunity for you to view our work in
          progress.

XJlO-L    The programme's producers, Roger Finnigan and Chris Bryer, will
          be in touch with your office in the near future to confirm
          receipt of this letter and discuss arrangements for a viewing.

          Yours sincerely

I ca n      remember        getting             s t uck     on       the       motorway          M6 p ,    a n d at        a    few    other

stages       of    the    journey           this         was     due       to       heavy    traffic            going          towards

Sheffield.               Just     before            we    got        into       Sheffield           I remember                 two

policemen were              stopping                vehicles          and       searching           them        for       drink,       however

they     just      waved     us      on,        it w a s       mainly           mini-buses            they were                stopping.




I do     not      remember        seeing            any     type          of    disorder          on t h e          route       or    ojvce    I

got    into       Sheffield          but        there       were          people       around         sitting          around          and
                                                                                                                            1/
drinking          from    cans.             I do         remember              seeing       some      policemen                again

stopping          lads    in van s.                 Once       in S h e f f i e l d         we    ha d     to       find a       place        to

park     and      eventually           we       followed             traffic          through         to G a t e w a y s         Superstore

car    park,       where     there          was       a sign          saying          "One       pound      to       park".



This     was      only a 5        or      10 m i n u t e         walk          from    the       ground.




On a grass           bank    on the             superstores                land,       there        were        a    few       oeiaple

sitting        around       drinking.                    I later           found       out       that      th e     Gateway           Store

was    selling        cans      of     beer         and     people             were    having         to    bu y      V   /cans       and     even

if y o u     bought       2 you        still          had      1\d    pay       for    4




Myself       and my       sister          then        began walking                   towards         the       ground,          this       would

have     been about          1.30pm             (1330).

         On   the     route          to    the    ground             again     I did       not    see     any       trouble         or       bad

         behaviour          through          drink,          it       seemed       very     good        humoured.




         Just    before          we       reached       th e         ground a Liverpool                  fan       told     us     that,

         "Liverpool           fans         had    to    go       that       way"     and    he    pointed           towards         Leppings            Ln

         just    a    few    seconds             later       a       policeman also              told      us w h e r e       to    go       but   by

         this    time       we       could       se^' the            sign    saying        Leppings           Ln.

         At   th e    turnstiles             there          was       a bit       of a     hold       up w h i l s t       the     police

         searched          people          before       entering,              but    there       did     not       seei

         queuing       system.               I would             say     there       wasn't       any      p r op e r      o r g a n i s a t ion

         outside       by the             police       and       not     enough       of    t hem,       I didn't

         horses       either.


                                                                                                      CAT                                                &
         I have       been       to H i l l s b o r o u g h           before       including            last       year'                                 d

         then    there       were         more        policemen and more                    organisation                outside          the

         ground.



         I did       not    see a n y        stewards                outside       the     ground        only       the      ones t a k i n g      the

         tickets.            I then          entered             a    turnstile          which        said     "    Entrance h ’             and

         once    on    the       other       side       I again             saw    people        being        searched           for     a    second

         time    by    p ol i c e ,       but    again           we     were      not.




         I d i d n ’t see a n y             other       gates           o p e n at   all        nor     did    I    see a n y

         unauthorised                entry       into       the       ground.




         My   ticket        wa s      handed          in,    in       the    correct        manner.

            I then       saw a sign above                        the    tunnel        saying,           standing           A    or B a n d        because

            it s t a t e d      on my        ticket         Standing            B    I thought           I must          go     ther e .




            There       wasn't         either         police           or    stewards          to a s k       to    the        contrary.           I do

            remember          seeing         a steward                talking        to a      programme            seller         near      to    a

            once    we     reached           the      pens        it w a s      very       full.


#           We    then     pushed           our     way     through            the    crowd        u n t il    we       came     to    space       near

            the    fr o n t ,    quite          a    lot,        we    even managed             to      sit    down        for    a while          behind

            a ba r r i e r .



            I had       not     at     t h is       stage        seen any           trouble        in    the       ground        or    people

            drinking          b e er    in the            ground.



            At     about        -1.50pm (1350)               in        pen 3     of Le ppi n ^ s / L n         t h e r e wa s         no    problem,



            At     about        2 . 2 0 p m (1420)           we       both moved           in f r o n t M           th e b a r r i e r       because          I

            had    previously               had a         ba d    experience              being      crushed            at H i l l s b o r o u g h      near

            to      a    fence.             Ih a d a l s o        had a        bad    feeling           about       the m a t c h          and    being

            At a b o u t      2.40pm         (1440)          it w a s        very     crowded           but    s^lll           Q K , just        like    it

            meant       you     couldn't             go    sideways.                 Although           it w a s        some     years       ago       when

            had    no      chance       being        crushed             on the        barrier,         I would            describe          him     as
<bt&        about         40 years          wjjXh g r e y        hair,       he w a s      wearing           a whi^/e T s h i r t             and     blue

            j e a n %/r    I could          not    se e    his        f a c e as       he w a s      bent     double.              I know           there

            were     at      lea s t    two       other        people        stuck       on     that       barrier          in d i s t r e s s .



            It wa s        then       that      I began          to      fall     to m y       rii^ht,       I lost         contact         with my

            sister         at    the    same       time.




            As    I fell         my    s ho e     came     off,          I felt        very     hot     and      c o u l d n ’t b r e a t h e .

            Just     before           I hit       the     ground          someone        picked         me    up4      I. w a s    then       propped

            up a g a i n s t      the m a n        on     the       barrier        who     had        ied,
                                                                                                     die d,      he    kept       me     from       going

            any    further            to m y      left.             My    sister        then      got      back       to    us    and      together

            Clwyd,       Tel     no.                                   We    formed a           triangle              to       protect

ourselves          and     raised          ou r      heaths up         so we       could        breathe.                   A    body        which

we    thought       wa s      dead,        then appe ar ed              on    top        of    us       being       passed           d o wn,      and

            and another              man     had       to     lift     it    off.             This       b o d y wa s          then       passed

forward.



It w a s     over    half        an     hour         l a ter    when        the    crowd a round                me       began         to    clear

and    people       could move              and        breath        again.              I remember             looking              at     the

man    b e h i n d me      whom       I had          seen      crushed,           and     as    the       crowd          came        off     hi m

he    fell    backwards              onto       the     terracing            and       did     not       move.           His        face     was

completely          grey and            his       eyes        had    rolled        into        the       back       of     his       head.




I remember          people           in f r o n t       of me        receiving            m/Juth to m o u t h

resuscitation              by    fans.               Then      fans     started/to              rip of          the        fencing           and

two    policemen           helped          t h e m,     eventually            a b/ble a p p e a r e d               in the           fence        and

a St    Johns       Ambulance              man       came      in to        help with           injured             p e o pl e .




We    then    managed           to    get       to     the     fence        where        two    fans          pulled           us    ou t    onto

the    pitch,       from        there       a     policeman            directed           us    onto          the     centre           circle.




The    only    reason           I can       feel        that        we w e r e     cr us h ed was              th e      massive            crowd

surge       just    before           3 o ’clock             (1500)       , but         the     barriers             and        the     fencing

at    the    sides       of     the     ground          are     badly        placed and                 are    at     fa ul t .

I remember          Kenny DALGLEISH                     coming         onto       t he    pit/h and             asking              e v e r y body

had    been a very              serious           incident.




Whilst       I was       on th e        pitch          th e    emergency           services              seemed          to     be     doing

their          job,     but       they were          lacking          in e q u i p m e n t     such         as    oxygen.



 It t o o k      quite        a while          for    the       fire       brigade       to    get        through       with wire

cutters,           the       fans    seemed          to    be    doing       a better          job.




I think          e v e n at        this    stage          at    4 o'clock          (1600)        there           were   some

difficulties                 in the       c r o w d at         the    back.




Eventually              we w e r e       told    by a          policeman         we m a y as          well        go,   but     first         we

went       to w a i t        for    a friend          of I                   by the       goal        area        in L e p p i n g s     Ln

stand.             It w a s        then    that       1 saw          the    bai^/ier      I wa s          stood      by was      bent

like       a    banana,           I had    not       known       this



We   waited            for    a while          but    eventually             left    via a d i f f e re n t             pen     gate,




I remember             as     we    left       someone          fainted and          there           wa s    a    large     crowd

moving          around        her    slowly,          but       eventually          we    got        out.          People       were

listening              to a       local    radio          report       which      said        that        Liverpool         fans       had

caused          th e    deaths       of 7 5      people,             but    everyone          wa s    disgusted            by   th a t

re-port.




We   then        went        to                  car       where       he m e t     his       friend,            I then     used a
       9

womans          phone        in a    house       where          I spoke         to m y    mum        to     tell     her    I was

alr ig h t .




               then     drove       us    to    our       car,       then    I drove          home.

             I have      no m o r e     to    say    this    is as    accurate       as   I can        remember       what

             happened.            But    I do       not   think    that    the L i v e r p o o l   fans       acted    wrongly

             in th e     ground,        they       only     ran at    the N o t t i n g h a m    fans    to    tell    them what

             happened.

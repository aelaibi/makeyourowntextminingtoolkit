when       we    locked           i'1s~44p to         walk       back     down       to    the      ground.




As    we    came          out     1 saw^^^tc^                                         supporters               sitting           on    the    low

they       were       drunk          at    that       time.




They       all       looked          cheerful             and    appeared           well       behaved.




We    walked          off       towards             Leppings        Ln    and       saw    quite         a    few     more       supporters

walking          toward           the      ground,          more       than     a    hundred.




The    supporters                 I saw         by    the       Leppings        Ln    entrance               were     mainly          family

so    we    walked             down       Vere       Rd    into     Fenistone             Rd    where         we    got     into       the

sports          hall       c ar      park       entrance.




We    walked          down        onto      the       track        round       the     pitch        in       front     of       the    Hop    to

I noticed             that        the      Hop       and    SoutfKStand              were       almost         full        of    Nottingham

Leppings             Ln    looked          empty          except       the     two     c e n t r a 1 cages            of    the

terracing.                These           two       cages       were     quite       f u l l ._____




I went          up    the       tunnel          and       met                             , the      head          groundsman           at    the

                                                                                                                                              S 1034-

c a r e t a ke rs      room       and    we       sat     in    there.




I stayed         there        for       about          15 m i n u t e s     and       then       I went          and       talked             to    the

apprentices             outside          the       changing           rooms          for    about       half          an       hour.




I then        went      dowft^the            tunnel        to       the    pitch       and       stood       on       the       touch          line

w ith                                         1 about           2.45       pm    <1445       hrs).




I didn't         notice           any    problems              at    that       time       but    it    looked             a    bit       unusual

for     the    West        Stand        to    be       partly        empty       at    that       time       -       that       is       terracing

behind        gates,         1,    2,    6    and       7 and        also       the    seating          area          in       the       West

Stand.         Me    andl                    Iwere         chatting         as        to   whatcondition                   the       pitch          was

in a n d      our      main       attention             was     drawn       to       this.




At    about     2.50         pm    <1450          hrs)     we       both    walked          slowly          around             the       track,

past     the     Kop       end     to    the       North        Stand       where          there       was       a    bench          for       me       to

sit     on    near      to    a    score          board.            I sat       down       and    I was          joined          by

              and                                  a    few     minutes          late r .         They       both          then          sat       down

with     me.        I have         been       shown        a        a map       of    the    Hillsborough                      Football

Ground        and      have       marked          on    this        map    the       position          of    the       bench             with       a

cross,        point        H1.      I now          produce           this       map    (Exhibit             no                       )

(Reference           No             1).




The     players         came       out       of    the     players          tunnel          and    I watched                   them       warming

up    until      the       kick     off.           My    attention              during       this       time         was        on       the

players        on      the    pitch,          identifying                 who    they       were.




The    Referee          blew       his       whistle           for    play       to    start       and       1 started                   to    watch

the     game.

                                                                                  x                                                              S1034

About       two    minutes             into      the        game.        I glanced                   over       towards          the        West

Stand       and     I saw      what           I thought            was    a       pitch          iiw^aj^on.                T h e re        was

perhaps          100    to    130       Liverpool             spectators                on       the       grass       area          just        behind

the    Liverpool             goal.            I didn't            see    anybody             at       that       time       climb           over       the

barrier          fencing.




It    looked        like      that          there       were       just       a       few    Policemen                down       on        the    track

with       them    at    this          time.




I    carried       on w a t c h i n g          the      game       then       at       about          5    or    6 minutes                 past

three,          (1303    -    1306          hrs),       a    Policeman             with          a    flat       cap       on    ran        onto       the

pitch       up    to    the    Referee             from       the       rough          direction                of    gate       two.




The    referee          blew       his       whistle          to    stop          play       and          the    next       thing           I

remember          is    that       a    Saint        John's         Ambulance                drove          past       me       on     the       pitch

towards          the    West       Stand.            It      looked       as       though             he    was       having           a    bit       of

trouble          getting       through             the       crowd       of       Liverpool                supporters                who        had    by

this       time    started             to    pour       onto       the    pitch             in       front       of    the       Liverpool

goal   .


Quite       a    few    Saint          John      Ambulance              people          ran          across          the    pitch           from       the

direction          of    the       corner          of       the    Hop    and         North           Stand          towards           the       top

goal .




1 stood          up a n d     I saw          some       Liverpool             supporters                   walking          along           the       track

from       the    West       stand          lYN<f r o n t     of    the       North          Stand          towards             m e.        A

policeman          who       was       sitting          ms^t       to    me       stopped             them       and       told        them       go

ba ck .




I saw       three       or    four          people          being       stretchereti— off                       across          the        pitch

                                                                                                                                                      S 1034

towards           the          corner        of      the       Kop       and       the       North        Stand.           I saw        one       of       them,

a    young        lad          who    had       a    Liverpool                shirt          on.      I could           only       see       the       back

of     his    head.




I started                 to    walk       slowly          across             the       pitch       towards            the       top    goal          then

when       I got           close       I saw             people          just       lying          there        on     the       ground       I

stopped,              I    could       see          fans       coming          out       of    the        p e n s \ m o v ing      down       the

pitch.            I       could       see       that       a    l ot      of       people          were      injured.              I saw          three

policemen                 giving       the          Kiss       of    Life          to    a    lad     aged        SO    tcN*£2 y e a r s .                 I

d o n ’t     know          what       he     was         wearing,             I c o u l d n ’t        see.           This        was    just          on       the

grass        between                gates       3    and       2.




I    could        see          people        being         squashed                in    the       pens      up      against           the    fencing,

trying        to       get          out.        Some       of       them       were          crying,         there         was     quite          a    bit       of

shout in g .




It     shook          me       up    s'd\I      walked          down          to    the       players           tunnel           entrance.


                            cat
I saw        that          people          had       r i pfcs^d d o w n            the       bill     boards           from       the     West         Stand

area       and        were          using       them       as       stV^tcniers               to    carry         people          across          the

pitch        to       the       ramp       that          goes       to    the       back       of     the       North        Stand.




Me .                                                                     and       some       of    the      apprentices                stood          around

there,        then             I said        I were            going          because          I ’d       had     enough          and     I started

to    walk        over          towards             the    ramp.              Then       I saw        a    lad       and     a    lass       trying             to

rip     off       the          boarding             on    the       edge       of       the    North         Stand         so     I kicked             it       off

for     them.




I then        said             I were        going         home          so    I walked             up     the       ramp.         I ’d      just          had

enough.               I walked             up       through          the       sports          hall        c ar      park        entrance             to       the
                                                                                                                            PAGE       6
                                                                                                                            S 10 3 4

       \     North    Stand       into       Penistone        Rd    and    I saw      about    twenty       ambulances        coming

             down    Herries       Rd    and    Penistone           Rd.




             I then       started       to    walk    home     and    carried         on   till     I got    home.




             I felt       I had    to    get    away.




             I just       stopped       at    home.      I was       supposed         to   have     been    going    out    that

             night    but    I d i d n ’t      feel     like       going   out       then.




             I d i d n ’t go      to    the    last     years       semi   -    final      that     was    played    at

             Hillsborough          so    I could        not    compare         one    with    the    other.

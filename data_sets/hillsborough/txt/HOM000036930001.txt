Thank you for your letter of 23 June to Tonv Banks enclosing one from
                                                      in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster. The consideration of matters relating to
Hillsborough is the responsibility of the Home Office, and it therefore falls to me to
reply.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for
a further public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations
which have been received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster
remain unresolved received renewed attention following the Granada television
documentary drama “Hillsborough” last December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has
been put forward, calling for a new public inquiry. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no
matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, as
you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to
conduct the scrutiny. I enclose for your information a copy of the
Home Secretary’s statement to the House, which includes Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith’s terms of reference. You will see that he has undertaken to make public the
advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives him.

It is our earnest hope that the independent scrutiny will finally bring an end to the
uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.    _                    .               *   -

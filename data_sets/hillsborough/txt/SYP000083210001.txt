                was      to   patrol      Mi d a l e w o o d Rd,     between M inta Rd and B r a d f i e l d Rd,

                At about         1115 am we           took    up our      positions         and     carried out a routine

At about 2 pm I was                           outside         Thr e s h e r s    off   licence      situated         on

M i d d l e w o o d Rd,             near      its    junct i o n with B r a d f i e l d Rd.             A c o n s i derable

am o u n t         of fans           had entered             these    premises and were               seen to be

purchasing alcohol.                            The     number        of    customers         inside    the shop became

such           that         I saw a male            employee         close and         lock     the door     to      prevent

other            persons           from e n t e r i n q .        A short         time after       this,     I saw POL

door.             People were               still     standing            outside      the     premises wait i n g          to    gs

in.            I am not            in a position              to say what POL PC G I B S O N said to the                          sh

employee,                  but     I believe         he may have            been asking          him to     close         the

When           the        si t u a t i o n a p p e a r e d   under        control      I resumed f ootpatrol                with

full           two        litre bottle           of wine.            I asked him          if he was       going       to the

football                  match and whe n            he said,         ’Yes'       I informed        him that         he w o u l d

not       be allo w e d             to enter         the     ground        carrying       such an      item,      he said,

’1*11           drink          it before         I get       there5.            I also    explained       that       he w o u l d

not       be a l l o w e d to enter                  if he was            drunk.

At about                  3 pm     (15Q0)      I heard a radio                  transmission        of my    personal

radio.               It was         c oncerning         problems           at the L e p p i n g s     Ln end of           the

football                  ground.         Officers appeared                 to be having           problems       control 1 in

the       crowd at the turnstiles.                               As time went            on,    I heard on of ficer as

for       some            door(s)       to be opened clue to                    crushing,        I cannot       say where

this was.

The       officer made                  this     request         on more         than one       o c c a s i o n and from         the

tone           of his voice,               there a p p e a r e d to             be a matter       of u r g e n c y    involved

s u g g e s t e d something            was wrong,             1    remained outside                the    ground at

the L e p p i n g s      Ln and w ith              some 50 or so other                 officers.            As    time went

on,    the     number         of s p e c t a t o r s    leaving         increased, until               the whole         of

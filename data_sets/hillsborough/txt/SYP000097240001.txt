                           COUNSEL'S ADVICE RE. PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS
                 (It would seem sensible to apply this also to Press statements)




Miss Norcliffe, solicitor, had consultation with Mr Woodward QC this date,
regarding requests for information from Government Departments to ourselves
for information to enable questions to be answered in the House, as follows


A.        So long as the information asked for is objective factually and can be
          given accurately - for example 'how many police officers were on duty at
          the match?' - then this can be supplied, but only if accuracy is not a
          problem.

          With regard to further questions - for example 'how were officers injured
          at the match?' - Counsel's suggested reply is as follows


                   'The South Yorkshire Police are not in a position to answer
                   that question and cannot speculate on it. This is one of
                   the matters obviously under investigation by the West Midlands
                   Police Force and the public inquiry ultimately.  It is a
                   question which cannot be accurately or reliably answered'.




All officers are reminded of the Chief Constable's directive that no
information must be supplied to the media in relation to the Hillsborough
disaster without his express permission.

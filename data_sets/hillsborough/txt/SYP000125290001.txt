 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 YES, AN INEXCUSEABLE ASSAULT ON A POLICEMAN ADMINISTERING FIRST AI d Q ^ T "
 "                -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ON THE FACE OF IT THE SITUATION WAS CHAOTIC.                                                                    THE SERVICES RESPONDED

 EXCELLENTLY AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES.                                                    THE POLICE CERTAINLY STOPPED A RIOT

 WHEN THE LIVERPOOL FANS ATTEMPTED TO CHARGE THE SPION K O P .                                                                                             THE SITUATION WAS

 GENERALLY TOO OVERWHELMING FOR THE SERVICES.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 A POLICEMAN WAS KNEELING OVER AN INJURED PERSON ON THE PITCH AND ADMINISTERING

 THE KISS OF LIFE.         A WELL BUILT LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER UPROOTED THE CORNER FLAG

 AND STRUCK THE POLICEMAN ACROSS HIS BACK WITH IT.         THE POLICEMAN DIDNT REACT,

 HE CONTINUED THE KISS OF LIFE.         TWO OTHER SUPPORTERS WHO WERE WITH THE WELL

 BUILT ONE PULLED HIM O F F .

 I WAS TOTALLY INCENSED BY THIS.         IT WAS INEXCUSEABLE.   I DONT THINK THE

 S^pv1
    |VICES COULD HAVE PERFORMED MUCH BETTER.

 ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND WE HAD BEEN PLAGUED BY LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS ASKING

 FOR TICKETS.        I'VE BEEN TO MANY BIG MATCHES BUT I’VE NEVER EXPERIENCED SO MANY

 PEOPLE APPROACHING ME.

 HANDLED , AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 FROM WHAT I SAW I WOULD SAY THAT ONCE IT WAS REALISED HOW SERIOUS THE INCIDENT

 OFFICERS PULLING AT THE FENCE WITH THEIR BARE HANDS AND HAULING PEOPLE OVER

 THE FENCING.      I DID SEE ONE FAN LIVERPOOL FAN 'ftfT? A POLICE OFFICER WITH A

 CORNER FLAG AS HE WAS ATTENDING AN INJURED HAN ON THE PITCH.        THE OFFICER

 JUST CARRIED ON.

 AND OTHERS WHO WERE TENDING TO INJURED PEOPLE BUT ALL OFFICERS TOOK IT

 WELL AND TRIED TO CALH THE FANS DOWN.

 2.     AS I WALKED BY THE LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND I COULD SEE POLICE

 OFFICERS AND MOUNTED OFFICERS TRYING TO CONTROL THE MASSIVE CROWD OUTSIDE BUT

 EVERYTHING THEY DID WAS TO NO AVAIL, AS THE CROWD JUST DIDN ’T WANT TO BE

 ORGANISED AND INTENDED       TO DO WHAT THEY WANTED.

 I WOULD TO ADD THAT AS       WE SAT IN MIDDLEWOOD ROAD IN THE CAR WAITING TO GO TO

 THE GROUND I SAW A GROUP OF MEN AND IN PARTICULAR ONE MAN DRINK 4 CANS OF BEER

 AND HALF A BOTTLE OF RUM AND I SAW A LOT WITH LOTS OF BEER AND BOTTLES OF

         WHICH MUST HAVE EFFECTED A LOT OF FANS.

 ®       CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS SUCH A SERIOUS INCIDENT THE Aj^HOjUTIES SEEMED

 TO REACT VERY LETHARGICALLY IN DEALING WITH THE I N C ^ D E J ^

 (II)     I WAS SURPRISED THAT ONLY ONE AMBULANCE CAME ONTO THE W f C H   TO FERRY

 CASUALTIES AWAY.

 (III)    IT TOOK FORTY MINUTES FOR FIREMEN WITH BOLT CROPPERS TO ENTER AND BEGIN

 CUTTING THE PERIMETER FENCE.

 (IV)     I THINK THAT THE CROWD SHOULD HAVE BEEN REDIRECTED OUT OF THOSE PENS

 (THOSE NOT INJURED, ETC, OBVIOUSLY) AFTER THE INCIDENT HAD UNFOLDED,

 CASUALTIES,    ETC..

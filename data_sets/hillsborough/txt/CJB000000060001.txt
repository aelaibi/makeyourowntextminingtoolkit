             STATEMENT OF: DAVID MALCOLM BOWNES

             OCCUPATION:    CHIEF LICENSING OFFICER, ADMINISTRATION & LEGAL DEPARIMENT
                            SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL

                                             Introduction

             Background details

     1.      My name is David Malcolm Bownes.   I am employed by Sheffield City    Council

             in the Administration and Legal Department as Chief Licensing Officer.


     2.      I have been employed by Sheffield City Council since September, 1971 and

             have held my current post since 11th July, 1977.


     3.      I obtained a Higher National Certificate in Public Administration     from

    4.       The responsibilities of my job are:-

             (a)   to manage the Licensing Section;


             (b)   to provide reports on licensing matters for departmental management

                   and committees and to institute, maintain and operate proper

                   procedures to ensure that all relevant matters are brought to the

                   attention of any committee or officer of the Council required to make

                   a decision on any licensing matter;


             (c)   to liaise with Council members, other departments of the Council and

                   outside bodies on all matters affecting the Licensing Section;


             (d)   to maintain a service to the general public   on licensing matters,

                   including dealing with enquiries and correspondence;


             (e)   so far as possible to ensure that the requirements imposed upon

                   licensees by law and by licence conditions are complied with, and in

                   this connection to co-ordinate the activities of the Council's

                   officers and the Police, Fire and other relevant authorities;
                                                                       &
                                                                        \v-

                                                     -2-


             (f)   to be responsible for all monies received by the Licensing Section

                   and to maintain proper records to the satisfaction of the City

                   Treasurer;


             (g)   to take statements and prepare reports on any matters where legal

                   proceedings may be contemplated and to appear in any court

                   proceedings which involve the Council's licensing function;


             (h)   responsibility for implementation of the Safety of Sports Grounds

                   licensing system;


             (i)   to assimilate and implement the increasing items of new legislation

                   relevant to the Council's licensing functions.


     5.      The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

             those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

             cinemas, theatres and places of public entertainment.


             Legislation and the Green Guide

     6.      On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Act 1975 (Document 1, pages 1-16) which established a "Certification"

             system for sports grounds capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.

             When a sports ground is designated by the Secretary of State an

             application needs to be made to the Certificating Authority for a General

             Safety Certificate under the 1975 Act.


     7.      At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council (the

             Certificating Authority) was obliged to attach to the Safety Certificate

             such terms and conditions as they considered necessary or expedient to

             secure reasonable safety at the sports ground when it is in use for

             specified activities.     The terms and conditions at this time had to

             include:-



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                      -3-


             (a)   The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

             (b)   Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of

                   entrances to and exits from the stadium or any part of it and the

                   means of access to any such entrances or exits and requiring those

                   entrances, exits and means of access to be properly maintained and

                   kept free from obstruction and as to the number, strength and

                   situation of any crush barriers.     (Section 2(2) of the Safety of

                   Sports Grounds Act 1975).


             Section 2(2) of the 1975 Act was repealed by the Fire Safety and

             Safety of Places of Sports Act 1987.     However, Home Office Circular

             71/1987 (Document 2, pages 20-29) advised that those conditions should

             still be included.


             Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to the plan

             attached to the Certificate, where appropriate.


             Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

             used by the Council if it thought that there was a serious risk to

             spectators at a sports ground.    The procedure involved applying to a

             Magistrates   Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

             of spectators to the sports ground.


             Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act a person authorised by the Local

             Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

             the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

             sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

             as he thought fit.   On local government reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

             (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

             passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

             Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.

     11.     In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

             (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

             Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

             at soccer grounds.   A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in

             1986 following the   Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.       The

             scope of the Green   Guide was amended to cover measures for improving

             spectator safety at existing sports grounds.       It is a voluntary code.     The

             Green Guide makes comments on such matters as the spacing of crush

             barriers, estimation of safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.       The

             Guide makes the point that deviations from individual guidelines are

             possible without necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the

             ground.   A flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the

             particular circumstances at individual grounds (paragraphs 6 to 8 of the

             Guide).


    12.      The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 197 5

             legislation in a number of areas.    In particular, the old Section 10 of

             the 1975 Act (Document 1, page 8)   was replaced by a more wide ranging

             provision which gave local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition

             Notice in respect of either a whole sports ground or part of it.          A

             Prohibition Notice   can only be issued where the Local Authority is ofthe

             opinion that there   is a serious risk         to spectators if they are admittedto

             the sports ground.   A Prohibition Notice may include directions as to the

             steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level

             and these may require alterations or additions to the ground or things to

             be done or omitted, which would contravene the terms or conditions of a

             Safety Certificate for the ground or for any stand at the ground.

             (Section 10(4) of the 1987 Act).    A prohibition or restriction contained

             in a Notice may take effect immediately if certain conditions are

             fulfilled, or after a specified period contained in the Notice.          An appeal

             may be lodged with the Magistrates' Court against a Prohibition Notice but


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -5-


              that appeal does not suspend its operation.    The Court may either cancel

             or affirm the Notice.


    13.      In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of every Certificating

             Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

             it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

             at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given

             to them by the Secretary of State.


    14.      The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

             stands at sports grounds.     Also, in order to give effect to various

             Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

             public entertainments which require licensing was extended.


    15.      The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

             1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

             Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc. (Document 3, page

             30-35).

                                         Home Office Circulars

    16.      Home Office Circular 71/1987 (Document 2, page 17-29) introduced the

             provisions of Part 2 of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the effects and

             operation of them.    There is also specific reference to the new

             Prohibition Notice procedure and a draft Prohibition Notice.


    17.      Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Document 4, page 36-43) sets out      the

             Statutory Guidance on inspections which is mandatory.


                          Administration of the Certificating Function by
                                   South Yorkshire County Council

             Background to Certification

    18.      The County Council   set up an "Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)"

             which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

             Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

             Council Administration Department.    This Working Party was set up

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -6-


             following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

             8th January, 1976.   There were four such Working Parties, one covering

             Sheffield, one Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


    19.      In the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

             Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about

             the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

             of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.   On 30th March, 1977 the

             South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

             to the Home Office indicating that they felt certification should be

             considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

             events that were held at Hillsborough.


    20.      At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there were

             incidents at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.

             This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

             of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

             At a meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

             questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

             specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

             with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.


    21.      The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up the designation

             question once again with the Home Office.   On 24th August, 1977 the Home

             Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that the case for designation

             of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming at that time - but they would

             reconsider the matter later.


    22.      The County Council continued to press the case for designation with   the

             Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

             played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

             been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -7-


             of safety within the ground.      The Home Office once again declined to

             designate the stadium.


             In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

             to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium

             under the 1975 Act.


             In August of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

             indicating that they would recommend to the Home Secretary that an order

             be made designating Hillsborough in due course.          The County Council then

             began the Safety Certificate drafting exercise.          The exercise was carried

             out in consultation with the Police, the Fire Service, the Building

             Surveyor and the Club.


             The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

             Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

             1979 (Document 5, page 44).


             The Club applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978

             (Document 6, page 45-48).


             Progress of the Safety Certificate Application with particular
             reference to the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

             In support of the Club's application, a report was submitted to the County

             Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

             1979 (Document 7, page 49-58) which dealt with the question of ground

             capacity at the stadium.    The report ».     .    .   deals in broad terms with

             the necessary strengthening and supplementation of the crush barriers on

             the terraces, and calculations are made of theoretical exit times .          .     ."

             All the stands and terraces were dealt with in the report.         Pages 4 and 5

             (Document 7, pages 53 and 54) of the report indicates that the west

             terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has a total area of some 1,480

             square metres, but there are no gangways.         It is suggested that the full

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -8-


             area would justify about 8,000 spectators, but after making a 10%

             allowance as the equivalent of gangways, a capacity of 7,200 would be

             appropriate.     The report says that the barriers should be designed to

             match this figure approximately and that those barriers which could not

             withstand test load should be appropriately strengthened and extra ones

             provided where necessary.    Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing

             1610/2X.     The three exits from the west terrace have a total width of

             about 11.5 metres which would permit some 1,250 persons per minute to

             leave the terrace.    The terrace could, therefore, be emptied in about 6

             minutes.     The report goes on that the Guide suggests that everyone on the

             terrace should be within 12 metres of a gangway or exit.     As there are no

             gangways some spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.     The report goes

             on to say that this is felt to be of no consequence as movement

             horizontally along the terrace will be easy and quick.


    28.      The north west corner reinforced concrete terrace is also referred to in

             the report which is noted as covering a net area of approximately 535

             square metres.    The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing

             the total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.     It was also noted

             that the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate in width and

             emptying should take place within 8 minutes.    The significance of the 8

             minute time relates to the recommended maximum time for departure of

             spectators from a terraced area of a football ground.    This recommendation

             is contained in the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 15.5 and the new

             Guide at paragraph 56.    The last page of the report, recommends a ground

             capacity of 50,100 spectators (consisting of approximately 24,000 seated

             spectators, 16,000 standing on the spion kop and 10,100 at the Leppings

             Lane end).


    29.      Following the submission of Eastwoods' report to the County Council there

             was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

             February, 1979 (Document 8, page 62) at which the west terrace and north

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -9-

             west corner reinforced concrete terrace were discussed.       As far as the

             west terrace was concerned it was agreed that ".      .   .   in view of the

              lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the spectator

              limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party

             agreed that it would be unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional

             exits must be provided." The Working Party also noted that special

             attention would be required to the crush barriers in addition to the

             ordinary testing in view of the apparent sharp edges, corrosion, etc.          The

             Working Party agreed that there were no real problems with the north west

             terrace but reference is made to the corrugated sheeting which would be

             required to pass the appropriate tests, along with the crush barriers.


    30.      On 30th March, 1979 (Document 9, page 66) the Officer Working Party

             considered further the question of the west terrace and the north west

             terrace.   As to the west terrace it was noted that the terracing in small

             areas near to the stand was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on

             the steps on the north west corner exit would also require attention as it

             tended to throw people forward.     The height of the crush barriers was also

             mentioned as being below the Guide recommendations.       The Working Party

             agreed that these points should be drawn to the attention of the Club.         As

             far as the north west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now

             took the view that the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in

             order to meet the requirements of the Green Guide.


    31.      On 2nd April, 1979 (Document 10, page 71) the Officer Working Party

             visited Sheffield Wednesday and a joint meeting was held with the Club

             representatives.   The Working Party agreed that the Club's proposals

             (including a capacity limit of 7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without

             the need for additional gangways.    It was also agreed that the question of

             the cross-fall on the steps on the north west corner exit, the height of

             some of the existing crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp

             edges in places, should be the subject of.detailed discussion between Dr.

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                      -10-


             Gastwood and the Building Surveyor.      The Club's proposals in respect to

             the north west terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900

             and the improvement of existing barriers and addition of some new

             barriers.     It was also agreed that the improvement or replacement of the

             existing corrugated sheeting should be subject to discussion between the

             Building Surveyor and Dr.    Eastwood.


    32.      On 18th April, 1979, (Document 11, page 75) a joint meeting of the Officer

             Working Party was held at Sheffield Wednesday.     The meeting was held to

             discuss further the proposals in relation to the Hillsborough Stadium.

             The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that in

             view of the cross-fall on the north west corner exit, the steps should be

             rebuilt and that the other matters previously raised would be reconsidered

             after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.     Whilst

             accepting the need for improvement or replacement of the existing

             corrugated sheeting on the north west corner terrace, the Club wished to

             consider whether to carry out more extensive works so as to bring an

             existing unused area into use for the accommodation of further

             spectators.


    33.      On 1st May, 1979 (Document 12, pages 78-80) the Sheffield City Council's

             Building Surveyor wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as

             the west terrace was concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps

             needed to be corrected and that the limitation in capacity should remain.

             It was noted that, on the north west terrace, the replacement of the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear was required, as was the removal of

             understrength barriers and their replacement by new ones constructed to

             Guide recommendations.


    34.      On 16th May, 1979 (Document 13, page 82) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to

             the County Council with a work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

             It is noted that the west and north west terrace exit routes were regarded


HB5AAA/JJJ
as satisfactory.   It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace 2,900 persons.


As a result of these consultations between the Working Party and the Club

on 8th June, 1979 (Document 14, page 85 and Document 15, pages 86-92) a

list of "Matters requiring attention at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield" was sent to the Club for its attention.


On 15th August, 1979 (Document 16, page 93) the Officer Working Party met

again to consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review

the progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


On 19th September, 1979 (Document 17, pages 96 and 97) Eastwood & Partners

wrote to the County Council about the emergency lighting installation in

the stadium.   Eastwoods proposed in the letter that new emergency circuits

and fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.     It was finally

agreed that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the

front of the corrugated sheeting at a Working Party visit to the ground

to assess the progress of works.     (Document 18, page 99).

Grant of the Certificate

The County Fire Services Committee of -the South Yorkshire County Council

at its meeting on 29th November, 1979 approved the issue of a General

Safety Certificate and the terms and conditions of that Certificate to

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.    This decision was ratified by the full

County Council meeting on 19th December, 1979.     Prior to the grant of a

certificate the Working Party visited the ground on 18th December, 1979
                                                        -12-


               (Document 97, pages 299-301).     The grant of a Certificate was made subject

               to remedial works to the south stand steel columns and the emergency

               lighting system being carried out.       The Safety Certificate document itself

               was issued on 21st December, 1979 under the signature of Mr.        F.   A.

               Mallett, the Chief Executive of the County Council.

             Example of Inspection

    42.
             At the Working Party inspection on 11th August, 1983 (Document 20, pages

             113-116) there were two representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club (Dr.     Eastwood and Mr.    E.   England), two from the South

             Yorkshire Police (j.    Barker and C.     Calvert), one from the South

             Yorkshire County Fire Service (J.       Miles), two from the Sheffield City

             Council (Building Authority) (A.     Roberts and D.    Sheriff) and one from


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -13-

              the South Yorkshire County Council Administration Department (D.

             Vaughan).   For illustrative purposes, I would refer to the last two

              paragraphs on the first page of the notes of the Working Party visit.       In

              the first of the two paragraphs it is clear that a problem in relation to

              the brickwork at the rear corner of the stand nearest the north west

              terrace had been raised at the previous meeting of the Working Party and

              this was further explored at the meeting on 11th August.    In the second

             paragraph, Dr.   Eastwood (the Club's Consulting Engineer) gave details of

             testing of the crush barriers on the terrace and indicating that

             appropriate remedial action had been taken, where necessary and that the

             first cycle of the barrier testing had thus been completed.


             Issues arising other than on inspections                    __

     43.     The County Council was made aware of various problems in connection with

             the use of the stadium.   An example as to how these matters were dealt

             with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

             Fire Service (Document 21, pages 117-118) to the Sheffield Wednesday

             Foptball Club regarding a test which the Fire Service did of the emergency

             procedures at a match on 4th October, 1983.   There was particular concern

             that stewards could not hear the emergency procedure announcement on the

             public address system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry out

             their emergency procedure duties.   Consultations then took place between

             the Club and the Fire Officer (with reference to the County Council) which

             resulted in the system being checked and found satisfactory by the County

             Fire Service on 29th October, 1983, (Document 22, page 119, and Document

             23, page 120).



                         Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority
                                 (with effect from 1st April, 1986)

             Initial Administrative System

     44.     At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel on 3rd March, 1986 (which is

             a Sub-Committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

             Committee of the City Council) a report was considered from the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds

             (Document 24, page 122). The Panel adopted the recommendations contained

             in the report which were:-


             (a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

                   Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.


             (b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in

                   consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Panel or of

                   the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

                   appropriate.


             (c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.


             The Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

             City Council which took place on 9th April, 1986.


     45.     The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act at

             its meeting on 6th May, 1986 (Document 25, pages 123-127).


             Review of the Administrative System

     46.     At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

             considered a report (Document 26, pages 128-130) on the future

             administration of the Council's Certificating function.


     47.     As the report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority,

             will act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service),

             the question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.      In this

             respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

             Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

             the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -15-


             Department of Health and Consumer Services.     Both the Building Surveyor's

             Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

             existing Council structure.   It was envisaged that the Advisory Group

             would function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most

             regular use would probably be the discussion of advice to the Council

             before recommendations were finally formulated by the appropriate

             Authority.


             It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

             request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

             Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

             list of items to be discussed.   At the conclusion of the meeting a further

             list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

             taken by each Authority would be noted.     It was then envisaged that

             detailed written advice would be provided by each discipline and acted

             upon as appropriate.


             The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

             Authority


             Authority                         Area of Responsibility

             The Building Surveyor,            All matters relating to the structure
             (Sheffield City Council)          of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                               walls, etc.

             South Yorkshire County            Fire precautions, fire alarms, means
             Fire Service                      of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                               capacity.

             South Yorkshire Police            Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                               access of emergency vehicles and
                                               emergency planning.


             It should be noted that there is, of course, an independent duty in

             relation to safety at the sports ground which falls on the club as

             certificate holder and the management of the business carried on at the

             ground as occupier.



HB5AAA/JJJ
It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

such as first aid requirements.   'Riese lists were of course not

exhaustive and several of the functions overlapped.


The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried

out each year.   It was also envisaged that some additional inspections

would take place during events.   It was noted that the proposal    was in

line with the Popplewell Report   and with licensing practice in other

areas.


The Panel approved the revised administrative system which therefore came

into effect immediately and delegated all routine matters in connection

with that system to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.         The

system remains in effect.


The report was seen in draft by   all the interested officers and   its

proposals modified in the light   of comments made. Prior to the

preparation of the report the administrative system was discussed at

length at both a meeting and in correspondence with proposed members of

the Advisory Group .


Comments on the New Administrative System

Basically, the Council's responsibility divides into three parts, i.e. (a)

inspections of sports grounds; (b) dealing with proposed alterations to

sports grounds and (c) dealing with serious risks to spectators.     The

inspection system is dealt with at paragraphs 61 to 78.


Sports ground management sometimes wish to alter or improve their facility

and usually these proposals involve the Council as Certificating

Authority.   Recent examples of such developments include the extension and
roofing over of the Kop and also the installation of facilities for people

with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough*    The administrative

system for dealing with those alterations is that copies of the proposals

are circulated to all the members of the Advisory Group for comment.

Where comments are received, they are collated and passed on to the Club -

if necessary following discussions between officers either informally or

via the Group itself.    This system works reasonably well where proposals

are straightforward and there is no disagreement between the officers and

the Club about individual items.   An example of a relatively

straightforward alteration to the Hillsborough Ground is the "Gate 'O'

Development" (Document 86, pages 269-270) which involved the creation of a

new entrance to the Ground on Penistone Road.


Unfortunately, some developments are not quite so straightforward and an

example of the sorts of problems that can arise are contained in the large

volume of correspondence in relation to the proposed facilities for people

with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.   In that

particular instance, a considerable amount of time was expended on what

was essentially a fairly straightforward development.   The amount of

officer time spent on'dealing with alterations to sports grounds obviously

has to be included in the total amount of time applied to the Safety of

Sports Grounds system.


If the Council were of the opinion that admission of spectators to the

Sports Ground involved a serious risk then immediate steps would be taken

to secure rectification of the problem.   If rectification was not

possible prior to spectator admission then if appropriate steps would be

taken to issue a Prohibition Notice.


The administrative system has not yet been in operation for a long enough

time to enable a true assessment of it to take place and it will, as with

any similar system, no doubt be capable of modification in order to
             improve its efficiency.   It is and has been my practice to review

             administrative systems after they have been in operation for a reasonable

             time (for example in this case perhaps a period of two years would be an

             appropriate time to review it).


             Role of the Administration and Legal Department
             in the Certification System

    59.      The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

             the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


    60.      An example (Doeowmt 27, page 131-132) of an Agenda and notes of a meeting

             are attached, dated 28th April, 1988, which shows the sort of items

             discussed at the Advisory Group.


             the Inspection System operated by Sheffield City Council

    61.      Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

             and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

             authorities.   Inspections have taken place on the following dates:-

             7th August, 1986; 6th August, 1987; 19th May, 1988.


             the Inspection System

    62       The inspection system basically consists of six stages:-

             Stage                      Action

             1                          Arrange the inspection

             2                          Carry out the inspection

             3                          Receive comments from Advisory Group members
                                         in writing

             4                          Co-ordinate the comments if necessary via an
                                        Advisory Group meeting

             5                          Send the co-ordinated list to the sports
                                         ground management

             6                          The Advisory Group Officers check that work is
                                        done either on the next inspection or at some
                                        earlier stage if appropriate.




HB5AAA/JJJ
 This procedure is of course much simplified in the table above and many

 variations of it can occur.   The system itself should in most

 circumstances work well but in practice some difficulties do occasionally

 arise.


Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.    Often, the Club is

represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

The inspection is carried out by the various officers who meet at the

ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

interest lies.


The Officers can draw points to each other's attention during the

inspection and Club representatives are sometimes asked for

information.


If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

taken to secure its rectification.   If rectification is not possible prior

to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

to issue a Prohibition Notice, if appropriate.


Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

which ought to be raised with the Club.   These are then collated and

discussed with the officers (when necessary at an Advisory Group) and

finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for action.


As an example, a copy of Officers' comments following the 1987 inspection

are attached to this Statement (Doconent 28, pages 133-134).
                                                   -20-


    69.      The actual time spent on each ground inspection alone usually exceeds two

             man days per year.     This does not include the subsequent administrative

             work or the consideration of proposals submitted by sports ground owners.

             Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Docuaent 4, pages 36-43) states that

             inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days per

             ground on average.


             Details of the Inspections at Hillsborough in 1986, 1987 and 1988

             7th August, 1986

    70.      There is no written record of the inspection on 7th'   August, 1986.There are

             two reasons for this.    The first is that no significant problems were

             discovered on the inspection and the only point of significance raised was

             that in relation to barrier 144 which is referred to in paragraphs 174-175

             of my statement.     The second reason is that at the same time as the

             inspection was being carried out, the lengthy and complex debate in

             relation to the Spion Kop was fully underway and by far the majority of my

             own efforts and those of the other participants in that debate were

             concentrated in that area.    I do, however, recall that the inspection

             followed the County Council system and it helped firm my views in that

             area.


             6th August, 1987

    71.      The Building Surveyor and the Director of Health and   Consumer Services

             made a number of comments on the annual inspection.    These comments

             were considered and discussed between officers and a   consolidated

             list was drawn up and sent to Sheffield Wednesday on   4th December, 1987

             (Docunent 28, pages 133-134).    No comments were received from the Fire

             Service or the Police.    The list was circulated to the Fire Service, the

             Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building Surveyor, the Police

             and Messrs.   Eastwood & Partners.




HB5AAA/JJJ
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote back to the Council (Document 82, pages

242-245) on 15th January, 1988, indicating that the majority of the points

raised from the list of comments had been completed but raising one or two

questions on some of the items.    Copies of Eastwoods letter were passed on

to the Health and Consumer Services Department and the Building Surveyor

but owing to the impending May inspection no further action was taken at

that stage.   I should explain that it had been decided to move the annual

inspection from August to May, in order that any work that needed to be

done could be identified and carried out during the close season.


As already noted, the Fire Service did not make any comments in relation

to the inspection.    The Fire Service sent a letter to the Council on 18th

February, 1987 (Document 91, pages 279-284) containing a large number of

comments on Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.    After discussions with

the Fire Service, the City Council sent a copy of the Fire Service letter

(along with various comments) on 22nd April, 1987 (Docuaent 92, pages

285-286) to Sheffield Wednesday.    After being reminded, the Club via

Eastwood & Partners responded to the County Fire Service letter on 3rd

February, 1988 (Docoaent 93, pages 287-293).    The letter was very detailed

and was passed on to the Police, the Health and Consumer Services

Department and the Building Surveyor on 8th February.    The letter was sent

to the Fire Service on 8th February, 1988, with a covering letter

(Document 94, page 294).    In view of the comments in this letter, the Fire

Service were invited to respond directly to Eastwood & Partners.      The

letter also requested comments on the remainder of the points raised in

Eastwoods letter.    A Senior Fire Officer rang me in February, 1988,

indicating that the Fire Service did not wish to reply to the letter at

that time.                                                     VT':
                                                    -22-


              19th May. 1988

     74.     The   inspection was attended by representatives of the Police, the Fire

              Service, the Building Surveyor and Health and Consumer Services

              Department.



     75.     The   Fire Service and the Health and Consumer Services Department both

              commented on the inspection by letter dated 25th May, 1988 (Document 95,

              pages 295-296) and memorandum of 3rd June, 1988 (Document 96, pages

              297-298) respectively.



     76.     The   Fire Service had not yet^epl-ied~tQ^astwoods letter (Document 93,

             pages 287-293) r e f^rgd to above.     I was therefore reluctant to send their

             further letter ^Document 95, pages 295-296)/to the Club before the

             previous issue had'bien~reso 1ved T   ^ h a d thought to write back to the Fire

             Service in this way but unfortunately time simply did not permit owing to

             other commitments within the Licensing Section.      I should say that at no

             time has the Fire Service indicated that any of the points mentioned in

             their letter required immediate attention or presented any serious hazard

             to the public.



    77 .     The Director of Health and Consumer Services made a number of points

             similar to ones raised previously.


    78.      Ideally, what should have happened in June or July 1988 was that the

             outstanding Fire Service issues should have been resolved and that a

             co-ordinated set of comments submitted to the Club.      This did not

             however happen owing, as I have mentioned previously, to pressure of work

             within the Licensing Section.   As I have already said, none of the points

             raised by either the Fire Service or the Health and Consumer Services

             Department had been highlighted as being of a serious nature.

             Why were the Administrative and Inspection Systems changed when
             Sheffield City Council became the Certificating Authority?____

    79.      In April,   1986, I recall visiting the South Yorkshire CountyCouncil

             Offices in Barnsley and collecting the large number of files in relation

             to both designated sports grounds in Sheffield.      In addition to applying

             some time   to reading the files, I talked to officers who had

             been involved with the system for some time.


    80.      It seemed   to me that the key test of the South Yorkshire County Council

             administrative system was whether or not it achieved a reasonable degree

             of public safety within the sports grounds which were subject to the

             certificating system.    Bearing this principle in mind, I formed a number

             of tentative views about the County Council's administrative system.      Hie

             first a°d most obvious point was that the issues at sports grounds were

             complex and required the allocation of a considerable amount of time in

             order to deal with them.   Also, although it appeared on the face of it

             that the system itself worked well, it struck me that there were a number

             of points which required clarification.      For example, it was not clear who

             made what decisions.    There were plenty of "agreements" on the file and a

             lot of letters to the Clubs but there was no evidence to indicate who had

             the authority to make requirements, etc.      It was also difficult to pick up

             from the files exactly where the technical responsibilities lay and often

             "agreements" were noted as having been arrived at without an indication as

             to who contributed to them.   There was also no clear indication in a lot

             of cases as to the basis on which agreement was reached.     The constitution

             of the Working Party was also rather confused as evidently Club

             representatives were present and made comments at various meetings at

             which agreements were reached.


    81.      I also looked at the question of inspections of the sports grounds and

             wondered about their thoroughness.   The inspection records did not

             clearly show which areas of the sports grounds had been looked at and it


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -24-


             seemed to me that in view of the size of sports grounds quite a number of

             points would be raised on an inspection - although these points would

             obviously vary in importance.     The question of the time taken on

             inspections was also a matter which I thought about.      I also noted that

             the Safety Certificate had now been in force for seven years and perhaps

             should be reviewed.     Obviously, this review process would take a

             considerable time.


             I also looked into the question of the amount of time which should be

             spent on safety of sports grounds and took particular note of paragraph 10

             in the letter accompanying the Home Office Circular 136/78 (dated 23rd

             August, 1978) which stated that "... Local Authorities should not in the

             normal course find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17

             man/days work         This statement is in relation to charging fees for the

             grant of Safety Certificates and is a clear indication that from the point

             of view of the Home Secretary, even the work prior to Certification which

             the Council would need to carry out should not exceed the rather limited

             17 man/days.    It should be noted that Home Office Circular 72/1987

             (Docuaent 4, page 37) indicated that inspections are not expected to take

             more than about 2 man/days per ground on average.     It seems to me that far

             more than 2 man days per ground are required.


             It is, in my opinion, vitally important that a licensing authority should,

             whilst arranging adequate systems of communication, also be completely

             independent of licensees themselves.     Such independence is crucial in

             order that the Authority can form properly balanced views which are based

             on adequate information and which are not unduly influenced by the view of

             licensees themselves.     I should emphasise once again, however, that

             licensees have a part to play in discussions but decisions finally rest

             with the Authority.     Carefully maintained independence also tends to breed

             objectivity whereas inter-dependence (i.e.     relationships which become too

             close) tend to obscure it.     In the area of public safety, independence

             must be maintained.


    84.      In March/April, 1986, having formed the tentative views I have set out

             above, I then decided to see exactly how the system worked in practice.        I

             had no wish to interfere with what appeared to be a smoothly running

             system unless significant factors emerged which required immediate

             attention.


    85.      In relation to the administrative system, the matter was first considered

             by the Council on 3rd March, 1986 (Document 24, page 122) when all powers

             and duties under the Act were delegated to the General Purposes Panel and

             various powers were then delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

             Department (paragraph 44).     A further report was considered on 6th May,

             1986 (Docuaent 25, pages 123-127) when it was agreed that the old system

             should continue for the time being and that the certificate conditions

             should be reviewed.     Finally, at its meeting on 7th September, 1987

             (Document 26, page 128-130) the current administrative system was approved

             (paragraph 46 to 53).


    86.      The inspections in 1986 followed the pattern of the previous County

             Council inspections where Officers of the Working Party accompanied a Club

             representative around the sports ground over a period of possibly two

             hours.   Two things struck me about these inspections.    The first was that

             they were not particularly efficient as Officers representing the various

             disciplines were not all interested in the same items and therefore much

             time was wasted while discussions took place between a particular

             specialist and the Club.     Secondly, the lead appeared to be taken by the

             Club in directing the inspection.     I am quite sure that if officers had

             said that they wished to visit a particular area of the sports ground or

             to take more time with their inspection this would have been allowed by

             the Club.    There is no suggestion that the Club or its representatives


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -26-


             either attempted or intended to control the areas of the sports ground

             which the officers visited.


    87.      However, during the 1987 and 1988 inspections of the sports grounds, I

             attempted to encourage Officers to feel free to visit all parts of the

             sports grounds and gradually this did indeed happen.    I recall that

             initially the Clubs were perhaps somewhat concerned about this move as

             were some of the officers, but its value has been demonstrated several

             times.   For example, during the 1987 inspection of one of the sports

             grounds in Sheffield it was discovered that there was an accumulation of

             combustible material beneath a wooden stand.    This situation was dealt

             with most promptly by the Club concerned in consultation with the relevant

             officers.


    88.      One of my suggestions was to involve officers of the Council's Health and

             Consumer Services Department in the Safety of Sports Grounds System.     This

             stemmed from recommendation 9 in the Popplewell Report which related to

             the Health and Safety experts.    I recognised that unlike other similar

             licensing systems (for example, public entertainments, theatres and

             cinemas), there was no input in the old County Council system from

             appropriately qualified Health and Safety experts.    There were some

             resistance to the idea of their inclusion, but I believe that their

             contributions have been and will continue to be most valuable.


    89.      Obviously, any system can be improved in the light of experience but I

             believe that any serious safety problem would be discovered and dealt with

             under the current system.   In the light of the tragic events at

             Hillsborough and with the benefit of the Inquiry report these issues will

             be reconsidered.


                                    The role of the Home Office

    90.      The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

             for safety of sports grounds.    Its functions can be described in brief as

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -27-




              follows:

             (a)   To advise Parliament on legislation;

             (b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
                   and to offer guidance;

             (c)   To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to
                   inspections); and

             (d)   To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
                   the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.




             __     The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
                                      and the Popplewell Report

    n.       The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

             1985 (Docuaent 29, page 135) outlining the certification system in

             operation throughout the County.     The press release went on to say that

             the forthcoming "Summer" inspections will take into account the lessons of

             the recent tragic event at Bradford and any revised advice and

             requirements which may be issued by the Home Office.     On 13th May, 1985

             the South Yorkshire County Council sent a letter to the Secretary of

             Sheffield Wednesday (Document 30, page 136) enclosing a copy of the press

             release and stressing that it is vital necessity for safety stewards to be

             fully aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of

             doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting

             equipment.


    92 .     The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

             9th August, 1985 (Document 31, pages 137—138) indicating that the Interim

             Report of the Popplewell Inquiry had been produced and advice had been

             deceived from the Home Office.     The letter drew attention to a review of

             the evacuation procedures in consultation with the Police an^ the Fire

             Service and also to the duties of safety stewards.     It also indicated that

             the Police and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in these

             matters.     Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities

             at the stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -28-


              There was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

              materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

              displayed.    The Club responded (Document 32, page 139) to the County

              Council s letter of 14th August 1985 and comments were made about steward

              training procedures.


     93.      Hie Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

              1987    (Docuaent 33, page 140) referring to the revised Green Guide which

              had been published by H.    M.   Government following the Popplewell Report

              drawing attention to the new Guide and particularly to Chapter 2, which is

              entitled "Management Responsibility".     The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday

              to confirm in writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the

              revised Green Guide on the premises and that they should take immediate

              steps to appoint a safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.    The Club

              responded to that letter on 23rd October, 1987 (Document 34, page 141) and

              Mr.    Mackrell stated "I confirm that I do have a copy of the Guide to

              Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 edition and have had such for many months.

             With regard to the appointment of a Safety Officer, my duties encompass

              those of the Safety Officer and I would be grateful if you could amend

             your records to note that I am responsible for all matters of safety

             within the ground".



                                          The Semi-Final in 1981

    94.      On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working Party (Document 35, pages 142-143)

             inspected the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F.A.

             Cup Semi-Final was to take place on 11th April, 1981.


    95.      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on 15th

             April, 1981 (Document 36, pages 144-145) outlining an incident which took

             place at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on

             11th April, that year.     It is noted that there were injuries to spectators

             because of crushing.     The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -29-



             appears that the crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late

             due to travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

             commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

             terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

             The turnstile readings indicated 335 persons in excess of the

             capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

             having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

             1N 1 (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

             directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

             were standing.   Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John

             Ambulance for minor ailments and 8 spectators were treated at the Royal

             Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals.     According to the Police,

             three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

             unspecified injuries.     The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

             both inside and outside the stadium was very good.


    96.      On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote

             (Document 37, page 146) to the Police asking for a copy of their report on

             the Semi-Final incident.


    97.      Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

             Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 (Document 38,

             pages 147-148) commenting in detail on the incident at the match on 11th

             April.   The Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to

             the stadium and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final

             matches at Hillsborough without previous incident.     The Police apparently

             envisaged difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters

             would need to use the Ml motorway.     There were a number of problems which

             slowed down the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a

             coach breaking down and extensive road works.     These resulted in Tottenham

             Hotspur fans being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.     This all

             resulted in      .   .   a sudden influx of large numbers of football

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -30-


             supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the start of

             the match . . . "


    98.      Mr. Brownlow went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed

             to obtain tickets from Wolverhampton.    He noted that this completely

             defeated the spectator policy which places the largest groups of standing

             supporters at opposite ends of the football ground.    Apparently, neither

             participating football club told the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield-

             Wednesday, or the Football Association about this situation and the mixing

             of supporters was not properly catered for.    Some 400 Tottenham fans had

             to be removed from the kop and accommodated in the Leppings Lane end.


    99.      According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

             took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

             the Leppings Lane enclosure ". . . thereby creating a jamming effect at

             the extremeties of it . . ."   The late arrivals then caused a problem

             because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

             Hotspur had scored an early goal.   The resulting injuries included broken

             arms, legs and crushed ribs.   It is noted that some 38 people received

             treatment.   The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

             enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

             perimeter track to relieve pressure.    Police Officers also refused access

             to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

             the crushing problem.   In Mr. Brownlow1s view, no other course of action

             could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


   100.      Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

             had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

             similar events.

                      The installation of, and alterations to, the radial fences
                                     on the Leppings Lane terrace


             The 1981 Proposals

     101.    Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

             1981 (Docuaent 39, pages 149-150) indicating that 11.     .   .   we have been

             instructed by the Club to organise the installation of two radial fences

             on the terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground .       .   .".   It was

             noted that the intention of these fences was to divide the terrace into

             approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance.         The

             object of dividing the terrace was to exercise more control over
i.



             supporters and for example, a visiting team with only a few followers

             would be allocated one section with the other two sections retained for

             home supporters.     A 1.'15 metre wide gate was proposed at the rear of each

             fence, to give access for maintenance and also policing during the game.

             The gates could be left open, but fastened back to connect the areas

             during the game if appropriate.     In order to preserve spectators' views

             Eastwoods recommended that the top of the fence should be approximately

             1680 mm above the terrace.     It was noted that a fence of this height would

             not prevent individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should

1            eliminate a mass "invasion" from one area to another.     Apparently, fences

             of this height worked successfully at St.     James* Park (the Newcastle

             United ground).    The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2

             and 3.


     102.    On 9th September, 1981 (Docuaent 40, page 51) Eastwoods wrote to the

             County Council indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in

             early October, subject to their being no objections from the Council.

             Eastwoods indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be

             received by 23rd September.


     103.    The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September 198J), (Docuaent

             41, page 152) considered the question of the proposed new radial; barriers

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                       -32-


             oh the west terrace.     It was noted that there were drawbacks to the

             division of the terrace into approximately three equal areas , but the

             Working Party felt that increased control on the terrace should result.               A

             "for instance" was quoted in that there could well be problems with

             opposing fans mixing at the rear of the west stand and/or the final exit

             gates, but the Police considered that they could cope with these

             problems.


   104.      The adequacy and positioning of the gates at the rear of the radial

             barriers was discussed as well as the use of the existing gates in the

             pitch perimeter fence.     It was noted that the plans did not indicate the

             headroom which would be available at the rear of the terrace should the

             radial barriers and gates be installed.          The Working Party agreed that

             there was no objection to the proposals subject to further calculations as

             required by the Building Authority being satisfactory, confirmation of

             adequate headroom at the rear of the terrace and those gates being under

             Police control.   The County Council wrote to Eastwoods confirming the

             Working Party views on 14th September (Document 42, pages 154-155).            In a

             letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

             substantially complete (Document 43, page 156).


   105.      The South Yorkshire Police wrote (Document 44, pages 157-158) to the

             County Council on 18th January, 1982 about, amongst other things, the new

             radial fencing at Leppings Lane.     It is confirmed in the letter that the

             fences are working well.     It is commented that since there have been no

             games resulting in the whole of the terracing being occupied by one group

             of fans, the Police are unable to comment in that respect, but they

             foresee no problems.     The Chief Constable goes on to say that as existing

             barrier rails have been extended up to and completely through the new

             radial fencing, fans could climb over from one pen to another.            Also, it

             was noted that there were some ".     .    .     dangerous pieces .   .   ."

             Council wrote (Document 45, page 159)     to Eastwood and Partners indicating

             that the radial fences appear to be working satisfactory and also

             outlining the Police views on th6m.     Messrs.   Eastwood and Partners wrote

             back to the County Council on 26th January, 1982 (Document 46, pages

             161-163) accepting the possibility that fans could climb over the radial

             fence, but stating that it would be unacceptable to leave a gap along side

             each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

             a major hazard.   The Police comment on the dangerous pieces of rails is

             noted.


 (    06.    At an Officer Working Party meeting on 4th February, 1982 (Document 47,

             page 164) the Police views on the barriers was again discussed.      It was

             however, agreed that the existing arrangement was, on balance, preferable

             from a safety point of view to prevent crowd surge.      It was agreed to

             review the issue at the end of the current season.


             The 1985 Proposals

     107.    Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 9th April, 1985

             (Document 48, page 167) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate

             visiting teams' supporters as they entered the ground and also to enable

             the Police to control their exit at the end of the game.     A scheme showing

             a possible modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on

             drawing 6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks of

             turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates.'


     108.    The Officer Working Party considered these plans on 18th April

             1985 (Document 49, pages 168-169). They were agreed, subject to a number

             of conditions.


     109.    Particular reference was made by the Working Party to the inclusion of two

             gates in the new central radial fence and a second gate in the radial

             fence dividing the neutral area and home supporters.

   110.      On 30th April, 1985 (Document 50, page 170) the Fire Service wrote to the

             County Council indicating that from a means of escape point of view, the

             scheme was satisfactory, providing the gates had minimum widths as

             indicated on the plan enclosed with the letter.       The Fire Service also

             stated that it was understood that these gates will be supervised either

             by the Police or Club officials.     The County Council on 2nd May

             transmitted its views to Messrs.     Eastwood & Partners by letter.

             (Docuaent 51, pages 171-172).


   Ill.      Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 8th May

             1985 (Docuaent 52, page 173) and indicated that several of the points made

             had already been incorporated into the latest scheme.       Eastwoods say in

             the letter:- ".   .   .   However I would ask that further consideration

             should be given to the request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a

             second gate to be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial

             barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.      If these     gates are

             meant for use in emergency it would mean       having a steward     inattendance on

             each occasion, the expense of which would hardly be justified.          It is our

             view that in the event of emergency, spectators can be evacuated quickly

             enough by the gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit- gates at the

             rear.   We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the Fire

             Officer's staff should you so wish .    .     ."


   112   .   The County Council sent a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (Docuaent

             53, page 174) indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the

             request for two gates per radial fence in the right hand area of the

             Leppings Lane End Terrace, provided that the remainder of the        points

             raised by the Officer Working Party were incorporated.


   113.      Subsequently, Eastwood & Partners submitted a further detailed proposal

             for a revised layout of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th

             July 1985 (Document 54, pages 175-176). Fourteen plans were included in

              the submission and it was considered by a meeting of the Officer Working

             Party on 29th July 1985 (Document 55, pages 177-178). The Working Party

             accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

             were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

             (Document 56, pages 179—180). The comments were made by reference to the

             plans submitted

              (a)   Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

             "(b)   Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                     shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                     outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
  (                  turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                     the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

             "(f)   Plan No.  6705/12 -. . . no objection    in principle, but no barrier
                    height indicated         .";

              (i)   Plan No.  6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

             "(j)   Stewarding of new gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
                    1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised       by
                    stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


      114.   Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (Docunent

             57, pages 181-182) and indicated that it might be easier for discussions

             to take place when the works are under construction.      Eastwoods' letter

             made the following comment on (a) above "We are not sure of the location

             onthe West terrace of the proposed extra security     gate.    There is already

             a gate in the 2m wide gap formed     by the new radial fence for use by the

             police.   This same gate will still be available for the spectators in

             emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace which will

             be under the control of the police.     This point may perhaps be clarified

             during the Working Party's visit on 7th August".      It is also noted in the

             letter that the stewarding would "...     no doubt be taken care of by Mr.

             Chester ...   (the Sheffield Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).     A

             copy of the letter was sent to Mr.     Chester by Eastwoods.

    115.     The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on 7th August 1985

             (Docuaent 58, pages 183-184) and noted the progress of works to segregate

             supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and on the terrace.       The

             note states "On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an

             existing gate in the new 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for

             use by the Police.     This gate would still be available for the use of

             spectators in an emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under

             the control of the Police would enable spectators to be directed down the

             2m wide gap.    However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be

             required.     It was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the

             new South Central Terrace Pen."    The Working Party agreed "(b) that the

             existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended or

             have steps to provide easier access from the new two metre wide gap formed

             by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence

             should be provided from the south central terrace pen".     There are several

             other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


    116.     At a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

             the Officer Working Party on 13th November 1985 (Docuaent 59, page 187)

i            considered the Club's proposals in relation to various projects at the

             stadium.    It was also noted that the Police reported on the continuing

             problems caused by the merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.    The Working Party noted that it was difficult to see how this

             could be overcome as the physical restraints to achieve this could

             conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present situation to

             continue.


    117.     When Eastwoods were notified of these problems by the County Council in a

             letter of 14th November 1985 (Docuaent 60, page 190)    in a response dated

             29th November, 1985 (Docuaent 85, page 268) it was stated that they found

             it very difficult to envisage anything more which could be done at

                reasonable expense, as major work had been undertaken during the last

                close season.


     118.       The Officer Working Party at its inspection of Sheffield Wednesday on 22nd

               January, 1986 (Document 61, page 193) next considered the segregation

               arrangements at the Leppings Lane end.     The Police confirmed that the new

               arrangements worked well on by far the majority of occasions.      Other minor

               matters were referred to in relation to advertising hoardings, spalling

               concrete and the north west terrace.


               Other references to the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium 1980 to 1988

               1980


     119.      On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

               the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

               of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

               pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

               be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.      (Document 62, pages

               194-195).


               1981

 ,   120   .   On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (Document 63, pages

               196-198) to inspect the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.      If was noted that

               the Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the

               concrete at the north west terrace, which would be considered shortly.

               Hie Working Party also heard the Club outline the consideration it was

               giving to the siting of caravans outside the Penistone Road and Leppings

               Lane ends of the ground to sell tickets.      It was hoped that if this took

               place, increased entry flow of spectators to the ground would result by

               reducing delays at the turnstiles.


     121   .   On 7th April, 1981 (Document 35, page 143) the Working Party noted that

               the cracking of the concreting at the north west terrace had been attended

             to by injecting material from the top.       The results had been satisfactory,

             except in two small areas where water seepage had taken place and

             they were to receive further attention.


    122.     The next entry on the file relates to a visit of the Officer Working Party

             to Hillsborough on 8th June, 1981 (Document 64, page 200) at which some

             water seepage was again noted at the north west terrace.       There was also a

             note that the tie bars through the upper level concrete area to the rear

             had been protectively wrapped.


             1982

   123.      The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 24th August, 1982 (Docuaent 65

             pages 201-203) and a letter from Messrs.      Eastwood & Partners of 27th

             August, 1982 (Docuaent 66, page 204) deal with some minor problems which

             did not apparently involve visitor spectators in the concrete at the north

             west terrace.   Similar problems were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at

             a Working Party meeting.    (Document 67, page 206) On 8th September, 1982,

             Eastwoods submitted a certificate relating to their annual inspection of

             the Hillsborough Stadium (Document 68, pages 208-209) and it was noted

             that the two radial fences had been installed on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.


             1983

   124.      The fact that the crush barriers on .the Leppings Lane terrace had been

             tested was noted by the Officer Working Party on 11th August, 1983

             (Docuaent 69, pages 210-213) which testing had completed the first cycle

             of crush barrier testing at the stadium.      There was also mention of water

             seepage again at the north west terrace.      On 29th August, 1983 (Docuaent

             70, pages 214-215).   Dr.   Eastwood copied a letter to the County Council

             confirming the testing of crush barriers at the Leppings Lane End of the

             ground and amongst other things, certified that in his opinion "...      the

             various structures on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and are

                 1984

       125.      Hie former A.R.P.    building adjacent to the boundary wall (near to Gate

                 'C') of the Leppings Lane entrances to the stadium was in the process of

                 being demolished when the Officer Working Party visited the stadium on

                 29th February, 1984 (Document 71, pages 216-217). Once again, water

                 seepage was noted on that day at the north west terrace.      In June, 1984

                 the crush barriers at the north west corner were tested by the Club's

                 Consulting Engineers (Eastwood & Partners) (Docunent 72, page 218 and

                 Document 73, pages 219-228).


        126.     It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

                 stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitchside

                 security fence at the front of the     Leppings Laneterrace, at an Officer

                 Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (Document 74,

                 page 229).   It was also noted that    the wire mesh barriers on the north

                 west terrace had been successfully test loaded.

                 1985

         127 .   There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

                 January, 1985 (Document 75, pages 232-233) about the segregation of home

                 and visiting supporters at the rear of the west stand at certain matches

                 by erecting temporary barriers.     It was noted that it was the policy of

                 the Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting supporters of the west

                 stand and terrace.     The Working Party agreed that the Club would consider

                 a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of the stand subject to the

                 necessary approvals.     It was also noted that the cracked brickwork

                 previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and that the apparent

                 rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should receive

                 appropriate treatment.

      128.   There are no other file references in respectof the Leppings Lane End        of

             the sports ground other than those dealt with       elsewhere in the statement.

             It should also be noted that inspections were       taking place on a

             regular basis throughout this period.


      ..                      Further Comments on the Certificating System

             Further comments

      129.   At the time the current Safety Certificate was       issued, the terms and

             conditions contained therein were those thought by the South Yorkshire
 i                  *
             County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

             necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

             sports ground.     There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

             Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

             State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

             respect of the Certificate Conditions.


      130.   Section 2(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) states that the Safety

             Certificate must have attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions

             shall be framed by reference to it, where appropriate.       Paragraph 5 of the

             General Safety Certificate refers to plans.       Under Schedule 1 of the

             Certificate, the definition of plans is "document or documents attached to*

             and forming part of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the

             person signing the Certificate ...".     When the files were handed over to

             the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety

             Certificate for Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of

             plans, none of which were signed by Mr.       Mallett (the original signatory

             of the Certificate).    The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged

             with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).


     131.    Under Section 3(3) of the 1975 Act applications for Certificates had to be

             copied to the Police and the Building Authority.       Sheffield Wednesday

             applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978 (Docuaent 6, pages

             45-48).   Copies of the application were sent to the Building Authority,

             the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (Document 76, page

             235, Document 77, page 236, Document 78, page 237).     There was no formal

             notice issued by the County Council requiring the Holder to supply further

             information to enable it (the Council) to determine the terms and

             conditions of the Certificate.     The matter was dealt with in lengthy

             correspondence and by consultation.


     132.    The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of
 (
             the 1975 Act (as amended) and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations

             1976, which were superceded on 1st January, 1988 by the Safety of Sports

             Grounds Regulations 1987((Document 3, pages 30-35).


     133.    The 1975 Act (as amended) provides that a local authority may, if it feels

             it appropriate to do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing

             to its holder or replace it.     A Safety Certificate may be amended or

             replaced either with or without the application of the Holder of the

             Certificate.   Section 4(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) indicates that a

             notice under Section 4(1)(a) amending a General Safety Certificate shall

             specify the date on which the amendment to which it relates is to come

             into operation, and the date so specified may be a date later than the

             date of issue of the notice.     The Regulations make further provision with

             regard to the amendment of the Certificates.     Regulation 5 provides that

             where a local authority issues or amends a Certificate it shall as soon as

             practicable give notice in writing of the issue or amendment . . .        to

             every interested party.   In addition, the local authority in giving

             notices must inform the persons to whom notice is given that a c o ^ of the

             Safety Certificate and the application may be inspected and where 'and at

             what time such inspection may be made.     In addition, the local authority

             must publish a notice in a newspaper as soon as maybe after the    \

             decision including certain information.
                                                                                 %t

     134.    On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

             resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

             Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

             Hie amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

             original.   Condition 26 varied the time limits in relation to

             electrical certificates.   There is no evidence from the file that these

             revised conditions were in fact properly brought into effect.


   .135.     At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (Document 79, pages 238-239) the City

             Council s General Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the

             Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.      The Panel agreed

             to amend the Certificate subject to a number of conditions, one of

             which related to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until

             certain works on crush barriers on the new Spion Kop were completed.       This

             condition related to two matches.   The amendment to the Certificate only

             affected the capacity at the Spion Kop end of the ground.     The Inquiry has

             prompted a review of this amendment and it transpires that no notice was

             inserted in a newspaper in connection with this amendment.     The Panel's

             deliberations attracted considerable publicity and copy of a report in the

             'Star' newspaper of Friday, 22nd August, 1986, is attached to this

             Statement (Document 80, page 240). Additionally, the General Safety

             Certificate is regarded as a public document and therefore the spirit of

             the legislation has been met.


    136.     On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel resolved (Document 81,

             page 241) to amend Schedule 1 of the Certificate so as to extend the

             definition of specified activity to include Royal visits.     Again, the

             notice provisions of the legislation were not observed.


    137.     Under Section 5 of the 1975 Act (as amended) interested parties may appeal

             against or about the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -43-


              Council's refusal to amend or replace it.    According to the files, there

              have been no appeals.


      138.   Under Section 8 of the 1975 Act (as amended), the Certificate Holder must

              give notice to the Council if he intends to alter or extend the sports

             ground or any of its     installations (if.that alteration or extension is

              likely to affect the    safety of persons at the ground).   To the best of my

             knowledge, this Section has been complied with by Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club; the developments which have taken place have been the

             subject of lengthy correspondence in each case.
 (.



      139.   The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice

             under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

             spectator safety.   No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

             Sheffield Wednesday.


      140.   It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange

             for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months.      At its

             meeting on 7th September, 1987 (Document 26, pages 128-130)     the General

             Purposes Panel noted the details contained in a report by the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department about the operation of the Council's

             certification function for the safety of sports grounds.     One of the

             details mentioned in the report relates to inspections and the proposal

             that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out.        In

             fact the report itself does not make clear my intention that these

             inspections should be annual.    My intention at the time, and the Council's

             practice since has been to arrange annual inspections of sports grounds.

             The report goes on to indicate that these inspections would be backed up

             by a series of "during event" inspections which proposal was in line with

             both the Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.         I

             am aware that the Fire Service visit the sports ground during events and

             of course the Police are present during most specified activities.


HB5AAC/JJJ
The Safety Certificate

Under Condition 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee must

be approved in writing by the Council.


Currently, the nominee is the Club Secretary.    On the 15th October, 1987 >

the City Council wrote (Document 33, page 140) to Sheffield-Wednesday

pointing out various provisions of the new Green Guide and making

particular reference to the appointment of a Safety Officer as defined in

Chapter 2 of'the Guide.    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic responded

to this letter on 23rd October (Document 34, page 141) and confirmed that

Mr.   Mackrel1's duties encompassed those of the Safety Officer and

requesting that the Council's records be amended to note that he is

responsible for all matters of safety within the ground.


Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

and maintain at the sports ground, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

suitably equipped first aid room.   The first aid room was installed and

noted by the Officer Working Party to be in use on 21st February, 1983

(Document 67, page 207).   The question of first aid facilities was raised

and discussed during 1987 and 1988 (Document 28, page 134 and Document 82,

pages 243-244).

Sheffield Wednesday - The Up to Date Position

On Wednesday, 10th May, 1989 the pre-planned annual inspection of the

ground commenced involving Police Officers, Fire Officers and Council

Officers from the Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building

Surveyor's Division and the Administration and Legal Department.    Detailed

enquiries are being made of Sheffield Wednesday pursuant to the

inspection.

                                       FURTHER GENERAL COMMENTS


             General Safety Certificate Conditions

   145.      A copy of the Safety Certificate and the Conditions which form part of it

             is attached to this Statement (Document 19, pages 103-112).      There are

             some 31 terms and conditions contained in Schedule 2 to the Certificate.

             The Holder is required to comply with various terms and conditions

             to the satisfaction of the Council, the Fire Officer or the Chief

             Constable as provided for in the particular condition.     Generally, for

             monitoring the ground the Council relies on annual inspections, during

             activity inspections and being notified by, for example, the Club of any

             proposed development or the Police (as they are present during most

             specified activities) of any matter which causes them concern.     In

             addition, following the Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Document 4, pages

             36-43) the Council would (where practicable) obtain copies of relevant

             certificates of testing, etc.   on annual inspection.    I set out below my

             comments on certain of the conditions.


             Condition 3

   146.      This condition relates to the number of spectators who may be admitted to

             the various areas of the Stadium.   These restrictions on the numbers of

             spectators admitted to the Stadium are also referred to as capacities.


   147.      At the 1989 inspection a sample of the turnstile records was obtained.        It

             is understood that these records are available from the Club for past

             events.   There is reference on the file to individuals obtaining access to

             the ground with forged tickets (Document 38, page 148) and reference to

             numbers of people with tickets for the "opposing" end of the ground being

             removed to "their" end of the ground (Document 38, pages 147-148).      There

             is no evidence on file to suggest that the Club deliberately allow more

             people into the ground than is provided for in the certificate.

             Paragraphs 27-29, 31, 34 and 95 of my Statement refer to capacity on the


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -46-


             Leppings Lane Terrace and there are other references to capacities on the

             Spion Kop.    There have been no amendments to spectator capacities in

             respect of any part of the ground since the Spion Kop development in

             1986.


   148.      Questions have been raised about the adjustment to capacities in relation

             to the alterations to the Directors' Box in the South Stand and also in

             relation to the incorporation of facilities for people with disabilities

             in the North Stand.     There is no reference on file about any changes to

             the Directors' Box on the South Stand.     At no time during the discussions

             in relation to the new facilities for the disabled was any mention made of

             changes in capacity for the north stand.      Had the question of capacity

             been an issue I would have expected the Advisory Group members to raise

             it.


             Condition 8

   149.      This Condition relates to first aid facilities and associated matters.


   150.      The County Council, in 1979, approached the Area Health Authority for

             advice on first aid facilities at Sheffield Wednesday.      The Area Health

             Authority responded on 31st May, 1979 (Document 87, pages 271-273) with a

             list of requirements.    References are made in the list to two or three

             treatment couches; six stretchers, two sets of stretcher wheels, 20

             blankets, six pillows and one "minute man" resuscitator.     Other comments

             are made about water requirements, lighting, etc.     On 15th August, 1979

             (Document 16, pages 93-95) the Officer Working Party requested the Club to

             provide a permanent first aid structure during the 1980 close season,

             subject to the Club agreeing to provide the recommended first aid

             equipment immediately.


   151.      On 21st December, 1979 (Document 88, page 274) the County Council wrote to

             Sheffield Wednesday indicating that the existing first aid facilities were

             accepted on an interim basis only pending the erection of purpose built

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                      -47-


               fa cilites in the 1980 close season.   On 20th April, 1982 (Document 89,

              pages 276-277) the County Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday following

              an Officer Working Party meeting at which the Club's outline drawing for

              new Police and first aid facilities was considered.     As far as the first

              aid facilities were concerned, four comments were made in particular:-

                (a)   The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                      non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to
                      be redecorated.

                (b)   Lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretchers, etc. were to be
                      provided.

                (c)   A telephone point was to be provided in the first aid room.

                (d)   The floor was to be of easily cleanable material (such as quarry
                      tiles, etc.)


   152.       The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 21st February, 1983

              (Document 67, page 207) noted that the new Police and first aid facilities

              under the north stand had been welcomed by the users and were proving to

              be most useful.


   153.       Following the interim Popplewell report, the County Council wrote to

              Sheffield Wednesday on 9th August, 1985 (Document 31, page 138) and drew

              attention to the necessity of providing adequate first aid and first aid

              room facilities.   Attention was also drawn to Condition 8 of the Safety

              Certificate.   In December, 1987 (Document 90, page 278 and Document 28,

              page 134) the City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday in response to the

              annual inspection which took place on 6th August, 1987.     It was noted on a

              schedule attached to the notification letter to Sheffield Wednesday that

               The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate first aid

              equipment for the treatment of spectators .    .   ." It was also mentioned

              that the provision of qualified first aiders was being reviewed and the

              views of the Club on this subject were sought.


   154.       In a letter dated 15th January, 1988 (Document 82, pages 243-244) Messrs.

              Eastwood & Partners responded to the Council's comments and noted the


HB5AAC/JJJ'
                                                  -48-


             views expressed on first aid equipment.     They went on to say that the Club

             regularly liaise with St.   John Ambulance about manning levels and a

             sufficient number of first aiders is provided for each game in line with

             the recommendations given by the football league.


   155.      The Green Guide deals with the question of first aid in paragraph 29

             (Management Responsibility).   Paragraph (x) is "to provide first aid

             facilities and first aid staff".


             Paragraphs 50 and 143 of my Statement also refer to first aid facilities.


             Condition 8(2) requires that during every specified activity a doctor

             shall be available to attend at the first aid room if required.


             Condition 8(3) relates to the number of first aid assistants required to

             be in attendance at specified activities and the condition states that

             there must be one first aid assistant for every 2,000 spectators.    Neither

             the County Council nor the City Council have varied that ratio.


             Condition 9

   156.      This condition relates to stewarding and makes particular reference to

             fitness and capability to carry out their duties, training and

             instruction, identifiable dress and written instructions as to their

             general duties.


             A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities of safety stewards

             was handed to Club representatives on 10th April, 1980 at a meeting of the

             Officer Working Party (Document 98, page 302).


             At a meeting of the Officer Working Party on 13th November, 1985 (Document

             59, page 187) it was agreed that a draft booklet which had been prepared

             by the Police outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and

             that it should be distributed to designated grounds for the information

             and guidance of stewards employed there.    Factors peculiar to particular


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                      -49-


             grounds could of course be added if considered appropriate..

             Unfortunately, there is no copy of the booklet ((which is i d e n t i f i a b l e ^

             such) on the file.     The Police and the Fire Service are involved in annual

             briefing exercises for stewards and in addition there are tests of the

             emergency procedures which include the stewards duties.          I also understand

             that there are pre-match briefings of stewards.         There are two emergency

             evacuation procedure drills particularly referred to on the files; the

             first being mentioned at Paragraph 43 of my Statement.          This relates to a

             test on 4th October, 1983 by the Fire Service.         The Fire Service stated

             that     . . the stewards they questioned would have known what to do if

             this message had been heard . . ." (Document 21, page 118).


   157.      On 14th November, 1987 (Document 99, pages 305-306) the Police instigated

             a trial of the emergency evacuation procedure during a match and found

             there to be some deficiencies in the Public Address System which were

             subsequently reported to the Club.       Again, there is no comment that the

             stewards' responses were in any way inadequate.


   158.      Paragraphs 43, 91, 92, 111, 113, 114, 171 and 191 of my Statement refer to

             stewarding.    There has been no concern recently expressed about stewarding

             at the Leppings Lane end of the sports ground, but the Building Surveyor

             did comment on the Spion Kop stewarding in a memorandum dated 2nd

             February, 1988 which was considered by the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Advisory Group on 23rd March, 1988.       It was indicated by the Police

             Representative at that meeting that the point had been taken up with

             Sheffield Wednesday.    Some records of steward training were produced at

             the 1989 inspection of the ground and further details are being obtained.


             Condition 10

   159.      Condition 10 refers to the immediate and easy opening of final exit

             doors/gates, the manning of those doors/ gates by stewards and the opening

             of them at appropriate times.      The Police determine which doors/gates are

             opened/closed on match days and no complaints have been received from the

             Police or the Fire Service about this procedure.    Neither have there been

             complaints about the manning of doors/gates by stewards.    The final exit

             gates are subject to at least annual inspection by the Fire Service and

             occasionally by the Building Surveyor.    Other references in my Statement

             to the type of items covered by Condition 10 can be found at paragraphs

             43, 92, 103, 110 and 134.



             Condition 11(4)

             This Condition refers to the maintenance of all means of ingress to and

             egress from the sports ground in good condition and free from obstruction.

             Generally these routes are checked both on annual inspection and during

             specified activities by the appropriate Advisory Group members.


             Condition 15(1)

             This Condition relates to the structural parts of the sports ground which

             are required to be maintained in sound order and to the appropriate and

             relevant standards in the Guide, and in all cases to the satisfaction of

             the Council.


             Presumably when the County Council issued the Safety Certificate to

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd in December, 1979 it was satisfied

             (subject to compliance with certain conditions) that this ground was

             reasonably safe (Document 14, page 85).


             Various structural parts of the sports ground are also checked on

             inspection. It should be borne in mind that full structural surveys of

             buildings at the sports ground is rarely practicable in view of their

             considerable size.   Separate consideration is, of course, given to

             structural alterations at each sports ground as and when they are

             proposed.

    162.      Ify Statement refers at some considerable length to structural matters.


    163.      As far as the Leppings Lane Terrace is concerned, it was subject to a

             visual inspection by the Building Surveyor on the 1988 inspection.       The

              tunnel (connecting the Leppings Lane Terrace and the open area at the

             back of the West Stand) and the ^turnsti 1^-^fall were inspected at that         ^

             time.


             Condition 16

   164.      This Condition covers the maintenance of emergency equipment and the

             maintenance, repair or renewal of any items within the Stadium as may from

             time to time be necessary.   There is also a requirement to maintain the

             operational parts of the Stadium in good and efficient working order.        The

             matters covered by this Condition are generally dealt with on annual

             inspections and by during event visits where appropriate.


             Condition 18(2)

   165.      Emergency vehicle access routes are covered by this Condition.        The Fire

             Service has commented on 16th May, 1979 (Document 13, page 84) that

             adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct access

             can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of the

             stadium.   They also mentioned that it was necessary to ensure that parked

             vehicles would not obstruct this access.     I understand from this

             letter that the Fire Service only require vehicular access to the exterior

             of each building in the football ground.     The emergency access routes are

             shown on plan 1610/11A.   The Officer Working Party at a meeting on 12th

             November, 1979 (Document 18, page 101) agreed that whilst no real problems

             had occurred in the past the Club would in consultation with the Fire

             Service and the Police mark out a lane from the main gates to the sotjth

             stand in which parking would not be allowed.    It was also agreed that the

             hydrant outside the south stand would have to be kept clear.    The Police

             noted on 26th March, 1980 (Document 84, page 264) that they did not j|ave


HB5AAC/JJJ

             any current problems in respect of the access for emergency vehicles.

             Access for ambulances is referred to at Document 87, page 273 and Document

             86,   page 269.   The reference in Document 86 is set out in greater detail

             below.


    166.     During the planning stage for the redevelopment of the kop, the Club

             offered (letter from Eastwoods 29th November, 1985 - Document 85, page

             268) to widen the gangway between the North Stand and the retaining wall

             of the kop to enable fire engines to get to the front of all stands.     The

             Fire Service responded to this at an Officer Working Party meeting (22nd

             January, 1986 - Document 61, page 193) by saying that whilst they felt

             that such a facility was not essential for their purposes it could be

             useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain situations and generally

             should be supported.     In a letter from Eastwoods dated 18th December, 1986

             (Document 86, pages 269—270) proposals were submitted for creating a new

             entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone Road so that the public would no

             longer have to use gate 'O', (Plan numbers 7593/1 and 2).    Another purpose

             of the development was to provide separate access for Police vehicles,

             ambulances, etc.    on match days; the proposal effectively reduced dangers

I            which could result from vehicles having to pass queueing spectators to
             gate
             'O'.  This development did take place.


    167.     It is the responsibility of the Club to maintain these access routes, free

             of obstruction, and the emergency services have never indicated that there

             have been problems with them.    I would expect the Police (who are present

             during the majority of specified activities) to make appropriate comments

             should the need arise.


             I understand that meetings have taken place between the Police, the Fire

             Service and the Ambulance Service on the emergency evacuation procedures

             at Sheffield Wednesday.    I assume those discussions dealt with the




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                        -53-


                 emergency access of vehicles to the sports ground.     The City Council has

                 had no direct contact with the Ambulance Service on this matter.


                 Condition 24

     168.        This Condition relates to the engineers' annual inspection of the sports

                 ground.     There is no record of any copies of Certificates being submitted

                 in 1984-1987, but a copy of the 1988 Certificate (dated 2nd August 1988 -

                 Document 100, page 307) was submitted on 10th May, 1989.     Previous

                 Certificates were submitted for 1980 to 1983 - see Document 68, pages

                 208-209 and Document 70, pages 214-215 for examples.

 V
                 Condition 28

     169.        This Condition prescribes the various records which need to be kept by the

                 Holder and produced to authorised officers on request.     The records kept

                 under Condition 28(1),(2) and (3) were checked on 10th May, 1989 and

                 subsequent enquiries about them are being made.     The checking of records

                 under Condition 28(4) is not practicable^     due to the wide ranging scope

                 of the condition.    However, all major work is inspected through specific

                 applications or inspections.

                 THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE
                 WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO PENS 3 AND 4

     170.        In the earlier part of my statement (see paragraphs 101-118) I refer to

                 the full history of discussions and decisions between the interested

                 parties (the Police, Fire Service, the Building Authority and the Club,

                 and its Consulting Engineers) leading up to and following the installation

                 of the radial fences on the Leppings Lane terrace.     It will be recalled

                 that the installation of fences took place in two distinct stages in 1981

                 and 1985.    In relation to the 1981 proposals it is clear from the

                 correspondence on file, which is' particularly referred to in my statement,

                 that the fences were erected only after careful and thorough consideration

                 by the appropriately qualified experts.




HRSAAr./.T.T.T

      171.   In early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs.

             Eastwoods & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end

             of the ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.   The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace involved the better control of supporters.     Once again, full and

             careful consideration was given to the proposals by the County Council

             involving the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club

             and its Consulting Engineers.     Full details of the discussions dealing

             with the positioning, width and proposed stewarding of the gates in the

             radial fences are related in the earlier part of my statement.
 I\

      172.   As far as the Green Guide is concerned, paragraphs 101 to 103 (in

             Chapter 8) refer to the division of spectator accommodation.     These

             paragraphs of the Guide are drafted in general terms.     There is no

             evidence on the file to suggest that the penning arrangements at Leppings

             Lane conflict with the general statements contained in the Guide.

             Obviously, the pens were constructed over a number of years, and were

             installed and approved in that situation by all the interested parties I

             have already listed.


             Crush Barriers on the Leppings Lane Terrace
             Layout

      173.   The layout of the barriers was approved when the Certificate was issued on

             21st December, 1979.   The barrier layout must have been reviewed when the

             radial fences were installed in 1981 and 1985.


      174.   On 7th August, 1986, the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was subject

             to an annual inspection.     During the course of this annual inspection I

             recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number
     Vr
             144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

             would not be obstructed by it.    Apparently, there had been some

 \
             difficulties in this area.     The barrier itself penetrated the central

      V'

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -55-


              radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.    The barrier was indeed

              reduced with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

              that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).    This issue was

             considered at the time of the inspection in the presence of

              representatives from the Fire Authority, the Police, the Building

             Authority and Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners, the Club's Consulting

             Engineers.    No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

             brought to my attention.


     175.    I should, however, point out that no written record of the decision to

 (           reduce the barrier is noted on the file.     I can, however, say that I

             remember the discussion and that none of the persons present objected to

              the reduction of the barrier.


             Strength

     176.    As far as the strength of the barriers is    concerned, they were tested

             by Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners on 14th, 15th, 18th and 19th July, 1988

             and the report (Document 83, pages 246-249) is attached to this statement.

             There were one or two defects discovered on the test which are noted in

             Eastwoods' letter which were remedied during 1988.     The barriers had also

 i           been tested in 1979 and 1983.


             Height

     177.    Prior to certification, it was brought to    the attention of the Working

             Party (Document 9, page 66) that many of the barriers were below the

             height recommended in the Guide.    Ibis was brought to the attention of the

             Club at a meeting on 2nd April, 1979 (Document 10, page 71), and was the

             subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building

             Surveyor.    As the ground was subsequently certificated by the County

             Council without requiring all the crush barriers to be replaced, I

             conclude that the Guide was applied flexibly as advised by the Home Office

             and that the Council were satisfied that the ground was reasonably safe.


HB5AAC/JJJ

             The Access Tunnel to the Leppings Lane Terrace

   178.      This tunnelwhich runs beneath the west terrace    is not   of a constant

             gradient and at the end increases to a gradient of 1:6     on the approach to

             the terrace itself.


   179.      Ihe files in my possession indicate that there have been no

             discussions about the tunnel itself.     No complaints have been received

             about the tunnel.     As far as I am aware there have been no problems with

             the tunnel and as it has been used for many years by many thousands of

             spectators without apparent difficulty or incident.


             The Wall at   theLeppings Lane Turnstiles

   180.      The wall at   the turnstiles is approximately 14' high from ground level to

             the coping stones and should prevent persons climbing into the ground in

             the majority of circumstances.


             Prohibition Notices in respect of Sheffield Wednesday

   181.      No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday as there was no indication that there was a serious risk to

             spectators warranting such action.     The Inquiry will be aware that since

             the tragic events at Hillsborough the Leppings Lane end of the ground has

             been largely closed and certainly no spectators have been admitted to the

             terrace or to the west stand.


   182.      On 25th April, 1989 a meeting was held between the Club and the various

             officers and it was agreed that the next two football matches would be

             postponed as the Leppings Lane end of the ground was closed which

             prevented the efficient segregation of spectators and emergency

             evacuation.   It was agreed that reserve matches could go ahead as they

             have a limited number of spectators.


   183.      On 2nd May, 1989 there was a meeting held to discuss future games and

             on 4th May, various officers visited the sports ground to look at the


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -57-


             proposed plans for segregation, admission and evacuation of spectators

             for football matches.    It was agreed th^t matches could go ahead using

             part of the Leppings Lane end, but not the terraces or the stand.       The

             Leppings Lane end remains closed and will not be used for the time being.

             If it appears necessary to do so, the Council will consider issuing a

             Prohibition Notice to prevent the opening of the west terrace prior to the

             interim report of the Inquiry, as extra works required at the ground may

             then be determined.


             The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987

    84.      Following the commencement of the Act, the existing delegations, etc.

             were felt to be sufficient and the matter was fully reviewed in a report

             to the General Purposes Panel in January, 1989.      The various delegations

             were then restated as far as it was necessary to do so.      On receipt of

             Home Office Circulars 71/1987 (Document 2, pages 17-29) and 72/1987

             (Document 4, pages 36-43) were circulated to all members of the Advisory

             Group.


             The Safety Certificate

   185.      The original 1979 Certificate is still in force in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday.   Amendments to it are dealt with by letter and do not as such

             feature in the body of the Certificate.      Amendments to the Safety

             Certificate are dealt with in paragraphs 133-136 of my Statement.


             Directional Signs in relation to access to the ground

   186.      There has been criticism about the adequacy of directional signs within

             the sports ground which would direct people to pens other than the two

             central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace.      The point has been made that

             fans entering through turnstiles A to G or Gate C could only see the

             tunnel which leads to the two central pens and no other signs.      There is

             in fact one small directional sign to the right of the west stand which

             says "standing".



HB5AAC/JJJ
   187.      It is appropriate to point out that spectator flow on match days is a

             matter on which the Council would need to take advice, from the

             Club and members of the Advisory Group.     There is no record on any of the

             files that there was any suggestion of inadequacy in signing arrangements

             for the terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a significant factor I

             would have expected that the matter would have been raised.     The provision

             of signing is not usually a complex or expensive task.


             Means of egress onto the pitch from Leppings Lane Terrace

   188.      There is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter

             fence at Hillsborough was in fact installed, but it appears to have been

             in place when the County Council first looked at the sports ground from

             the point of view of a Certificating Authority.


   189.      According to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were

             considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development plan was

             submitted.     It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

             its representatives that one pitch perimeter fence gate was to be provided

             per pen.     (Document 49, pages 168-169, Document 55, pages 177-178 and

             Document 58, pages 183-185).


   190.      There is no information on the files relating to whether or not the

             pitch perimeter gates should be signed.


   191.      The means of access laterally between the pens on the Leppings Lane

             terrace are the gates at the top of each radial fence immediately adjacent

             to the west stand wall.    The gates are designed so that when they are

             open a clear 1.15 metre opening remains.    Manning of gates is dealt with

             in Document 50, page 170, Document 51, pages 171-172, Document 52,

             page 173, Document 53, page 174, Document 55, pages 177-178, Document 56,

             pages 179-180, Document 57, pages 181-182 and Document 58, pages 183-185.

   192.      There are no gangways as defined by the Guide on the Leppings Lane

             Terrace.   Annex 'A' of the Green Guide defines gangways as being channels

             for the passage of spectators through a terrace running across the slope

             (lateral gangway) or running with the slope (radial gangway).   Paragraph

             96 of the Guide indicates that the aim should be to ensure that every

             spectator on the terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that

             they can move quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the

             event of an emergency.


   193.      All the proposed major alterations to the terraces have been considered by

             the Working Party and therefore subject to full and careful consideration

             by the interested parties.

       FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987:-
       IMPLEMENTATION OF PART II (SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS)
       Introduction
       1.    As foreshadowed by HOC No 42/1987 the Secretary of State has
       now made a commencement order under section 50(2) of the Fire
       Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act)
       bringing in Part II of the 1987 Act with effect from 1 January
       1988.

       2.   This circular, together with Annex A, introduces the
       provisions of Part II of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the
       effects and operation of them. Advice on those provisions of
       Part I of the 1987 Act (fire safety) which are to be brought into
       force by the first commencement order is the subject of Fire
       Precautions Act Circular, 14/1987.
                                   *

       Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Grounds)
       3.   Part II of the 1987 Act, consisting of sections 19 - 25,
       emends the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) in
       line with the Government's proposals contained in the
       Consultative Document published in June 1986 in response to the
       safety recommendations of the Popplewell Inquiry set up following
       the fire tragedy at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985. The*, main
       changes effected by Part II are as follows;-
      Section 19:- removes the distinction between sports "ground" and
      sports "stadium" with consequential modifications to section 2(2)
      of the 1975 Act dealing with the contents of safety certificates.

      Section 20:- empowers the Secretary of State to vary the
      designation threshold of 10,000 under section 1 of the 1975 Act.

                                                              i




                                   0
 Section 21:- precludes'conditions in safety certificates
 relating to police presence unless the extent of the presence is
 reserved for the Chief Officer of Police.


 Section 22:-    directs appeals Under section 5 of the 1975 Act to
 the courts.

  Sections 23 and 24:- replaces the existing emergency procedure
:junder section 10 by introducing prohibition notices in the case
  or serious risks to spectators; and provision to appeal against
 u IIG   III •


 Section 25:- places a duty on local authorities to enforce the
 1975 Act and to arrange for annual inspections of designated
 sports grounds in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of

 4.   Annexes A and B to Home Office circular No 7/1986 which
 gives advice on the 1975 Act should be noted as necessary and
 cross referenced to this circular. Particular attention is drawn
        latest guidance on the new procedure for the issue of
 prohibition notices to deal with serious risks to spectators.
 Local authorities are asked to copy all such notices to the Home
 Office for information until further notice. To assist local
 authorities to draw up a prohibition notice a suggested format is
 reproduced at Annex B to this circular.

5.   A copy of the revised regulations is also enclosed with this
circular. The regulations reflect the changes brought about by
sections 22 and 24 of the 1987 Act and lay down time limits for
    f •* Provisions on procedures for applications for safety
certificates, their issue, amendment, transfer and replacement
are incorporated in the regulations which also authorise the
determination of fees to be charged in respect of applications
for the issue, amendment, transfer and replacement of safetv
certificates.
Transitional

6.   Under the provisions of.Schedule 5 of the 1987 Act any
existing court order made under section 10 of the 1975 Act
remains in force. Similarly any appeal lodged prior to l January
1988 and still extant on that date will remain subject to the
appeal procedures of the Safety of Sportr, Grounds Regulations
1976 (SI 1976/1263).                                 *


Resource and manpower implications

7.   The contents of this circular do not result in any cost or
manpower implications other than those arising from the
inspections to be carried out on designated sports grounds under
section 10B(1) as introduced by section 25 of the 1987 Act.
Circulation of Statutory Guidance under section 10B(2) of the
1975 Act on these inspections together with any supplementary
advice is being done separately and will cover, as necessary, any
resource implications arising therefrom.

Supplementary
8.   The information and advice in this circular and in Annex A
on the 1987 Act are given in good faith but it should be
understood that ultimately only the courts can rule
authoritatively on points of law.
9.   Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should be
directed to Mr D Macnamara 01-213 7338.

ANNEX A TO HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 71/1987
FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987
Advice note by the Heme Office on Part II of The Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (The 1987 Act) amending The
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (The 1975 Act)
Introduction
1.   The general background to the 1975 Act together with a
summary of local authority powers and functions under that Act,
and procedures for the issue of safety certificates is set out in
Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986 issued 7 February
1986 (taken from earlier Home Office circulars 150/1975, 130/1976
and 187/1976). This guidance should therefore be read in
conjunction with Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986
which will need to be cross-referenced.
2.   The Popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at
Valley Parade concluded that the 1975 Act had worked
satisfactorily at designated grounds but recommended changes to
improve its operation. The Government's response was contained
in a consultative document published in June 1986. Parts II and
III of the 1987 Act implement these proposals and introduction of
Part II as from 1 January 1988 is the first phase of this
implementation.
3.   The main mechanism for securing safety at sports grounds
remains the safety certificate. Guidance on safety standards is
contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green
Guide) revised in October 1986. Local authorities are reminded
of the advice contained in paragraph 5 of Annex B to Home Office
Circular 7/1986 highlighting the need to maintain flexibility in
order to take account of the different circumstances at
individual grounds.
SUBSTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS EFFECTED BY PART II OF THE 1987 ACT
Section 19: Application of the 1975 Act to all sports grounds
4.   Section 19, together with the textual amendments of Schedule
2 to the 1987 Act removes the distinction in the 1975 Act between
a sports "ground" and a sports "stadium". As amended the
provisions of the 1975 Act apply to all sports grounds as defined
in section 17(1) of that Act. The Secretary of State may thus
designate any category of sports groind witheut first having to
make an order extending the provisions of the Act to that
particular class of ground.
5.   In consequence of this wider power, section 2 of the 1975
Act (originally formulated with "stadia" in mind, particularly
football stadia) has also had to be amended, by section 19 (2) of
the 1987 Act, so that safety certificates are no longer required
to contain certain obligatory terms and conditions. The
Secretary of State is however empowered to stipulate by order the
contents of a safety certificate for any class of sports ground.

    an order made by a Magistrates Court on determining a complaint.
    Such an appeal may be made by the local authority or by any
    "interested party” as defined in section 5 of the 1975 Act.
    11. Subsections (4), (6), (7) and (8) of section 5 are repealed
    in consequence of the removal of the Secretary of State's
    functions in respect of appeals. However the Secretary of State
    is given the power to prescribe by regulation the time within
    which appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act are to be brought.
    These regulations will also come into effect as from 1 January
    1988. There is however transitional provision contained in
    paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act to preserve the
    existing appeal procedures/powers in respect of appeals made to
;   the Secretary of State before 1 January 1988 and which are still
    extant on that date.
    12. Section 22(8) of the 1987 Act makes a number of
    consequential amendments to section 7 of the 1975 Act
    (determinations and appeals/supplementary). Subsection (8)(a)
    amends section 7(1) of the 1975 Act so that it provides for an
    application to be deemed to be withdrawn if the local authority
    serve a notice under section 5(1) that an applicant is not
    qualified for the issue of a certificate, once the time limit for
    an appeal has expired. It also removes from the 1975 Act section
    7(1)(b) which misleadingly implies that the local authority can
    determine without an application having been made that an
    existing holder of a safety certificate no longer qualifies to
    hold it.   Subsection (8)(b) amends section 7(2) to make
    provision to suspend the effect of the local authority decision
    that an applicant is not a qualified person if an appeal is made
    in the prescribed time limits. This suspension has effect until
    the appeal is either withdrawn or determined by the court in
    favour of the authority. Subsection 8(c) amends section 7(3) of
    the 1975 Act and subsection (8)(d) repeals the provision in
    section 7 of the 1975 Act by which a court could, on the
    application of the local authority, give immediate effect to a
    term or condition of a safety certificate which had been
    suspended as a result of an appeal.
    Section 23s Special procedure in case of serious risk -
    prohibition notices: and
    Section 24: Prohibition Notices: appeals
    13. Section 23 of the 1987 Act replaces the existing section 10
    of the 1975 Act with provision for a system of prohibition
    notices. Section 24 of the 1987 Act provides for appeals against
    a prohibition notice.
    14. A prohibition notice may be served in respect of any sports
    ground as defined in section 17(1) of the 1975 Act or part of
    such a sports ground. The criteria for issuing a prohibition
    notice are set out in the new section 10(1) and local authorities
    should not feel inhibited from using the new powers when
    necessary. These powers are nonetheless potentially far reaching
    (see also paragraph 20 below) and local authorities are therefore
    asked to ensure that they are used with due discretion. In
    practice, the considerations leading to the issuing of a
    prohibition notice are likely to be comparable to those which now

suspend the operation'of the notice or of any amendment to it
(section 10A(6)) so, particularly if the notice is to apply to a
"one-off» fixture, it is important that it is served, wherever
possible, well in advance so as to enable the recipient to
exercise effectively his right of appeal. The appeal procedure
is by way of complaint to a Magistrates Court. On appeal the
court may cancel the notice or affirm the notice, either in its
original form or as amended, or with such modifications as the
court thinks fit. There is provision for a further right of
appeal to the Crown Court against the decision of the Magistrates
Court. Persons entitled to make such an appeal are listed in new
section 10A(7). "An aggrieved person" referred to-in sub-section
(7)(a) is defined in sub-section (9).

Section 25:   Enforcement : Inspections and offence of obstruction
21. Section 25(1) of the 1987 Act adds a new section 10B to the
1975 Act which provides for local authorities to enforce the
Act's provisions and, for that purpose, to arrange for the
inspection of designated grounds at least once every twelve
months in accordance with any guidance from the Secretary of
State.

22. Section 25(2) updates section 12(6)(d) of the 1975 Act by
amending the term "wilfully" to "intentionally".

NOTES
Offences

1.    Contravention of any prohibition notice or restriction
imposed by a prohibition notice is an offence provided by section
12(1)(e) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act)
as amended by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987 (the 1987 Act) and renders the offender liable, on summary
conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum
(currently £2,000) or, on conviction on indictment, to an
unlimited fine, or imprisonment for not more than two years, or
both.
2.   Where any person is charged with an offence under section
12(1)(e) of the 1975 Act it shall be a defence to prove
(a)   that the admission of spectators in contravention of the
      notice was without his consent? and
(b)   that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all
      due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence by
      himself or any other person under his control.
3.   Section 12(7) of the 1975 Act provides that where an offence
under that Act which has been committed by a body corporate is
proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of,
or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, a director,
manager, secretary or other similar.officer of the body
corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such
capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of
that offence and be liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly.
4.   Where the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its
members, section 12(7) of the 1975 Act shall apply in relation to
the acts, and defaults of a member in connection with his
functions of management as if he were a director of the body
corporate.
5.   The validity of a prohibition notice served on any person
shall not be affected by a failure to serve another person
required to be served with such a notice.

Appeals

6.    Your attention is drawn to the provision for appeal to a
magistrates' court against this notice in section 10A of the 1975

                                                     EXPLANATORY NOTE
                                            (This note is not part o f the Regulations)
   These Regulations, which apply throughout Great Britain (except the Isles of Scilly),
 replace the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 (“ the 1976 Regulations”) and the
 Safety of Sports Grounds (Amendment) Regulations 1986 (which apply in England and
 Wales, except the Isles of Scilly) and the Safety of Sports Grounds (Scotland) Regulations
 1976 (“ the 1976 Scottish Regulations ”).
   Regulations 8 to 13ofthe 1976 Regulations and regulations 9 and lOofthe 1976 Scottish
 Regulations made provision for the procedure for appeals to the Secretary of State in
 respect of safety certificates under section 5 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (“ the
 1975 A ct”). When the amendments made by section 22 of the Fire Safety and Safety of
 Places of Sport Act 1987 (“ the 1987 Act ”) come into force, those appeals will be made to
 magistrates’ courts in England and Wales and by summary application in Scotland and
 regulations 8 to 13 of the 1976 Regulations and regulations 9 and 10 of the 1976 Scottish
 Regulations will no longer be necessary. By virtue of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places
 of Sport Act 1987 (Commencement No. 1) Order 1987 (S.1.1987/1762), Part II of the 1987
 Act (in which section 22 is contained) comes into force on 1st January 1988, the same date

                                                                                  5
as the coming into force of these Regulations. Accordingly, these Regulations no longer
include provision corresponding to regulations 8 to 13 of the 1976 Regulations and
regulations 9 and 10 of the 1976 Scottish Regulations (the enabling power for which is, in
any event, replaced by section 22 (7) of the 1987 Act) but provide instead (in regulation 6)
for the time within which an appeal must be brought before a magistrates’ court in England
and Wales or by summary application in Scotland.
  These Regulations also differ from the 1976 Regulations and the 1976 Scottish
Regulations in that they no longer prescribe a minimum time before the event for which
the application is made for the submission o f an application for a special safety certificate.
They also do not require the local authority to have made decisions in respect o f such
applications by specified periods.
  Regulation 5 of these Regulations requires certain notices to be given to interested
parties (as defined) and a newspaper notice to be published. Regulation 8 of these
Regulations differs from regulation 14 of the 1976 Regulations and regulation 11 of the
1976 Scottish Regulations in that it allows local authorities to charge fees in respect of
applications for the replacement and transfer of safety certificates as well as for
applications for their issue and amendment.
  These Regulations also differ from the 1976 Regulations (as amended) and the 1976
Scottish Regulations in that they refer only to sports grounds and not to sports stadia in
consequence o f the amendments made to the 1975 Act by section 19 of, and Schedule 2 to,
the 1987 Act (which provisions also come into force on 1st January 1988 by virtue of the
Commencement Order referred to above).
  Regulation 7 of these Regulations is a new provision which prescribes the period within
which appeals in respect of prohibition notices (and amendments to those notices) issued
under section 10 of the 1975 Act (as substituted by section 23 (1) of the 1987 Act) must be
brought under section 10A (1) and (2) o f the 1975 Act (as inserted by section 24 of the 1987
Act).

 resulting in serious injury to spectators has occurred since the
 last inspection;

                         .or.deficiency which has arisen since the
      inspection and which, in the opinion of the inspecting
 officer would be likely to lead to an accident which could result
 in serious injury to spectators;                1

 (c) major remedial work carried out since the date of the last
 inspection to ascertain that it has been satisfactorily carried
 OU v   §

of spectators, the authority should go on to inspect all the
crush barriers etc, terracing or seating in that part of the
ground where the sample indicated that there were deficiencies.
Testing of equipment

4.   Tests should if possible be carried out to confirm that the
following is in working order:-

Supplementary advice and explanatory notes to the Statutory
Guidance to local authorities given by the Secretary of state
under section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction
1.   The following advice does not form part of the Statutory
Guidance given under section 10B of the 1975 Act. The following
advice is given in good faith but it should be remembered that
only the courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of
points of law.
Objective of Inspections
2.   The object of the inspections is to monitor the suitability
of the terms and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the safety certificate or other
notice served on the ground occupier.
3.   Local authorities may wish to note that the inspection is
not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
from the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
maintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
certificate for the number of spectators authorised to enter the
ground for a specified activity.
General
4.   As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out more frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act is
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is seen as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs. In this context local
authorities may wish to bear in mind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act.are in addition to, not a
substitute for those required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
holder.
Inspection frequency
5.   As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Act stipulates that an
inspection should take place of a HdesignatedH ground at least
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed. Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requirements of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of
     the ground should be carried out either:-
    within a year of its issue, or

    within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.

Guidance.

 *       Statutory Guidance does not require that, an inspection
should take place at any particular time so the local authority's
discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
is not restricted. An "in-use" or "during performance"
inspection could therefore constitute part of the.inspection
         by section 10B of the Act even though it might not be
rUf*101*?'+.(having regard to the requirements of the Statutory
Guidance) to be an inspection itself.
Records

10.  Local authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
     ?SPS       Cafriwd out under t*1® Statutory Guidance and may
        f?nSi    whether a copy of any report/record should be
sent to the holder of the safety certificate. Local authorities
are also asked to consider affording a reasonable^opportunity for
any such report to be made available for inspection, if so
requested, by members of the public.

          This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
   which is attainable.
         It dealsin broad terms with the necessary strengthening
  and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
  calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
         Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
  the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
  made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
         The green guide has been used as a basis foi* our cal­
  culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
  will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
  guide.   Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
  fire officer and the police.

    Standing Accommodation
    (a)    Spion Kop
                  The general layout of Spion Kop is good.   It
           has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
           well below the maximum laid down in the guide.   The
           slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
           for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                  The~only~que stions therefore are the adequacy
           of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
           permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
           the exits.
                  Where the barriers are adequate in strength
           and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
           of spectators should not exceed 54 per lorn22 of plan
           area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
           Kop is approximately 3120m which would provide,
           accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                  Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
           standards.   Category A must be able to withstand a
           test load of 6kN/metrewidth (400 lb/foot approximately)
           and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
           In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
           and Brocklebank Ltd.   Of the 101 barriers on Spion
           Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
           a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
           incipient defect which needed attention.   Most of
           those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
          would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
          On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
          long barrier which was weak. It should be emphasised
          that the general situation was satisfactory compared
          with most grounds.
                  Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the

              barriers up to a uniform category A standard.   It —
              should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
              the tests and there may have been some deterioration
              due to rusting.   Most of the barriers are made from
              2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness,of 0.192
              inches when new.   Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield's
              atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
              to more rusting than others and it is possible that
              there will be an increase in the number needing attention.'
                     Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/in, the
              maximum distance between barriers recommended ih the
              guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5? to 2.9m
              for slopes of 30°.   These figures apply to 'peak viewing'
              areas.   Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17°
              for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.   The slope of the
              upper part changes to 25° for which the spacing is
              3.1m.                                       *
1                    Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
              Spion Kop could be considered as not being 'peak
              viewing areas' we are prepared to accede to the police
              view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
              This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
              ground.
                                       I
                     We propose that the existing barriers should be
              supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
              drawing 1610/1X.   The green shaded area behind each
              barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
                                                           •2
              available for spectators.   This area is 2958m which
                               2
              at 54 persons/lOm gives a capacity of 15,973.    It

              should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
              have been admitted to the Kop in the past.

                  Spion Kop has three exits, one near each       r;                -_c-
            end and one at the top.    The total width of
            these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.5m.
            The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
            exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
            width.   Thus the theoretical time to discharge
            16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
            compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
            guide.   We do not consider this to be a serious ..    J/ , o O
            matter.   Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) i's very    -—
            desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
            fire, or explosion, or structural failure.    In the
             case of terracing it is only the impatience=of.spectators
            which might create danger.   We believe that for an
             interim period at least the evacuation time of"Ilf
            minutes should be acceptable.
                   The exits at each end of the terrace are
            reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
             end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
             recommended value of 8ft.   This defect could be
             removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
             it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
             and the cost of modification is not justified in an
             existing structure.
                    The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
             from handrails dividing it into lanes.   Some remodelling
             of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
             desirable.            \v

    (b)      The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                                                                 2
                    The west terrace has a total area of: 1480m but
             there are no gangways.v  We feel that some allowance should
                                                                 SHEET   5.


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




           be made for circulation space as spectators have
           to move quite considerable horizontal distances
           to achieve good packing.  The full area would
           justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
           probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
           of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
           The barriers should be designed to match this figure
           approximately.   Those barriers which cannot,withstand
           6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened,- "and extra
           ones provided where necessary.
                  The extra barriers required to achieve
           approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
           attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                  The three exits have a total width, of about
           11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
           to leave the ground. Thus the terrace could be
           emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                  The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
           should be within 12m of a gangway or exit. There are
           no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
           exit.   But we feel this is of no consequence as
           movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
           and quick.

    (c)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                  This area is also illustrated in the drawing
           1610/2X.   The gross area available (there are no
                                   2
           gangways) is about 565 m .   Thus if the crush barriers
           were adequate and the whole area is included the number
           of spectators could be about 3,050.
                  Provided the existing crush barriers are
           brought up to standard and supplemented in red as
                                                                  SHEET g

          shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
          be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
          shown in green.    This area is about 535m   corresponding-
          to about 2900 spectators.   This would bring the total
          standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                 The exits serving this part of the terraces
          are very adequate in width and there will be no ■
          difficulty in emptying in eight minutes. C

   Seating Accommodation
   (a)    The North Stand
                 The form of construction of this stand is
          such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.*  The
          exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
          the recommendations of the guide.
                 The exits are very marginally below the „
          recommended l*lm width, but we do not consider this
          to be of great consequence.
                 Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
          length (they widen round the exit).   This is well
          below the green guide recommendation.   However, it
          is clearly appropriate to take into account the
          general nature of the stand, the number as well as
          the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
          speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
         leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
         The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.   Thereafter
         the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
         This established that in an emergency the green guide
         figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l'lm gangway)
         can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                  SHEET

           the average is 556 per exit. Thus the stand .wou}.d
           empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
           recommended limit of eight minutes.
                  Our observations in company with the fire
           officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
           had left this stand, apart from some people who were
           in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
           counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
           whistle.   The overall picture appears very satisfactory
           and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
           as not needing any significant modification.    *
    (b)    The West Stand
                  This stand is very similar to the north stand
           in its construction.   We were not able to accurately
           assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
           January because there were many seats which were unsold.
                                                          '"•L
           However, there is every reason to believe that there
           will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
           eight minutes also.   There should be no need for
           significant modifications.
   (c)    The South Stand
                 The structure has been surveyed and appended
          are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
          show the plans and cross-section.   Also attached is
          a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                  The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
          has 5710 seats.   These are served by 12 exits (excluding
          those serving the directors box) so that an average
          of 476 people need to pass through each exit.   The
          count by the fire officer's staff on 6 January showed
          an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
          exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
          seven minutes. Indeed there were very few people

                                                                  SHEET   8

           still trying to get out six minutes after the ^inal
           whistle.   A few had no doubt left early and a few
           were still standing around, but the stand had
           substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                  Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their way from the first floor, landing
           via one of three staircases.   Two of these are 3.6m
           wide and the other 2.4.   This is equivalent to 17|
           ’lanes’ of 550mm.   At 40 people per lane, 700 people
           pass per minute.   To discharge 5710 people (less
           those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
           exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                  At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air, through a. compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
           will probably need three sets of self closing fire
           doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
           The club intends to move the paint store from the
           space behind this staircase.
                  The front, open-air part of the south stand is
           well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
           one passage.   This passage has a theoretical capacity
           of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.'
           This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.   Because
           the stand is open to the air and there is very
           ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
           long emptying time is of any great consequence.

    Future Ground Capacity
           Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
    out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
    ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows :—
           Seating approximately             24,000
           Standing on Spion Kop             16,000
           Standing at Leppings Lane end
            (total including N.W. corner)     10,100

                                              50,100

           It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
    has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
    be admitted to the ground.   This involved of the order of
    19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.   Indeed, it
    is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
    70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
    Kop probably approached 30,000.
           It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
    excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

                         1«____ Purpose of Meeting

                        Following the Working Party's meeting with the representatives of the
                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
                        Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
                        Report, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
                        and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
                        16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

                        The purpose of today’s meeting was to consider the views which the Working
                        Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

                        2.                Plans

                       (a)     Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
                       plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
                       for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
                       Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
                       to the same scale, and it was AGREED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
                       Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

                       (b)     The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
                       Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
                       Friday's meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be
                       Indicated on that plan.
                                                                           1.
(c)     It was .AGREED that the planssupplied hadinaccuracies and
inadequacies. In particular, they lacked indications of cross sections,
profiles, structural stability, position of handrails and balustrades, width
of stairways, etc. Where appropriate, these could, as an alternative, be
described in a Report.

(d)    The CountyCouncil’s hope was that, in view of limited resources in
the Architectural & Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
Drawings.

3.     Report

(a)    General

It was recognised that the criteria set out in the Home Office ’’Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)” required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
In existing situations the criterion was that of a reasonable degree of safety.
As tiie Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
the flow of spectators was the most important criteria to be adopted.
Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
it would be useful to. know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
Guide that gangways should not be less than 1.1 metres wide. The County
Council AGREED to try"to find this information out, and the Fire Service
AGREED they'would contact their colleagues in other areas who had been
Involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 metre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations In their
respective areas.       •

At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
admission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
time.

                                             *

.Whilst it was probably a typing mistake, it was AGREED that the wording
on the Front Cover should read "REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
 COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL’’.

                                 (JJ
(c)    Spion Kop   (pages 2,3 & 4)

The Working Party agreed with the Club's view that, With the existing three
exits, there was no way that the recommended discharge time of 8 minutes
could be met. Where they disagreed was that an evacuation time of I l f
minutes should be regarded as acceptable. If no more exits were to be
provided, the Working Party AGREED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be less than the recommended value of 8ft.
As this was in fact some 6' 6", the Working Party AGREED that the Club        ..
be informed that in their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
remove this danger to spectators.                          "              ___

The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
barriers would need installing.

The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

If new exits were to be provided by the Club, it was AGREED that at least
TWO would be required. The most economical way of providing one would
be to use the gates in the existing barrier, provided these were lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
require to be a completely new exit.

The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush barriers would fail
the tests, and consequently any necessary re-siting would probably not be
too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
require careful consideration.

For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some
form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it was suggested
that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each limited to a
padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

As recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
could cause problems, and it was AGREED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
the Club on profile and step dimensions and the slope of the Kop.

                                 - 3-
 (d)     Th e West Terrace   (pages 4&5)


to view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club’s offer to reduce the
spectator limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the
Working Party AGREED that it would be unreasonable to Insist that
gangways or additional exits must be provided.

 However, even If the existing crush barriers were to pass the tests, the
•Working Party AGREED that the barriers would require special attention
 In view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

 .(e)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

 The Working Party AGREED there were no real problems here, but the
 Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush barriers, the
 existing corrugated sheeting would require to pass the appropriate tests.

 (f)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

, Whilst the flow rates and discharge times were probably satisfactory (the
  construction and width of the ramps being such that they could quite properly
-be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
  the North Stand were only 640mm wide for much of their length, compared
  with the recommended width of 1.1 metres.

 Additionally, observations had shown that two-thirds of the spectators used
 the upper exit, whilst the remainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
,to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of its cantilever
 construction, the cost would be prohibitive.             '       -
        ■^ 4#
As an alternative, the Working Party AGREED that consideration might be
given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits, with a physical barrier across the stand below the upper
exits to ensure more equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
If this would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
exits might be considered.         ’

So far as the Wire Mesh barriers under the stand were concerned, the
Working Party AGREED that these must either be removed or made of a
permanent construction.

Whilst the exits were adequate and well spaced and the discharge times
were acceptable in view of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that
                                   - 4-




                                   S3
the means of escape were not adequate as the only means of egress was
by way of two staircases.. The Working Party AGREED that it was essential
that another staircase be provided, and one on the south-west corner was felt
to be the most acceptable.                ,

(h)    The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

So far as the seating arrangements were concerned, the Working Party
felt that it was the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
of the bad Ingress/egress, the Working Party AGREED that two additional
exits would be required. It was suggested that the most economical way of
doing this was by means of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
looked at closely.

As the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate tests.
Also, as the staircase was a 24 instead of the maximum 12 riser recommended
In the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

Contrary to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, provided that the
necessary increased fire resistance measures were carried out, the stand
would not be the problem from a combustability point of view that they had
anticipated.

The Building Authority expressed concern as to the corrosion of the steel
work of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

 The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
 Stand. Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just before
 the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
 access to the ground. As they left immediately afterwards, the same thing
 occurred at the end of a m atch.. This practice had to be stopped, either by
 banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
 of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

 (h)    General Requirements

• These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.
(I)    Future Ground Capacity

If additional exits are not provided on the Spion Kop, this will have the
effect of reducing the ground capacity to 45,140, made up as follows:-

         Purpose of Meeting                               .        ■^

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2._____ Plans

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.                    *

,3^_____ Report
 (a)     General

The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that set out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.

                                        1.
 (b)      Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was AGREED that it would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11,040 if the extra
exits are not provided.

On the question of exits, it was again AGREED that it was essential to line       •
up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two     -
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on       - •
the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was AGREED
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was AGREED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x2-central
barriers but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatever
barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in some cases weil below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club’s attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

As well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
to the Club’s attention.

(d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 8)

Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
meet the requirements of the Guide.

was not to be reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would require. Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure almost twice as large as the existing temporary
structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
e tc ., facilities.

So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed their willingness to provide advice on First-Aid and
Medical Facilities, but the person nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

                H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mx. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club’s activities. The Club’s
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

3. 1 That as much work as possible should be carried out in the close season,
bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah’s Witness Bally had
also to be borne in mind.

2.   Discussion on Standing Areas

A.    Spion Kop

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

2.    That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

3.    That, in view of the clearance time of I l f minutes compared with the
8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (Including the re-sitlng of the gates
in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
an increase in their number).

4.   That the headroom at the North end under the bricfee be increased to the
maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

5.    That representative parts of the concrete wail and boundary posts and fences
be tested to the appropriate standards.

6.    That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

7.   That the Club’s longer term proposals for the improvement of the means of
egress be unanimously welcomed.

8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
points have been resolved.




                                           2.




                                       □
B.    W es t Terrace

IT WAS AGREED-.

1.' That the Club's proposals for the installation of additional barriers and the
reduction in capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additional gangways
should be implemented.

2.    That the question of the cross-fa.il on the steps on the north-west corner
exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
and sharp edges in places, be the subject of detailed discussion between ---
Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C. . North West Comer Terrace

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
supplemented by new barriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
be implemented.

2.    That the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.     That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party as to the appropriate steps (if any) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider ail the points made, and
to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

2.    That the question of fire protection works to the Store Room and to the Team
Boom be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the
Fire Service.

3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
that the facilities required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.    That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.   That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
                                         3.




                                         t    o
4.    W e s t Stand

 IT WAS AGREED -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency use, rather
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT WAS AGREED-                                                   ""

1.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin walls.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems in the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.    That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an addi tional gangway to exit on to the
derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediately
before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.

6.   Ground Exits

Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
circulated without delay.




                                        4.




                                        0
7.    Communications

IT WAS AGREED That consideration would be given to the installation of an
Improved public address system, with the Police having access to its control
from their Control Room, together with its use as a fire alarm system, subject
to an emergency back-up system in the event of failure.

8.    Police and First Aid Facilities

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the Club accept the principle of permanently contructed Police and
First Aid Facilities.

2.     That the Police would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their initial
sketch plan showing the facilities they wished to see, and that Dr- Bailey would
inspect the existing first-aid and medical facilities and then discuss future
facilities with Dr. Eastwood.

9.    Any other Topics

IT WAS AGREED That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the existing
and any proposed emergency generating and fire-fighting equipment.

10.   Future Action

The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work as possible before
the Issue of the Certificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done,
it was essential that any points for discussion between the various representatives
of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

11.   Date of Next Meeting

IT WAS AGREED That the next meeting should be held at 2.30 p.m . on
Wednesday, 18th April, 1979, at the Stadium.

                     D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council - Admin. D ept.)

      Apologies for absence were received from Dr. H. Bailey (Sheffield Area Health
      Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).

      The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
      in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
      and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
    • Metropolitan District Council Building Surveyor's Department held on 13th April, 1979.

      The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
      amendments and additions in the light of the further Investigations and discussions:-

      2A     Spion Kop

      Paras. 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1610/IX were circulated at the meeting
      showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines of radial
      barriers. This was AGREED in principle.

      Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean an unacceptable
      evacuation time of some 12j minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
      and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to some 10 minutes,
      but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
      This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
      Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.


                                             1.
para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the improvement of the headroom had
still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

 Para. 5 - Because of the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
"(such as the top of the Kop), it was AGREED that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGREED that the question of the haight of some
of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed :&n.
testing.                          _      '    .                                  I.   \ .

Para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the Improvement of the means of
egress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with;
the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existing
barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B    . West Terrace

Para; 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the cross-fall on the north-west corner
exit, the steps should be re-built. It was AGREED that the other matters would be:
considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C     North West Corner Terrace

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the Improvement or replacement of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 250/300 spectators.

3.     North Stand

Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would
Involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from In
front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGREED to give
consideration to the proposal.

Para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been 'Tea* and not ’Team1.
It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail any
fire protection works considered to be necessary.




                                       2   .

                                        □
4.     West Stand

The Club AGREED that additional exits o f simple steel construction should be
provided from ea;ch end of the upper stand.

5.     South Stand                                                     ......

Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGREED th.at all bases would be exposed for
Inspection and, If necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parte before
encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also AGREED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was AGREED that
It would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

Para. 3 - It was AGREED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
It was also AGREED that the brick staircase walls should .be buttressed where crowd
suige pressure could be generated.

Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1.2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance measures In the
surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any loss of seats.

6.     Ground Exits

The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

7.     Communications

The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
address system . It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look Into the possibility of
achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

8.     Police and First Aid Facilities

Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in
the provision of Police Facilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects

to receive first priority and to wait for the 1980 close season for the work to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr. Bailey had not yet completed his Investigations
Into the first-aid and medical facilities.

U.    Any other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
emergency lighting equipment.

10.   Future Action

Mr. McGee stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently If the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,000 crowd             (
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.




                                                                                        (

    I refer to recent meetings with regard to the improvements required at the above'
    ground and now append a summary of matters, in relation to the Building Authority
    requirements, which require attention and have been discussed at the various
    meetings.

    West Terrace

    1.    The downward slope of the exit steps to be corrected.

    2.    Limitation of numbers as agreed between Police representatives and club.

 Subject to these two points this area is acceptable.
.                        -     - s              •
 West Stand

 Provision of additional stairways for egress purposes is required. 'Subject to
 this provision the slight shortfall on headroom in certain cases can be accepted.

 South Stand

 1.       Removal of divisions between areas of seating is required, and following
          this the general arrangements of egress provisions can be appraised.

 2.       Areas of badly spalled concrete to be repaired.

 3 . _ Corrosion to steel columns to be investigated and its effects assessed and

 With regard, to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
 "be recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
 that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

 I.would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
 perhaps, he advisable to hold future meetings away from the., ground, and that
 Mr. Vaughan, as the co—ordinator, should chair such meetings.

             system to some essential lighting circuit e .g . bar lights is strongly
             recommended thereby ensuring that the emergency lighting is always
Fire Warning System

The suitability and type of system to be decided when further discussions have
taken place.

Fire Extinguishers

Fire fighting hand appliances are to be installed where indicated by a triangle
on the attached plan. The colour of the triangle determines the type of
appliance required. (Please see attached legend). It may be that equipment
is already provided in the building, and the plan shows the final complement
of appliances.

Two gallon water extinguishers to be wall mounted so that the handle is
approximately one metre from floor level. The 51b. dry powder extinguishers
and glass fibre blanket to be wall mounted, the extinguishers being mounted at
approximately light switch lev e l.

General Fire Precautions

1.     All walls and ceilings inside the stands and along escape routes to be
       class 'O' surface spread of flame.

2.     Provide isolating valves on the pipeline leading to the gas cookers at
       the point adjacent to the escape route from the counter area.

3.     Quantities of waste paper were discovered under the seating in the
       stand. This should be removed and placed in a satisfactory storage
       area.

Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

To ensure that the Safety Stewards and Staff are conversant with the safety
precautions they will be expected to administer, a meeting should be arranged
with the Fire Service, suitable to all parties.

 Notices - Exit Signs

 1.    These signs to have suitable sized white lettering on a green background,
        the size of lettering to be agreed on site.

        The position of the exit signs are indicated on the plans by a green
        rectangle containing the letter'E '.

 2.     If the proposed rewiring of the emergency lighting system is adopted
        as discussed by Mr. Clough and Divisional Officer Jones then, with the
        reduced lighting output, it may be necessary to provide a number of
        illuminated exit boxes.

              LhH i??Sting fa<liliti t S are considered to below an acceptable standard
                      s suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
              stnicture which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.
              The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
               mpervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
              sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
              tiles or formica type finish e t c .. . .

     (11)      Waiting Area

              The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
              the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

     (HI)     Treatment Area

              The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
              for nWv^ anL ? ei lm®’ End consideration should be given to the needs
              natfpntl   within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
              patients may well be lying on couches.

(iv)     Lighting

         Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vi)     Toilet Requirements

         The d u b should provide at least one male and one female toilet,; for _
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(viii)   Equipment

         The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service:-

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
         on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
         cubicled.

         Six Stretchers.
         Two sets of stretcher wheels.
         20 Blankets.
         Six Pillows.
         One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

(ix)     Telephone Facilities

         A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
         achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
         police.

 The Working Party considered Preliminary Drawings nos. 1917/1, 2, 3 and 4 forwarded
 by M essrs. Eastwood and Partners relating to the Club's proposals to erect a new
 security fence around three sides of the pitch at Bramall Lane.

Whilst many detailed preliminary plans had been provided by M essrs. Eastwood and Partners
these were not suitable for including as part of the Certificate. The conditions and
date of issue of the Certificate weie also discussed, as was the provision of the
First-Aid Facilities recommended by the Area Health Authority.

A letter had also been received that morning from M essrs. Eastwood and Partners
requesting alterations to the previously agreed barrier arrangements in the North
Stand.

IT WAS AGREED s-

(a)    that the aim be to issue the Certificate at the beginning of December; that the     ^
       Club be advised of this aim and asked to state their programme for the
       completion of the required works, any works not completed by that date to
       be included in a Schedule of Crowd Capacity Limitation to be incorporated in

(b)   that particular emphasis be placed on the necessity of carrying out the required
       works to the South Stand as soon as possible and that'provided that it is feasible
       the Building Authority and the Fire Service be requested to let the County Council

       to provide the proposed First-Aid permanent structure in the 1980 close season,
       subject to the du b agreeing to provide the recommended equipment immediately;

(e)   that M essrs. Eastwood and Partners be advised that the alterations to the
      previously agreed barrier arrangement in the North Stand set out in their letter
       dated 14th August cannot be agreed, the alternative to their suggestions being
      the retention of the 1.1 metre height (as recommended by the Guide) in line
      with the stairs but with a possible reduction in height of the returns to 1 metre;

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Sirs,
               ’ Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                  Emergency Lighting Installation
     Further to our discussions with Mr. K. Jones, we would
like to set down in detail our proposals for the upgrading of
the emergency lighting facilities at the above Club.
     At present there is a large central battery system
providing 240 volts D.C. which is arranged to serve the West
and South Stands, and adjacent areas.    This is achieved by an
automatic changeover on mains failure, from AC mains to the
DC battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
tungsten lighting.    For the North Stand and adjacent areas,
there is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in
the event of a loss of the normal supply.
     We are proposing at this stage that new emergency circuits
and fittings be installed to serve the Penistone Road exits,
Spion Kop, the North Stand, the North-West Terrace,, the West
Stand, the South-West Terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.
The existing normal lighting for the West Stand will be excluded
from the battery load, and the spare battery capacity made
available will serve the new emergency installation.

                                                     Registered In E n g P * i * j N o . 1134531
EASTWOOD £f PARTNERS




        The duration of the battery supply will be substantially
   unchanged by this redistribution of load, and will give more
   than adequate time for clearing the ground.   As these are
   existing grounds, we would not recommend to the Club that
   their installations should comply in all respects with the
   standards set for new premises, especially as the 3-hour
   duration recommended for emergency battery capacity is quite
   inappropriate to the particular needs of safety.
        We are not proposing at this stage to recommend improvements
   to the South Stand emergency lighting.   Subject to approval,
   we would suggest that the system be reviewed when the time
   comes for replacement of the central battery.   At thix£Ttime
   the load reduction which could be achieved with a new emergency
   lighting layout would permit a considerable saving in the battery
   replacement cost, and this would offset the cost to the Club of
   the new emergency lighting installation.
        We are enclosing a set of drawings corresponding to
   these proposals (1610/101 to 106) for which we are now seeking
   tenders.   We would look forward to your comments and suggest
   that it may be appropriate to arrange a meeting with the Fire
   Prevention Officers concerned if further discussions are required.
        We would also wish to have their comments on the proposed
   locations for the Fire Alarm call points shown on the drawings.

    Mr. Whitehead welcomed the representatives and explained that delays caused primarily
    by the wet weather, had meant that all of the required work had not been completed by
    today's meeting as the Club had originally envisaged.

    the following results (after site inspection where necessary):-

1.        To prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints and to
           spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present, it was agreed
           that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the
           sheets at a height about one metre from terrace level.

2.        Work carried out.

D.        West Stand

          It was agreed that, whilst the only positive way of provingthe adequacy of the
        . joint between the new andexisting construction wasby means of a test load,
          the calculations provided would be l'egarded as acceptable.

K.       Emergency Lighting

1&        It was obvious that there was a difference of opinion as to what could be
2        regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency 'lighting in the South
         Stand. It was agreed that a trial should beconducted during the hours of
          darkness attended by representatives of the Club and the Fire Service so
         as to identify the danger areas. Consideration would then be given to
         possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
         areas not covered by the emergency lighting covering other parts of the
         ground.

.L_____Fire Warning System

         The problems with the public address system seemed to be mainly ones of
         diction and correct volume level. It was agreed that the police would monitor the
         position at the next home match and." pending the new police control post being
         erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the. Disc Jockey in the
         meantime.

         It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire detection equipment
         should be in the tower between the South and West Stands, and would proceed
         once the electrical work was completed.

         The fire extinguishers had been delivered and were to be fitted shortly as
         shown on the plan. The Fire Service undertook to clear any doubtful points.

        necessary wording.

        As agreed, a suitable permanent Police Room would be provided in the 1980
        closed season.

        The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
        for boththe police and first aid facilities to be in the same overall building
        although physically separated. The police representatives reserved their
        position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
        Club.

         The question of parking for both police and St. John's personnel purposes
         would also need to be looked at in detail.

 S.___ Ground Capacity

         Provided the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
         that the crowd capacity would be as shown, i.e . a total of 50,174.

            Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                   Sheffield on 11th August, 1983

 PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

            Dr. W. Eastwood (Eastwood & Partners)
            E. England (Secretary)

            Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

            Ms. J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police)
            C. W. Calvert (South- Yorkshire Police)
            J. Miles (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
            A. Roberts (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
            D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
            D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 .______ Purpose of Meeting

pie purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the "summer"
^nspeci-ion of the Ground in accordance with the policv of twice yearly
visits to rootball League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appronriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to sea theposition with
regard to the efiect or the carrying out of the improvements at the
P e m s t o n e Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th -une, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a                          dated _9th June).  Reports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of s u m c i e n t magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

2.      Ground Inspection

A.      Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1982, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands. Evidently, it
was proving to be a most welcome feature.                           *

B.      West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
ac the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium.  One had
failed and been replaced.




                                    m
   IT WAS AGREED -

  (1 )     That, if the Club intend, to continue to use the former A.R.P. builcin
  adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would require attention
  in particular,' as would the general maintenance of -the building.

  (ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork, at
  the rear corner of the Stand (nea-ast to the North West Terrace) should continue
  to be monitored.

  (iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
  loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
  C.      North West Terrace

  As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
  the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
  caused^by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
  impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the sespaee of
  water between the two.

  IT WAS AGREED that this^was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
  continue to monitor the position.                         -
 0.       North Stand

 The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
 joint adjacent to Stand entrance "X" requested at the last meeting was in hand
 as a matter .of maintenance.
■ E.      Spion Kon

 As requested at^the las; meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
 and corrosion of the root of the tunnel exit from the Spies Xop (towards the
 North Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
 worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
 increasing the headroom.

 Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
 stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spicn Kcp following digging out
 to provide new refreshment and ‘toilet facilities, the Officer Working Parry
 were of the^firm opinion that further work was essential. Measurements had
 shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
 movement.  Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
 ;ormer retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
 consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
 o the existing barrier rails.    The Club would have to look to the contractor
 (or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
 ramp and barrier rails.

 As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
 require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
 new facilities (as they were not load bearing) . Barriers would- have to be
 provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
 crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
 out m the letter of 29th June).
 IT WAS AGREED

(i)   ^ That the C l ub ’s proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be sunoorted in
principle. '                                                      **




                                    G D
   (n)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
  match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
  rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and
  inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
  of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
  sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

  (1 1 O A JS° prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must .
 be taKen (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
 facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
 wnere these are capable of being generated.


 Srh  ,*.*!“ '• 'he              to the existing boundary wall in connection
          new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so ds not to reduce the
 support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall'externallv
 m places must also not be overlooked.

 F.      "Stands” Club

 It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the stee?
 beams underneath the "Stands" club.  It was understood that the premises
 were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

 It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection £n the br*c>
 built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if" “
 pressure was applied to the cop of the wall.

 IT WAS AGREED:-

 (i)   ^ That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to »ive
 attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel°beams
 under the Stands   Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(u 1\ . ^ That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
snou_a be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G-      South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed     '
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
s eel supports to the sides of the concertina-type exit gate from the
Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

IT WAS AGREED

(1 )    That the Club would remove the remaining coping stones and arrange
tor the remainder of the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.
                                                                                 «


(ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme to be prepared by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for replacement of'both steel supports to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).




                                0 3
H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate. However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistone Road end of the Stadium at
the present time.

     to tne evacuation procedure.                '•

4.   Further investigation revealed that, in a number of areas, listed below,
     tne public acaress systaa was not audible. ‘

     There are speakers at tne rear of the west stand but those were not woricin
     on the night of the test. It is possible that speakers at th.e Penistone
     Road end nay have been removed or are not functioning correctly because of

    the alterations currently being carried out at that end of the ground.
5. Because of the problem with the audibility of the public address system
   it was not possible for my Officers to assess the effectiveness of the
   emergency procedures. They did, however, report that the stewards they
   questioned would have known what to do if the message had oeen heard
   by them.

6. A number of stewards vere not wearing identifiable dress, i.e. fluorescent
   tabards; as.required d v condition ?(c) of your General Safety Certificate.
7. My Officers also reported that staff manning refreshment oars in the
   nortn and soutn stands did not know the position of fire alarm call
   points or the position of and how to use fire extinguicners.

I have informed Hr. D. Vaughan (Secretary Officer Workin~?srty) c.-' the
problems listed above and he will oe arranging a site meeting as soon as
possible to resolve the matter of the public address system. Iters 6 is
a matter which I think you can deal with yourself.

On the subject of staff training, which is a condition placed on the Club
by the General Safety Certificate, I am prepared to make my Officers
available to instruct your stewards and staff members in the emergency
procedure and use of fire extinguishers.

 Dear Mr. Wright,

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

 Further to your letter of the 7th October re your visit and
 appraisal of the emergency procedure at this ground on
 Tuesday, 4th October, when your Divisional Officer Johnson
 cane to see me after the match and explained thatiin his
 opinion there were dead areas in our ground, as it appeared
 that stewards had not heard the emergency announcement, to
 say the least this surprised me, as only this last close
 season have we had the P.A. System further improved.

I have taken the opportunity this morning to try out the
system in all the areas that were supposedly 'deadi and
I must report that everything that was said, was heard
clearly and distinctly.

I have informed Hammerton Road police of this, and it
has been suggested to me that perhaps it would be a
sensible idea for one or two of your officers to come
to the ground at say 1.00 o’clock on Saturday, 29th
October when we play Huddersfield Town and gi around the
ground with the police and hear the broadcasts for them­
selves.

Yours sincerely,



Secretary.

 REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
 PURPOSES PANEL


                              Safety of Sports Groundg


 With effect from 1st April 1986, the City Council will be responsible as
 Licensing Authority for the administration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
-1985 in place -of the South Yorkshire County Council. This.preliminary report is
 intended to inform Members as to the basic framework of the Act and the
 delegations required to carry out the Council's functions.

A detailed report will be presented to the next meeting of the Panel by which
time investigations into the current licensing system will be complete.

The Home Office have provided a useful summary of the dutiesTof Licensing
Authorities and a summary of the Act itself; both these documents are attached— ■
to this Report for members to consider.

Following the Bradford disaster, the importance of the provision of a sufficient
level of safety at sports grounds has been highlighted; the responsibility of
theCouncil in this regard should not be underestimated.
       i


Members will probably be aware that the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into
Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Ground (the Popplewell Report) was recently
published and a copy of its recommendations are attached to this Report for
information.

Summary and recommendations

A more detailed report will be submitted to the Panel as soon as possible but
in the meantime it is recommended that the following delegations be approved;—

(a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports Ground
      Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel;

(b)    The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be
      delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in
      consultation with Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel or of the
      Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as
      appropriate.

(c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be delegated to
      the Head of Administration and Legal Department.

                          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction

The Panel will recall that a report was submitted to the March 1986 Meeting

covering the general safety of sports grounds legislation as it affects the City

Council.    This follow-up report aims to deal in detail with the current

situation in Sheffield as inherited from the South Yorkshire County Council.

There are 2 sports grounds currently subject to the legislation - Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield United Football Club;. „ther Owlerton Sports

Stadium is likely to be made subject to the legislation shortly.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - Hillsborough

The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited was designated as requiring a

Safety Certificate in August 1978 and such a Certificate was issued by the

County Council on 21st December, 1979.    The Stadium is currently undergoing

major works which, when complete, will form a roof over the Spion Kop and thus

substantially improve the accommodation for spectators.

Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane

The Club was designated as requiring a certificate in August 1984 but to date

a certificate has not been issued as there are outstanding works to be

completed. The County Council took the view that the certificate should only be

issued as and when the Ground was up to the appropriate safety standard and not

before.    This procedure effectively insured that the terms of the Safety

Certificate were not breached as soon as it was issued.    It is hoped that the

Council will be in a position to issue a certificate before the start of the

1986/87 season.

Owlerton Sports Stadium

It is understood that the Home Secretary will shortly be designating the Stadium

as requiring a Safety Certificate in accordance with the Popplewell Report ’

recommendations.    It will, therefore, be necessary to arrange for a full

inspection of the Stadium in the next few weeks to find out what works are




                                     12
2.

going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.

The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

Leased to the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited.    This Lease will expire on 1st

November, 1987.

Safety Certificate Standard Conditions

At the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

standardised throughout South Yorkshire and both the Police and the Fire Service

have indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

administrative simplicity.   The Conditions do, however, give some-cause for

concern, as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.     The

drafting of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

submit them to the Panel for approval.    The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 (1) (b) of the Act.    The

Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

the start of the 1986/87 season.    The re-drafted conditions would, of course, be

submitted to the Fire Service, the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

other authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved in this process.

Existing Administrative Arrangements

The County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

components - (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings of an

officer working party.   The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

Stadia and the identifying of any defects.   These defects are at the time of the

visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

representative if one is present.   Depending on the nature of the faults found

(if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder
to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the public occurs.       The

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police, Fire Service,

Building Surveyors and the County Council - it considers in detail various

matters (such as the Spion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.       The

Working Party is effectively a co-ordinating body which attempts to ensure that

a balanced and consistent approach is maintained to current issues at the Sports

Grounds.    Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

The Health and Safety Executive

Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report read as follows

’’There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and

communicate their inspections and reports".    Bearing this in mind the local

office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

administrative system for safety at sports grounds.    This invitation was

declined.   The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the

Certification system.

In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between the Home Office

and the HSE about Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no

useful outcome.

In these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether or not to

respond.

Fees

The basis on which fees may be charged is s«t out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states ”14.   A local authority may

determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or




                                  0 3
amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case

exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."     The

South Yorkshire County Council did not fix any fees under the Regulation

apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter of policy that

no fees will Tj'e charged in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds legislation or

(b) decide in principle to fix fees and to ask for a report back on the costs

to the Council.                                                       -_

Conclusion                                                    —

The Panel is asked   to:-                                         „

(a)   Note the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

      County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

(b)   Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Head

      of Administration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

      all matters relating to sports ground safety;

(c)   Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft new

      safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

      authorities approval by the Council;

(d)   Either resolve that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

      request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to report on the

      Council's costs in this respect.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT SITUATION AND PROPOSALS FOR THE
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION FUNCTION'.

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act. The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adequate standards of
safety at designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at the moment
— Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United FootbalLClub^ and the.
Owlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and itsrapplication in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.      ....i          • ...

The Current Situation

The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several main-areas for further     r
investigation.                                              .'is:;;::.,-

Firstly it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the    \    ;.
administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued for
the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this report.             -

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
all matters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the HSE's involvement. As far as
keeping the HSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Executive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments. The practice was
therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in the HSE issue has been
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review the HSE's
relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in the
Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results of that review have
yet been received.  Fortunately, however, the Council's Director of Health and
Consumer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide ahealth and safety -
input into the decision making process in relation to safety of sports grounds.
This substitution, therefore, temporarily covers the absence of an input from
the HSE.

The Panel also made reference to consultation on the safety of sports grounds
policy with the other District Councils-in South Yorkshire. Unfortunately,
attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date. It
is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

The drafting of new safety certificate conditions in consultation with the
Council's advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
currently under consideration by those advisers. It is hoped that the new
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in October for final
approval iS--         -

As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should be
be made deaz^Chat such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
Certificate will then be issued co Sheffield United and at that time it is
proposed to deal with the question of fees.
Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become d e a f that a
detailed administrative system needs to be established in connection'with the
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter have been underway
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council’s Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on the- basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated.  In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council. That
particular working party also appeared to have had some decision making powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now: agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to   \
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of items of advice to the Council before they are finally
formulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be held at
the request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of
Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a list
of, items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of
items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be takgn by each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as appropriate.

Tn addition, the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies of
all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in the
Group.                                                      *

Under the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities —V
represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing with
sports grounds. However it appears that the various Authorities and Officers
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed:—

Authority                                      Area of Responsibility

The Building Surveyor                  All matters relating to the structure of
                                       stadia including crush barriers, walls,
                                       etc.

South Tbrkshire County Fire Service    Fire precautions, fire alarms, means of
 .       >Yai                          escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                       capacity.

South Yorkshire Police                 Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                       ac~-ss3 c e n e r z e n c y vehi;i=s ar.c
It is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department would have an
input to the Advisory Group on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general
safety management of stadia; (c) various special items such as first aid
requirements. It will be appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not
exhaustive but it is anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt with by
discussions at advisory group meetings.

Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested .that one
large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
by a series of inspections which will take place actually during events,
this proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and with licensing
practice in other areas.



There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
to the day to day decision making required for the running of the Certification
System. At the moment decision making powers rest with the Panel but this.is a
highly impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently.  It seems •
that as an interim measure al1 routine matters could be delegated to Head of
Administration and Legal Department with other matters remaining at the
discretion of the Panel. It is proposed that when the revisedCertificate
Conditions are in force then the delegation will be much more closely defined.
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Certificate of
Conditions.

Recommendations

The panel is recommended to:-

(a)   Note the current situation;

(b)   Approve the revised administrative system detailed in this report including
      the establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group".

(c)   Delegate to the Head of Admxnxstratan and Legal Department authority to
      deal with all routine matters in connection with the Administrative System.

    I              '   of 11th April
         2.

                       The contents of the memorandum were noted and it was
                       agreed that the situation should be kept under review.


                       Owlerton Sports Stadium - Safety Management Plan
         3,.
                       Mr. Moore presented the Safety Management Plan which is
                       designed to be capable of amendment in appropriate
                       circumstances. The idea is to place a large scale plan          -
                       in the stadium control room. The plan itself would then
                       provide complete information as to lines of communication,
                       stewarding, fire extinguishers, etc., at a glance. It was
                       agreed tha^fche plan was a most useful inovation.


                       Owlerton Sports Stadium - Access Around the Whole Stadium
                                                                                               '          --.
                       After some discussion it was agreed that access should be
                       maintained around the whole stadium even on the top of the
                       old south terrace*: This particular footpath should be
                       restored to a suitable condition.


                       Owlerton Sports Stadium - Capacity

    •          ■       The Capacity ofj;,the stadium was again discussed at some     The Fire"'
                       length*^ The Fire Service indicated that they could not       Service- to
m s p m                give advice' onTexit widths until some idea had been          enquire -
  *'• ■*?•""*■         obtained fro* the Company as to its future plans for /        further;
V X ■ <?■'             the stadium^ The point was made that although exit,           into the :
                       widths could bd recommended for a 4,000 capacity t$bse        capacity
                       widths would need to increase if the capacity was to be       question.
                       raised at a subsequent time.    It is therefore desirable
                       to set a exit width, etc., at appropriate levels to
                       prevent the need for expensive works later on.

COMMENTS                                                      MADE   BY

1.0 Spion Kop

1.1   The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
      means of escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since
      it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
      width.                                                    B.S.

1.2   A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
      adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be
      removed, and the crush barrier be modified to join onto the end
      of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.           B.S.

1.3   A timber hut at ground level, under the KQP structure should be
      removed.                                                    B.S.

1.4   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
      adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
       terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.              B.S.

1.5   An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
      side of the Kop is corroded and t o m .                             HCS

1.6   It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial
      gangways had become defective.                                    HCS         '

1.7   At some positions within the new development there is a
      difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
      of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a
      suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                          HCS

1.8   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
      minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
      adequately controlled by means of "ongoing” maintenance.         HCS

1.9   The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
      be repaired.                                                    HCS

2.0   North Stand

2.1   A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.      B.S.

2.2   The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
      correctly bedded down.                                            B.S.

2.3   It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath this
      stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
      fertilisers or weedkillers.                                       HCS

3.0   West Stand

3.1    Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
      permanently secured at the following positions

      a) between seats 1 and 14                                           B.S.
      b) between seats 20 and 28
      c) between seats 136 and 150.
         Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
         purpose.

         Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       : be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

 3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
        have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
        onto the crowd below.                                                g #g

 3.3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
        suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
        emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
        fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
        cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
        impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                     B.S.

4.0     Miscellaneous Points

4.1     At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
        abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
        projectiles by the crowd.  Such material should be collected and
        suitably disposed of.

4.2     The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
        first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
        become ill or injured within the sports ground.                      HCS

4.3      The provision of qualified first aiders is being reviewed at the
        moment; it is felt that the existing arrangements require
        formalisation. The Club's views on this point are sought.            HCS

SAFETY AT SPORTS GTIOUNDS Iw SOUTH YORKF’-I-'^


Of the five Foocoail League Grounds in South Yorkshire, three (Barnsley,
Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday) have already been granted General
  j£ety Certificates by the County Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds     ^      ‘
  >   1975, following their designation by the Secretary of State O n the               '~
ct ying out of improvements.                                               .........

The Bramall Lane Ground of the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. was designated
by the Secretary of State in July, 1984 on the Club's promotion to the Second
Division. The Club has already carried out a number of improvements to the
Ground, the remainder to be completed during the 1985 close season.

Only the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. remains
undesignated (the Club remaining in the Third Division), but the County Council
is continuing to work on a goodwill basis with the Club.

The County Council has also since 1979 had a policy of "winter" and "summer"
inspections of all five Football League Grounds by Officer Working Parties
(comprising representatives of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Council
and the District Council’s Building Surveyor).  Such inspections have been welcomed
by the Football Clubs, who have always displayed a responsible attitude on safety
matters.

    •rally, the forthcoming "summer" inspections will take into account the lessons
oi che recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements
which may be issued by the Home Office.

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

 I attach a copy of a Press Release issued by the County Council today,
 in response to requests for information by the media on the situation
 in South Yorkshire following Saturday’s tragic events at Bradford.

It is reasonable to assume that revised advice and/or requirements
     ®e issued by the Home Office in the near future, and naturally
this will be taken into account at the fortticoraing "sunjmer" inspections
by the Officer Working Parties.

In the aeantime and racpgnising that the season has ended, 2 would
particularly stress the vital necessity for safety stewards to be fully
aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of doors
and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting equipment.

                                   Yours faithfully,




                                   Chief Executive.

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

 I write to ccnriris the concluding paragraph of my letter of 13th May, the

D e a r ‘Sir,

Guide to Safety at Sports C r o w d s - 1QR6 Fdltlon

^ re^er to     revised Guide which was recently published by H.M. Government
following the Poppelwell Report.  I would like to drav your attention to the new
Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled “Manapenent KesponeiMli t y “.

This Chapter sets out in detail the sort of matters which ground r»anajrement
should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management of
designated stadia should be entirely familiar with it and follow its guidance.

Would you please, therefore, confire in writing

(a) that you have obtained and intend to retain on the premises a copy of the
    Guide;

(b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and intend
    to perform the nsnagetsent duties outlined in Chapter 2 of the Guide; the
    Company should also take immediate steps to appoint a Safety Officer as
    defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should he sent to
    the Council as soon as possible*

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

1.         Purpose of Meeting

Bearing.in mind the F.A. Cup Semi-Final which, was to take place on Saturday,
llth April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to~‘
visit the ground, especially as’a small number of matters had arisen since the
last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2.         Inspection of Ground

(a)        South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies’ Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand, and the batteries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements
had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Box.
It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator .
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

(b)     West Stand

As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
at the ground.

The cracked: brickwork at the rear of the stand which required pointing, the "
apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the- steps at the rear of the^
stand, the cracks in the concrete at the top bo both sets of stairs, as well
the currently slight corrosion-in the base plate of the outer steel column
(nearest to the South Stand) had all been included in the maintenance progr
and would be undertaken shortly.                       ^


                                         i.
The cracking of the concreting had been attended to by injecting material from - _
the top^— The results had’been'satisfactory, except   in two small areas where____ .
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
attention.

.(d)    North Stand

The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall   of the North Stand (nearest
to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
attended to shortly.

 (e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
exit at the top of the Kop would be given attention in the close season..

Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet in use. It was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators could be pushed, or possibly stumble because of the camber, had
been created. As regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final,

IT WAS AGREED -           - .                      ,'....

that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps. In the longer term, the existing barriers would need
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled off.

3.      Ground Evacuation Procedure

Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "Fire Instruction and Drills"
on 9th April, 1980, consultations between the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "Emergency Evacuation
Procedure". The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

                  Dear Sir,

                  SEMI-FINAL - 11TH APRIL 1981

                  On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
                  a-fc ‘th® Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
                  enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
                  because of crushing.

                  From our enquiries it appears the.crushing was caused
                  through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
                  problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
                  after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
                  to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
                  been in the ground a considerable length of time.

                  According to our turns tile readings there were 335 in
                  excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
                  area.; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
j                 purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
                     Turnstile »N», Penistone Road, which was the
                  Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
                  police to the other end of the ground where the
                  Tottenham fans were standing.

                  I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                        30 spectators treated by St. John’s Ambulance
                                     Brigade for minor ailments, etc.
                        Treated at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital:—

 FA COP SEMI-FINAL            -   11 APRIL 1981         "           ~~...          '■

 I would refer to. the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
 Wanderers Football Club" and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
 Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
 Saturday 11 April 1981.

 As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
 held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
 a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
 This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
 Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

 Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
 of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
 to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
 the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
 the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
 caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
 to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
 traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
 football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
 start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
 afternoon could have been anticipated.

 I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
 and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

On the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
which were at a premium in London.  Others also made the journey from London
to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
groups of standing supporters at opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
-the two participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Glub or the Football
Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
was not properly catered for"." The result of this' was that some 400 ........
Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
Lane end of the ground,, which had been designated for use by Spurs
supporters.             _■;

The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
a safety factor- At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
■that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

i m p o l i c y of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
 large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
 On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
 day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
 centre of this enclosure;' thereby creating a ja m m i n g effect at the
 extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
 gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
 immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
 after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
 terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
 fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John. Ambulance
 representatives present at the game.

As a result of this the safety gates at the front of the Leppings Lane
enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
get. in. In m y view no other course of action could have been adopted in
the interest of public safety.

During the half time interval m y officers attempted to move the spectators
who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
by officers within the ground.

In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

Yours faithfully

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                           Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End
      We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
 installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.

     It is intended that these fences are so positioned
that they divide this section of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
entrance.

     By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
should result. A visiting team with only a few followers
will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
retained by the home supporters.

     Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
dictate.

               A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
during a game. The gate could be left open, but fastened
back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

For the attention of Mr. Dv Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
    Thank you for your letter of 8 September.    I am grateful
to you foraccepting our letter of 2 September   as giving
the formal 21 days notice under paragraph 5(2) of the...
General Safety Certificate.
    Tenders have to be returned by 23 September and we shall
be reporting to the club shortly thereafter.    Normally the
contractor would' commence on site in not more than about two
weeks from receipt of order.    Thus work is likely to begin
in early October subject to there being no objection from the
County Council.
    We may be wishing to place the formal order for the work
on about 24 or 25 September so that if there is the likelihood
of suggestions for major changes to our proposed scheme, I should
be grateful if I could have notice by that time.


                                                                                       Yours sincerely

1_.____ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public..

2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
thatthe Officer Working Party  sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

      (i)-         the further calculations required by the Building
                    Authority being satisfactory;

      (ii)         confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                    available at the rear of the Terrace, and

      (iii)         the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                   under police control.




                                E 3
3.    Security Gates around North Stand

Now that the gymnasium was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at the top of -the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional'gates at ground floor level at the'Penis tone Road
end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the West
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Lepping^ Lane.

These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured m the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.-

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject to4 the gates and/or their supports,
hinges, etc not impinging'on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4.    Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr.. D, Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are to-be provided.

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should draw the Club's attention to the.
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

Referring t<S" your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party—
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit- gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a snail scale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 nm high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:- -

(a)   the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
      satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact-you direct);

(b)   confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
      of the lerrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

(c)   the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
      control.

2.    Security Gates around North Stand

The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide
security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in
use.

Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand

Two other matter* were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating      'r
to the Police and.First Aid Facilities and th£ siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes.             "                           “

 (a)   Police and First Aid Facilities

       It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
       aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim   ‘
       basis on the understadding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

      It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
      still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
      a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are'to,
      be provided.
 (b)" Lottery Ticke~t Boxes    ...                                   ~

       Concern was' expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if '
       the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps. .
       were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

       The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
       re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                      Touts faithfully,

         For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

         Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                           Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End
                                 and Security Gates
               The work on the radial fences and security gates
         indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on
         2 September 1981, is now substantially complete.
               Three first team home games have been played since the
         fences were erected. We have not heard any formal comments
         from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
         their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
         South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
         satisfied with the new arrangements.
               To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
         are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
         the West Stand. Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed
         showing details of the gates.



                                                                               Yours sincerely.



                                                                            gland - No. 1134531

    I refer to your letter of 23 December 1981 and to the letter from Messrs.
    Eastwood & Partners - the Club1s consulting engineers - relating to their
    proposals to erect a pair of security gates at the base of the two staircases
    at the rear of the West Stand at the ground. From a policing point of view I
    see no problems whatever concerning the erection of these gates, subject of
    course to them being secured in a fully open position during the time the
    public parts of the ground are occupied when matches are being played.

    Dealing now with the radial fences which have recently been installed on the
    Leppings Lane terracing, I can confirm that the fences are working particularly
    well and proving to be most satisfactory in effecting the segregation of
    opposing groups of fans. Since the fences were put up there has been no
    fixture at the ground of sufficient interest to result in that entire section
    of terracing being given to one group of fans and so I am -unable to comment in
    that respect, but I see no problems whatever.

    However, there are one or two points concerning the actual construction of the
    fencing which give cause for concern from a police point of view. In some
    places the existing barrier rails have been extended -up to and completely
    through the new radial fences at a height of 4'6" or so from the ground,
    making it very easy for fans to climb from one pen to another. In other
    places the existing barrier rails have been cut off short of the radial
    fences, leaving what the police consider to be dangerous pieces protruding
    into some of the gangways. This matter has been drawn to the attention of the
    Club Secretary, who has been advised of my intention to bring it to your
    notice. I would point out that Mr. England totally agrees with police
    observations regarding the construction of the radial fences but I 'understand
    from him that it is being suggested that any alterations could conceivably
    result in a reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane terracing. I am
    not aware of the thinking behind that but for my part see no reason why that
    should be.

I apologise for the delay in replying to you but I am sure you will appreciat
that the recent bad weather has necessitated the cancellation of a number of
  tch.es at the ground which would perhaps have provided greater experience in
the handling of spectators within the new pens - particularly the match on
Boxing Day. -              ........ ...

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.                         ......

In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification,
on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
course, to the gates being secured in the fully, open position during the
time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals

As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
to make the following comments;-

(a)       Radial Barriers on West Terrace

The matches plajred at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
confirm that they appear to be working wall and satisfactorily effect the
segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section of
the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.

The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
completely through the new radial barriers at a height of 4'6" or so
from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
from one pen to another. In other places the existing crueh barrier
rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.

(b)    Security Gates around the North Stand

You will recall that m y   letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
provided that the gates    and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
impinge on the existing    critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
saw no objection to the    erection of the security gates.

I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed
has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least 7\" into the width
of the ramp. This means that there is a 15" reduction in width of the

As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due
to take place anytime around now, I would suggest the opportunity be ....
taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                  Safety of Sports Ground Act
         Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
         I believe the small number of points needing
 clarification have already been discussed between
 John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.   One of these refer to the
 need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
 in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.    There is
 also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
 of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.     There
 is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
 maintenance repair will be carried out.
         Turning now to the radial barriers -on the West
 terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
 crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
 it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
 over.   Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
 leave the crush barriers as they are.   If all barriers
 were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
 would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
                                                                                                                                 C o-jT > >J Tr&     C . £•

                                                             R e g is t ^ |   | l a n d - No. 1134531                                          th-        f


                                                                                                                                                          I
There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
view.   However from the point of view of safety a strip
of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
major hazard.
 ------ It should be kept in mind that the introduction
of these radial barriers has effected a very great
improvement from the point of view of segregation of
spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
X believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
between the various interests.
        In the second paragraph on this subject you
refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
crush barriers.   I have not had an opportunity to check
this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
the word 'dangerous' is'a little exaggerated and they
do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
gangway at this position.
        With regard to the security gates around the North
stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
the gate width is at all critical.   The remaining clear
width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
routes.   The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
to the upper set of exit stairways.   The picture is that
fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.



                      m
  OOD & PARTNERS




        There were very good structural reasons for placing
the gates in this way.   The theoretical exit capacity has
not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
'reservoir' area upstream of the gates.
        I telephoned your office yesterday but gather
you were on leave and have again telephoned this morning
with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
meeting of the working party.   I will try again in the
next day or so.


                              Yours sincerely,

    1.     Purpose of Meeting

    The purpose of the meeting was to discuss<he apparent difference of opinion
    on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
    and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
    carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

    2      n.
           vj.-round   Inspection

    A.    West Terrace

    Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
    erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
    satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

    However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
    had been extended up to and, in some cases, completeiy through the new
    radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
    who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
    nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
    left unsupported.

    IT WAS AGREED -

    (i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
    prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
    through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
    able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
    current season.

    (ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
    be cut off.

                                                1-
One of the-security-gates .which the Club wished to instal at; the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED       that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.     North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the -manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT WAS AGREED" that, as' the point might well have been covered -in t h e ......
initial consideration of the Club’s application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE - A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
              suspected, the point had been considered at a
             meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
              the relevant part of the Note of the meeting readingt-

                 "the construction and width of the ramps being
                  such that they could quite- properly be
                  regarded as elevated roadways".

D.      Spion Kop

It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
theleft of the original exit at   the top of the Kop had taken place; that
the boundary      fence at the top otthe Kop had been reinforced, andthatthe
existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
levelled off as agreed.

E.      South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F.   Items   of General Maintenance

IT WAS ^AGREED   that the following items of general maintenance required
attention

(i)   pie rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
the exit at the southerly end of the WestStand   (to be done that day),  as
well   as the rounding off of thebrackets to the North Stand securitygates.

(ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
Gate "0".




                                 03'
      (iii) The' cracks *in the- concrete terracing of the •Spion Kop to be filled.' --   v”   v

      (iv) The wooden support 'tia the electrical line between the brick built
      refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

      (v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
      to the South Stand) to be pointed.

      (vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
      the South Stand (nearest' to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and.
      exposed bar).

      G.    Temporary Structures

      Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
      of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
      television transmissions.,
>>
      Paragraph 20 of the Club's General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
      and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
      between the Police and the Club.    The Club also weregenerally required  to
      ensure that the Stadium complied   with good engineering andbuildingpractices
      and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

      IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
      under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
      Club.

      3.    Future Developments

      A.    Police and First Aid Facilities

     * It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
      Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
      that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
      forthcoming close season.

      B.   Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

      The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their
      intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
      some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
      order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
      Stadium.

      C.   Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

      Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
      rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
      When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
      walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

Tor the attention of Mr D Vaughan

Dear Mr Vaughan,
                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
       Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

    The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
their exit at the end of a game.
    We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
and new gates.
    It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                                Yours sincerely,




c .c „ Mr R. Chester

                       SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

               Note of a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
               District) held at the Police Sports & Social Club, Niagara
                             Sheffield, on 18th April 1985


PRESENT: N. Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
         C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
         R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
         G. Stanley (South Yorkshire Police)
         T. Stewart (South Yorkshire Police)
         G. Sykes     (South Yorkshire Police)
         D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
         A. Vickers   (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan   from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.    Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally- acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject tos~

(a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
      and the wall of the inner access road;

(b)   the   central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
      visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in half by a new
      central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
      pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
      to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
      secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
      on the plan to be abandoned);

(c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
      terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
      running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
      fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
      home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

(d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
      installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
      area


                                         1.
The County Fire Service saw no objection^ in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of 'the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.

(b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

            Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
            new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
            been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
            certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
            plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
            or club officials.

            Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                      Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
        Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
        In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                 However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                if these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                    a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                   It is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                        Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs#

Safety of Sport3 Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

la reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
Cc) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the reauest
of the South Yorkshire Police.

Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are In coprorated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radical fence
in the right feand area of the Mappings Lane End Terrace (indicated as”*hcrae
supporters’ terrace on the plan).



                                    Yours faithfully,

Note of, a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
the Police. Sports and Social Club, Niagara, Sheffield, on 29th July, 1985

PRESENT:    S. Allcock (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).
            N. Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
            Ms. J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police).

            Dc Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
            D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council).

         Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
         segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.   It was
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and- some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays.   The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.                  " "      -

2.     Consideration of Proposals         '         . . :   -~

The 14 detailed plans submitted'were^eac6. c<?ns£/Jf!red and discussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED — that, subject to the'following points and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations .to ^the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally, acceptables-

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes,
a pitch perimeter fence gate to b& provided;

(b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by. Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned^ so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23„ and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than, the,width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;                                         s

(c)    ^ lan ^ ? V 67°5 ^9A “ the single block thickness of the interal walls
 e ‘g* thf cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)     Plan No. 6705/10A - same conments as for plan 9A;

location required;

corner of the Spion Kop (by the' crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j )   Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May, 1985
it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards*
who must be fit, able and properly trained.

              For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

          Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                    ■.'      Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                 Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
          outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.   We note
^         the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
      by the Building Surveyors Department. We believe that all the
      calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
      checking and comment.
             With regard to your detailed observations our response
      is as follows
          (a)                     We are; not sure of the location on the West terrace of
\     the Proposed e » a security gate. There is already a gate’in-
      the 2m wide ga||.formed by the new radial fence for use by the
      police. This f^ne gate will still be available for the’spectators
      in emergency as"there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
      which will be under the control of the police.   This point may
      perhaps be clarified during the Working Party's visit on 7 August
      (b)
                            The foundations-fo^his fence are in fact already aligned in

  the way you suggest.
  (c } and (d)
        We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
 single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
 walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
 vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
 Sfcadding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
 durability, and would probably invite vandalism.
 (e^    The refreshment area is under the most westerly
 staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
 be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

         v.The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
 above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
 step-.

  Cc$:    The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
 cfccamfers which will not form good footholds.

  Ox*    Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
 object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
 the- precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

         As with point (a) , we are not sure what is intended,
 and: the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

§}>■   Your comment regarding stewarding. will no doubt, be
taken care of by Mr. Chester.


         ^         ^ much easier for your Working Party to
appreciate w|£t is intended when they see the works under
constructiorilllj. There will also be; an opportunity to see *
the metal-deeping of the South stand.        '   ;

      Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on
                            7th August, 1985

PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

           Dr. W. Eastwood (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
           P. Hough (Deputy Secretary)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

1.   Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the- "summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.   Ground Inspection.

A.   Leppings Lane End

The progress of^ the works to segregate visiting, supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and. Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meetings held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive’s letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Ekstwoodji Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment. -        '
           he*                          r - . i * •-   ..            ■: ■ ■
On the inspection**, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing w a l L which w a s b e i n g built behind the Stand. The position of the
^°o^ce ^ ersonne$ access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by, .
45 chamfer^            not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations^©! the ne w handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually beeitt*^ ; ' ■
aligned so aa^^; maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall..
and the Turnst;i.Le^.(unlike the indication on the plan_ submitted)            .

As regards the cs m g l e block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out tliat the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted,
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs.  It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets,   itbeing considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely   to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed outthat the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by thePolice.
This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required.  It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED : - ^ £ r ri                                 '

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and      female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the-new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;   ,-                   -         .. .

(c)   that a new gate iri the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;                        ..il ;

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;   :   *    *  ; - -~-

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance:

(f)   that the'corrosion of the^steer columns at the rear of the Stand
should receive attention on a maintenance basis.    ' r cct.

Messrs-
      ." Eastwootf  Partners reported that" the’condition* o£ the upper*' -tenv

investigated and;was considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted thS€ the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).



                                EJ
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.                               __

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details ofr^ie Club** s
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part oE^Ebat scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its presentsconditiou
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.         :

           experiences last season, the Club were requested io. provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front coraer nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

n WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.   North Stand                                              :;   7~ \

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports 2 a H ) iwere
inspected,                              r '              •                ■

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.        ^

E.   Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and -outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed^dTcurt
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party*

IT WAS AGREED

(a)^ that a. 2| kg. CO 2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in "both the
Police Control Box and'the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should Tie made
secure.

     The 0fficer Working Party expressed’ reservations on both of the supgestions
     proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled.   If the disabled

    The Fire Service and the Building Authority, agree* that calculations showed



                                            C3
that the enlarged Snip- Kr*f would provide for an incroaso of some 5,000
spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46. The proposals to increase the
tunnel exit on the north side of the Kop to 8 clear units and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the smith side were regarded as acceptable.
As when the original calculations had been made, the-units of exit width
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable

     (a)  adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
          upper rear and the new south side exit routes;
     (b)  to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents’
          toilets and the new ladies’ toilets in the new six unit staircase
          on the south side;
     (c)  to landings being constructed in-front of the existing emergency
          gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
     (d)  to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
          the south side and on the Penis tone Road side ;
     (e) until acceptable alternatives are available,    the new exit gates to
          be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of
          stewards.

4 .___ Roofing of Spion Kop

Whilst it was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals hadbeen
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.

IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,,
as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
unauthorised access.

5.   Crowd Flow at the Leppings     Lane End of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
to achieve this could conceivably b e more of a danger than allowing the present
position to continue.

6 .____Duties of Stewards Booklet

IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
such grounds.  Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
added if considered appropriate.

7 .____Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out




                                    CHS2
at the Oakwell Ground of the F>r>rns]ey Football Club in conjunction with the
Police and the Building Authority, and reported that thr Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

Dear Sirs,

Safaty of Sports Crounds Act, 1575
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) net yesterday afternoon to
consider the proposals contained in your letter dated 25th October 1935
and accompanying plans.                                          •. *•

1.    Disabled Facilities

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of your suggestions
for the disabled. If the disabled continue to be accommodated in *ront of
the North Stand, they will still he in the "firing line""of ais-aiaed shots
and any clear sheeting over the top of the area they occupy could constitute
an unacceptable hazard to persons who might vacate the North Stand in an
emergency situation by climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the
pitch perimeter. It is accepted that the means of escape does not provide
for this to be done, but it has to fee recognised that in practice this is a
real possibility. The structural strength of such a structure could also be
something of a problem. The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled
lu I°S \ ° f the perimeter fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to
    North Stand) is also unacceptable for the reasons stated by you.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was "that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the tersncin*'
levelled to provide, say, a twoltier .level landing on which to. accommodate
the disabled, with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch
perJ™eter fence    front of tfcss area could be removed, and the disabled
could continue to gain access from the ramp between the Spxcra Kbp and the
North Stand as at present. This would also enable free access h r the
disabled to the proposed disabled toilets under the rebuilt terracing of
the Spion Kop.

Consulting Engineers,

23 Kingfield Road,

                                                           14 November 19S5


The current legislation relating to the disabled was aiso discussed.
In the circumstances, the Officer Working Party consider that the
proposals for the disabled suggested by the Police should be supported
subject, of course, to there being no obstruction of exit routes and
flows.

2.    Enlarged Spion Kop

The Officer Working Party agreed with your calculations and proposals to
increase the tunnel exit on the north side of the Spion Kop to 8 clear
units and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party agree that, subject to the following
points, the proposals for hhe enlarged Spion Kop are generally acceptable:—

(a)   adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the upper
      rear and the new south side exit routes;
<b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents’
       toilets and the new ladies* toilets in the new six unit staircase
      on the south side;

(c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
       gates in the pitch perimeter fence (as at Bramall Lane);
(d)   to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
      the south side and on the Penistone Road side?
<e)   until acceptable alternatives are available, the new exis gates to
      be fitted with a tura-bar arrangement under the control of stewards.

3.    Roofing of Spion Kop

It was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals has been supplied
to date, but the 3uilding Authority point out that it appears that the gables
are not to be lined and thus it would be.comparatively easy for them to be
climbed.

Also the Police asked me to stress that should any of the proposed works on
enlarging or roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the cilse season,
it will be a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to
prevent unauthorised access.

4.    Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems' caused by the merging of spectators
from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings itane end.

It ;.as agreed that it was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the
physical restraints to acieeve this could conceivably be more of a danger than
allowing the present position to continue, but I was requested to register the
point.

                                      Yours faithfully,



                                      County Solicitor.

                R. Woodhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)**

1.     Welcome and Introduction

Mr. Vaughan pointed-out that the Local Government Act,' 1985/ would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan ■County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under
the Safety of Sports Grounds. Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council.  In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had been~ suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors1 Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.' -.T.-;.-"’' V            •

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer.Working Parties since 1978.    There
had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
had occurred but', in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
constructively.                                  ' .......

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his servicesrkad^wished
him well for the future.  "                *'          ‘             ‘

The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss ^the further
details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded'with'the letter
dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.     ■'

                  blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North

    _Dr. ILastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the^iipper seated area

    The.area f o r t h e suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

    As previously-:mentioned by Dr. Eastwood", the possibility of providing an
    increased width access to the pitch area (between the. North Stand and the
    Spion Kop) f°r.possible use by emergency vehicles,’ as well as for maintenance
    by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
    enlarged Spion'Xop ^proposals relatively easily.

    Xt WAS AGREED that, -whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
    was not essential yfor their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
    vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

                 (iv)         Spion Kop

    Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
    roofed, Spion "Kop, and confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
    unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
    course.of the season.

    It was noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
    front c o m e r nearest to the South Stand, with a stepped arrangement to
    assist access and egress, had been provided.

                 (v)          South Stand

    It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
    portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
    acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
    solutipn to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

    IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

               INSPECTION JULY/AUGUST 1980 OF HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM


       Items of maintenance which it is suggested should be carried
 out in the reasonably near future.


 1.            Some of the fencing posts at the top of the Kop need painting
               near the base.


2.             The fencing at the rear side of the gangway over the lower
                exit from the Kop is becoming very corroded.


3.             Theconcrete posts forming part   of the retaining wall at the
                foot of the bank at the rear of the Kop (behind Penistone
                Road turnstiles) are showing signs of spalling due to
               corrosion of the reinforcement.   The cracks should be repaired
               with either liquid epoxy or by epoxy mortar.


4.             The Denso tape wrapping on some of the starter bars at the
               back of the North West c o m e r is coming loose.


5.             Cracks running                           from thetop to near the bottom of the concrete
               terrace at the North West corner have grown more pronounced
               in the past year with salts leached out of the concrete
               being deposited on th^underside.                                               These cracks should be

 6.    There is a very small area of rust spalling on the
       ballustrade at the front of the West stand.

 7.    The boundary wall at the South West c o me r needs
       pointing in places.


 8.    Certain timbers in the roof of the South stand may   be
       suffering from damp penetration.   These can be checked
       when part of the roof is examined at the end of 19 80.

1 ._____ Purpose of Meeting..

Mr. H. E. McGee, the Club's Chairman, welcomed the Working party.           *

As had been explained in theChief Executive's letter dated 10th January to
the Club, the County Council felt it was desirable to introduce a twice-
yearly programme of visits by the Officer Working Parties to all five of
the League Football Grounds in South Yorkshire (namely, early in the year and
also in the middle of the Year) in an effort to maintain public confidence
in their safety at football grounds. Additionally, at the other grounds,
it was hoped that this procedure would obviate the real possibility of the
Clubs carrying out works which might prove- abortive or require additional
work on designation. This was the first of such a programme of visits.

2 .______ Inspection of Ground

Mr. McGee lsft to attend to other business, and the remainder of the
representatives made a tour of inspection of the ground.   It was agreed
that the majority of matters revealed (detailed below)’ could be regarded
as routine maintenance.

(a)         South Stand

The detailed inspection of a mutually agreed part of the roof structure
had taken place on 13th/14th January after the erection of scaffolding and
platforms._ Bearing in mind the age of the stand, relatively little
deterioration had taken place. It had been agreed that the apparent
deflection in the steel trusses should be monitored over a period of time.
Whilst there were signs of water staining on the roof timbers, it was by
no-means certain if water penetration was still taking place.  It was
agreed that the area around the roof hatch should be particularly investigated,
which would also give the opportunity of inspecting the roof tiles generally': ’ .*•

It was also agreed that should any of the exterior windows in the Ladies'
Toilets below the stand be broken, they would be replaced by wired or some
such safety glass.
     Except for the continuing maintenance of the concrete terracing and crush
     barriers,...the .on ly_.matter,requiring, attention was. the. infilling of a step
     adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original exit at the top of
     the Kop.                  £-.7*
                            t.   ;

    The Club had received Planning Permission and      Building Regulation approval
    to^the erection of a brick built chip shop at       the bottom right of the new
    exit from the Kop (viewed when descending).        The siting of the   chipshop
    would not interfere with the egress from the       new       Kop exit.

     (c)'    North Stand

    Expansion cracks had appeared in the wall of       the North Stand(nearest    to
    the Spion Kop) which required attention.

\   The Club were in the process of buiiding showers and changing accommodation
     attached to the existing gymnasium at the rear of the Stand. The public
     did not have access to the facilities. Additionally, the Club were
     investigating the possibility of acquiring property in Vere Road so as to
     provide an alternative exclusive access to the gymnasium without using
     the existing access through the ground.

    Revised proposals for the facilities to be provided in the new Police Post                ^
    and First Aid facilities had been agreed, and it was intended to build
    permanent accommodation in virtually the same position as the existing
    temporary structures.                                                                " '**14

    (d)     North West Corner Terrace                                                               _

    The Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete
    on the terracing, which the Board were to consider shortly.

    (e)     West Stand

1   Some cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand required pointing and then
     checking to see if the cracks re-opened.

    Apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the rear
    of the Stand required urgent attention, and attention ought also to be
    given to cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs.

    The weathering and corrosion in the base plate of the sheeting column in
    the south-west c o m e r of the stand required attention, nossibly by concrete
    sheeting.

    Finally, the steel supports to the new emergency exit (nea’rest to the
    South Stand) still required to be rounded off.

    (f)     Police Control Facilities
                                                                                             ,.i\


    The Club pointed out that the police now had exclusive use of the box
    (overlooking^the whole of the ground) previously used by the disc jockey.
    The disco unit had been re-sited underneath the original box.




                                     GB
              The Club outlined the consideration being given to the siting of caravans
              outside the Penistone- Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell .
              tickets.  It was hoped.^ that if this took place, increased entry flow of
              spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the turnstiles.

              4.______Bar Facilities" .

              The Club also outlined che consideration being given, at the request of
              the Police, to revised bar facilities at the Leppings Lane end of the
              ground.

              5 ._____Future Developments

              Whilst the proposals were in a very preliminary stage, consideration was
    .   ----- being given by the Club- to the provision of an Executive Club' . at the .......
(             Leppings Lane end of the car park under the South Stand and the adjoining
              store area. There was. also a possibility of thei-existing office accomm­
              odation being extended outwards. Additionally, the reception lounge
              might be extended, the kitchen 'area moved and a new Directors' Room built.
              It was stressed that these were long term plans and no firm proposals existed
              at the moment.

1 ._____Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 .____ Inspection of    Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)    South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to-be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)    West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.




                              •    JE9
The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take’place" "after"'
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted'that* the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.-. .... ...... ...    ________

(d)    North Stand       ,. .

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the -top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps- (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)-   General

It was noted:-       .

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penis tone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that .the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

1         Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual summer inspection carried out of all Football
League Clubs in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive’s letter to the Club dated 10 January 1981).

    _
    2_____ Ground Inspection

A         West Stand

•It was noted that there was light surface corrosion at the foot of the
 steel supporting pillar nearest to the North-West Terrace. As there was
no enclosing wing to the stand, the pillar was open to the elements.

The possibility of spectators climbing onto the roof of the store shed to
the rear of the stand and adjacent to the boundary wall was discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That the Club would arrange for the footof the steel            supporting
pillar to be cleaned and painted andpossiblyfor the gusset             plate to be
covered by a concrete haunch.

(n)    That the Club would consider whether any useful purpose would be
served by retaining the store shed adjacent to the boundary wall.

(iii) That the Club would investigate and make good the crack in the
concrete adjacent to stand entrances "W" and nX".

B        North West Terrace

It was noted that the cracks in the concrete underneath the Terrace had
been repaired and appeared satisfactory.  However, there was seepage of



                                M      b
water between the North. West Terrace, atid the .West Stand in, heavy". rainTj-jV^

IT WAS AGREED — That the Club7would make good the bitumastic sealing          ^
between the.Terrace and the West Stand.

£      North Stand : ~ ^             — ------------      -------    - — ;------ ------ —   -

A crack in the concrete at the expansion joint      adjacent to Stand entrance
"R" was noted.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would investigate and make good the crack.

D      Spion Kop

The Building Authority suggested that at some future date the Club should
consider giving attention to the original steps at. the rear of the Kop
(at the bottom of the new staircase) so as to remove the slight downward
tilt and ensure a common height of risers.

IT WAS AGREED - That, whilst there had been no reported incidents, the Club
would bear the suggestion in mind for attention at a future date.

E       South Stand

The Club reported that the gantry access to the Commentary Box on the top
of the Stand was not now      used, except by ground  maintenancestaff.

IT WAS AGREED - That the       Club would replacethe       missing ringsinthe chain
used as a handrail on the gantry.

F       Crush Barriers

The Club reported that the remaining third of the crush barriers on the
Spion Kop had now been tested.  The only problem had been rusting of some
of the clips over the top tubes. These had been replaced or would be
replaced by the start of the Season on 28 August.

A visual inspection had also been carried out of the clips on the crush
barriers on the West and North-West Terraces, and similar action taken.

G       Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand were well
on the way towards completion, and would be utilised at the opening match
on 28 August.

H      Penistone Road Side

It was noted that the steel girders adjoining the wall at the rear of the
Butcher's Shop had been satisfactorily attended to, and that the Folding
Exit Gates had had new tops and runners installed and the concrete made
good.

So far as the proposal to re-site an existing toilet block to the rear of
the Spion Kep to enable additional turnstiles and an exit gate to be
installed was concerned, the Club had reported to the Chief Executive
by letter that this had had to be deferred until the end of next season
due to the size of the problem and the possibility of creating hazards for
spectators.




                              03
    ..      Television Camera Facilities'____

     It was.noted, that the scaffolding'Toweir erected' on the Spion Kop for
     Television-camera.pupjoses had.now been'removed.

     There did not appear*to have been any progress with the Television..
     Authorities to date on the subject of permanent or semi-permanent
     facilities.
                      ■■■   •!,, i . . - ------

     J      Fire-Fighting Equipment

    Whilst the Club were’confident that all of the fire extinguishers, etc,
    were still sited as originally required by the General Safety Certificatej
    the County Fire Service felt that a routine inspection of the equipment
    would now be appropriate.

    K       Maintenance

     Certain areas of spalled concrete in the Stadium required attention, and.
J    the Club had the work in hand as items of: routine maintenance.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                 Minutes of Meeting held on 24 August

              Thank you for sending us a copy of your note of the
proceedings of the meeting.                                                  My one comment                  on these minutes
is that although the leakage of water between the north
vest terrace and west stand was discussed, there was
no commitment to effect a repair.                                                      This is not a matter
■which in any way affects the ground safety at this moment.
As I explained, creating the perfect seal at a junction
of this kind which is subject to opening and closing with
change in temperature is extremely difficult and quite
expensive.                The polysulphide sealant which would need to
be used would itself cost not less than £200 to install
but we fear that unless a carefully shaped chase is cut
into both the concrete and the brickwork the sealant
will not work.                       Thus an expenditure of quite a few hundred
pounds would be necessary and the Club is unlikely to
wish to spend this money on a matter which does not
present a hazard to spectators.                                                  Nevertheless, we will
                                                                                                                                                          ■lo
                                                                                                                                                   PT
suggest that this be put on the list of items which might
be attended to during future maintenance by the Clubs own staff'/5^

  21st February, 1983                ~                               2---

            D. Knights (Assistant Secretary)
            J. Strange (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)

            F.   J. Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

 1•     Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual winter inspection carried out of the Football
League grounds in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981), as well as to
discuss and comment on the Club's proposal to erect a new score and
message board (referred to in the letter and plans from Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners dated 7th February, 1983).

-•     New Score and Message Board

The new board was to be erected in the south west c o m e r of the ground
between the South and the West Stands at a-height of some 7 metres above
the terrace level. The siting and construction of the supporting pillars
were such that there would be no appreciable effect on the number of
spectators who could be accommodated on the terrace.

The Building Authority regarded the detailed drawings and calculations as
satisfactory, and .Messrs. Eastwood & Partners outlined the steps taken to
take effect of wind and^ice-loadings on the structure. The South Yorkshire
Police were satisfied with the assurances given that the structure would,
tor all practical purposes, be climb proof. The South Yorkshire County
i’ir'2 Service saw no objection to the proposal.

IT WAS AGREED That the Officer Working Party saw no objection to the
proposal, and that Mr. D. Vaughan would reply to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners
to this effect.

3•_____Ground Inspection

A.    West Stand

It was noted that, whilst the foot of the steel supporting pillar had been
cleared of light surtace corrosion and its gusset plate had been covered
  L n \ COnCrete,haUnCh.(3S agrec-d at the summer inspection on 24th August,
i J o 2 ) , it still required to be painted-




                                m
It was also noted that the crack in the concrete adjacent to stand entrances
"W" and "X" had been made good.

The Club had also been requested at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1982, to consider whether any useful purpose would be served by retaining
the store shed at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall.
This point was repeated, and the South Yorkshire Police added that at
some time in the future they hoped the Club would be able to provide some
form of segregation, as well as separate bar and toilet facilities, to
separate home and visiting supporters at the rear of the Stand.

IT WAS AGREED that the new expansion crack in the brickwork at the rear
corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should be
monitored to ensure its condition did not xrorsen.

B.     North West    Terrace

It was noted that the seepage of water between the North West Terrace and
the West Stand in heavy rain (also raised at the summer inspection) apparentl
continued to occur.

IT WAS AGREED that, whilst not being a matter of safety, the Club should
be recommended to replace the bituman impregnated fibre board as a matter
of maintenance to overcome the seepage problem.

C.    -North Stand

The crack at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" (which    the
Club had been requested to investigate and make good at the summer
inspection) had received some attention but could not be regarded as
satisfactory.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would give further attention to the crack.

D.     Spion Kop

All of the crush barriers had been tested since certification, the main
problem having been rusting of some of the clips over the top tubes on
certain barriers.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would investigate and make good the spalled
concrete and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop
(at the North Stand end).

E.    South Stand

In view of recent adverse weather conditions, the agreement to visually
inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection after exceptional gale
or snow loading was recalled.  It was noted that the sixth roof truss from
the East Gable (including the Gable) particularly appeared to have deflected
since the summer visit.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That some form of measuring the evident deflection in the roof
trusses was desirable, and the Club were requested to consider whether some
form of quick and/or economic method of doing so could be devised.

(ii)   That the Chief Fire Officer be requested to consider the suitability
from a fire resistance point of view of the clnddim; in the first floor
enclosed link bridge from the Stand to the Restaurant.

F.     Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand had been
welcomed by the users and were proving to be most useful.

G.    Maintenance

It was noted that certain items of maintenance throughout the ground
required attention.

IT WAS AGREED that under this general heading the Club would look particularly
into the loose wiring at both ends of the South Stand, at the pointing and
spalled concrete in the Male Toilets at the Spion Kop end of the South
Stand, and at the pointing required to the wall (including coping stones)
and -the loose metal sheeting between the South Stand and the Spion Kop.

H.    Floodlighting Pylons

Whilst the electrical contractor's staff obviously had to climb the flood­
lighting pylons from tine to time, it appeared that no regular inspection
of the pylons took place from a structural safety point of view.

IT WAS AGREED that a regular inspection of the floodlighting pylons from
a structural safety point of view was desirable, say, every, two or three
years, and that to establish the present position, an inspection  of one of
the pylons should be carried to see what was revealed.

I.    Painting of Structural     Steelwork, Roof Trusses, etc.

Whilst not being a matter of immediate concern, the Officer Working Party
felt it would be in the Club's own interests to institute a programme for
the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club should be requested to consider instituting a
programme for the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc. on.
a regular basis.

J.    Penis tone Road Side

The Club were not yet in a position to say when the proposed improvements
at the Penistone Road side of the Ground were likely to be implemented.

    ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                                         CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


              On 16 August 1982, I made an inspection of the ground,
    afterhaving had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
    on Spion Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
              At the end of June, crush barriers numbers '43, 44, 45,
    46, 51, 52, 53, 54,   62, 63, 63A, 65, 66, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78,
    79, 80, 86, 87, 88,   89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103,
    104, 105, 107, 108,  109 and 110 were tested in accordance with the
    procedures laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.
    All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
    the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.     These clips have
    been replaced.   At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
    showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
              I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
    satisfactory strength.
              Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
    Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
              Gates have been installed at various locations around
    the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
              Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
    supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate 'O' on
    Penistone Road.

            Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                   Sheffield on 11th August, 1983

 PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

            Dr. W. Eastwood (Eastwood & Partners)
            E. England (Secretary)

            Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

            Ms. J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police)
            C. W. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
            J. Miles (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
            A. Roberts (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
            D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
            D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

 lj______ Purpose of Meeting

pie purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the "summer"
inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

 In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
 regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
 Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th June). P.eports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

2._____ Ground Inspection

A»      Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1983, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands.  Evidently it
was proving to be a most welcome feature.                           *

B.     West Stand and Terrace

The Club’s intentions with regard-to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Easttrood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium.   One had
failed and been replaced.
  IT WAS AGREED -

  (I)     That,  if the Club intend’ to continue to use the former A.R.P. fauildir.
  adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would require attentio-
  m particular, as would the general maintenance of the building.

 (II )That the condition of the crack in the    non load bearing brickwork at
 the rear corner of the Stand (nea-ast to the North West Terrace) should continue
 to be monitored.

 (iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
 loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
 C.         North West Terrace

 As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
 the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
 caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
 impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
 water between the two.

 IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
 continue to monitor the position.
 £>•        North Stand

 The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
 joint adjacent to_Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was ia hand
 as a matter of maintenance.
 E.         Spion Kop

As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
and corrosion of tne roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the
 orth Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (a~d
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of**
increasing the headroom.

Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spion Koo following discing out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the^firm opinion that further work was essential. Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement.       Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
-ormer retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
o the existing barrier rails.        The Club would have to look to the contractor
r°lr! h l s ,1"surfrs)    meet th® cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.

As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing).  Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out 1X1 the letter of 29th June).
IT WAS AGREED

(i)    ^ That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
principle           r°°f of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
 (11)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
 match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
 rails must be stabilised Cpossibly by- drilling holes at intervals and
 inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
 of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
 sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

 (iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
 be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
 facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
 where these are capable of being generated.

 (iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
 with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
 support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
 in places must also not be overlooked.

 F.      "Stands'* Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the Stands club.    It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

 IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)   ^ That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel°beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)   That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.      South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,'
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
steel  supports to the sides of the concertina-type exit gate from the
Stand  (nearest to the Spion Kop).

IT WAS AGREED:-                                                '      .   '

(i)   That the Club    would remove the remaining coping stones and arrange
for the remainderof the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.                                         «



(ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme to be prepared by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for replacement of both steel supports to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

          Annual Inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                         by the Certificate of Ground Safety


                   On 25 July, 1983 I made an inspection of the ground after
 having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
 tested by members of my staff under my control.

      At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 121, 122, 123,
 124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
 136 (part), 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144 (part), 145
 (part), 146 (part), 147, 148, 149 (part), 150, 151, 152, 153
 and 154 (part), all at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
 were tested in accordance with the procedures laid down in the
 Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.

      In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
 although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
 deformed. These clips were on barrier 136 between spans 6—7
 and 8-9. New clips have been fitted.

      The only failure was the centre support of barrier 141
 where the angle leg parted where it was badly corroded. The
 angle has been plated and new bolts inserted.

      I am now able to certify that all the barriers tested
 have a satisfactory strength.

                   Various minor items of remedial work to concrete walls
 at the.back of the North stand, steps and terracing on Spion

    Kop and protection of the North side gable stanchion in the
    West stand have been completed as part of the maintenance
    programme.
             Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
     suggested should be carried out in the near future have been
    recommended to the Club.                 A list is attached.

             New toilets and turnstiles have recently been constructed
    behind Spion Kop.                  During these operations the ramp down the
V   back of Spion Kop was disturbed by movement of the embankment.
    In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
    edge of the gangway moved sideways.                  The hand rail and wall
    have now been tested in accordance with the requirements of
    the Code of Practice and in all but one case, where there was
    excessive deflection of a hand rail post, successfully
    resisted the test load.
             Following these inspections and tests, I certify that in
    my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
    satisfactory condition and are appropriate for the stadium to
    be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
    Ground Safety.

1 .____ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football League
grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate Officer Working Party.

The Club reported that the majority of the items listed as normal maintenance
items following the "summer" inspection had yet to be carried out. This was
due to a combination of the change in Club Secretary and certain development
proposals (outlined on a confidential basis) which the Club had in mind.
However, those which the Club's staff could undertakewould  be commenced shorrly
and tenders had been invited and received for the urgent remaining larger
items (to be carried out commencing in May). The exception was the roof of the
tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the North Stand end) in view of its
possible inclusion in the development proposals outlined.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.     West Stand and Terrace

It was noted that the former ARP building adjacent to the boundary wall was
in the process of demolition and the site cleared and levelled. This would
have the additional benefit of improving the access/egress.

B..    North West Terrace

It was noted that whilst generally the sealing of the cracks beneath the Terrace
to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
seepage from one of the repairs.

The possible need for protection of the wire mesh on the inside of the upper
access deck was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That theClub would continue to monitor the slight seepage    of water
from the repaired cracks under the Terrac-2 .

(ii)   That the possible need for lateral bracing co the frame of the*wire
mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access deckbe investigated  by a
test loading during the forthcomins close season.
c.      Spion Kop

As previously indicated, the Club confirmed that the remedial work to the
existing access ramp and barrier rails required as the result of the
construction"of the new refreshment and toilet^ together with the erection
of barriers to prevent access to the roofs'of the new facilities, had been
carried out.

The present condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the roof of
the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop was inspected.

The stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end     of theground
was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That the Building Authority and Mr. J. Strange of Messrs. Eastwood &
Partners should discuss and inspect that part of the perimeter fencing
erected at the northern end cf the ramp to prevent access to the roofs of the
new facilities.

(ii)   That the Club would undertake continuous maintenance work on the roof
of the tunnel exit, pending a decision on any development proposals.

(iii) That the Building Authority and    Dr. W. Eastwood should   discussandinspect
Che stability of the perimeter wall at   the Penistone Road end   during the
forthcoming close season.

D-     Lighting Pylons

The Club undertook to carry out a visual inspection of the lighting pylons during
the forthcoming close season and to make more detailed inspections should this
prove to be necessary after the visual inspection.

^*     Emergency Lighting, Fire Alarm and Public Address Systems Test

IT WAS^AGREED - That the County Fire Service in conjunction with the South
*orkshire Police and the Club’s staff, would carry out a test of these systems
at the evening match against Fulham to be held on 7th March.

 For the attention .of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                      Testing of Crush Barriers
         The barriers at the North West corner of the ground
 are due to be tested this year, which will complete the fi— st
 fiveyear cycle. As the ground is being used by a congress of
 Jehovah's Witnesses during early July, we shall be carrying
 oat the tests during June.
         Mr. Sheriff will be informed of the arrangements so
 that he can carry .out his usual inspections.


                                                                                           Yours sincerely

-Dear Dick,
                                                          Barrier Testing-::i»84':--

     On 18 and 13 June, crush barriers 155, 156, 15 7, 158, 159,
160, 164, 165, 1.661 167, 167A, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173,
174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180 (spans 3 and 4), 182, 183
 (spans 1 and 2), 184. and 185, on the north west corner terrace,
were tested irr accordance with the procedure laid down in the
Guide to Safety at Football Grounds. The barriers are shown
on the attached print of our drawing 1610/6 4C„
      Barriers 161, 162, 163, 180 (spans 1 and 2), 181, 183
 (spans 3 and 4) and 186 could not be tested because being very
close to the back of. the terrace the testing rig would not fit
into the space available. Because the distance behind these
barriers is so resitricted it is extremely unlikely that the few
people behind them will exert the full load suggested in the
•green1 guide »
             In all cases tested the barriers sustained the test load.
             On 20 June the fencing along the internal edge of the
access walkway at the rear if the north west corner terrace was
tested. Thirteen spans were tested and although the wire mesh
deformed by as much as 36mm during the load application

        recovery at the end of the final test was 100%.
             On 22 June the concrete parapet wall along the front ci
        the suspended section of terracing, in the north west c o m e r
        was tested. During the load application, movement of the
        wall was so small that readings using the measuring equipment
        could not be taken.
             Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing
        the results of all the tests on the barriers and fencing.
        We are pleased to report that none of the barriers needs
        strengthening work.
             This set of tests now complete the five year test cycle
        at the ground.


                                                .j.   Yours sincerely.

D.        North Stand

It was noted that a metal water storage tank had been installed adjacent to the
ramped access to the,upper stand level.  It was also noted that a store area

That part of the perimeter fencing erected at the norther end of the ramp at
the rear of the Kap to prevent access to- the roofs of the new facility (referred
to at the meeting on 29th     February, 1984)had been up-graded andsatisfactorily
tested to the Green Guide     requirements.

The brick built screening     wall in front of the Hale Toilets underneath the
"Stands" Club had been braced by metal supports.

It was noted that the condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the
roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop had continued to deteriorate, as had the
dividing wall between the Spion Kop and the South Stand and the outer perimeter
wall at the Penistone Road ead of the Stadium.

(iii)     That, as it apparently now serves no useful purpose, the damaged
corrugated metal sheeting between the Spion Kop and the South Stand should be
removed.

(iv)      That pointing work should be carried out as a matter of urgent
maintenance to the outer perimeter wall pending agreement between the Building
Authority and Dr. Eastwood as to its stability (during the present close season,
as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection).

(v)       That the redundant wooden post and loose wire adjoining the walkaway

                    Dr. W. Eastwood (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)

                    Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

                    D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

         1.___ Purpose of Meeting

         The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
         Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
         League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

         2 .___ Ground Inspection

         A.   South Stand

        ■ The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
          had been completed since the "skimmer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
          Working Party.

         IT WAS AGREED -

         (i)    That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
         the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
         by' the Club as a matter of maintenance.

    J    (ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
         Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

         (iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
         of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
         should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
         with the appropriate Regulations.

         (iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
         of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

         B.    West Stand and Terrace

         The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
         Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
         of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
         temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
         was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
         of the West Stand and Terrace.  On those occasions when the number of
         visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
         obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.



                                                 2 3
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.    North West Terrace

No comments.

D.   North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

E.    Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club’s development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.   Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.   Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4,    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club's
Architect and had been formally approved. •

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that Che Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes,

   Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                            Safety of Sports Grounds Act 19 75
       As requested in your letter to the Club date d 8
  January, we reply to your letter dated 4 December. We will
  reply to your earlier letter, dated 22 April, in the next
  couple of days.

        Going through the list of items accompanying your
  letter of 4 December the following are being done or have
  already been done by the ground staff - l.i, 1 .3 , 1 .5 , 1 og,
  I 08, 2.1 , 2.2, 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1.

       The concrete post mentioned in item 1.2 has been
  taken down and a new barrier rail.fitted to an existing
  steel post.

      I have not had the opportunity of speaking to Dr.
 Eastwood about the rail in item 1.4. He left for
 Australia the day after I returned from six weeks leave.
 However, enclosed is an extract from the terrace layout.
 Is it the rail which is shown in red that was agreed to?

                Item 1.7 is not understood.                                    You will recall that
 just before opening the Spion Kop, handrails were erected

 alongside the radial barriers where the members of the
 Officer Working Party considered that the step between the
 gangway and terrace was excessive.   I cannot find anywhere
 on the new terracing where an unprotected drop of over
 600mm exists.   Perhaps the location can be pointed out to
 me please.

      We do not consider that the rendering on the gable
 wall adjacent to gate 'O' warrants immediate repair. How­
 ever any loose rendering will be knocked down to prevent
 it falling on passing spectators. That job can be done by
 the ground staff.

     As I recall, when the store mentioned in item 2.3 was
inspected on 6 August, there was nothing in there that
constituted a hazard.

     A prototype of. a gate fastening is to be trialed
shortly. i will let you know when it has been fixed so
that it can be inspected. Perhaps that type of fastening
will also be acceptable on the gate mentioned in item 3 .3 .

     The comment in item 4.1 is noted but we consider that
a greater hazard exists outside the ground, caused by the
road works on Penistone Road. I have personnaly seen two
members of the public injured when leaving the ground.
One fell into an unprotected deep excavation, another
tripped over a partly excavated pavement and reguired
medical attention after receiving cuts and grazes.   I am
not aware of any similar injuries occurring within the
ground over the past few years and feel that more benefit
to safety would be gained by tidying up the pavements on
Penistone Road.

    The comments in item 4.2 are noted.

     I understand that the Club regularly liaise with the
St. John's people about manning levels and a sufficient
number of first aiders is provided for each game, in line
with the recommendations given by the Football League.

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell

Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                                    Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                                        Barrier Testing 1988

     Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
     The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds'.
                In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
     Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.

     The rail, on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now. There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.

     Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
at the West end of the ground in July, 1988. You will see from
the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
was certainly sent to Mr. Butler in your department and to
Mr. Bownes in the Legal department.   I know it is our normal
practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
so, a full set is now enclosed.
     I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
the previous week.


                                                                           Yours sincerely,

          METHOD

          The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0«5 lever arm testing machine                                                       is
          terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                     of
          the forces applied during the calibration is +0.52!.

          Three tests were made on each cylinder.

          Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

           Dear Sir,

           SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
           SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

           I refer to your letter dated the 14th March 1980, concerning the above
           subject and would inform you that so far as our primary responsibilities
           are concerned, we do not have any current problems in respect of access
           for emergency vehicles, terrace to touch line area dr communications.

           The only matter outstanding so far as the Police are concerned is the
           provision of a suitable Police room and I understand that an undertaking
           has already been received from the Club that this will be constructed
           in the closed season of 1980. In dealing with this particular aspect,
           it would also be advantageous for a site to be made available, whereby
           ground control could be maintained from a position overlooking the play
                    this is a matter which may be properly discussed at future

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                            Safety of Sports Grounds Act,' 1975
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
     Thank you for your letter of 14 November setting out the
comments of the officer working party or, the proposals for the'
new roof over the Kop. Our response is as follows

1.            Disabled Facilities
   i First it should be emphasised that the disabled will have
to be accommodated at ground level. No other arrangement is
possible at reasonable expense.   The choice is between putting
them in front of the North stand or in front of the Kop.
     Considering first the Kop, you will know that the terracing
drops down below the level of the perimeter track.   It would
therefore be necessary to place the disabled slabbing, and- seating
behind the line of the present perimeter fence. Each disabled
chair including manoeuvring space and also a runway in front
of the chairs occupies the same space as about 20 standing
spectators.                           It would therefore be ne'cessary to sacrifice the

                                                 An    Unlimited          C               istered in England - No. 1833144
                                                                              ©
equivalent of about 1000 standing spectator places to accommodate
50 disabled people and their attendants.   This would be
extremely costly. The Club has decided to increase the
capacity of the Kop by 5000 people and the additional cost
compared with merely roofing over the present Kop is in
excess of £500,000.   Thus, if 1000 standing places were
sacrificed the cost to the Club would be £100,000 at least.
Ancillary expenses would include moving the boundary fence
and reconstructing it to safety barrier standards plus the
cost of the concrete hardstanding.   We also have to keep in
mind that not only would the spectators be in the firing
line if anywhere near the goal but that in addition the new
Kop roof only extends to the front of the terracing so that
the disabled would be virtually unprotected from rain.
      The alternative proposal of leaving the disabled in front
of the North stand has the advantage that the cantilevered
roof extends some way in front of the seating so that there
is some protection from rain except when the wind is blowing
from the South,,     The Club would like to give complete
protection from rain and is prepared to consider the cost of
the glazed roofing which we have suggested as a possible way
of "increasing the comfort of the disabled.   The glazing
would of course be of toughened glass.
      If the working party has strong reservations about the
glazing then obviously it will not be carried out.     However
I should stress that there is no possibility of the disabled
being placed in front of the Kop because of the exorbitant
cost.   The Club will continue to use the present location and
the only question to be decided is whether it should be under
cover or not.
     I should add that new toilet facilities for the disabled
are an integral part of the scheme for the Kop and will be
conveniently placed under the North   end of the Kop.

2.    Enlarged Spion Kop
      Ca}- ftll exit routes will have 2.4m clear head room
       (approximately 8ft.).

      (bi We will need to discuss the proposed barrier
      adjacent to the new ladies toilet.  The exit route
      widens- out very considerably from 4.1m wide at the
      location where the six unit width has been calculated
      and is approximately 6m wide alongside the toilet block.
      We therefore believe that there is no bottleneck effect
      and that a barrier might merely provide an unseen
      obstruction which could create difficulty. • We will .
      forward a larger scale drawing of the area so that
      our comments can be considered in more detail.


   • (cl We will of course provide the landings in front
  . • of the existing•emergency gates in the pitch perimeter
      fence but you will know that there have been changes of
      view on this particular matter in the past and we would
      not wish the Club to be put to the expense of taking
      them out- again when members of the present officer working
      party are. replaced with the passage of time.

      (d) Therewill be four new turnstiles on Penistone
      Road and six new turnstiles at the South end of the Kop.

      (e) Gates with a turn-bar arrangement will be provided
      at the exits and the Club will of course provide stewards
      to control them.

3.     Roofing of Spion Kop
      The gables will be sheeted on the outside face only and
 will not be lined. This is normal in Kop buildings and we
 think it extremely., unlikely that there will be any difficulty
 with hooligans climbing. The horizontal rails are at such
 wide spacings that it would be difficult for even the most
•agile to climb up.
     We are very mindful of the need to complete the areas
open to spectators before the start of the new season. It
is conceivable that the contractors will have difficulty
in completing the new terrace steps at the rear of the Kop
before the first game. In that event secure fencing will
have to be provided as a temporary measure. However we
are reasonably confident that the whole of the terrace
area of the Kop will be complete by the due date.    We
also intend to have all the new exit arrangements completed
but it is possible that work will still be going, on in toilet
areas, particularly the new toilet for the disabled.

4.   Crowd Flow at the. Leppings Lane End of the Stadium...
     The Club is aware of the difficulties which the Police
have to contend with at the Leppings Lane end' arid has of
course been very pleaised to help the problem by. the majpr.
works which were undertaken during the last close season.
We find it very difficulty to envisage anything, more which
could be done at reasonable expense.                    '•

5.   Fire Brigate Access to the Front of all Stands
     As part of the works on the Kop, we are completely:
remodelling the area around the existing, tunnel.   The
head room is being increased to 2.4m and the width of the
tunnel is being increased also. A considerable amount of
earth shifting will have to take place arid this
presents an opportunity to widen the gangway so as to
enable say a fire engine to pass between the North stand
and the retaining wall of the Kop.   If the Fire Service
think this is of value, I should be pleased to know the
width they would like so that we can see whether it can
be provided at reasonable cost and without sacrificing, too
many standing spaces.

     S&&sr months ago we applied for Planning Approval on behalf of
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, for a new entrance on Penistone
Road. Approval was granted last September.
     €Sae purpose of the entrance is to provide access for the public
osinf t&e Sports Hall so that they will no longer have to use
Gate "O'*,, whia^ also leads to. other parts of .the ground.                                                                    Another
purpose is to provide a separate access for police vehicles, ambulances

may r e s u l t v e h i c l e s having to pass through queuing spectators

     Enclosed are six prints of our drawings 7593/1 and 7593/2

                    Dear Mr. Vaughan,


                                     Safety of Sports grounds Act 1975


                         Since you spoke to me yesterday by telephone, the St. John’s
                    Superintendent rang and X have today had a very long discussion
                    with him about the requirements at the Hillsborough Football
                    Ground. I have put my observations into a separate report which
                    I attach for your perusal# Perhaps you would contact me if you
                    require any elucidation of the points and I would esteem it a
                    favour not to get involved in any long meetings with the Club
                    Officials as there are so many demands on my time that I cannot
                    afford to be away from the office for any length of time.


                                                      Yours sincerely,




                                        Specialist in Community Medicine

 STEUCTORB

 The existing facilities are much below an acceptable standard and I
 would. suggest the Club consider providing a more permanent structure
 which is not likely to require up grading for a very long time. The
 internal finish particularly of the Treatment area should be of an
 impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered
 fairly sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by
 the use of tiles or formica type finish etc....

 WATTING AREA

 The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
 the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

 TREATMENT AREA

 The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
 patients at any one time and consideration should be given to the
           privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that
 the three patients may well "be lying on couches.

 LIGHTING

Good lighting is essential ard at the present time strip li^htin^
is very much in vogue and would be satisfactory. The provision of
a power point would also appear to be a basic requirement.

VkTSR

A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
 ° r jinking. ^ It would also appear reasonable to request provision
of a^hand basin and a large Belfast type sink. The Club should
consider whether it would be cheaper in the long run to provide
stainless steel basins which are not subject to chipping.

TO11ST KEPUIH5K5?ITS

The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
the use of the public and should consider whether they should provide
an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

STORAGE

Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and    for tv;o sets
of wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen.    This storage
should be lockable.

equipment


The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service.

Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is

Six Stretchers.

Two sets of stretcher wheels.

20 Blankets.

Six Pillows.

One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

TEL5FH0KE FACILITIES

A telephone facility -would appear to be "basic in 1979« This can be
achieved by an extension from the main switch* or sharing with police

CAR PARKING

The Club may also consider what facilities should be extended to the
St. John’s personnel for the parking of staff carse

AMBCTIAKCES

Access for ambulances at the present time appears to be adequate but
must not be overlooked in any redesigning. It is understood that the
perimeter track is insufficient in dimension to easily run the
ambulance around the football pitch.

Dear Sir,
Safety of Sports C-rounds Act, 1975
Following approval by the County Council and clarification of ccrt^in
structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am new able to formally
issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
Stadium.

As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has .yst to be detenninsd by
the County Council and I will, of course, ocntact you further on this point
as soon as possible.
I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
Schedule 2 of the Certificates-
8(1) ~ the existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim basis
       only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980
       close season;
12(1) - the arrangements for Ernergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set
        out in the letter front Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
        Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1979) are
        regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
        battery life?
14    - the existing Police facilities are accepted on an interim basis only
        pending the erection of pjipose-built facilities in the 1980 close
         season?
30    - use of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                   and
      - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.
Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue required
by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

   Dear Sir,

   Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

   I refer to your letter dated 5th April and to the recent *phone conversation
   which you had with ilr.   Vaughan of ny staff.

   I confirm that the Officer Working Party has now considered the Club's outline
   drawing of the new police and first aid facilities and, subject to the following
   points and consideration of detailed drawings, regards the proposals as
   acceptable in principle:-

   (i)      the walls of che first aid rooa to be lined with suitable non-
             canbustible material to enable the room to be easily cleaned and
             also avoid the need for re-decoration;

   (ii)     lockable storage facilities for blankets, strctchers,etc. to be
             provided in the first aid roca;

   (iii)    in view of the location of the G.P.O. iacV point in the police room,
             the telephone facility to be extended into the first aid room also;

   (iv)     the f&oors of both the first aid and police rooms to be of easily
                \nable material (such as quarry tiles>

   (v)      Uu   woor of che detention roon in the police rooa to be at least
            2" thick and fitted with a 5 lever moi'tise lock, and to open outwards
            in the direction cf the top of the plan suppliedj

   (vi)     the roof ever the two rooas   to be of suitable non-corabustible
            material;

            the need for the building to be robustly constructed, (cspccially
            tiie detention roon) without reducing the internal dimensions to be
            borne in aind;

   (viii)   the building generally (and the toilet accomodation particularly)
            to be adequately ventilated, and suitable drainage facilities to be
            provided.

Additionally, two other matters were raised at the Working Party                meeting. The
first relates to the subject of temporary structures. This was,                 of course,
referred to in my letter dated 31st March, and no doubt you will                let me know,
m due course, what progress is being made on the preparation of                 the proposals
for semi-permanent or permanent facilities.

The second matter relates to the concern felt from a public order and safety
point-of view-  by-
                  spectators-(particularly during evening fixtures) spilling out....
on to Penistone Road whilst trying to gain admission to the Ground. As you are
aware, the Penistone Road-at thet point is both the main A61 Sheffield/Barnsley
road and a feeder toute from the city centre to the ML Motorway at Tankers ley
and, as such, carries considerable volumes of traffic at all times. There is
a very, real fear th<rfc a s«rious accident will result unless something can be
done to enable spectators queuingto gain access to the Ground       -that point to
enter more rapidly than is possible presently.

This was, of course, a matter discussed at the Ground Inspection on 4 th February,
1982.- It was understood at that time that the Club intended to carry cut t-.-rrk
in the close season to rcctify the problem. In this connection, it is suggested
that the most viable method of improving the situation is to re-site an existing
toilet block to the rear of the Spion Kop to enable an additional minimum, of
six (but preferably twelve) turnstiles to be installed, together with an
additional exit gate. The exit ’•“ •jths on the Pensstone P,.oad side of the Ground
are, of course, just acceptable and an extra exit would relieve the situation.

Ihe County Council feels justified in requesting n o n firmly that the Club
sl-o-i-*.*  action in the forthcoming close season to relieve the admission
(and to a lesser extent, the egress) problems at the Penistone Road side of the
Ground, should a decision to do so not have already been taken by the eiu’- .

                                            Yours faithfully.




                                           Chief Executive.

     For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


     Dear Sir,

     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

     Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
     Club.

     Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

     An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
     comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
     individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
     it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
     various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

     MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

     North Stand

     Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

     The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.85
     in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

     There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
     with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
     ment of these buildings.

     Spion Kop

     A.   Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has -not
           received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
           installation, this should be removed immediately.

     B.   It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
           part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                              All communications        ised to the Chief Fire Officer.
       with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bottom and open in
       a sideways direction.    It is doubtful that if it were necessary to
       evacuate the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
       open if pressure were generated by a crowd.      No record can be found
       in respect of discussion on gate fastenings.      It is recommended that
       a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side should
       be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

 C.   During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps on
       the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the complete
       step had erroded away.    Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure
       that all steps are kept in a good state of repair.

 D.   The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
       climbed is ineffective.    It has been observed that patrons visiting
       the Kop can, in large numbers from the back of the Kop, climb into the
       lower half of the roof.   The mesh should be extended to alleviate this
       situation.

 E.   It was observed that where the terracing is above 1 m higher than the
       lateral gangways wire mesh infill' had not been located along the full
       lengths.   Where the mesh had been provided this had been spot welded
       but the mesh had not been given an additional vertical support.

F*    Exit Sates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning                 the
       gate before patrons enter the stands.

West Stand"

A.    Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been there
       for some considerable time. No record exists of:-

      (1 )    acceptance of these units or,

      (2 )    that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.
B.    Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item B under Spion Kop above.

South Stand

The accommodation is divided into four areas:-

A.    Ground floor     offices,   directors   suite,   players   area,   function   suite,
      kitchen etc.

B.    First floor, upper stand walkway,        press lounge, players lounge,        paint
      stores, disused bar area.

C.    Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

D.    Rear stand, covered seating.

With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

A.    Ground Floor:-

         (i)    During normal working hours most doors from the office area
                are kept locked shut.   All doors marked    ’Fire Exit’ should
                be made readily available for use by any person within the area.
                                      -   3 -



       (ii)    A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
               and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
               fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
               also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
               by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

               The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
               should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
               requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

      (iii)    All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
               areas always maintained free from such storage.

B.   First Floor:-

        (i)    Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
               the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint
               store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
               should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

       (ii)    Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
               five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
               off should an emergency arise.

      (iii)    All timber construction within this    area   should   be   suitably
               treated so as to be flame retardant.

       (iv)'   The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
               mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
               be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
               should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
               is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
               licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

        (v)    The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
               should be removed from this area.

       (vi)    In the cleaners' cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
               separation between the ground and first floor levels is breached
               by the passage of       cables through a wall.    The areaaround the
               cables should be infilled with material to ensure a minimum
               fire resistance of thirty minutes.

      (vii)    All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
               it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
               being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
               rebates.

     (viii)    Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
               purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

C„   Uncovered Seating Area:-

     The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
     the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
     evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
     ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
     This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
     to 1 m high at the West end.


                                    PHI
                                     -   4   -




     To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
     that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D.   Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand):-

     The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
     in that escape is possible in one direction only, -this being down through
     areas described in A and B above.

     Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
     later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
     means of escape from the covered seating area would be acceptable.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
in the South Stand.

It is recommended that such provision should be made in all areas beneath
the seated area of the stand as soon as possible.    The system should also
cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
fire detection be provided in that Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING         ,

Spion Kop

The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

South, North and West Stands

In letter dated 12th November, 19&0, from Eastwood and Partners, it was
suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a period
of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years for
North and West Stands. As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
maintenance records have ever been re-presented.     The emergency lighting
system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the ground and test
certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
to B.S. 5266.

FIRE ALARM

West Stand

Existing call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of ■
franchise areas and be increased to cover the upper areas of the stand.

North Stand

As West Stand above.
South Stand

This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
of call points.

Indicator Control Panel

The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
be: -

1.      Police control box

2.      Main office reception area

FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

The current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
is considered satisfactory.

GATES

The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
While the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
the Officer concerned.

Yours faithfully,

Sear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounda Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

In Noveaber 1986 1 asked both the Police and Fire Service to consent on the
condition of your stadias having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. 1
have alao asked the Building Surveyor to sake similar contents but I have not
received them as yet.

The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
with the stadlua and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
receive ia very satisfactory.

The Fire Service have, however, made a nuaber of consents and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to ne of 18th February. Some points in Che
letter have now been further clarified as follows

(a) The timber buildings referred to should (if ctlll required) be re— sited away
from the walkways.

(b) As far aa the   locked doors in the aouth stand are concerned they will   be
dealt with by the   Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

(c) Gates awst be unlocked and stewarded at all tines, during watches: if this
cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
particularly like to refer to the e o m e n t s which are aade in respect of final
exit gates. As you can see fro* the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
their useful life they mtst be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
Service have alao produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) toshow a
better arrangeoent for securing the sliding gates against forced entry froa the
outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this'hook
type arrangement will be aore easily used in the event of an eaergency than the
current locka, about which they are very concerned.

Enc*
BH                                                    734005 - Mr. Bownes

Would you please let ne have your coamencs cm the Fire Service letter as   soob   as
possible.

                  Means of Escape in Case of Fire
                  North Stand

                              With the exception of a small hut and the steel
                   clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
                   located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
                   clad buildings have been removed.
                       We believe that the reference in the minutes
                  dated 7 August, 1985 was to storage facilities and
                  not to buildings.

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)   Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     jo b .
     d)   The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
     as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
          We disagree that spectators climb onto the
     ste'elwork in large numbers although we do not deny
     that-the police have, at some matches, had to tell
     a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
          The cost of erecting a full height fence
     would be several thousands of pounds. The Club is
     not at present contemplating that magnitude of
     expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
     their own foolish behaviour.
     e)   There are four or five lengths of barrier
     where the drop in front is just over one metre,
     but as far as we are aware this has not created
     any hazard. In fact to the contrary, because
     people can leave the ground by going under the
     barriers onto the lateral gangway. This is a
     common feature of most league grounds.
          The welding is performing well and it seems
     that any additional vertical support is
     unnecessary.   However, the welding can be inspected
     at regular intervals to make sure that it con-
     tinues to hold the mesh securely.

     f)   Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground. The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand

     a)   Do we understand correctly that the
     reference to 'timber framed and clad units' is to
     the bar fittings at first floor level? If so, then
     those fittings were part of the. original construction
     for which Building Regulations Approval has been
     granted. There has not been any previous comment
     about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
     or other stands. We do not consider that they
     present a hazard.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     South Stand

    a)   (i) We note.the comment about the doors and
    this point has been dealt with under the regular
    procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
    the Fire Precautions Act of 19 71 for the offices.
    Fire Officer Roger Woodhouse has been dealing with
    the matter.
          (ii)        We see the principle behind the creation
     of fire compartments. That is sensible. Sealing
     off the windows is not difficult but the provision
     of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
     very expensive. A major exercise such as providing
     ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
     redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.
EASTWOOD «r PARTNERS                                  SHEET




         (iii)     We agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes. There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match days.
     b)    (i) It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
     ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
     be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
     controlled shutters. Those grilles and shutters
     were fitted although we see that two recently
     installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
     and shutters. As the form of fire protection from
     those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
     Service,the Club are not prepared to have ducting
     installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
     fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
     shutters.
          (ii) A close inspection of the gas supply pipe­
     work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
     valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
     when there is only one appliance in the bar. The
     pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
     been replaced recently but without a valve.
               However, there is a master valve, at
     ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
     to the whole of the first floor. That valve was
     installed at the request of the Fire Service in
     1980.
         (iii)    We confirm that all the timber facing onto
     the public circulation areas was treated with an
     intumescent paint during the work carried out in
     1980. Since then the walls have been re-decorated

      but this does not reduce the effect of the
      intumescent paint underneath.
             (iv)        We cannot understand this comment because
      the paint store was constructed in its present
      position on the advice of the Fire Officer.                    A
      special 'non-sparking' light fitting was even
      installed on his recommendation.               It is not contem­
      plated to move the store again after spending money
      to build the store in its present position.
              (v)   We do not consider that the two laminate
      covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.                  As for the
     wooden cupboards, they have been on the first floor
      for many years and no previous adverse comments
     have been made by the Fire Service about their
     presence.
             (vi)        We agree that the holes round the cables
      should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
     material.
           (v ii)          As f a r a s we a r e aware a l l d o o rs le a d in g

     was done in 1 9 7 9 -8 0 .
           (viii)     We agree that the spaces above toilet
     accommodates should not be used for storage but
     believe that the Club have now removed the stored
     materials.

      c)      We believe that clinbing over the existing low
     wall does not present any difficulty in the event
      of an emergency.        Spectators will go over the wall
     whether there are gates or not.                We do not consider
      that the installation of gates is necessary.

     d)   Escape through the rear of the stand has always
     been accepted by the Officer Working Party.   Further­
     more, it has been readily accepted with the
     protection which has been provided so far to the
     escape routes.

     Automatic Fire Protection

          We will suggest to the Club that proposals
     should be put forward for the provision of a fire
     detection system but the system is not likely to be
     installed until the major re-development of the South
     stand which is planned for 1991
     Emergency Lighting

          Testing of the emergency lighting system is
     being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
     Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
     time for carrying out the test«
          The testing of the general electrical circuits
     will also be organised over the next few weeks and
     a current IEE Certificate produced.
     Fire Alarms

          The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
     the call points in the bars in the stands. Moving
     the call points again is out of the question.
     Inidcator/Control Panel

          The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
     time of installation, where the indicator/central
     panel should be placed. The Club was told that it
     should be located in the Police control centre,
     where it is now. No duplicate panel was asked for
     and it is not considered that one is necessary.

      Gates
              The comments about the gates are noted.


     The Club have expressed to us their increasing con­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors. Whereas we agree that many
of the observations and recommendations are of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion. Some consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
appreciated.

           THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

          ANNUAL INSPECTION OF SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
          ON THE 19th MAY, 1988

          I write with reference to the above and following our recent site meeting
          and safety inspection of the named premises.

          I would confirm that while the general standards of health and safety-
          being maintained were found to be satisfactory a number of points did
          require attention. I have itemised these below for your convenience.

          Spion Kop Development

          1.   The pylon situated to the left-hand side of the kop was not suitably
               protected from unauthorised access and climbing.

          2.   To- several locations around the kop, accumulations of associated
               builders wastes and stonework that could easily be obtained for use as
               projectiles were noted.

          3.   At some positions within the new development, there is a difference in
               height between a terraced area and radial gangway of over 600mm.  I
               would advise that these areas be protected by a suitably constructed
               pedestrian guardrail.

          4. An area of stair nosing wasfound to have become defective upon the
              "new" part of the spion kop and a similar defect was located upon the
              older radial gangway.

          5.   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of minor
               repairs.

          6.   A loose rainwater pipe and length of guttering were located to one of
               the Penistone Road turnstiles.

          7.   An area of glazing serving one of the Penistone Road turnstile huts
               has been broken.

          8 . The club might consider  the nowcombustible nature of much of the
               vegetationsituated immediately  behind the spion kop and take the
               appropriate remedial action.

          9.   The rendering to the entrance gate side wall was still found to be in
               a loose and defective condition.

          West Stand

          1.   In a number of cases terrace nosings require to be repaired.

I.    Purpose of Meeting

The original intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding matters
referred to In the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
or were in the course of completion prior to the anticipated issue of the Certificate
by the County Council this week.

2.    Minor Matters

An Inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the m xt *
few days.

3 .____ Major Matters

A.    Emergency Lighting - SOuth Stand

The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and M essrs.
Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on tte South Stand Emergency Lighting
had produced agreement on an interim arrangement which would be regarded as



                                      'B U D
                                                   /




acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life. Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existing installation. Details were
contained in the letter dated 12th December which M essrs. Eastwood and Partners
had addressed to the Fire Service.
     ✓
B.       South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, it was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by M essrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the last week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide t o required information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a specific
written request for such a fall structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that it had been Inherent in the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building Regulations and
the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
stability of the South Stand in conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
was mentioned.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
same specification or the sane construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, for instance, none of the buildings in Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Research Station was \
evidently thinking In terms that thesis requirements were unrealistlcally high. In
his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able in practice to meet
the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
being possibly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
and consequently no spectators would be present.

Experience of the corrosion of indoors steel in the Sheffield area showed this to be
minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures such
as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
visual inspection. Even though he did not consider it essential, plaiting of the
front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
Building Authority's concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
was a structural problem. Reference was made to the Guide's advice that when
assessing whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood's
view, It would be unreasonable-and unnecessary to Insist on a full structural survey
of the South Stand or to delay the issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
opinion (which he was most jealous of and would not put in jeopardy) that the South
Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was '
appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
to them should this be necessary.
IT WAS AGBEED that:

(a)    as there was no obvious deterioration in the South Stand structure of such
       a nature, as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
       continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
       provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred in the intervening
       period, and

(b)     a further meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
        Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss the structural integrity of the
       South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
       to be present at Dr. Eastwood's request).

NOTE As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the Fire Service and Police representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
     termination.

1.         Purpose of Meeting

la view of the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 12th April and following recent
visits' by the disciplines represented on the Working Party, the Chief Executive of the
South Yorkshire County Council had raised with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
matters which apparently were still outstanding.

A letter of reply dated 3rd April had been received from the Club, as well as letters dated
4th and 8th April from the Club's Consultants, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners, giving
details of the present position.

2.         Inspection of Ground

The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

(i)       Training of Safety Stewards

           The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing thetraining of the Safety
           Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but with
           agreement the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday.
           A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities was handed to the Club's
           representatives.

(ii)      Exit Signs

           The Club's representatives feltthat the exit signsgenerally hadbeen    sited .where
           required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

           It was agreed that there were a number which could be more advantageously sited
           and/or illuminated, and some which might be more effective with larger lettering
         and/or direction arrows. The County Fire Service undertook to liaise with
         Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.

(iii)    Emergency Lighting in the South Stand

         As was evident, complete re-wiring of the South Stand with separate circuits had
         already commenced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let Messrs. Eastwood
         and Partners know their detailed requirements.

(iv)     Fire Warning System                 *

         The Fire Warning System had been installed, except for the trickle charger and
         battery equipment. These items had been subject to delivery problems, but the
         system should be complete by the end of the month.

         It was agreed that as regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final, the Police Communications
         base which would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if
         necessary.

(v)      Sealing of Fire Resisting Frames

         The sealing of the fire resisting door frames against the supporting walls had generally
         been carried out, but there were a small number which were now showing signs of
         small gaps.

(v*)     Fire Betardent Paint

         The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fire retardent paint had been specified on the
         partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
         14th April, it was .not possible to say with certainty at this time whether it had actually
         been used.

(vii)    Wired Glass

         The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired glass had been used
         wherever required by the County Fire Service.

         The County Fire Service and the Police were generally satisfied that the small panes
         of glass in the upper half of the wooden partitions within theSouth Stand would not in
         normal circumstances be regarded as a fire and/orsafetyhazard.          TheClub agreed in
         the longer term to consider the fitting of wired glass and, in the short term, to
         consider fitting wooden battons as an interim measure.

(viii)   Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

         Whilst there were a number of sharp corners on the supports, these were at a height
         of at least seven feet. However, the Club undertook to round them off.

(ix)     Perimeter Fencing on the Spion Kop

         The Club pointed out that this had been tested where feasible and the results forwarded
         to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Building Authority on
         30th January.
Possible Step Obstruction on Upper-Exit Area on Spion Kop

Whilst it was agreed that'the erection of the barriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
a small adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lower level
than the remainder of the exit, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
undertook to give attention to it in the longer term.

Mesh Fencing under North Stand

In view of the normal crowd flow rates on the public side of the mesh fencing and the
fact that there was no public access to its rear, it was felt that the timber framed
mesh fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable.

                    Annual Inspection of Hillsborough Stadium as required
                            by the Certificate of Ground Safety



                    On 18 July 1988, I made an inspection of the ground
during the time that this year's quota of crush barriers
were being tested by my firm.
     The results of the crush barrier testing are given
in a separate report of today's date.
      I made a visual inspection of all the main structural
 features of the ground. Particular attention was paid to
 gates ana entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
 fences.   No significant defects were noted.
      The roof of the South stand was inspected from the ground.
-Ko deterioration in its condition was observed.
     I certify that in my opinion the various structures on
the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
the Certificate of Ground Safety.

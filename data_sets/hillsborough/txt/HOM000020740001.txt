HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


I mentioned to you on the telephone on 14 September that Lord
Justice Taylor has asked Professor Leonard Maunder, one of his
Assessors on his Inquiry, to convene a small working group to
review the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.  I said that Lord
Justice Taylor very much hoped that the Football Association
would be able to nominate someone to sit on this working party,
and you accepted that invitation. You said you would consider a
nomination, and I should be grateful to hear from you as soon as
this is decided.

The terms of reference of the working party are set out on the
attached note: the rest of the membership is still being
finalised but will be about six.        *.

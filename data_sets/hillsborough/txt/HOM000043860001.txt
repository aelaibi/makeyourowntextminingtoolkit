      The disaster at H illsborough Stadium on 15 A pril 1989 was one o f the m ost appalling

      events this country has experienced since the war.

      2.        TtremUmb'ers killed - 96^ w ere r e i y h igh . IBut the tragedy was com pounded by the

      large ^jjumber^of children and young people w ho were crushed to death, by its association

      w ith seceer, our national g am ^ ^ n d by the fact that the disaster unfolded via television

      3.        There is another reason w h y that day has been such a trauma for the relatives and

      friends o f those killed or injured, and for the C ity o f Liverpool. The deaths could not be

      explained by som e A ct o f God, by som e event o f nature so unforeseen as to be beyond the

      culpability o f any human being. Instead, from the second that the Leppings Lane gate was

      opened, everyone knew that this was a disaster w hose root was entirely human, caused by

      the error, incom petence, com placency, or worse, o f people entrusted to secure the safety o f

      those w h o attend football matches.                    3 ^ 5 ^            H v ^ '-

      4.       The H om e Secretary o f the day, the then Kenneth Baker, was therefore entirely

      right to establish just tw o days’ later a very full inquiry into the disaster, under one o f the

      m ost senior and respected judges available, Lord Taylor o f Gosforth.



      5.       Lord T aylor’s inquiry took oral evidence from 174 witnesses at public hearings

      during May and June 1989 and considered m any other statements and over 70 hours o f

      video evidence. In his interim report published in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that

      the disaster had a number o f causes. H e did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or




      Speech:Hills8my
person, but in paragraph 278 he concluded that “The main cause o f the disaster was the

failure o f police control”.



T h e Inquests



6.     Inquests were held by the Coroner for South Yorkshire to determine the statutory

questions as to w h o each o f the deceased was, and w hen and h ow he or she died. In March

1991, after hearing the evidence o f around 200 witnesses, the inquest jury returned verdicts

o f accidental death in respect o f all the victim s.



T h e crim in al and disciplinary in vestigation



7.     There was also an investigation, conducted by W est Midlands Police and supervised

by the Police C om plaints A uthority, to establish w hether there were any grounds for

criminal or disciplinary proceedings.



8.      The D irector o f Public Prosecutions considered the W est Midlands report and took

advice from Q ueen’s C ounsel.           The D P P ’s decision was that no-one should face

prosecution as a result o f the events that day. The Police Com plaints A uthority, though,

decided that C hief Superintendent D uckenfield and Superintendent Murray should face

disciplinary charges o f neglect o f duty.          In N ovem ber 1990, C hief Superintendent

D uckenfield retired from the force on the grounds o f ill health before disciplinary

proceedings could be com pleted.         U nder police regulations, a discipline hearing cannot

proceed w hen a police officer retires.        The Police Com plaints A uthority subsequently

decided to w ithdraw the charge against Superintendent Murray because they considered

that it w ould have been unfair to pursue what in effect was a joint charge, in the absence o f

the m ore senior officer.



9.     Lord T aylor’s inquiry and report was as thorough and impartial as one w ould

expect o f such a great judicial figure. H is report has led to lasting im provem ents in the

safety o f football grounds, in crow d behaviour and control. T hough this    13   o f -no com fort

              10.     But there has been sustained criticism of both the coroners inquests, and above all

              o f a police discipline system so defective that no one was brought to book.



              11.     C oncern that the inquests had not properly been conducted led six of the bereaved

              fam ilies to seek a judicial review o f the inquests. Their application was heard in 1993. The

              D ivisional C ourt investigated the matter w ith great thoroughness, and looked in particular

   XI        at the 3.15 pm cut-off point, but it decided tjjfat there were no grounds for overturning the
   V         1990 inquests. v'C /'djxy] ,



              12.     «For m any o f the families, the sense o f grievance on ly increased w ith the passage of

              tim e, and th ey decided that more should be don ej& get at the truth as th ey saw it o f what kco^-

16.      I thought that there was, on the face o f it, sufficient to warrant a further

investigation; but since there had been a very thorough inquiry by Lord Taylor, very

lengthy inquests, and the W est Midlands Police inquiry, I decided that what in the first

instance was needed was a judicial scrutiny o f the n e w ^ & t^ to determine w hether these

form al inquiriesjshould be re-opened.

      16.    I thought that there was, on the face o f it, sufficient to             warrant a further

      investigation; but since there had been a very thorough inquiry by Lord Taylor, very

      lengthy inquests, and the W est Midlands Police inquiry, I decided that what in the first

      instance was needed was a judicial scrutiny o f the new evidence to determine w hether these

      form al inquiries Should be re-opened.



      17.     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith as a senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal was

      em inently qualified^to conduct^an independentjthorough scrutiny o f the evidence.            The

      terms o f referenc^I gave him were very wide and enabled him to establish conclusively

      w hether any material evidence had been overlooked and to recom m end appropriate action.

      H is terms o f reference were:



              “T o   ascertain w hether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the

 18.    I appointed Lord Just Stuart-Smith on 30 June 1997.           I published his report on

 18 February 1998.      I want to place on record, again, m y thanks to him for the

thoroughness, and impartiality, w ith w hich he conducted the scrutiny.

whatsoever.                     -—



21.    Let me explain w h y that has to be so.



22.    There is, first, the overriding issue of who was to blame for the disaster.


23.     If blame had not so far been allocatedtand new evidencenafl w ho to blame was now

25.    A nd far from recoifcltig from this judgement - or taking part in a “w hitew ash”, as
                              i-                                       _ tfSo#lr!T         A. 7^-A-vv..
som e have ludicrously charged, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith repeated this conclusion^in the ‘

m ost strident o f terms. Indeed (paragraph 100 p. 87) he referred to C hief Superintendent

D uckenfield as having uttered a “disgraceful lie” about Gate C being opened by fans, and

he quoted w ith approval Lord Taylor’s “stinging rebuke” o f South Yorkshire police for

failing to concede that they were in any respect at fault.



26.       Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also unearthed the fact that som e o f the original

 statements made by individual police officers had been edited for solicitors acting for South

Yorkshire police. A t appendix 6 he gives one example. H e considered w hether the$r were

 how ever covered by legal professional privilege, and so could not be made public.                        He

 concluded that such privilege did not apply.         In consequence, I have made every such

 statem ent available to the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group, and placed copies in the

 Library o f the H ouse.

 27.      The new ewidesce (j>ut before Lord Justice Stuart-Smith by the television

 programme and the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group fell principally into tw o areas -

video evidence, and that relating to the 3.15 pm cut-off point for the inquest.



 28.      Let me deal w ith these in turn.

                                                      to,'cXK'*
29.       First, there is the question o f the missing^/tapes. T w o tapes were stolen. Their theft

- still unsolved - has understandably heightened concerns about a “cover-up”, w hich were

com pounded by the extra-ordinary and pervasive denial o f responsibility by South

Yorkshire police at the tim e. But the crucial thing about these tapes is that they contained

no material evidence not otherwise available.          O ne was entirely blank as the camera

concerned had been pointing at a wall. The other show ed turnstiles 9-16 at the Leppings

Lane end, next to turnstiles A-G , w hich them selves were m onitored by police C C T V




                                                  6
     camera 1. W hat happened on these turnstiles was recorded on both the police tape (TB2)

     and tape RJH2, w hich consists o f camera output viewed in the club control room .



     30.    C ounsel for the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group made five subm issions/on

     behalf o f the Group, listed at paragraph 33 on p. 20.                                     ^



            (i)        That the police blamed their failure to see the overcrowding in pens 3 and

                       4 o f the Leppings Lane end on camera 5 being defective w hen in fact it

                       was not.



            (ii)       That the evidence o f the video tapes taken from camera 5 was deliberately

                       suppressed and concealed.



            (iii)      That the coroner deliberately failed properly pursue the question o f the

                       “m issing video evidence”.



             (iv)      That police officers gave deliberately false evidence that camera 5 was not

                       w orking correctly.



            (v)        That evidence from Mr Roger H ouldsw orth, a C C T V technician in the

                       club control room , was ^uppressed. Mr H ouldsw orth, w ho featured so

                       prom inently in the          in -Aetjon programme, claimed that he could

                       see from m onitoring police cameras that pens 3 and 4 were overcrowded

                       and that a dangerous situation was likely to arise because o f the influx o f

                       fans through Gate C.


                                                                           •T
X?   31.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith goes through each o f the subm ission w ith great care.
                                                                          A-

     32.    H e describes subm ission 1 as “quite untenable” (paragraph 61), subm ission 2 as

     “com pletely unfounded” (paragraph 77), subm ission 3 as “unfounded” (paragraph 79),

     subm ission 4 as “evidence w h olly insufficient to warrant consideration o f criminal

     proceedings against any police officers” (paragraph 93).



                                                    7
33.     A s to subm ission 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith emphasises that Mr H ouldsw orth’s

existence, and his evidence, were know n both to the Taylor Inquiry and to the Coroner,

and that his evidence, even if correct, w ould not have had any effect on the previous

proceedings.



34.   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also deals w ith the credibility o f Mr H ouldsw orth,
                                                                                     •«

H e said that he was “unable to accept” that his recollection o f events n ow is accurate”, and

adds that “the im portance o f his evidence has been exaggerated out o f all proportion”.



Madam Speaker,                                                          < 3 ..

35.     T he second m ain issue-of^new evidenced related to the inquests.

                 lA J & lT IAI n r o ~\ ,                                                           j
36.     T he use o f the 3.15 pm cut-off has long been a matter o f controversy to the fam ilies.^/

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found no grounds to conclude that the conduct o f the inquests

was flawed. H e says that the cut-off point did not lim it the inquiry undertaken by the
                      r^)L^CA
inquest and it was nptjisuggested by the coroner that all those w ho died did so before

3.15   pm . The inquest jury heard evidence about those w ho died after arrival at hospital

and o f those w h o were treated and recovered. It was on ly in relation to h ow and by what

means the deceased came to their deaths that the cut-off tim e was imposed. Evidence that

som e people died after 3.15 pm w ould not, therefore, effect the outcom e o f the inquest.



37.     O ther allegations related to the rescue operation, and to alleged improper

interference w ith witnesses.     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith noted that Lord Taylor had

inquired into the rescue operation and criticised the slow response o f the police.         Lord

Justice Stuart-Smith found no evidence o f want o f care by the em ergency or medical

services and, in his view , no purpose w ould be served by any further inquiry into this

aspect o f the disaster.




                                                8
    38.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith investigated in som e depth allegations that certain

    witnesses were pressurised by the W est Midlands police to change the evidence w hich they

    wished to give. H e concludes that there was no im proper attempt to affect their evidence.

^   H e also exam ined carefully the statements w hich the South Yorkshire police obtained

    from their ow n officers, som e o f w hich were amended on the advice o f force solicitors. H e

    is satisfied that the Taylor inquiry and the inquest were not in any w ay inhibited or

    impeded by what to ok place. In a very few cases referred to in appendix 7 o f the report,

    what was excluded was either factual or com m ent in w hich factual matters were im plicit

    and he says that “it w ould have been preferable “for those matters not to have been

    excluded”.



    39.    Against this background, the question is what a further opening o f full inquiries, or

    inquests, or disciplinary procedures could achieve.



    40.    A re-opening o f Lord Taylor’s inquiry w ould serve no purpose, and since I

    published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report on 18 February I have heard no^argument

    against that£ Since there was cover-up neither by Lord Taylor nor Lord Justice Stuart-

    Smith, w e k n ow already w ho was principally to blame - the police - and thankfully Lord

    T aylor’s recom m endations about the safety o f soccer grounds have already been

    implem ented.



    41.    W hen I talk to the bereaved families m uch o f their anger continues to focus on the

    inquests, and on the police disciplinary procedures.



    42.   So far as the inquests are concerned, there was no evidence before Lord Justice

    Stuart-Smith w hich could result in/application by the A ttorney General to set aside the

    inquest verdicts, not least giveij( that the conduct o f the inquests was jy e v y thoroughly

    exam ined by the D ivisional Court in 1993.



    43.   But I accept, as I believe does the w hole H ouse, that inquests o f this kind turn the

    screw on bereaved families w ithout adding understanding on questions o f culpability.




                                                   9
44.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report        underlined the need to make im provem ents

to the inquest system. In the case o f H illsborough, it was clearly unsatisfactory that the

families suffered additional distress as a result o f the inquest proceedings and the jury’s

verdicts o f accidental death w hen the causes o f the disaster had already been established by

the Taylor inquiry and the D PP had announced that there w ould not be any prosecutions.



45.    I have made clear that the inquest system, in its present form, is unsuitable for

dealing w ith disasters such as H illsborough.      The H om e O ffice W orking Group on

Disasters and Inquests, w hich reported in March 1997, recommended that the role o f the

inquest should be lim ited where a public inquiry has already been held.



46.    A com prehensive public inquiry w hich also addressed the questions before an

inquest w ould relieve the coroner o f the need to resume the formal inquest. The changes

recom m ended by the H om e O ffice W orking Party point the right w ay forward and the

Governm ent w ill lo ok for a suitable legislative opportunity to amend the C oroner’s

A ct 1988.



47.    It has often been asked o f me, if the police were to blame, w hy has no police officer

been brought to book?        The on ly answer, very far from satisfactory, is that police

disciplinary procedures have been so defective that individual senior police officers can

utter “disgraceful lies” and act w ith contem ptible incom petence w ithout penalty.



48.    A s I said in m y statement to the H ouse on 18 February, I fully understand the

public disquiet that those w ho have been criticised by the inquiries into this disaster have

not been prosecuted or disciplined in respect o f their actions. It is not possible, however, to

turn the clock back and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is satisfied that there is no new evidence

w hich he considered w hich should be put before the D irector o f Public Prosecutions or

the Police C om plaints A uthority. I firm ly believe, though, that there is a com pelling case

in the light o f H illsborough and other cases for reform o f the police disciplinary system.



49.    In January the H om e Affairs C om m ittee published its report into police

disciplinary and com plaints procedures. The report recommended changes in a number of



                                               10
k ey areas and I announced to the H ouse in March that I was taking steps to im plem ent

m ost o f its recommendations.



50.     I have decided that the standard of proof in discipline cases should be changed from

the criminal to the civil standard and that it should be possible for officers to face both

criminal and disciplinary action on the same facts. I have also accepted the H A C 's

recom m endation that w e should im plem ent a system o f ' fast track' dismissal for use in the

m ost serious cases.



51.    In the light o f the H illsborough disaster, I have been particularly concerned to

address the serious defect in the present practice w hich allows a police officer to retire on

medical grounds before disciplinary hearings can be com pleted. This was quite rightly an

issue o f the greatest frustration to the families o f the H illsborough victim s.

Conclusion


Madam Speaker,



52.     N inety-six people lost their lives as a result o f the disaster at H illsborough on 15

April 1989. The lives o f m any others were and continue to be profoundly affected by the

events that day. Q ne canaet begin to understand the anguish felt by the families w h o lost

their loved ones in such tragic circumstances, but w e have shared their determ ination to

establish, to the fullest extent possible, how and w hy their relatives died. The causes o f the

disaster were clearly identified by Lord Taylor in his 1989 report. It was right to consider

w hether there was any subsequent inform ation w hich cast doubt on earlier decisions asp I

am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has, after rigorous exam ination, reached the

correct conclusions.



53.     I have taken a very close personal interest in this case/from the start. I believe I was

right to establish the scrutiny.(^My on ly regret is that^thtrfamilies have not, for their ow n

reasons w hich I w ell understand, felt a b k te ^ c c e p t its conclusions. 1 h o p e , however,

Madam Speaker.



The disaster at H illsborough Stadium on 15 A pril 1989 was one o f the m ost appalling

events this country has experienced since the war.

not least by its association w ith football. A nd by the fact that the disaster unfolded via

television before the eyes o f the world.                CKJ Ac^WvgL
                                                                             v5‘

3.       There is another reason w h y that day has been such a trauma for the relatives and

friends o f those killed or injured, and for the C ity o f Liverpool. The deaths could not be

explained by som e A ct o f God, by som e event o f nature so unforeseen as to be beyond the

culpability o f any human being. Instead, from the second that the Leppings Lane gate was

opened, everyone knew that this was a disaster w hose root was entirely human, caused by

the error, incom petence, com placency, or worse, o f people entrusted to secure the safety of

those w h o attend football matches.



4.       The H om e Secretary o f the day, the *kcn: Douglas Hurd, was therefore entirely

right to establish just tw o days^ later a full inquiry into the disaster, under one o f the m ost

senior and respected judges available, Lord Taylor o f Gosforth.



5.       Lord T aylor’s inquiry to o k oral evidence from 174 witnesses at public hearings

during M ay and June 1989. It considered many other statements and over 70 hours o f

video evidence. In his interim report published in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that

the disaster had a number o f causes. H e did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or




Speech:Hills8my
person, but in paragraph 278 he concluded that “The main cause o f the disaster was the

failure o f police control”.



The Inquests


6.      Inquests were held by the Coroner for South Yorkshire to determine the statutory

questions as to w ho each o f the deceased was, and w hen and h ow he or she died. In March

1991, after hearing the evidence o f around 200 witnesses, the inquest jury returned verdicts

o f accidental death in respect o f all the victims.



The criminal and disciplinary investigation


7.      There was also an investigation, conducted by W est Midlands Police and supervised

by the Police Com plaints A uthority, to establish w hether there were any grounds for

criminal or disciplinary proceedings.



8.      The D irector o f Public Prosecutions considered the W est Midlands report and to o k

advice from Q ueen’s C ounsel.          The D P P ’s decision was that no-one should face

prosecution as a result o f the events that day. The Police Com plaints A uthority, though,

decided that C hief Superintendent D uckenfield and Superintendent Murray should face

disciplinary charges o f neglect o f duty.         In N ovem ber 1990, C hief Superintendent

D uckenfield retired from the force on the grounds o f ill health before disciplinary

proceedings could be com pleted.        U nder police regulations, a discipline hearing cannot

proceed w hen a police officer retires.       The Police Com plaints A uthority subsequently

decided to withdraw the charge against Superintendent Murray because th ey considered

that it w ould have been unfair to pursue what in effect was a joint charge, in the absence o f

the m ore senior officer.



9.      Lord T aylor’s inquiry and report was as thorough and impartial as one w ould

expect o f such a great judicial figure. H is report has led to lasting im provem ents in the

safety o f football grounds, in crow d behaviour and control. Th65^E£fi*3i^£Pi.iu ewmiort

     10.     But there has been sustained criticism o f both the coroners inquests, and above all

     o f a police discipline system so defective that no one was brought to book.



     11.     Concern that the inquests had not properly been conducted led six o f the bereaved

     families to seek a judicial review o f the inquests. Their application was heard in 1993. The

     D ivisional Court investigated the matter w ith great thoroughness, and looked in particular

     at the 3.15 pm cut-off point, but it decided there were no grounds for overturning the 1990

y    inquests verdicts

                                                   W tK /
     12.    H ow ever, for m any o f the families, that sense o f grievance on ly increased w ith the
                                                    'A
     passage o f tim e, and th ey decided that m ore should be done to get at the truth as th ey saw

     it o f w hat had happened. W ith the full co-operation o f the H illsborough Fam ily Support

^    Group, the author, Jim m y M cGovern, decided to prepare a tcloviaicnT drama-documentary

     for Granada Television.          Entitled sim ply “H illsborough” the tw o hour programme

     broadcast on 5 D ecem ber presented a powerful picture o f the tragedy. It suggested that
                             A
     there was fresh evidence w hich had not previously been considered w hich called into

     question the verdicts o f the inquests, and other decisions.



     Madam Speaker,



     13.     I dedare an interest. For tw o years before I entered this H ouse in 1979 I w orked

     on the staff o f o r ld - I n - A c t io n . Some o f the people I knew th e n j like Ian McBride^ helped

     put “H illsborough” together. I knew and k n ow them to be journalists o f great tenacity

     and integrity.



     14.           F ollow in g the programme, m y H on Friend for Liverpool W alton (Peter Kilfoyle)

     secured an adjournment debate on 17 Decem ber 1996. I attended that debate, and listened

     w ith care to what m y predecessor, the Rt H o n Gentlem an for Folkestone and H ythe,

yq   responded to ilk! dcbaic on thu Tntimu and whether any inquiry should be re-opened.



                                                        3
15.    W ithin days o f com ing into office I began a thorough exam ination w ithin

G overnm ent as to w hether there should be any re-opening o f this matter.



16.   I thought that there was, on the face o f it, sufficient to warrant a further

investigation; but since there had been a very thorough inquiry by Lord Taylor, very

lengthy inquests, and the W est Midlands Police inquiry, I decided that what in the first

instance was needed was a judicial scrutiny o f the new claims to determine w hether these

form al inquiries therefore should be re-opened.



17.   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith as a senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal was

em inently qualified to conduct such an independent and thorough scrutiny o f the evidence.

T he term s o f reference w hich I gave him were very w ide and enabled him to establish

conclusively w hether any material evidence had been overlooked and to recom m end

appropriate action. H is terms o f reference were:



       “T o ascertain w hether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the

       H illsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989; w hich was not available:



       (a)       to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or



       (b)       to the D irector o f Public Prosecutions or the A ttorney General for the

                 purpose o f discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or



       (c)       to the C hief Officer o f South Yorkshire police in relation to police

                 disciplinary matters;



       and in relation to (a) to advise w hether any evidence not previously available is o f

       such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the H om e

       Departm ent o f a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to

       their attention any evidence not previously considered by them w hich m ay be




                                              4
              relevant to their respective duties; and to advise w hether there is any other action

              w hich should be taken in the public interest.”



     18.      I appointed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on 30 June 1997. I published his report on

     18 February 1998.       I w ant to place on record, again, m y thanks to him for the

     thoroughness, and im partiality, w ith w hich he conducted the scrutiny.



X    19.      A n yon e w ho has read the report        through w ill, I believe, be bound to com e to

     the same conclusions as did Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, nam ely that a re-opening o f the

     inquiries w ould serve no purpose whatsoever.



     20.      Let me explain w h y that has to be so.



     21.      There is, first, the overriding issue o f w ho was to blame for the disaster.



     22.      If blame had not so far been allocated there w ould, unquestionably be very good

     grounds for further inquiry.



     23.      But w e have know n since Lord Taylor’s report that Sheffield C ity Council,

yf   Sheffield W ednesday |ootb all< 0u b and principally the South Yorkshire police w ere to

     blame.



     24.      A nd far from resiling from this judgement - or taking part in a “w hitew ash”, as

     som e have ludicrously charged, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith repeated this conclusion about

     tfee-pofee in the m ost strident o f terms. Indeed (paragraph 100 p. 87) he referred to C hief

     Superintendent D uckenfield as having uttered a “disgraceful lie” about Gate C being

     opened by fans, and he quoted w ith approval Lord T aylor’s “stinging rebuke” o f South

     Yorkshire police for failing to concede that th ey were in any respect at fault.



     25.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also unearthed the fact that som e o f the original

     statements made by individual police officers had been edited by solicitors acting for South

     Yorkshire police. A t appendix 6 he gives one example. H e considered w hether tk errw ere
                                                                                              ■tLese
                                                        5
how ever covered by legal professional privilege, and so could not be made public.        He

concluded that such privilege did not apply.       In consequence, I have made every such

statement available to the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group, and placed copies in the

Library o f the H ouse.



26.    The new claims put before Lord Justice Stuart-Smith by the television programme

and the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group fell principally into tw o areas - video

evidence, and that relating to the 3.15 pm cut-off point for the inquest.



27.    Let m e deal w ith these in turn.



28.    First, there is the question o f the m issing video tapes.    T w o tapes w ere stolen.

Their theft - still unsolved - has understandably heightened concerns about a “cover-up”,

w hich were com pounded by the extra-ordinary and pervasive denial o f responsibility by

South Yorkshire police at the tim e. But the crucial thing about these tapes is that th ey

contained no material evidence not otherwise available.       O ne was entirely blank as the

camera concerned had been pointing at a wall. The other show ed turnstiles 9-16 at the

Leppings Lane end, next to turnstiles A-G, w hich them selves were m onitored by police

C C T V camera 1. W hat happened on these turnstiles was recorded on both the police tape

(TB2) and tape RJH2, w hich consists o f camera output viewed in the club control room .



29.    C ounsel for the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group made five subm issions in

relations to video evidence on behalf o f the Group, listed at paragraph 33 on p. 20.



       (i)       That the police blamed their failure to see the overcrowding in pens 3 and

                  4 o f the Leppings Lane end on camera 5 being defective w hen in fact it

                  was not.



       (ii)      That the evidence o f the video tapes taken from camera 5 was deliberately

                  suppressed and concealed.




                                               6
         (iii)      That the coroner deliberately failed properly pursue the question o f the
                                                                A
                    “m issing video evidence”.



         (iv)       That police officers gave deliberately false evidence that camera 5 was not

                    w orking correctly.



         (v)        That evidence from Mr Roger H ouldsw orth, a C C T V technician in the

                    club control room , was suppressed. Mr H ouldsw orth, w ho featured so

                    prom inently in the Granada Television programme, claimed that he

                    could see from m onitoring police cameras that pens 3 and 4 were

                    overcrowded and that a dangerous situation was likely to arise because o f

                    the influx o f fans through Gate C.



30.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith goes through each o f the submissions w ith great care.



31 «-     H e describes subm ission 1 as “quite untenable” (paragraph 61), subm ission 2 as

“com pletely unfounded” (paragraph 77), subm ission 3 as “unfounded” (paragraph 79),

subm ission 4 as “evidence w h olly insufficient to warrant consideration o f criminal

proceedings against any police officers” (paragraph 93).



32.      A s to   subm ission 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith emphasises that M r H ouldsw orth’s

existence, and his evidence, were know n both to the Taylor Inquiry and to the Coroner,

and that his evidence, even if correct, w ould not have had any effect on the previous

proceedings.



33.       Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also deals w ith the credibility o f Mr H ouldsw orth. H e

said    that he was “unable to a c c e p t that his recollection o f events n ow is accurate”, and

adds that “the im portance o f his evidence has been exaggerated out o f all proportion”.



Madam Speaker,



34.      The second area o f new claims related to the inquests.
Cut-off point


35.     A t the start o f the main inquest, the coroner ruled that he w ould cut-off the inquiry

at 3.15 pm , the tim e by w hich he considered that all those w ho died had received the

injuries w hich caused their deaths.        This cut-off point has long been a matter o f

controversy to the families.



36.     The u3e~of the 3.15 pm cut off hariuiig b m i irm aiiei o f iu n u u ?ersy to the-families.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found no grounds to conclude that the conduct o f the inquests

was flawed. H e says that the cut-off point did not lim it the inquiry undertaken by the

inquest and it was never suggested by the coroner that all those w ho died did so before

3.15 pm . The inquest jury heard evidence about those w ho died after arrival at hospital

and o f those w ho were treated and recovered. It was on ly in relation to h ow and by w hat

means the deceased came to their deaths that the cut-off tim e was imposed. Evidence that

som e people died after 3.15 pm w ould not, therefore, effect the outcom e o f the inquest.



37.    O ther allegations related to the rescue operation, and to alleged im proper

interference w ith witnesses.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith noted that Lord Taylor had

inquired into the rescue operation and criticised the slow response o f the police.           Lord

Justice Stuart-Smith found no evidence o f want o f care by the em ergency or medical

services and, in his view , no purpose w ould be served by any further inquiry into this

aspect o f the disaster.



38.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith investigated in som e depth allegations that certain

witnesses w ere pressurised by the W est Midlands police to change the evidence w hich th ey

w ished to give. H e concludes that there was no improper attempt to affect their evidence.

As^ndicated earlier, he also examined carefully the statements w hich the South Yorkshire

police obtained from their ow n officers, som e o f w hich were amended on the advice o f

force solicitors. H e is satisfied that the Taylor inquiry and the inquest were not in any

w ay inhibited or im peded by w hat to o k place. In a very few cases referred to in appendix

7 o f the report, what was excluded was either factual or com m ent in w hich factual matters



                                                 8
     were im plicit and he says that “it w ould have been preferable ^for those matters not to

     have been excluded”.



     39.    Against this background, the question is what a further opening o f full inquiries, or

     inquests, or disciplinary procedures could achieve.



     40.    A re-opening o f Lord Taylor’s inquiry w ould serve no purpose, and since I

     published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report on 18 February I have heard no convincing

     argument against that view . Skx&e ihere was cover-up Neither by Lord Taylor jrfor^Lord
                            OS                      A-                                       A
     Justice Stuart-Smith^ w e k n ow already w ho was principally to blame - the police - and

     thankfully Lord T aylor’s recommendations about the safety o f soccer grounds have

     already been im plem ented.



     41.    W hen I talk to the bereaved families much o f their anger continues how ever to

     focus on the inquests, and on the police disciplinary procedures.



     42.   So far as the inquests are concerned, there was no evidence before Lord Justice

     Stuart-Smith w hich could result in an application by the A ttorney General to set aside the

X"   inquest verdicts, not least since f id t the conduct o f the inquests was so thoroughly

     exam ined by the D ivisional Court in 1993.



     43.   But I accept, as I believe does the w hole H ouse, that inquests o f this kind turn the

     screw on bereaved families w ithout adding understanding on questions o f culpability.



     44.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report underlined the need to make im provem ents to

     the inquest system .    In the case o f H illsborough, it was clearly unsatisfactory that the

     fam ilies suffered additional distress as a result o f the inquest proceedings and the jury’s

     verdicts o f accidental death w hen the causes o f the disaster had already been established by

     the Taylor inquiry and the D PP had announced that there w ould not be any prosecutions.



     45.    I have made clear that the inquest system, in its present form , is unsuitable for

     dealing w ith disasters such as H illsborough.      The H om e O ffice W orking Group on



                                                    9
Disasters and Inquests, w hich reported in March 1997, recommended that the role o f the

inquest should be lim ited where a public inquiry has already been held.



46.    A com prehensive public inquiry w hich also addressed the questions before an

inquest w ould relieve the coroner o f the need to resume the formal inquest. The changes

recom m ended by the H om e O ffice W orking Party point the right w ay forward and the

G overnm ent w ill look for a suitable legislative opportunity to amend the C oroner’s

A ct 1988.



47.    It has often been asked o f me, if the police were to blame, w h y has no police officer

been brought to book?        The on ly answer, very far from satisfactory, is that police

disciplinary procedures have been so defective that individual senior police officers can

utter “disgraceful lies” and act w ith contem ptible incom petence w ithout penalty.



48.     A s I said in m y statement to the H ouse on 18 February, I fully understand the

public disquiet that those w ho have been criticised by the inquiries into this disaster have

n ot been prosecuted or disciplined in respect o f their actions. It is not possible, however, to

turn the clock back and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is satisfied that there is no new evidence

w hich he considered w hich should be put before the D irector o f Public Prosecutions or

the Police C om plaints A uthority. I firm ly believe, though, that there is a com pelling case

in the light o f H illsborough and other cases for reform o f the police disciplinary system.



49.    In January the H om e Affairs C om m ittee published its report into police

disciplinary and com plaints procedures. The report recommended changes in a number of

key areas and I announced to the H ouse in March that I was taking steps to im plem ent

m ost o f its recom m endations.



50.    I have decided that the standard o f proof in discipline cases should be changed from

the criminal to the civil standard and that it should be possible for officers to face both

criminal and disciplinary action on the same facts. I have also accepted the H A C 's

recom m endation that w e should im plem ent a system o f ' fast track1 dismissal for use in the

m ost serious cases.



                                               10
       51.     In the light o f the H illsborough disaster, I have been particularly concerned to

       address the serious defect in the present practice w hich allows a police officer to retire on

       medical grounds before disciplinary hearings can be completed. This was quite rightly an

       issue o f the greatest frustration to the families o f the H illsborough victim s.



       52.     The procedures w ill be strengthened so that where accused officers claim they are

       unable, through ill health, to appear at disciplinary hearings, matters can be decided in

       their absence, w ith appropriate safeguards.          I am also concerned that the existing

       regulations should be rigorously applied so that any outstanding disciplinary matters have

       to be com pleted before any application for early retirement can be considered.

       Conclusion


       Madam Speaker,



       53.     N in ety-six people lost their lives as a result o f the disaster at H illsborough on

       15 A pril 1989. The lives o f m any others were and continue to be profoundly affected by

       the events that day. N o n e o f us can begin to understand the anguish felt by the families

       w ho lost their loved ones in such tragic circumstances, but w e have shared their

       determ ination to establish, to the fullest extent possible, h ow and w h y their relatives died.

       The causes o f the disaster were clearly identified by Lord Taylor in his 1989 report. It was

       right to consider w hether there was any subsequent inform ation w hich cast doubt on

       earlier decisions but I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has, after rigorous

       exam ination, reached the correct conclusions.



       54.     I have taken a very close personal interest in this tragedy from the start. I believe I

       was right to establish the scrutiny. It is also right to accept its conclusions. I am asked to

       establish yet another inquiry but it is above all out o f concern and com passion for the

In the light o f the Hillsborough disaster, I have been particularly concerned to address

an issue o f the greatest frustration to the families o f Hillsborough victims.

Madam Speaker.



The disaster at H illsborough Stadium on 15 A pril 1989 was one of the m ost appalling

events this country has experienced since the war.



2.       The numbers killed - 96 - w ere very high. But tl^ tragexiywas ^com poui^d^b^ t h e ^ ^ ^ ^

lagjgssStSiaSer o f children and yoimg-pgpple w b t ^ ^ -^ ^ lipatfvHpnth, by its association

w ith s^ c e ^ o m H ia tio n a l game; and by the fact that the disaster unfolded via television

before the eyes o f the world.



3.       There is another reason w h y that day has been such a trauma for the relatives and

friends o f those killed or injured, and for the C ity of Liverpool. The deaths could not be

explained by som e A ct o f G od, by som e event o f nature so unforeseen as to be beyond the

culpability o f any human being. Instead, from the second that the Leppings Lane gate was

opened, everyone knew that this was a disaster w hose root was entirely human, caused by

the error, incom petence, com placency, or worse, o f people entrusted to secure the safety of

those w ho attend football matches.



4.       The H om e Secretary o f the day, th e,th en KmimtlrD.Umr, was therefore entirely

right to establish just tw o days’ later a vjgp f full inquiry into the disaster, under one o f the

m ost senior and respected judges available, Lord Taylor o f Gosforth.



5.       Lord Taylor’s inquiry took oral evidence from 174 witnesses at public hearings

during May and June 1989v           considered m any other statements and over 70 hours of

video evidence. In his interim report published in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that

the disaster had a number o f causes. H e did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or

person, but in paragraph 278 he concluded that “The main cause o f the disaster was the

failure o f police control”.



Speech:Hills8my
The Inquest?


6.     Inquests were held by the C oroner for South Yorkshire to determine the statutory

questions as to w ho each o f the deceased was, and w hen and h ow he or she died.     In March

 1991, after hearing the evidence o f around 200 witnesses, the inquest jury returned verdicts

o f accidental death in respect o f all the victim s.



The criminal and disciplinary investigation


7.     There was also an investigation, conducted by W est Midlands Police and supervised

by the Police C om plaints A uthority, to establish w hether there were any grounds for

criminal or disciplinary proceedings.



 8.     The D irector o f Public Prosecutions considered the W est Midlands report and to ok

 advice from Q ueen’s Counsel.           The D P P ’s decision was that no-one should face

 prosecution as a result o f the events that day. The Police Com plaints A uthority, though,

 decided that C hief Superintendent D uckenfield and Superintendent Murray should face

 disciplinary charges o f neglect o f duty.         In N ovem ber 1990, C hief Superintendent

D uckenfield retired from the force on the grounds o f ill health before disciplinary

proceedings could be com pleted.         U nder police regulations, a discipline hearing cannot

proceed w hen a police officer retires.        The Police Com plaints A uthority subsequently

decided to w ithdraw the charge against Superintendent Murray because they considered

that it w ould have been unfair to pursue what in effect was a joint charge, in the absence o f

the m ore senior officer.



9.      Lord T aylor’s inquiry and report was as thorough and impartial as one w ould

expect o f such a great judicial figure. H is report has led to lasting im provem ents in the

safety o f football grounds, in crowd behaviour and control, y^ h eu g h -this-i-8 o f no com fort

  10.     But there has been sustained criticism o f both the coroners inquests, and above all

  o f a police discipline system so defective that no one was brought to book.



  11.     C oncern that the inquests had not properly been conducted led six o f the bereaved

  families to seek a judicial review o f the inquests. Their application was heard in 1993. The

  D ivisional C ourt investigated the matter w ith great thoroughness, and looked in particular

  at the 3.15 pm cut-off point, but it decided that there were no grounds for overturning the

  1990 inquests.

         p s ^ ir c r r
  12.     For m any o f the families, the sense o f grievance on ly increased w ith the passage of

  tim e, and th ey decided thatjnnre^hould be done to get at the truth as they saw it o f what

  happened. D uring 1996, Jim m y M c G o v e n y ^ ith the full co-operation of the H illsborough

  Fam ily Support Group decided to prepare a television drama-documentary for G r a n a d a

              a                        Entitled sim ply “H illsborough” the tw o hour Joag

  programme^ presented a powerful picture of the tragedy V it suggested that there was fresh

  evidence w hich had not previously been considered w hich called into question the verdicts

  at the inquests, and       other decisions.



  Madam Speaker,



  13.     I declare an interest. For tw o years before I entered this H ouse in 1979 I w orked

  on the staff o f W orld-In-Action.    Some o f the people I knew then - like Ian McBride

  [check] helped put “H illsborough” together. I knew and know them to be journalists of

  great tenacity and integrity.    So the effect-of the programme on me was all the more

„ o j mpuiHing."“ *                                                                     vk



  14.     F ollow in g the programme, m v .H on Friend for Liverpool W alton (Peter Kilfoyle)

  secured an adjournment debate ^ D e c e m b e r 1996.     I attended that debate, and listened

  w ith great attention at the careful and sensitive w ay in w hich m y predecesso i^ the R t H o n

  G entlem an for Folkestone and H yth e, resp oeaea t e -the debate oft-tim n atter afid w hether

  any inquiry should be re-opened, he said this:




                                                  3
       and in relation to (a) to advise w hether any evidence not previously available is of

       such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State for the H om e

       Departm ent o f a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to

       their attention any evidence not previously considered by them w hich m ay be

       relevant to their respective duties; and to advise w hether there is any other action

       w hich should be taken in the public interest.”



18.    I appointed Lord Just Stuart-Smith on 30 June 1997.           I published his report on

18 February 1998.      I want to place on record, again, m y thanks to him for the

thoroughness, and impartiality, w ith w hich he conducted the scrutiny.



                                                                                 suspect having




20.    A n yon e w ho 4&es read       all through w ill I believe be bound to com e to the same

conclusions as did lj4, nam ely that a re-opening o f the inquiries w ould serve no purpose

whatsoever.         'y) L S ' J J .



21.   Let m e explain w h y that has to be so.



22.   There is, first, the overriding issue o f w ho was to blame for the disaster.



23.    If blame had n ot so far been allocated

         then there w ould, unquestionably, be very good grounds for further inouiry.



24.    But w e have kn ow n since Lord Taylor’s report w ho was to plame - th^police.

                       CC                                \jC /-C ^     U cSM                      fid
25.    A nd far from rgcoiimg from this judgement - or taking part in a “w hitew ash”, as

som e have ludicrously charged, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith repeated this co n clu sio n ^ ! the i

m ost strident o f terms. Indeed (paragraph 100 p. 87) he referred to C hief Superintendent

D uckenfield as having uttered a “disgraceful lie” about Gate C being opened by fans, and




                                                 5
    he quoted w ith approval Lord Taylor’s “stinging rebuke” o f South Yorkshire police for

    failing to concede that they were in any respect at fault.



    26.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also unearthed the fact rfiat som e o f the original

    statements made by individual police officers had been edited fjxjsolicitors acting for South

    Yorkshire police. A t appendix 6 he gives one example. H e considered w hether they^were

    how ever covered by legal professional privilege, and so could not be made public.          He

    concluded that such privilege did n ot apply.      In consequence, I have made every such

    statem ent available to the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group, and placed copies in the

    Library o f the H ouse.

                    CJca Xo
    27.    The new eyideiit e put before Lord Justice Stuart-Smith by the television

    programme and the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group fell principally into tw o areas -

    video evidence, and that relating to the 3.15 pm cut-off point for the inquest.



    28.    Let me deal w ith these in turn.

                                                      V\ckiO
    29.    First, there is the question o f the missing^apes. T w o tape^were stolen. Their theft

    fotfflSTby the extra-ordinary and pervasive denial o f South Yorkshire police at the tim e.

^   31.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith goes through each o f the subm issiorrwith great care.

Madam Speaker,

                                        c AcaA J
35.     The second main issue o f “new evjjdefice” related to the inquests.



36.   v^The use o f the 3.15 pm cut-off has long been a matter o f controversy to the families.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found no grounds to conclude that the conduct o f the inquests

was flawed. H e says that the cut-off point did not lim it the inquiry undertaken by the

inquest and it was jx&c suggested by the coroner that all those w ho died did so before
                      A/
3.15 pm . The inquest jury heard evidence about those w ho died after arrival at hospital

and o f those w h o were treated and recovered. It was on ly in relation to h ow and by what

means the deceased came to their deaths that the cut-off tim e was imposed. Evidence that

som e people died after 3.15 pm w ould not, therefore, effect the outcom e o f the inquest.



37.     O ther allegations related to the rescue operation, and to alleged im proper

interference w ith witnesses.



[Paraphrase con clusion s here please]
    38.    Against this background, the question is what a further opening o f full inquiries, or

    inquests, or disciplinary procedures could achieve.



    39.    A re-opening o f Lord Taylor’s inquiry w ould serve no purpose, and since I

    published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report on 18 February I have heard no argunfient
                    ,                                                 £?*i     ^
    against that. Since there was cover-up neither by Lord Taylor nor'Lord Justice Stuart-
               A
    Smith, w e k n ow already w ho was to blame - the police - and thankfully Lord T aylor’s

    recom m endations about the safety o f soccer grounds have already been im plemented.



    40.    W hen I talk to the bereaved families m uch o f their anger continues to focus on the
                                                                                  A
    inquests, and on the police disciplinary procedures.



    41.    So far as the inquests are concerned, there was no evidence before Lord Justice
                                     .
    Stuart-Smith w hich could result in^application by the A ttorney General to set aside the

    inquest verdicts, not least gixes-th at the conduct o f the inquests was vgrjr thoroughly

    examined by the D ivisional Court in 1993.                                    ^



    42.   But I accept, as I believe does the w hole H ouse, that inquests o f this kind turn the

    screw on bereaved families w ithout adding understanding on questions o f culpability.



$   43^    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report also underlined the need to make im provem ents

    to the inquest system . In the case o f H illsborough, it was clearly unsatisfactory that the

    fam ilies suffered additional distress as a result o f the inquest proceedings and the jury’s

    verdicts o f accidental death w hen the causes o f the disaster had already been established by

    the Taylor inquiry and the D PP had announced that there w ould not be any prosecutions.



    44.   I have made clear that the inquest system, in its present form , is unsuitable for

    dealing w ith disasters such as H illsborough.     The H om e O ffice W orking Group on

    Disasters and Inquests, w hich reported in March 1997, recommended that the role o f the

    inquest should be lim ited where a public inquiry has already been held.




                                                   8
45.    A com prehensive public inquiry w hich also addressed the questions before an

inquest w ould relieve the coroner o f the need to resume the formal inquest. The changes

recom m ended by the H om e O ffice W orking Party point the right w ay forward and the

G overnm ent w ill lo ok for a suitable legislative opportunity to amend the C oroner’s

A ct 1988.



46.    It has often been asked o f me, if the police were to blame, w h y has no police officer

been brought to book?        The on ly answer, very far from satisfactory, is that police

disciplinary procedures have been so defective that individual senior police officers can
                             GiOf
utter “disgraceful lies” and      w ith contem ptible incom petence w ithout penalty.



47.     A s I said in m y statement to the H ouse on 18 February, I fully understand the

public disquiet that those w ho have been criticised by the inquiries into this disaster have

not been prosecuted or disciplined in respect o f their actions. It is not possible, however, to

turn the clock back and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is satisfied that there is no new evidence

w hich he considered w hich should be put before the Director o f Public Prosecutions or

the Police C om plaints A uthority. I firm ly believe, though, that there is a com pelling case

in the light o f H illsborough and other cases for reform o f the police disciplinary system.



48.     In January the H om e Affairs C om m ittee published its report into police

disciplinary and com plaints procedures. The report recomm ended changes in a number o f

key areas and I announced to the H ouse in March that I was taking steps to im plem ent

m ost o f its recommendations.



49.    I have decided that the standard o f proof in discipline cases should be changed from

the criminal to the civil standard and that it should be possible for officers to face both

criminal and disciplinary action on the same facts. I have also accepted the H A C 's

recom m endation that w e should im plem ent a system o f ' fast track' dismissal for use in the

m ost serious cases.



50.    In the light o f the H illsborough disaster, I have been particularly concerned to

address the serious defect in the present practice w hich allows a police officer to retire on



                                               9
     medical grounds before disciplinary hearings can be com pleted. This was quite rightly an

     issue o f the greatest frustration to the families o f the H illsborough victim s.

     Conclusion


     Madam Speaker,



     51.       N in ety-six people lost their lives as a result o f the disaster at H illsborough on 15

     A pril 1989. The lives o f m any others were and continue to be profoundly affected by the
                              o p W)
     events that day. -Oae canaet begin to understand the anguish felt by the families w ho lost

     their loved ones in such tragic circumstances, but w e have shared their determ ination to

     establish, to the fullest extent possible, h ow and w h y their relatives died. The causes o f the

     disaster w ere clearly identified by Lord Taylor in his 1989 report. It was right to consider

     w hether there was any subsequent inform ation w hich cast doubt on earlier decisions apet'I

     am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has, after rigorous exam ination, reached the

     correct conclusions.

    My Lord Justice Taylor,

    I am writing to inform you that the NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES
    would wish to give evidence to the Inquiry into the Sheffield Football
    Disaster.

|   The NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES is the major union for ambulance
I   staff in this country and members of ours employed in the ambulance
j   service attended the tragedy.  They would like to give evidence to the
|   Inquiry about their experiences that Saturday afternoon and express
|   our criticisms at the manner in which ambulance cover is given at large
|   sporting events.

    It is our view that extended trained ambulance crews with vehicles and
    equipment including defibrillators should be on hand at such events and
    that lives would probably have been saved had they been on duty that
    afternoon.  Additionally, all large sports stadia should consult with their
    local ambulance services about accident and emergency arrangements.

    We would appreciate hearing from you about the arrangements to be made.

    Youifsj sincerely,

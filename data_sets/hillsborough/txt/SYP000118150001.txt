            f i n al       at H i l l s b o r o u g h -

            Transport             was       provided          to    the    ground where                1 attended             the     briefing          at

            approximately                   10am    ( 1 000).          I wa s      engaged         in C I D d u t i e s         at       the

            ground.              My    particular             duties       that     day were             to    take up         position

            within          the       gymnasium          at     the       ground and             t a k e r e p o r t s of      crime       related

            matters             from    persons          attending           and    in the         vicinity            of     the     stadium.

            Detective             Sergeant          L i nd l e y was         the    supervisory               officer          responsible

            f o r me        t ha t     day.        Other        officers        in m y       serial       were         D Cs    Hall       a nd Blake.

            After          the    briefing          I toured              the a r e a       of    the g r o u n d w i t h           DC B l a k e

            prior          to    standing          by w i t h i n      the    gymnasium.

            Took         report        of    theft       from a young              Liverpool            supporter             who    had       ten

            pound          stolen       from       him       by a s u p p o s e d      ticket          tout.

            Shortly after                   kick    off       and whilst           in the     gymnasium            I     saw    that           about

            SO       uniformed          officers             hurriedly        left          t h at b u i l d i n g . T h i s         was       shortly

            after          3pm    (1500).

            W i t h DC H a l l          I went          to    the     ground       floor      tunnel          at   the        end    of    the

            North          stand       (farthest             from Le pp in gs          Lane)       -    I could         see     the       playing

            area         from     this       point       at     the    end    of    the      tunnel       and most             of    the a r e a

                                                                                                                               R 176

occupied         by s u p p o r t e r s .

I could        see     that       play was         not    in    progress          and    numerous            supporters

were    congregated around                      the       Leppings          Lane    goal area.

DC Blake         came       to    this     p o i nt      shortly after              t hi s a n d             he    h a d a ra d i o as

I re cal l       but    I could           not    h ear    transmissions             due     to     loud       jeering           from

all    around.

Most    of     the     fans        in the N o r t h s t a n d w e r e            standing         up out          of    their

se at s .     As     far     as     I was       concerned        simply another              pitch           invasion           had

occurred.

1 saw 2 fans            believed Liverpool                     run    up    from Leppings               Lane       e n d - up

the    pitch and            gesticulate            towards       Notts.          Forest     fans        in the          ne w

covered        st a n d .        First     a young        man    then an          elderly man               both       of w h o m

were    arrested            on    the     pitch.         These       two    people       seemed         to    cause          more

shouting         and abuse            from      both where           I was       stood      and              the       n ew sta nd.

An am bu lan ce         drove         onto      the       pitch and          drove       to the              L epp in gsLane

end.        Police      reinforcements                 went     onto       the     pitch and         formed a             cordon

down    the      c en t r e .

I   started        to w a l k       down     the      p i t c h w i t h DC H a l l        and      passedDS L i nd le y

walking        down     the       other      way.

I heard        him     say       t h at   about       SO people       had        died.      I lost          DC H a l l

amongst       the      c r o w d at       Leppings Lane           end.           I could     see at           least       5     fans

lying       on the      pitch         being      attended        to    by P o l i c e / A m b u l a n c e         crew and

members       of     the     pub l i c .        These     were       apparently          dead.

I was       not a w a r e        t ha t   man y more         people        were    dead     j us t      a    few y a r d s

farther       on.       Many        supporters           we re mi 1 1 i ng a r o u n d ,          cryi ng a n d          s h o u t i ng

helping       with      cardiac           massage.           This     was    taken       o ve r    by       persons          already

around       him     including            a uniformed male                 officer.         I rendered assistance

in m o v i n g     this      person away              from     the    pitch        but a g a i n     this was            taken

over    by    people         who     were       already        with    him.         I returned              to the
gymnasium         to a s c e r t a i n w h a t        further        a c t i o n was       to    be    taken        re this

incident       and      speak       w i t h DS L i n d l e y .

I was    not      aware       of    the     scale       of    casualties            at    that    time          before

returning         to    the    gym.         At    the     gym      bodies     were        being       brought          in one

after    another.             I assisted           in     removing         a ll     furniture          from       the         f lo o r

space    then       started         laying        out     bodies.          The      atmosphere             at    t h at       time

was    dreadful        and     chaotic.

Chief    S u p t . Addis           a t t e n d e d at     the      gym w it hi n a short               time and

instructed myself                  and    other       officers         th e r e .        This was          mainly         that         the

officer       who      brought        the      body     in to       remain        there     u n ti l       further            notice

and CID officers               to a s s i s t      with       establishing               identities.              W i t h DS

Lindley and            other       officers        I assisted             in t hi s       process          and    placed

bodies       into      body    bags.

There were          not     sufficient            b ag s at        that    time.          About       70    bodies            were       in

the    g y m at     t hat     time       although         I did      not     physically           c o un t       them.

Throughout          all     this      DS L i n d l e y was          carrying         out    the       same       duties          and

rendering         help and          support        all       around.         I personally              benefited               from

this    as    I found         this       situation           distressing            and    upsetting             however           I

found    t h at     I wa s     able       to     perform          these    necessary            functions           and        for

the    time    being        supress         my    own     feelings.

At    about    7pm      (1900)        I attended             at H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e           Station          and

assisted       DS L i n dl e y        in the       compilation             of a w i t n e s s         list.

Det.    Supt.       McKay      gave       a briefing              there    and      explained          that       ID

procedures          with      relatives           were       to    follow.

Between 9.30pm              (2130)        and     11 pm      (2300)       I took m i s s in g          person          reports

from    relatives           at H a m m e r t o n R o a d .          Shortly after               11pm       (2300)         I

attended       back       in the         gymnasium with DS Lindley,                         DC H all            and DCs          Blake

and Lindsay.

There    I teamed           up w i t h      DC O ' B r i e n a n d        began      the    identification

process       with     relatives.                This     was      basically         to    obtain a CJA                from        the
                                                                                                                                        PAGE    4
                                                                                                                                        R 176

             respective           relative          once    he/she          had    identified a body                  to      the

             uniformed        officer          completing           the G e n          18.

             I carried        on w i t h       this    unt i1 shortly                  after     S a m (0500),        when       I

             returned        to E c c l e s f i e l d w i t h D S L i n d l e y a n d               other      colleagues.

             This     is    the    first       time    I h av e w o r k e d            a semi       f i n al   match       at

             H i l l s b o r o u g h w h i 1st      in CID.         I have         worked       at     that      ground many            times

             since      July,      1980       (000780).           Policing             there    has a l w a y s       been       of a v e r y

             high     standard          and    the    safety        record was               excellent.

             I r eca l l     a Sunday Newspaper                   some       years       ago     doing a         large        spread with

             pictures        showing          the    high       standard          of P o l i c i n g     carried        out      at   this

             stadium.

             I h av e      attended       many       briefings          at     this      s t a d i u m a n d all        the      semi

             finals.         Nothing          seemed       to    have       been       done     differently           this       year    and

             yet    all     the    other       previous          matches          passed without               incident.

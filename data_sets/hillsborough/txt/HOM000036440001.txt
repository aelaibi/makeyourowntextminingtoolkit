HILLSBOROUGH


At the meeting yesterday evening, the Home Secretary undertook to let you see in
draft the Oral Statement which he proposes to make. I am enclosing a copy of the
draft as it stands currently. Although it is likely to be subject to further drafting
changes, I do not anticipate that the substance will alter. Please let me know if
there are any parts in the statement which would cause you any difficulty. It is now
almost certain that the statement will be made to the House on Monday 30 June.
We will be forewarning interested parties in the next few days that a statement is to
be made, although they will not be told of its terms in advance.

I suggest that when you are free from your current commitments in court that we
should meet again to discuss your requirements for handling this exercise.

DRAFT:             23 JUNE 1997




DRAFT ORAL STATEMENT FOR THE HOME SECRETARY



With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


2.        96 people lost their lives as a result of the Hillsborough disaster which
happened on 15 April 1989. That was more than eight years ago but no one who
saw the news reports on that dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those terrible
events. For those who lost loved members of their family, the pain is ever-present.
Following Hillsborough, members of this House were united in our determination to
do all in our power to prevent anything like that ever happening again.


(i)       Public Inquiry


 3.        Madam Speaker, following the Hillsborough disaster a number of inquiries
and investigations took place, looking at aspects of the tragedy. Perhaps the most
thorough and wide-ranging was the Public Inquiry led by Lord Taylor. The terms of
reference of that Inquiry encompassed not only inquiring into the events but also
making recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports events.


4.        Lord Taylor’s Inquiry took oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public
hearings during May and June 1989 and considered many hours of video evidence
from different sources. In his interim report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that
the disaster had a number of causes. He did not attribute all the blame to a single
cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made clear that:


           “The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control”




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pddoc
5.         Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in January
1990 made a further 76 recommendations. The improvements which have taken
place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing of football matches
have been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has
been transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide-
reaching and soundly based conclusions.


(ii)      Coroner's Inquest


6.         The deaths which occurred on 15 April 1989 were also the subject of inquests
conducted by the Coroner of the western district of South Yorkshire.


7.        Madam Speaker, as hon Members will know, an inquest is a fact-finding
inquiry, conducted by a Coroner in front of a jury, and aimed at establishing the
answers to four important questions, namely:


           the identity of the deceased;


           the place of death;


           the time and the date of death; and


           how the deceased came by his or her death


8.        The Coroner’s rules require proceedings and evidence to be directed solely at
finding answers to these four questions.


9.        The jury at the Coroner’s inquest after examining the evidence, found in
March 1991 that the cause of death of those who died at Hillsborough was
accidental death.




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pddoc
(iii)      West Midlands Police Investigation


10.        A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands Police,
supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any
grounds for criminal proceedings and to consider whether any police officer should
be subject to disciplinary proceedings.


11.        That investigation involved the taking of over 5000 statements and the
scrutiny of all the material which had previously been examined by the Taylor
Inquiry.         After that investigation evidence was sent to the Director of Public
Prosecutions, who concluded that no person should be subject to criminal
proceedings.


12.        The Police Complaints Authority decided that the chief superintendent and
superintendent in charge on the day should face disciplinary charges for neglect of
duty. In the event, the chief superintendent retired due to ill health in advance of a
ruling by a disciplinary tribunal. A disciplinary hearing cannot proceed when a police
officer retires before the hearing takes place. The Police Complaints Authority later
decided that disciplinary proceedings against the superintendent should be
withdrawn because the retirement of the chief superintendent meant that what, in
effect, was a joint allegation of neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the
absence of the more senior officer.


(iv)       Continued calls for further investigations


13.        Madam Speaker, hon members will know that some of the families of those
who died were unhappy with the verdict of the inquest. They later applied for judicial
review of the coroner’s proceedings.        During the judicial review proceedings the
conduct of the inquest was subjected to close and detailed examination.             In
November 1993 the divisional court ruled that none of the matters raised in the
judicial review proceedings justified intervention by the court in the verdict of the



f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pddoc
inquest jury.             The court also expressed strong doubts as to whether a further
inquest, if ordered, would result in anything further being learned and observed that
the process would be very harrowing.


14.        The events surrounding the Hillsborough disaster have therefore been subject
to exceptionally thorough investigation on several occasions.         But concerns have
remained about whether the full facts have yet emerged. I have met relatives of the
Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief that there are
unresolved issues which should be investigated further.


15.        Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me,
to the Attorney General and to the Director of Public Prosecutions.          A Granada
television programme in December last year dramatised the disaster and raised a
number of issues which, in the view of the programme makers, represented new
evidence.             Since then further material has been submitted on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.                Those representations have related in
particular to video evidence of the disaster and medical evidence about the time of
death of the victims.


16.        Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney General and the
Crown Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which
has been put forward in recent months.


17.        I have, however, to tell the House that I have not so far identified evidence
which would lead me to conclude that a new public inquiry should be established.
Similarly, the Director of Public Prosecutions takes the view that the material so far
presented to her would not justify fresh criminal investigations.          The Attorney
General also takes the view that, again on the material so far presented to him, any
application to the High Court for a new inquest would not have any realistic prospect
of succeeding.




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pddoc
18.        Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of some of those who
died at Hillsborough and many others are very concerned that unresolved issues
remain.           I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final conclusion without a full
and independent examination of the evidence.


19.        I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that there should be an independent scrutiny
to ascertain whether there now exists any new evidence relating to the disaster
which was not previously available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart -Smith, a
senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose.                     His full terms of
reference are:


           To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
           Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


                        (a)        To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor, or


                        (b)        To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General
                       for        the   purpose    of   discharging   their   respective   statutory
                        responsibilities; or


                        (c)        To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to
                        police disciplinary matters;


           And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
            is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State
           for the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and
            (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them
           which which may be relevant to their respective duties; and to advise
           whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.




f:\oppu\hou\drafts\pp0232pd.doc
I am today placing a copy of these terms of reference in the Library.


20.        We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other
evidence which has been submitted.                He will also consider any further material
which interested parties wish to submit. They will be able to make representations
to him.


21.        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s task will be twofold. First to advise me whether
any evidence not previously available is of such significance as to justify a further full
public inquiry.             His advice to me will be available to the House and the public.
Secondly, he will identify for the Attorney General and the Director of Public
Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence which
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.


22.        I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively whether
any material evidence about the causes of the Hillsborough disaster has been
overlooked and to take action if it has.             For the families of those who died at
Hillsborough the grief will never end. I hope that Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s work will
help to allay some of their grief by removing any remaining doubts about the
circumstances in which their loved ones died so tragically.

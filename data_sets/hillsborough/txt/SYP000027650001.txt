                                              I report with reference to the attached correspondence
                                         received at this Station from                     H of

                                         made by the South Yorkshire Police Federation representative
                                         after the Hillsborough Disaster.

                                              On Sunday, 23rd April, 1989, I saw                  J
                                                                                                and
                                         discussed with him what action could be taken regarding his
                                         letter.

                                              He accepts that no response will be made by Merseyside
                                         Police, but asks that we forward his letter to the Chief
                                         Constable, South Yorkshire Police for his attention.

                                              I therefore suggest that his letter be forwarded to the
                                         A.C.C. (C & D) for onward transmission to South Yorkshire.

Dear

Hillsborough Disaster - 15 April 1989

Thank you for your letter dated 19 April 1 9 8 9 , which has kindly been passed
on to me by the Merseyside Police, concerning the disastrous event at
Hillsborough Football Stadium on the above date.

Firstly, may I say that your hurt and frustration on the accuracy or
otherwise of the many words spoken after the horrendous incident are entirely
understandable, hence my Chief Constable's embargo on any further comment
by South Yorkshire police officers.

I note that your letter contains no complaint of misconduct on the part of
any police officer to yourself or your son but rather offers criticism on
the remarks afterwards which may well prove unfounded and mistaken.

You will be aware of the inquiry being conducted by Lord Justice Taylor and
Mr G Dear of the West Midlands Police into the events at Hillsborough which
I am sure will be of the most rigorous and independent character. You may
therefore consider that.the public interest may better be served by offering
your son or any member of your family who was present at Hillsborough as
witnesses in that inquiry rather than invoking the police complaints
procedure which principally deals with police misconduct and indiscipline
on duty.

I hope you may feel that on balance this would be a more constructive course
of action, and to this end I have taken the liberty of passing a copy of
your letter to the West Midlands Inquiry team.

Yours

There        was    very        little        movement        of    fans             along       Penistone                  Road       North

'The F o x '        public         house,       a    considerable                    number          of    f an s        were

good        humour,        well     behaved          but    in g e n e r a l           were          standing               a r o u nd and

seemed        reluctant            to m a k e       their     way       to       the       ground.                 Large         numbers          Were

carrying           cans     of     beer       and    lager       obviously                 purchased                from         other        than

public        houses.            I personally              advised           a       number          of    these            fans       on the

implications               of    trying        to e n t e r      the     ground with                      alcohol            in       t h ei r

possession.                The     stock       reply was           "I 'll            drink       it       before            I get        in the

ground mate".                   I n o t i c e d at     this        time          that        ’The         G a t e ’ public               h o us e

that       they      had       no    officers          available           at    t h at   time.             I was       of    the

At     2.55pm         (1455)         I joined          Inspector           Millett        and      other          Serials         at       the

junction            of L e p p i n g s       L a n e / C l a y w h e e 1s Lane.           It w a s          most    noticeable                  that

large       quantities               of     bottle       and     canned         beers     had      been       d i s c a r d e d at

this       point       along         with        empties.           I became          aware       of    an    increase            in

radio       traffic,            one       particular           officer          was    very anxio us               about        the

s i t u a t i o n at       a    gate        and    requesting          that       it s h o u l d        be    opened          and      that

fans       were       in d a n g e r        of    being     crushed.             At    leas t      three          requests            were

made       for      t-he g a t e       to    be    opened.           It w a s     cl e a r     t hat        the    problem was                  at

the W e s t         stand.

At   3pm     <1500)           with         other         serials          under     the       command         of    Inspector

Millett1
       , we                approached                the      ground       by w a y      of L e p p i n g s        Lane.         On

arrival          at    th e      ground,it              appeared           to m e       that      Police       officers

outnumbered                fap        at       this      point'-,' w h a t       fans     were         outside          th e    ground

w^re     being         presented                from       sintering        t he    ground.            Radio        traffic              at    this

point      appeared              to       be    frequent            a n d ‘urgent.            It w a s       apparent           to me

there      was        problems             in t h e        ground.          A    considerable                number        of    fan s w e r e

milling          about        in the            direction            of C a t c h b a r       Lane.          I was       under           the

impression             they       had          been      pushed       b a ck     by th e         officers          in L e p p i n g s

Lane.        A    number          of       fans         were    i rr a t e ,     aggressive,             and       holding           tickets

up     demanding            entry          to     the      ground.          A senior             officer       then        ordered a

c o r d o n to        be    formed             across         the    entrance           on Leppings            Lane.            At       this

point      having           formed             the      c o r d o n we     were     joined          by o f f i c e r s         from

Mo unted Branch.                      A    fan approached                  me     very     ir rate,          it wa s       apparent

he'd     been         drinking             and       was      waving       his     arms       about      holding           a    t ic k e t ,

saying       "I've          got       a    ticket"            and was        demanding            entry       to    the        ground.              I

advised          him       that       fans        were        not    being       allowed          to    enter       because.of                 a

serious          incident             in the            West    stand.           This      particular              fan     became             more

aggressive             and was             approached               by a M o u n t e d        officer         who       advised           him       in

strong       terms          to    le a v e        the      ar ea.         Th e   youth        attempted            to    push        the

Police       horse          away          and     in d o i n g       so    lost     his       balance         and       fell     beneath

th e    h o r s e ’s h o o v e s .              He      got    up a n d      immediately               struck       a stone              pillar

with     his      right          fist          causing         his    knuckles           to      spl i t .     An       older        man       then

took     him a w a y          saying            " I' v e      seen     it all,          i t 's    ridiculous,              h e ’ ll

complain,             I' m a w i t n e s s " .                It w a s     at    this      point        that       I heard           a

message          on    the       radio          fo r     all    available           officers            to    enter        the       g rou nd .

At     approximately                  3.05pm            <1505)       I entered           the      ground       by w a y         of       the

             were     physically             interferring                with        officers,              I personally             had      to

             strongly        advise          fans       to     leave      the        area.           Liquid         was      pouring       down       the

             to    respond        to    this.

             It    seemed       to me        that       th e    remaining                fans      in the         West       stand     would         be

E N D OF   REPORT
              INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROEGH                    p g # 2228.   A'   Sl> £
              SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989                      Dennis Arthur Atkin.
                                                          A3/Askern.



At 8am, Saturday 15 April 1989» I commenced duty at Doncaster Divisional
Headquarters to be conveyed by Police Transit to the football stadium at
Hillsborough in connection with the F.A. Cup Semi Final between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest.


My designated duty was that of Officer in Charge of Serial 33» Officers
detailed to perform duty in that serial were :
PC's 2576 McEwen
     1953 Wortley
     2510 Pattison
     2922 Denton
     2689 Lacey
     2063 Stevenson
     2091 Highton
     27^9 Allen.


At 10am the officers on duty were assembled in the North Stand for briefing
by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. Very little information was available
regarding what numbers were expected to travel to the ground without tickets.
Serials were to be briefed by designated Inspectors. In the event my serial
received no detailed briefing. However the Operational Order was adequate
and carried sufficient information to enable me to brief my serial on their
duties. I was in possession of a Burndept radio.


At 1130am, in company with Inspector Millett I deployed serial personel as
follows:   (PENISTONE ROAD NORTH)

PC's 2091 and 2689 at the entrance to the   Travellers Rest Inn which wasclosed.
PC*s 2063 and 2922 service road entrance side of Travellers Rest.
PC's 2510 and 1953 alongside wall forming garden boundary of Fairest Funeral Cntr.
PC's 2576 and 27*+9 entrance to Fairest Funeral Centre.


There was very little movement of fans along Penistone Road North until
approximately 1 .30pm. From this time on the flow of fans both towards the
ground and north towards Wadsley Bridge increased. A considerable number of
fans were asking directions for the    'THE FOX' public house, a considerable

number of fans were approaching others saying    'any spares'. In general the
fans were in good humour, well behaved but in general were standing around
and seemed reluctant to make their way to the ground. Large numbers were
carrying cans of beer and lager obviously purchased from other than public
houses. I personally advised a number of these fans on the implications
of trying to enter the ground with alcohol in their possession. The stock
reply was *1*11 drink it before I get in the ground mate'. I noticed at
this time that the, 'The Gate' public house was open and allowing Liverpool
supporters to enter.


At 2.30pm, I noticed a marked increase in the number of fans approaching
from the Wadsley Bridge area. An high proportion of these fans had obviously
been drinking, they were chanting slogans, disorderly    and were male persons
mainly in the age group of 18 to 25 years of age group. Some coaches were
still arriving at this time.


At 2.it5pm there was a marked decrease in the flow of fans to the ground,
although I saw four coaches off loading their passengers on Halifax Road to
the north of Wadsley Bridge. The fans from these coaches were much the
same as those described in the preceeding paragraph. Because the flow of fans
had decreased to a trickle I decided to essemble the serial outside the
'The Travellers Rest' with a view to commence Phase 2 of the operation (Stanby
duties at junction of Catchbar Lane/Leppings Lane)


At 2.50p, the serial was delayed at a disturbance at the *The Gate' involving
Liverpool supporters and local residents. This disturbance was quelled by
the officers attending leaving some sixty supporters still in the premises.
I radioed control advising them of the situation and requesting that we be
relieved by other officers in order that the serial could go on with Phase 2.
The response was that they had no officers available at that time. I was of
the opinion that the serial would be better deployed nearer the ground so
I advised cintrol that I was joining Inspector Millett in order to commence
Phase 2. Being ofay with the layout of Leppings Lane/West Stand entrance
and aware of the large number of fans I had seen approaching the ground late
I thought there may be some problems on Leppings Lane.


At 2.55pm» I joined Inspector Millett and other serials at the junction of
Leppings Lsne/Claywheels Lane. It was most noticeable that large quantities
of bottle and canned beers had been dscarded at this point along with empties.
I became aware of an increase in radio traffic, one particular officer
was very anxious about the situation at a gate and requesting that it should
be opened and that fans were in danger of being crushed. At least three
requests were made for the gate to be opened. It was clear that the problem
was at the West Stand.


At 3Pm » with other serials under the command of Inspector Millett, we approached
the ground by way of Leppings Lane. On arrival at the ground it appeared
to me that Police Officers outnumbered fans at this point, what fans were
outside the ground were being prevented from entering the ground. Radio traffic
at this point appeared to be frequent and urgent. It was apparent to me there
was problems in the ground. A considerable number of fans were milling about
in the direction of Catchbar Lane. I was under the impression they had been
pushed back by the officers on Leppings Lane. A number of fans were iratet
aggressive and holding tickets up demanding entry to the ground. A senoir
officer then ordered a cordon to be formed across the entrance on Leppings
Lane. At this point having formed the cordon we were joined by officers from
mounted branch. A fan approached me very irate, it was apparent he'd been
drinking and was waving his arms about holding a ticket, saying 'I've got a ticket'
and was demanding entry to the ground. I advised him that fans were not being
allowed to enter because of a serious incident in the West Stand. This particular
fan became more aggressive and was approached by a mounted officer who adiised
him in strong terms to leave the area. The youth attempted to push the Police
Horse away and in doing so lost his balance and fell beneath the horse's hooves.
He got up and immediately struck a stone pillar with his right fist causing
his knuckles to split. An older man then took him away saying, "Iftve seen it
all its ridiculas, he!11 complain, I'm a witness*. It was at this point that
I heard a message on the radio for all available officers to enter the ground.


At approximately 3»05pm, I entered the ground by way of the gate leading to
the rear of the West Stand and the tunnel feeding the terraces. The serial at
this point fragmented. On entering the space at the rear of the stand I was
met by a scene of utter confusion. Fans stood in groups some angry, some
distressed. Police Officers assisted by civilians were trying to resutitate
people on the ground, fans were laying on the floor unattended. I went to
the tunnel and with the assistance of other officers pulled a male person
out, his fingernails were blue, there was fluid coming from his mouth and
nostrils, there was no sign of a pulse, it appeared to me he was dead. There
was a strong smell of alcQhol. Attempts made to resueitate this man were without
success. I was then involved in assisting with the dead and injured. Fans
were stood about, some were angry, some were distessed, a large number were
drunk, some   were physically interferring with officers , I personally had to
strongly advise fans to leave the area. Liquid was pouring down the back of the
Stand.
                                                                    r-     —
I was later given to understand that this was urine. I could see damge being
caused to the covered stairway of the stand I was unable to sespond to this.


It seemed to me that the remaining fans in the West Stand would be leaving
the ground and there was every likelyhood this would interfere with the
police opertaion involving the dead and injured. With what available manpower
was available and with the assistance of some Liverpool supporters I formed
a cordon to prevent these fans leaving by way of the gate leading to the service
road at the rear of the stand where the dead and injured were being assembled
awaiting collection by ambulance.


Throughout the latter part of this incident I witnessed officers who'.wwe
distressed, sickened by the whole incident being subjected to spitting, verbal
abuse and countless unfounded accusations. I cannot recall any officer in
my view responding unprofissionally or whose conduct I would have thought
inappropriate in the circumstances.

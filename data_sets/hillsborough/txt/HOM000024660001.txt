     It is also understood that a number of the larger Clubs are also themselves
arranging for provision of defibrillators and oxygen equipment.

     With regard to First Aid facilities at Football Grounds, an indication of
the minimum standard required has already been forwarded by ourselves to the
Football Authorities, and we are currently awaiting completion of joint visitations
by the S.F.A. and our own medical experts to all Premier Division grounds in order
that a joint report might be drawn up, and action taken where required.

     We are also in dialogue with individual Clubs in an endeavour to agree a
formula for levels of donation to the Association to cover our costs in providing
the First Aid service, which costs now include administration, provision of
materials and equipment, training, travelling expenses etc.

     I trust the above information wi 11 be of use to you.


                                                 Yours sincerely,

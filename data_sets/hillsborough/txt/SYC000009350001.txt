IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE

Mr. & Mrs. L. Jones,




Dear Mr. & Mrs. Jones,

We are writing to follow up our earlier correspondence about your son, Richard, who died on 15th
April, 1989. We are sorry this has taken so long; as you know the Retained Organs Commission
(ROC) has insisted that all NHS Trusts undertake a comprehensive review of their information
systems to ensure that accurate information can be provided.

The Retained Organs Commission has now approved our information systems following careful
checking by a team from the NHS Executive Regional Office. We are therefore able to give you
the following information.

A post mortem was carried out on Richard on 16th April, 1989, at the Medico-Legal Centre,
Sheffield at the Coroner’s request in order to ascertain the cause of death. We have no reason to
believe that any organs or tissue samples were retained. However, we believe you are already
aware that a sample of blood was retained for toxicology.

Further, in the absence of any information to the contrary, and following the expiry of a deadline
for notification to us, we are confident that no organs are held elsewhere in national or regional
collections. So far as tissue blocks or slides are concerned, it was not our practice at the time to
refer blocks and slides for inclusion in national or regional collections and we have no evidence to
suggest that this was ever done in the case of Alan.
We are truly sorry for any uncertainty and distress about the circumstances surrounding your
son’s death. We can assure you that the new arrangements have been developed and introduced
to ensure that others in future will not be subject to similar unnecessary concerns.

Yours sincerely,




A. CASH,                                        C. P. DORRIES,
Chief Executive.                                H.M. Coroner.

Dear Mr Jones
I am writing to enclose a copy of a letter that I have sent today to Ann Adlington. You will
note that I had originally believed the delay in sending papers to you was due to the loss of
correspondence in the post between ourselves and the Police but a second delayed matter
makes it plain that the error actually occurred within this office.
I am extremely sorry that you were put to the trouble of having to chase correspondence
up in this fashion.
Yours sincerely

Re: H1LLSBROUGH STATEMENTS


Dear Mr Jones,

Thank you for your letter of 9th February. I am sorry for the delay in replying to you but I
understand you have had a telephone message in the meantime.

Because it appears that the statements do not fall within Rule 57 I have asked the Police
to supply copies from their facilities.

If you do not hear anything within the next two weeks please do not hesitate to contact me
again.

Yours sincerely

  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                   Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                         Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.

     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                   Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:

     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                   Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

   Dear Sirs,

   Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


   If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
   of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
   on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
   due course.

   I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
   evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
   coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
   inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

   Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
   under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
   witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
   this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

   Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter,I am writing   to you
   to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
   appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
   consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

    May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
    attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

    I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
    names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that thedecision as
    to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter  for me.

    I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
    heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
    submit.

    Yoy^s faithfully,




         Tffpper,
          Coroner.

Hes       RIGHAH35 JONBS (deceased) F0.63*

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,

Dear Mr Jones
Thank you for your letter dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
which I have noted and have read with care.
Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
you view the points raised, I do not think that it is either right
or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
the issue which you have raised.
However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
to say that it is not my intention to call either Dr Ashton or
Dr Phillips.
I have alBo read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
apply for a judicial review is a matter entirely for you and/or your
advisors and I do not think that I should comment on this either.
Yours sincerely



S L POPPER
H M Coroner
                                                 12th February, 1991




Dear Dr. Popper.

At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a series of questions concerning
the aftermath at Hillsborough, we were left with the impression that the
questions would be dealt with at a later stage.

However since then you have ruled that it is not necessary to proceed after
15.15pm and it now appears that our questions will not be addressed, you
did say that in an ideal world everyone would have ended up i*n hospital and
you suggested that we were naive in thinking that the medical response was
inadequate, that sort of answer is not conducive to the facts as shown in
the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying valiantly to
assist the injured.
                                                                        «
The video shows it took till at least 15.35pm before all the casualties
were removed from the pens, a fairly lengthy delay which obviously did
nothing to help their chances of survival.

Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
enclosed) certainly imply that in their opinion, the response left a lot to
be desired.

We also know of people who were removed in an unconscious state, a prime
example being Mr. Edward Spearritt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
it was possible for people in the crush who suffered severe injury to
survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.

At the very least this raises questions in the eyes of the families that
the inefficiency of the major incident response could have contributed to
the number of deaths occurring at Hillsborough and therefore we consider
that this should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for the
deaths.

You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
it would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.
We would suggest the two most qualified Medical Personnel namely Dr. John
Ashton and Dr. Glynn Phillips be called to give evidence at your inquests,
so they can be questioned as to their medical opinion of whether the
response contributed at all to the amount of fatalities.

We think you realise the seriousness which we place on this matter, and we
feel that if you fail to address this situation, that this failure will
obviously form part of a case for judicial review no matter what verdict is
reached.

Dear Mrs Jones
Thank you for your letter dated 14 January 1991.
Apart from saying that I am obviously sorry that you are upset, I do
not think it would be appropriate to make any other comment. I am
sure you will understand that.
Yours sincerely

I wish to make an amendment to the information that was given

to the Coroner's Office shortly after April 15th 1989.

I wish to add B.Sc. after my son's name.

RICHARD JONES B.Sc.

Richard graduated from Sheffield University with an Honours

Degree in Chemistry in 1987.   At the time of Richards death

his degree was far from my mind, but what I did not realise

was, that as time progessed,   I personally would be made to

feel that his reputation and integrity, and that of the other

94 people who died would be questioned.

^ ^ r e f e r to your recent conversation with Superintendent
  Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
  the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
  following the adjournment of the inquest.

 After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
 to this course of action.

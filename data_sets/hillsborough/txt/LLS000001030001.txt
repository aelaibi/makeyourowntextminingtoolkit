                 will say as follows:-



   On Saturday the 15th April 1989 I travelled                            to Sheffield for

   the purposes of attending the Semi-Final                          of        the       F.A.      Cup

   between       Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough

   Ground.       I had a ticket for the match                  and        travelled              there

   with m y teenage Nephew.



   I     arrived at Turnstile           ,B" at the Leppings Lane end at 2.30

   p.m.     It was obvious to me that there were too                             many        people

   attempting          to get into the turnstiles and a crush situation

   developed.          Police,    I noticed,     tried to shut the                       gates     but

   the    weight        of the crowd pushed them open again.                              I noticed

   three horses         trying to control        the     crowd        but        the        numbers

   were     such       that   this     made little difference.                       It was also

   obvious to me that,            despite the concern at the crush,                              there

   was     no    violence        in   the   crowd,       altho ugh             we, as regular

   supporters,         were amazed at the            apparent        inability              of     the

   Police       to     organize       the crowd in such a fashion that would

   have led us into the ground in an orderly fashion.
                                                          ft




At 2.35 p.m.         I got out of the crowd and stood                     by     the       gate

that was eventually to be opened.                At that time I really was

   not interested in going back into^the queue and was prepared

   to miss the game.             At 2.45 p.m. I detected              impatience in the

   crowd        as    no-one seemed to be going through the turnstiles.


                                            PAGE 1
     I did note a beer can was thrown at one Police Officer



At 2.50 p.m.                the gate at       which     I        was       stood    was     opened.

Myself        and others by the gate entered in an orderly fashion

and we all went                through the tunnel which led into the middle

section of the standing area.                         There were two                much     smaller

entrances           nearby           which    were      not being used.               They looked

like minor doorways as compared                          to the            wide      tunnel.         We
                                                            \V
could        have       entered         through       these doorways had we known or

been led that way but no-one explained the situation.                                              Once

through           the       tunnel      I could see that the standing area was

full.        I tried to turn back but the weight of people                                       coming

in     from        behind        prevented        me from doing so.                  I knew there

were several thousand people who had come through the tunnel

and at this time I was extremely concerned and frightened.

At 2.53 p.m. as we were all being crushed and moved down the

terracing I came against a crash barrier.                                    I could not           move

to avoid it/ although I was continually being pushed                                         forward

by     the        crowd        entering        from     the rear.            I attempted to go

under the barrier,                   rather than risk            getting          pinned    against

it.      There was a man to my right who was pinned against the

barrier and I could hear him screaming but                                    could        not     help

him.         As     I went down my head stuck against                             the barrier,        I
                                                                       *
somehow managed                to get free but I injured                     my     neck     and     my

back.         My        left     arm     was     then stuck around the leg of the

barrier.           I was pushed downwards but could                          not move        as     the

leg     was        against my armpit.                 I suffered much bruising to my

left arm and rib-cage.                       I don't know          how       I     got     free     but

eventually              I     did.      I tried to stand up but couldn't,                          so I


                                                PAGE 2
  pushed both hands upwards and someone must then have                        pulled

  me up from the floor.



  At 2.56 p.m.        I was approximately halfway down the steps.                     At

  this      time I had lost my watch,            scarf,      glas ses and shoes.         I

  found myself walking on a body.                    I couldn't    help whoever       it

  was on the floor as I just couldn't move my limbs to protect

  myself let alone help anyone                  else.
                                                       W



  We     shouted       to    the Police on the pitch beyond the barriers

   that there were people under                foot but they      only shouted      back

   telling us to "push             back".       Myself and        others    told     the

   Police      to     open    a small gate which we noticed to our right

   and to cut down           the    front      fencing but        our   shouts      were

   ignored.



  At    3.00    p.m. at kick-off,            I felt myself      getting wea ker and

  weaker.      Panic started to set in amongst                 the crowd as        there

  was    no    wa y    out.        Many     people    were    screaming and others

  simply walked over our heads,                desperate      to get out.

The match was stopped at 3.06 p.m. and at that time we                        were

still    fighting for our lives.              Several      times I felt the air

   was totally squeezed out of me and I had                     to make a conscious

   decision to stay calm and to keep breat hing de eply as best I

    could.



    At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.15 p.m. a gap appear ed on my left              and       I

    went      into it and was fortunately helped over the fence into

    another section of the ground.


                                             PAGE 3
 Throughout this      terrifying          incident      there    was      no      crowd

 violence/       simply    panic     at     the   situation        we     were       in

Everyone tried to     help    each        other   but     un fort u n a t e l y    to

little effect.
    As I walked onto the pitch I noticed several Police Officers

    simply      standing there not helping those left in the Lepping

  Road Stand.      I was   in a state of shock and simply got out of

  the ground as best I could.             I havfe since       been      to     see      my

  Doctor with regard to the crush injuries that I received.

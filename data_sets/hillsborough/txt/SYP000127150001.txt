 STATES! ARRIVED AT GROUND 1430 HRS. THE PERIMETER GATES AT LEPPINGS LANE WERE
 OPEN. AS I GOT TO THE TURNSTILES PEOPLE WERE CRUSHING AGAINST EACH OTHER & AT
 ONE POINT I GOT CRUSHED AGAINST A POLICE HORSE. THERE WAS NOTHING THE
 POLICEMAN COULD DO DUE TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE & I THINK HE WAS AS
 F ^ S H T E N E D AS I WAS, EVEN THE HORSE COULD NOT MOVE.

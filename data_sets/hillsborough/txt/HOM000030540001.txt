       Dear  Peter

       H illsborough Stadium Disastelr 1989

       I attaeh th e letter I recently sent to Matthew PYNE, Home Office Police Unit, about the
       am ended statements of police officers, Mr Pyne telephoned me on 6 October 1998 and
       told me that he had discussed this with George C R O STO N, Special Caseworker CPS. Mr
       Pyne told him that a Liverpool Mem ber of Parliament, Maria EAGLE, has tabled a question
       asking why the Home Secretary has not honoured his promise to place tn the House of
       Commons Library the am ended*statem ents         Miss EAGLE is close to the Hillsborough
       Family Support Group (HFSG ) and I suspect she knows the answer to the question. The
       question is due for answer in a few weeks when the Commons reconvene. Mr Pyne feels
       that t h | Home Secretary’s promise should be honoured because it predates the
       commencement of the private prosecutions. The Home Secretary gave that undertaking
       when Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny report was published (February 1998) and only
       gave that undertaking after the Chief Constable had agreed.

       Mr Pyne says that Mr Croston has ao objection to the release of the statements. If that is
       the case, then I wonder if I can, or should, continue to withhold them.

        Please advise me as soon as possible

       Yours sincerely

       D ear Mr Pyne

        H illsborough   Stadium Disaster 1989

        I refer to your letter of 1 Septem ber 1998 and to my acknowledgement dated 9 S e p te m le r.

        Municipal Mutual Insurance are content for Peter Metcalf’s letters to be released, so is Mr
        Metcalf and so am I.

        In relation to the statements of police officers, I do see a difficulty. As indicated in my letter
        of 9 Septem ber, I have taken legal advice and my reply is based upon that advice.          ^    —

        Immediately prior to the publication of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny report, the £ t p f
        Constable agreed to place in the House of Commons Library those statements of pdftce
        officers which had been am ended. That process was continuing when, on 26 June 1
        Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group (H FSG ), initiated
        private prosecutions against two former police officers.

        The Director of Public Prosecutions is reviewing the case to determine w hether she will
        take over the prosecutions. The advice of the Crown Prosecution Service is that the Chief
        Constable may wish to make no voluntary disclosure of material while that review is in
        progress.

        Accepting that advice, I have declined requests for material from:

        a)      various people representing the HFSG

        b)      solicitors representing each of the two former police officers                                      ^

        c)      the Football Association

        d)      numerous requests from individuals.




                                      Tel: 0114 2523405   Fax: 0114 2523481
OCT   ’ 98    7:41    FROM S . Y . P .   CHIEF.DEPT.            0114 2523481      8481         . 003




A parallel case may be of interest.         W hen the Home Secretary announced the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny, I suspended the release of material
from the South Yorkshire Police Hillsborough archive until I had asked Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's permission. He told me that he was content for me to continue to release material
so I did so. This is analogous to the present position.

 W hen the DPP has m ade public her decision on the Hillsborough prosecutions, I will return
 to the question of releasing the officers statements     I hope this reply will m eet the
 requirements of the Home Secretary, If it causes any difficulty, please do not hesitate to
 contact me

 Yours sincerely

 Assistant Chief Constable

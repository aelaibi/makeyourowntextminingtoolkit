               and        had           known                David        for      seven          or     eight              years.

                The       last           time                 I saw       David         was       early               Saturday         morning          of    the       match           and

                we    had           a    very                 short       conversation                   during              whi eh     he    told       me    that        he        had

                just       got           tickets                   -for      the       match       at         Hillsborough.

                I borrowed                        a       car      from       a    mats        and        I        left      for      the    match       about          10*30

              •am     -    11.00                  just            myself          and       the     two            lads.          There      was    a    lot       of    traffic

                and       we        were              held         up     quite         a    lot,         I think                it   was    about       S . 30     pm    when             we

                got       to        Sheffield*

                Because                 we        were            late       due       to    the         traffic             problem         we    went       straight,              to

                the       ground,                     There          was      hundreds              of            people         milling      around          outside             the

                ground              but           there            was       no    problems               just          a    normal         football          crowd.             We

                queued              up       and              went      in    through             gate            B    Leppings         Lane       End*        After          going

                through                 the           turnstile               I took           the            boys      towards         a    tunnel          straight

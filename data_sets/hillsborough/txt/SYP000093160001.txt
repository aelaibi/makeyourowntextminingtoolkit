                           On Saturday 15th April      1989 (150489) I was on duty in connection with

                           the F.A. Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough between Nottingham Forest and

                           Liverpool.       At 9 am (0900)   I attended at the briefing at West Bar

3u ^              p        Police Station and the Serial to whi ch I was attached were responsible

                           for escorting supporters from the Midland Station to Hillsborough.                             At

                           10 am (1000)      that day I began this duty.          The Serial to which I was
  x~r~'
                           attached were responsible for escorting most of the Nottingham



       v                   supporters to Hillsborough.

                           of the day.

                           good humour,
                                                                 stayed outside of the Station for most

                                             The majority of the supporters were well behaved and

                                             although there were isolate^ groups of youths who had
                                                                                                                  1   n



                           obviously been drinking and were a little rowdy.                 At approximately

         ^                 £.30 pm (1430)      I escorted a double decker bus which was full with

                           Nottingham supporters from the Station to Hillsborough                   I was
                                                                                              S3 7 42

                 accompanied at this time b y PC 687 A S H M O R E .   We arrived at

                 Hillsborough at 2.50 pm ( 1450), after a uneventful journey,           the

                 supporters on the bus were well behaved and had been chanting football

                 songs.   Upon arrival at Hillsborough,       I was surprised to see how many

                 supporters were still outside the ground the roads on which we had

                 been travelled were    packed with fans and outside the ground it was

                 mass of supporters, who were waiting to get in myself a n d PC ASHMORE

                 then made our way to the gym to meet up with our serial and to be put

                 on standby.     We arrived in the gym and were speaking to other members

                 of our serial when we were requested to attend at the Leppings Lane

                 end, we went from the gym behind the North Stand towards the Leppings

                 Lane end with a number of other Serials.         At this time 1 was unaware

                 of why we were attending the Leppings Lane end,          but I assumed that it

                 was fighting.     At the corner of the Leppings Lane end and the North

         tf*     Stand we were stopped by an Inspector whose name I do not know.                While

                 we were standing there, a number of fans who were very upset, were

                 telling us that people were being killed outside,          and that the gates

                 should be opened.     I also saw youths climbing over the top of the wall

                 and coming into the ground.       We were then told to stand around the

                 gates whilst they were opened.       The gates were opened and a lot of
i    t
                 people came flooding    in.   We were still    being approached by youths who

                 were hysterical and were shouting abuse at us.           I then saw an elderly

                 couple who were staggering around and looked ill.           I made my way

               yj^towards them and led them to the side away from the main flood of

    y*     |/^fa n s who were still     coming through the gates         A St J o h n ’s ambulance-

                 man approached me and began to speak to the couple.            I then resumed

                 back to my position near the gates.        After a couple of minutes the

                 gates were closed and our serial was told to go around onto the pitch.

                 Upon arriving onto the pitch I saw p#aple who were being crushed onto

    $            the fencing and it was apparent that a number were already dead.                 I

            saw a youth who was gasping for breath and staggering around on the

            edge of the penalty box

            I approached him and encouraged him to take deep breaths.            I stayed

            with this youth for quite some time.        He began to recover and said

            that he was okay. So I went back to the fence to see if I could

            assist anybody else.- Back at the fence I saw Police Officers

            everywhere they were hanging over the fencing in an attempt to pull

            tfpeopie clear of the crush.
    ✓
            I then saw a group of Liverpool     fans who were carrying a yo u th on the

            advertising boards which had been made        into stretchers.    These youths


f.          were struggling to pick the youth up and so 1 assisted.

        ^^jsaw that the youth was dead,      his face was blue |

                                                               ______________________ |

                              I.   We ran the full    length of the pitch and left this
                                        r
            youth next to the gym where there were people who I assumed to be

            doctors.    I then ran back with the youths and collected a man who was

            lying on the grojijid; he was also dead.      We put him on the board and

^           ran back to near the gym where we again left him.         Two other officers

            picked him up and took him into the gym.         I then walked back to the

            centre of the pitch where a Chief        Inspector was organising to make a


if          Police   cordon to stop Liverpool fans attempting to make their way to

            the No?^rngf?am                  standing    in the cordon,   I was approached

            by a number of youths who were crying and threatening violence towards

            the Nottingham fans,     these youths were spoken to and agreed to go

            down to the Leppings Lane end where they had come from.           After some

            time we were told to leave the ground which I did.            I then made my way

            with other officers outside the ground and to a nearby transit which

            took us back to the Midland Station.        At 7.30 pm (1930)     that night I

        /   went off duty.    Throughout the incident      I was unable to hear anything

            which was passed over our personal       radio due to background noise,

              On Saturday the 15th of April                   1989 (150489),       I was on duty in

              connection with the FA Cup Semi-F inal at Hillsborough Football Ground

              between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.



              My pre-match duties involved escor^ip < y ^ip porters to the football

              ground from the Midland Stat-loln.



              Having ar          d at the ground at about 2,                                    yself and PC

              As a result of a request,                I, together with the rest of my serial, made

              my way to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
                                                                                                PAGE   2

         On arrival      I could see that people were being crushed against the

         fence.       I began to give assistance to fans on the pitch.



         Some time later I assisted t              carry at least two persons who appeared

         dead,      on hoardings,   to tr

         On Thursday the 8th of February 1990 (080290),                    I saw PC 8

         West Midlands Police at Force HQ, Snig Hill, Sheffield.                        I was     own

         I can identify myself        in the top right of the picture placing a body

         onto a hoarding.       I do not know the identity of this person,                    beat I

Dated                  130389                                                                Signed


            I am a Special Constable              stationed at Woodseats Police Station.

            have been a Special Constable since January 1988,

            At approximately       16.00 hrs on Saturday 15 April           1989 (150489),   as a

            result of hearing of the incident at Hillsborough football                 stadium on

            the radio,       I telephoned the Hammalton Rd Police Station and was

            advised to report for duty at Hillsborough football                 stadium.     I took

            my private vehicle and drove in that direction.                  On reaching

            Hillsborough Park the traffic was so heavy that I was unable to

            proceed.     I made contact with regular officers and as there were

            sufficient officers       in the area,      I was advised to attend Woodseats

            Police Station later.

            At SSOO hrs later that day I reported for duty and went to the

            Northern General Hospital         but was not required and returned for
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S886

         general    duty in the Netheredga^area.

         I was on duty in April     \9&jjg in the Semi-final   match at Hillsborough

         Stadium.    On that occasiran I was doing duty as traffic controller      in

         the Penistone Rd closyfi to the ground.     The traffic congestion on that

         day was just as    i e ^ y and bad with the football    supporters vehicles as

         it was on 15 Apr      1989 (150489).

         I was not in possession of a radio and I have never done any football

         duty at another ground except Hillsborough football stadium.

                                                                               SIGNED

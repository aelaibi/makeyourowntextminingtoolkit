 I FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONTROL BY STEWARDS OR POLICE

 WITHIN THE GROUND.    I ALSO FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE

 OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND TO MONITOR THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE APPROACHING

 THE TURNSTILES.     THE TURNSTILES SEEMED TO OPERATE SLOWLY, POSSIBLY

 BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE BEING TURNED AWAY.

           ~MTn   I
                  ,        --
 LOTS OF LIVES.

 2) PEOPLE WERE VIRTUALLY DYING ON THE^^iTCH AND THE POLICE WERE TELLING THEM

 TO GET BACK OFF THE PITCH.             I T H I ^ K T H E POLICE DID N’TREALISE WHAT   WAS

 HAPPENING.       THEY THOUGHT IT       W£S A PITCH INVASION.

 3) THE STEWARDS AND ST JOIjW AMBULANCE ACTED WELL IN ASSISTING PEOPLE.

 THERE WERE A LOT OF PEpfH-E SITTING ON THE PITCH AND THE POLICE KEPT ORDERING

 THEM OFF THE P I T C H y / m E S E PEOPLE WERE VISUALLY UPSET AND INJURED. J M E ^POLICE

         VERY ^LOW I X REACTING.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1)     I THOUGHT THERE COULD BE TROUBLE BETWEEN RIVAL FANS BUT THE POLICE

 HANDLED THAT VERY WELL.

 2) FIRST AID PEOPLE DID A GOOD JOB WITH WHAT THEY HAD AVAILABLE.

 m
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) IN A NUTSHELL THERE WERE JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THERE AND ONLY ONE SMALL

 GATE TO GET PEOPLE OUT.

 2) TOO MANY PEOPLE LATE IN ARRIVING CAUSING THIS MASSIVE SURGE SO LATE ON.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1)     I BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH TICKETS FOR THE NORTH

 STAND IN THE WEST STAND.             IT IS LIKELY THAT PERHAPS MANY OF THEM ON THE

 TERRACES BELOW WERE ALSO PEOPLE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE NORTH STAND

 BUT FOR SOME REASON HAD BEEN MIS-DIRECTED OR PREVENTED FROM GETTING TO THE

 NORTH STAND.

 2)     THE GATES FROM THE PENS ONTO THE PITCH WERE FAR TOO NARROW.

 I ^ T H E DELAY INTO GETTING TO THE GROUND WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF PARKING

 NEAR THE GROUND AND FORCED   TO DRIVE ONE AND A   HALF MILES AWAY.   IF    WE HAD

 MOTORWAY WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED.

 THAT TURNED UP,

HILLSBOROUGH: COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

Thank you for your letter of 15 June.

I fully support your aim of persuading the South Yorkshire  police
authority that the additional costs for the investigation should
fall initially to be met by them.   Any other outcome would set an
entirely unwelcome precedent.

I agree that a special payment offers the best hope of achieving
this and is justified in view of the likely scale of the costs  of
the  investigation  in relation to the authority's budget.  I also
agree that   in this   case   it would be    difficult to  justify
arrangements  less generous than those applied in the cases of the
miners' dispute and the demonstrations at RAF Molesworth.    I am
therefore content with    the   formula that you propose and for
Robin Ferrers to make an offer on this basis   when he meets   the
South Yorkshire police authority tomorrow.

Of  course the expenditure which the special payments cover will
represent a claim on the Reserve.  As such I must   ask  that you
make every effort    to make equivalent offsetting savings on your
cash limited Votes.

I am copying this letter to Nicholas Ridley.




                                                             JOHN MAJOR

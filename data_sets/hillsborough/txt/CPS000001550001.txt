    Dear Mr. Croston
                                              Hillshoronph Stadium Disaster 1989: Documents

    I refer to our telephone conversation today. I also acknowledge receipt of Chris Enzor’s third fax
    (14.40) of 31 December 1998.

    Developments since 24 December caused me to overlook the fact that you had been promised a
    formal response to your earlier letter of 23 December relating to privilege.

    My view is that none of the material requested from South Yorkshire Police is in fact privileged and
    I would prefer not to deal with the point until it arises. At that stage my view is likely to be that
    before considering the question of privilege it will be necessary to consider relevance. Generally I
    would not expect correspondence between police forces and CPS and/or CPS and counsel (including
    opinions) to be relevant to a prosecution because it usually represents comment on evidence rather
    than evidence in itself

       I assume from our conversations and from Chris Enzor’s earlier faxes of 31 December that CPS
       will be taking a broadly similar approach in relation to disclosure. Clearly there can be no objection
       to that course from the South Yorkshire Police. If, however, there are specific items which give rise
       to uncertainty please do not hesitate to contact me.


       Yours sincerely,




       P C Metcalf

Dear    /


^ p C K K OF THE BSE DJVESTCGATICN INTO THE HUISBGKXJGH DISASTER

Following your request, I enclose a set of the reports and annexes Which make
up the full compendium of the HSE investigation.

As I explained, some of these have not received final vetting so are marked
DRAFT. I understand that you require to read the reports as soon as possible
in order to discuss matters with the DPP. As you can see, you are on the
circulation for the final version of all the reports and I do not expect the
draft versions to be altered radically on final vetting.

If you have any comments please let me have them as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely

             outside       the L e pp in gs Lane            turnstiles.           We were       directed         to a t t e n d

             *A * , I could see             that     there was a large              crowd outside              the    t urnstiles

and the gate,             causing           the gate to buckle and bend under the                              pressure,

of the       people       outside-              It was    d ec i d e d    not      to open this gate?               becauue

it was       thought       the       people at the             front w o u l d be t r a m p l e d on.               We    then

went    to the        rear      of the West S t a nd             to the turnstiles,,                numbers         "I -•

16.     We      could see          several        people       climbing over             the    turns tile         roofing

■from outside            the    ground;,         gaining       access         into the      ground.,        assisted        by

a P olice        Inspecto r , who wa s s ta ndi n g o n t o p of the                            t urn s ti 1 e r o o f .

The    area      behind        the    turnstile          was    not     very      busy and       it w a s     obvious

that    people        were      having          difficulty        in g e t t i n g      through     the

turnstiles.              I could          see    through       the     turnstiles         and    realised          that

there     were      several          hundred       outside       the     ground         trying     to    cjet in.         Each

t u r n s t i 1 e wa s    b 1 oc:ked, p e o p 1 e w e r e        being         pushed     up a g a i n s t    the

turnstile         gate,        making       it    inoperative.            Some         people    got     through         and

were    obviously          injured          and    in a g r e a t       deal      of    pain.      I helped         them       to

one    s i de   and      tried       to     free    one of      th e     turnstiles,           w hi ch was     jammed..

People       were     screamingand               shouting       for    h e lp,      requesting          the    gates        to

be    opened.

In an effort             to get       outside       the ground,               I f o l l o w e d Pol i c e    S e r geant

Wright       towards       gate       ’C " , w hich was          open.           I lost     sight       of him and my

other     colleagues and                  returned to the              rear of gate            'B ’ , w h i c h was

closed.         There      I hel p e d a man who                had some a b dominal               injury,         moving

him to a safe             place where             he was       left sat down.               I looked          towards       the

centre       tunnel,       w hi ch gives access                 to the L e p p i n g s Lane             terracing.             I

could see         there was a large                 crowd       in an arc ar o u n d            the entrance

trying       to get       t hr o u g h the tunnel.                I never         saw any Po l i c e         Officers          or

stewards         in that a r e a .

1 looked towards                gate              and saw a steady                stream of        people       entering

the ground,           m o v in g     into       the are a      behind         the West Stand.               Most    walked

straight         f or w a r d towards            the tunnel.             An    Inspector,        who was        stood

near     gate     » C ’ and the tu rns t i l e s a d j a c e n t                 to the gate,           i n d i c a t e d and
shou t e d an order               to open gate         *B’, which          I was      next     to.     A steward

was     on the gate and               refused       to open        it.     Another       man,.     I believe           to be

a stew a r d         came up,        was    g iven the keys          to the gate an d u n l o c k e d              it.

Wi th    the a s s is ta nc e         of Police C o ns ta b l e           223 6 B r o w n an d Police

Con s t a b l e      1632 Smith,           I pulled one           side    of the gate          open,       allowing

fans     through         into      the ground.            The     gate had been b u c kling                under       the

pressure          of the       people outside a n d               I realised there were a lot                      of

people about             to    come through.              I th e r e f o r e    pushed a g a i n s t       the    crowd

to slow the entry down,                      preventing anyone                 from falling          down and being

pushed.           Several         people     lost    their        footwear,        w h i c h was     placed to one

side and          left.        In the       region of        100 people           ente r e d   the gr o u n d

through this             gate w hi ch was           open for betw e e n 30 seconds                    and one

minute,       to the          best    of my       recollection.            Host     of the       people who

e nt e r e d the ground either went                       to the     programme          s e l l e r ’s van nearby

or towards            the     entrance       to the L e p p i n g s Lane           t e r racing      by the N o r t h

Stand.        Access          could    not    be gained           to the       central    ter r a c i n g    this way

unless      people          climbed over the              barriers       and the walls.               Once       the    gate

was     closed 1 went             to find Police             S e r g e a n t Wright,      who was          outside       the

turnstiles.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.05          p.m.   a radio m e s s a g e was           received        from the

Gr o u nd Control             d ir ec t i n g all    personnel           onto the       pitch      in front        of the

L e p p i ng s Lane         terracing.            I was    unsure as           to why they d i r e c t e d us

went     th rough a gate under                    the Pol i c e Control             box and went        through          a

track      towards          the   front      of the L e p p i n g s Lane           terrace.          As we did,          our

passage was             bloc k e d by Liverpool              supporters,           who wer e a n g r y and

trying to            prevent me from              getting         onto   the     pitch.        Ipushed them

Once     on the       pitch       I was    several       people       climbing        over    the      perimeter

fencing at the              centre       of the L e p p i n g s Lan e       terracing and              I could see

a 1 o t of      peo p 1 e be i ng        c r ushed up agai ns t the              f ence wi t-hi n t he          cent r e

pen.      Due to this             I f o l l o w e d Police S e r g e a n t Wright            thro u g h    gate 2 of

the    perimeter           fencing,       entering       into     the L e p pings Lane           tar races,           South

pen.      As we      did,     our' access was a gain               bloc k e d by fans          desperate          to

get    out.        Once     inside       I made my way to the                  back of the terracing,

w here    there      is a gate           in the     fencing w h i c h          d i v i d e d the two      pens.

There we r e several               s u p porters     s t o o d t h ere    bio cking       t h e p e n ma ki n g no

atte m p t    to    leave     the Centre S outh             pen    into the S o u t h         pen,     w h i c h was

nowhere       near as        c o ngested a € the Centre                 pen S. I s h o u t e d to them to

move     into the South             pen,    most     of the       supporters          refused       point       blank,

others m ov ed         in slowly either              by rne pushing             them or of their           own        free

will.        Whilst        I was    there       several     fans        came up to me.          They were

o b v ously drunk and s h o uting                  obscenities          r e g arding    the Po l i c e      and

critici sing         the P o l i c e      for    putting       them     in the       smaller     end of         the

ground.         A drunken youth              came    towards me          shouting,        “ I T ’S YOUR F AULT

Y O U B A S T A R D S. "     He    then hit me wit h his                fist     on the      right     side      of my

face.        He was above me and                 I was    being       pushed by other            s u p p o rters.        I

t h erefore        hit him on his            left arm w i t h my Police                truncheon.           At this

he s t u m bled      into the           crowd and       I lost     sight       of him.

M y a t t e n t i o n was     drawn to a y oung             girl who           was   crying. She          had

obviously          come     from the       centre       of the C e n t r e S outh         pen an d        was    very

distressed.          I e s c o r t e d her       through the            gate and       left her        in the S outh

t hro u g h the      gate.         By    this    time    the     gate    had once a g a i n         beenblocked

and the       suppo r t e r s w o u l d      not    listen to me.              I could see          several

people       climbing        into the West S t a n d seating a rea above.                            1 tried to

stop them because                 they were        falling and          injuring       people       below.        1 was

pushed awa y and had no option but                          to    leave     them.      A man     came      up to me,

stated he was a M e r se ys id e Police Officer.                            He took       over     from me

trying       to tell       the    crowd to      pass t h r o u g h the gate          into      the South

peri.       The      fans    were    still      insistent        on stopping         in the Ce n t r e         pen,

ignoring          both the        requests     of myself        and this        other man.           I noticed

numerous          persons w i th in the           crowd were        drunk,      some      had d i f f i c u l t y

been     involved          in the    crush below.

I then went           down       the terracing        towards           the centre of        the Centre South

pen.        I stop p e d whe n       I reached a number                  of bodies on        the floor.                 I

saw that w i t hi n the             pile    of foodies a barrier              had fallen over and had

been u p r o o t e d       from the       concrete.        There w&t&s a         large      number        of

bodies,       m o s tl y    lying on top of each other.                     I saw      people      climbing             on

top of the bodies                trying     to climb over           the    perimeter        fence.         I looked

down     towards       the       fence and     saw several          officers a s s i s t i n g       injured

people       by the fence.             1 saw three         or four        officers       s tood at        the front

of    the    bodies        and    realised, that       there were a large                number      of    bodies

on top of each other.                     I t h e refore     concevitrated on the              people

immedi a t e l y at my feet.

The     crowd behind me were                shouting a buse              at me and the Police             in

general,          c o m p l aining about       being     in the small        end     of      the ground.            I

told them to be quiet and help me,                           but    several      just     s tood and

watched.           I. saw one       person     lying on the             floor who was a g e d about                 15/

16 years.           He w a s n ’t b r e athing at all              so    I tried    to    revive      him using

mo u t h to m ou th         r e su sc it at io n and heart massage.                 I was      cons t a n t l y

being       pushed by people who were                   in a panic,         trying       to get      to the

front.        Several        fans were a ss is t i n g w i t h the            injured and the dead by

taking       them towards           the    side   fence and the front               perimeter         fence.

Three       fans a s s i s t e d me and took           the y o u t h who       1 had been trying                 to

revive       to a break           in the    fence.       I r e t urned to the bodies                and saw one

y outh      lying    in a mo n g s t      them who     had a lot of           colour      to his      face and
                                                                                                         PAGE

looked as though he was                  still    alive.        I pulled him free and              checked

for a pulse.          1 then gave rnouth to m o u t h                resuscitation.

             I turned him onto              his       side and asked        people    to assist me             to

carry him out,.            I did not get an             immediate       response and. whilst

wai t ing f or someone            to h e 1p me the y outh            lapsed     into unconsc i a usness

an d stopped       breathing.          There was        nowhere      to put- him down so,           w ith the

help of two men,            I carried him out to a break                    in the    fence.        I.

returned     to    the     bodies      to find one         lying     on his side.        He was      not

breath i n g a n d I t u r n e d h im o n t o h i s b a e.k

                                   I                                a t t e m p t e d to get a clear

airway.      I then gave m outh to m ou th                  r e s u s c i t a t i o n and heart massage.

                                                                         I turned     him over       onto

his front and together with                     two    fans,    I   carried him to the front.                  As

I did a fan who was               blind drunk          grab b e d hold of me,        causing me          to

lose my balance.             He    then began          pushing me and s w e a r i n g at me,

shouting     various        obscenities.              I tried to       ignore   him and. c o n tinued to

the   fence w i t h the          injured y o u t h .      Once at       the fence     I carried him

through the        fence and onto           the       pitch,    where    I again     cleared his

airway.      He    never     regained       c o n s ciousness        and after     five m i n u t e s     of no

response,      no heart          beat,    no pulse,       he was       covered up.       A m a n who

stated he was a doctor,                  pulled me a w a y an d said,           "Give    it up."          He

a g re ed that     he was        dead.     1 left him          covered up w i t h my Po l i c e anorak

and then     returned        to the f e n c e , whi ch I had e n t e r e d           onto    the    pitch

fencing,    ma k i n g a large gap of about                    six feet,      enabling      us to

receive    bodies         from    inside    the terracing.              There   I s tood on the wall,

taking    hold of the            bodies    being      brought       to me by the fans a n d          passed

stood       on the wall            w ith me and. helped me                     to    carry the           bodies        over     the

wall.        The    flow of         bodies        began to slow down,                      a y o u t h who          looked

alive,       was    passed to me.                 I stayed wit h him going onto                               the    pitch,

where       1 ^ave m o u th to m ou t h               r e s u s c i t a t i o n and heart massage.                        Ihere

was    no    response whatso e v e r .                 An a m b u l a n c e m a n took          him away             towards an

a m b u l a n c e wit h    the a s s is ta nc e          of    two Liverpool                fans.         He was

o b viously        dead.        1 then         remained        on the          pitch a s s i s t i n g w i t h          the

removal       of bodies            from the L e p p i n g s             Lane    end to the Spiort Hop and

N o r t h S tand      corner.           Duri ng       this     period,          1' was a b u s e d and              pushed by

several       supporters,               even whe n       I was          helping        injured       people.            This

mo s t ly    took     place whilst              I was       on the        terraces.            1 do not             remember           of

any    p a rti cular       i nc i d e nt w It .ic h o c c u r r ed o n t h e p i t c h w h i 1 st                    1 w as

a s s istin g with         the      injured.

Whilst       on the       terracing            it was       clearly         obvious         that     a    l a rg e

proportion          of    the L i v e r p o o l       supporters           were       either       drunk        or    had     been

dr i nk i ng .      There       was      a heavy       sme 11       of    vorni t , b o t h at           the    to p of       the

terracing          and    in the         centre       where        the    people        had    di ed.          1 would        not

be a b l e    to    recognise            any    of    the     d ece as ed who           1 tried          to    help.         I can

only    remember          one      of    them     being       1*3/16 y e a r s        with     dark       hai r,       the

others       were    what       I would         describe           as    ’y o u t h s '.

On the       pitch there were                  several        incidents where L i v e r p o o l                     suppo r t e r s

tried to argue w i th Po l i c e O f f i c e r s about                              the a l l o c a t i o n of         tickets,

putting       them       in the smaller               end of the ground.

At    approximately             5 .00     p.m.       or w h e n     the     fans w e r e       let out          of the

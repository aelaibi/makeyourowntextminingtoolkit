Most     of     the      help      to    injured           fans      was        given          by our       ow n    supporters                  who

did a m a r v e l l o u s          job.           The    other        emergency                services        did what           they

                                                                                                                                     S3643

             could when               they arrived            but    by t h e n     it was      too    late*

             I also          feel     which       I think       is v i t a l       to    this   enquiry         is t h a t   the

             organisation               between         the    police        inside       and   outside         the    ground       left

             a    lot       to   be    desired       in th a t       there        appeared      to    be   no    communication

             whatsoever               between      them.

             There          should also           be m o r e    gates        to    give      easy access         out    of   the     pens.

            9.00 am on duty at Ecclesfi                       on, High Street,

            Ecclesfield.        Transported down     i1 Isborough Football Ground for

            semi final duties.

            Once at the ground I attended the briefing given by Chief

            Superintendent Duckenfield,       after which I commenced patrol       in a

            transit of the Stocksbridge area.        My sergeant on that transit was PS

            1347 Hunt and our sector commander was Inspector Walker who

            accompanied us throughout that patrol.        Our patrol was mainly

            confined to the Stocksbridge area which was our allotted duty but as

            our sector commander was with us we occasionally visited the Deepear

            and Oughtibridge areas.        There were only a small number of local

            public houses       in these three areas that were serving drinks to

            Liverpool    fans and although due to the fact I was the driver of the

            transit    I did not check any of the public h o u s e s , as did my

            supervisors,    the fans did not appear to be causing problems.

            At S . 45 pm that date we were parked stationary in the Oughtibridge

            area monitoring the flow of traffic to Sheffield.          At this time I

            noted that there were still a number of vehicles containing Livverpopl

            fans travelling towards Sheffield.        With reference to any radio

    traffic from ground control, whilst             in the Deepcar and Stocksbridge

    area,® we were unable to received any transmissions,              but in the

    Oughtibridge area w© were able to receive but not transmit.                     And it

    was about t h i ^ t i m e   that we heard over the radio numerous requests

{   for a g a t r i o   be opened.     As we were going to take 4 meal at 3 pm our

    Inspector instructed us to go into the ground.               Due to the radio

    traffic seemed to indicate some sort of problem at the Lappings- Lane

    end of the ground           we went to   that end to see if we were needed to

    assist or whether*          we were to meal as briefed.'

    The journey to the ground from Oughtibridge must have taken about ten

    to fifteen minutes maximum.              On arrival   there were a number of police

    officers and fans outside the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end,

    and I                                                     bridge at that location,

     'e was stood on the wall of the bridge and seemed to be trying to get

    ^ view of the exterior ofthe ground.              Upon arrival   our       Inspector

    alighted from the           vehicle to   ascertain as to whether we would be

    needed and seconds          later came back and instructed us to get out of

    the vans and gather outside the exterior pen.                As the driver of the

    vehicle I was the last to leave the vehicle havin to lock the doors,

    and just as I got out I heard over Channel H XS, the Operation

    Support    call for the ground.           I immediately reported this to my

    Sergeant and Inspector.

    A couple more minutes          passed during which a Liverpool         fan with a

    ticket demanded access to the ground but was turned away by a mounted

    officer.     At this point there were a number of fans milling about

    near the ground.        Seconds after this we were directed by Supt*

    Marshall to go t nli^r^he.^iFfeund.          Although I did not have a radio I

    was stood with jjgyj+unt all the time and did not hear any call over

    the radio stating what had occurred in the ground and due to this both

    myself and the members of my                    thought that there was a serious              <

               public order problem in the ground.                  As we approached the exit gate

               from the Leppings Lane end,               I saw an ambulance,    laid at the side of

               this ambulance, were two bodies, who were being attended to by police

               officers and ambulance officers.                  We then entered throiigb the gate.

               It was*then we approached the entrance to the tunnel                  leading to the

               terrace.*             At this entrance there were numerous bodies laid on the

               floor, a number of police officers were there and numerous Liverpool

               fans, most of which were stood qyietly,                  but a small number were

               hurling abuse at the police and some were stating a wish to go back

<:<***   irf   onto the terraces but were being prevented from doing so by police
?    ^
               officers.              At this point we were still not aware of what had happened

               and we went down the tunnel.                 I went to the left of the divind

               railings and met a colleague from FS,                  I told him there were bodies

                    tside the tunnel             to which he said there were bodies down on the

               terrace.              Upon hearing this I went down t he/terrace and managed to

               get onto the perimeter track.                   At this point I realised there had

               been some sort of disaster but I thought                  it must have been over,

               however,          I looked to my right to where an ambulance was parked and

               saw officers pulling bodies out of the terrace through the gate.                                     Upon

               seeing this             I went to assist and with other officers pulled out 3 to

                    bodies.           I checked the bodies for signs of life but it was obvious

               they were dead.              Sometime    later I turned to look onto the pitch in

               front of the goal and saw body after body laid out near to and around

               the touc h ! i n e .        Officers and fans then started carrying bodies off

               the pitch and along with a S e r g e a n t , whom I do not know and about two

               fans     I assisted to carry a body off the pitch and around to the gym.

               The      fans were trying to run,          I d o n ’t think they realised that the

               parson we were             carrying was dead.      At the entrance to the Gym it was

                   haos,   fans were trying to get into the gym, most were hysterical.

               Off i cers assisted in getting the body through the door to the gym and
                                                                         "PAGE ■■■

I then returned to the terrace.        I managed to locate my sergeant.          It

was still chaos,      fans were jeering at us blaming us for what had

happened.       There were no directions over the radio so we stood

there.   Then a senior officer,      I do not know fchat rank ordered myself

and a number of other officers tq: enter the terrace and make sure

that clothing which was strew about was not moved.           At this we were

then abused more by the fans,       then an Inspector cam© to us seconds

later and ordered us out of the terrace.         I d o n ’t know how long we

stood there on that pitch but eventually the fans lef,t the ground and

we then resumed to our transit and commenced patrol, attempting to

attend reports of fights but due to the heavy traffic we always

arrived after the event.

The only incident of note was when we had to arrest a Notts Forest

fan who was walking down the central        reservation of Penistone Road

near Bradfield Road,      jeering at Liverpool fans in their cars,       if we

hadn't God knows what would have happened to him.

We retired from duty at 8.30 pm that date.

Of the fans      I came atross   in the ground and on the pitch it was

obvious that a number had be@n ,drinking,       but jE couldn't tell whether

they were drunk,      they just seemed to be in a lot of cases displaying

out and out hatred of the police.        One fan came up to me on the pitch

and asked me if 1 was alright,       he was the only calm and sensible

Liverpool fan I met all day.

This   report    is as accurate as I can make   it, as even though I made

small notes as instructed two days after,        the whole   incident was then

and still   is blurred in my mind,     the only clear thing being the

bodies, «|nd due to the nature of the incident I d i d n ’t pay much

attention to anything else,-both myself and other officers were too

busy dealing with the bodies I suppose.

            INCIDENT AT HILISBOHBUGH FOOTBALL GROUND


9.00am - On duty at Ecclesfield Police Station, High Street, Ecclesfield*
         Transported down to Hillsborough football ground for serai final duties.
Once at the ground I attended the briefing given by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, after
which I commenced patrol in a transit o^r the Stocksbridge area. My sergeant an that transit
was PS 13^7 Hunt and our sector commander was Inspector Walker who accompanied us throughout
that patrol* Our patrol was mainly confined to the Stocksbridge area which was our allotted
duty but as our sector commander was with us we occasionally visited the Deepcar and
Oughtibridge areas. There were only a small number of local public houses in these three areas
that were serving drinks to Liverpool fans and although due to the fact I was the driver of
the transit I did not check any of the public houses, as did my supervisors, the fans did
not appear to be causing any problems.
At 2.*4-5pm that date we were parked stationary in the oughtibridge area monitoring the flow
of traffic to Sheffield, At this time I noted that there were still a number of vehicles
containing Liverpool fans travelling towards Sheffield. With reference to any radio traffic
from ground control, whilst in the Deepcar and Stocksbridge areas we were unable to receive
any transmissions, but in the Oughtibridge area we were able to receive but not transmit.
And it was about this time that we heard over the radio numerous requests for a gate to be
opened. As we were going to take a meal at 3pra our Inspector instructed us to go into the
ground. Due to the radio traffic seemed to indicate some sought of problem at the Leppings
Lane end of the ground we went to that end to see if we were needed to assist or whether
we were to meal as briefed.
The journey to the ground from Oughtibridge must have taken about ten to fifteen minutes
maximaia• On arrival there were a number of police officers and fans outside the turnstiles
at the leppings Lane end, and I could see Supt Marshall should on the bridge at that location,
he was stood on the wall of the bridge and seemed to be trying to get a view of the exterior
of the ground. Upon arrival our Inspector alighted from the vehicle to ascertain as to whether
we would be needed and sceonds later came back and instructed us to get out of the vans and
gather outside the exterior pen. As the driver of the vehicle I was the last to leave the
vehicle having to lock the doors, and $ust as I got out I heard over Channel 2 XS, the
Operation Support call for the ground. I immediately reporyed this to my sergeant and Inspecto
A couple more minutes past during which a Liverpool fan with a ticket demanded access to the
ground but was turned away by a mounted officer. At this point there were a number of fans
milling about near the ground. Seconds after this s e e k we were directed by Supt Marshall to
go into the ground. Although I did not have a radio I was stood with PS Hunt all the time
and did not hear any call over the radio staing what had occured in the ground and due to
this both myself and axtk the members of my serial thought that there was a serious public
order problem in the ground. As we approached the exit gate from the Leppings Lane end, I
saw an ambulance, laid at the side of this ambulance were two bodies, who were being attended
to by police officers and ambulance officers. We thek enfeteed through the gate. It was then
we approached the entrance to the tunnel leading to the teratace. At this entrance there
were numerous bodies laid on the floor, a number of police officers were there and numerous
Liverpool fans, most of which WBBe stood quietly, but a small number were hurling abuse
at tike police and some were stating a wish to go back onto the terraces but were being preven­
ted from doing so by police offciers. At this point we were still not Btware of what had
happened and we went down the tunnel. I went to the left of the dividing railings and met
a colleague from F2, I told himthere were bodies outside the tunnel to which he said there
were bodies down an the terrace. Upon hearing this I went down the terrace and managed to
get onto the perimeter track* At this point I realised there had been some so»t of disaster
but I thought it must have been over, however I looked to my right to where and ambulance
was parked and saw officers pulling bodies out of the terrace through the gate. Upon seeing
      I went to assist and with other officers pulled out 3 to k bodies. I checked the
bodies for signs of life but it was obvious they were dead. Sometime later I turned to
look onto the pitch in front of the goal and saw body after body laid out near to and around
the touchline. Officers and fans then started to carrying the bodies off the pitch and along
with a sergeant, whom I do not knoWjjiand abput two fans i assisted to carry a body off the
pitch and round to the gym. The fahs were trying to run, I don't think they realised that
the person we were carrying was dead. At the entrance to the Gym it was Chaos fans were
tr^i^g to vget i*-tu ciie gym, aost were Moterical, Officers assisted in getting the body
through %he door to the gym and I then returned to the terrace, I managed to locate my
sergeant. It was still bhaos, fans were jeering at us blaming us for what had happened.
There were no directions over the radio so we stood there. Then a senior officer, I do not
know what rank ordered myself and a number of other offciers to enter the terrace and
make sure that clothing whch was strewn about was not moved. At this we were then abused
more by the fans, then an Inspector came to us seconds later and ordered us out of the
terrace, I don't know how long we stood there an that pitch but eventually the fans left
the ground and we then resumed to crnr transit and commnced patrol, attempting to attend
reports of fights but due to the heavy traffic we allways arrived after the event.
The only incident of note was wheh we had to arrest a Notts Forest fan who was walking down th»
central resevation of Penastone road near Bradfield road, jeering at Liverpool fans in their
cars, if we hadn't god knows what would have happened to him.
We retired from duty at 8,30pm that date.
Of the fans I came across in the ground and on the pitch it was obvious that a number had been
drinking, but I could n't tell whether they were drunk, they just seemed to be in a lot of
cases displaying out and out hatred of the police. One fan came up to me on the pitch and
asked me if I was allright, he was the only calm and sensible Liverpool fan I met all day.
This report is as accurate as I can make it,as even though I made snail notes as instructed
two days after, the whole incident was then and still is blurred in my mind, the only
clear thing being the bodies, and due to the hature of the incident I didn't pay much att­
ention to anything else, both myself and other officers were too busy dealing with the

           Further to my previous statement,           I have identified the body of my

           son, Henry Charles ROGERS,           17 years, born in Hertford on 14.2.72

           (14021972).          He was a schoolboy attending Queens Park High School,

           Chester.          He was a single man.    His mother's name

                                                a part time Mobile Warden.      His General

           Practitioner was Dr McBRIDE, Lache Health Centre, Hawthon Rd, Chester

                   3     My son was a fit and healthy youth.          He was 6*01 tall and

           slim, brown hair medium length, brown eyes.               On Saturday 13.4.89

           <•150489) he left the house at 0830 to travel to Hillsborough.                He was

           wearing at that time shoes, but I cannot describe them at present,

           white socks, green underpants, blue jeans, a pale green coloured tee

           shirt, a zip neck pale green sweatshirt with a nautical design on the

           front, and a dark blue reversable Mickey Mouse motif padded
                                                                                 PAGE


         sweatshirt, the inside was white with small Mickey Mouse patterns on.

         I can't remember if he had a hat or scarf but he had his glasses with

         him, a thin black framed pair.         I have received back all the items

         with the exception of the two top garments mentioned <sweatshirts>

         and his glasses + shoes.

         His companions were his brother                                   living

         with me.                      [ address + age not known at present, and

                        age and address not known at present.       They had arrange!

         to travel to the match via British Rail from Chester to Sheffield and

         travelled to Chester Railway Station in                         s car

         I think I would be able to recognise the various items of clothing,

         footwear and glasses if they are found.

         After the incident a few days, 2 gentlemen came to our house having

         recognised our son's photograph from a newspaper and said that one of

         them was with Henry when he died.         I have their names and addresses

         at home.

 knowledge of the ground.    No special inspection was made; no

 consultation with Sheffield Wednesday or the local authority

 took place.



          statement to                n his statement

        said that he would have expressed an opinion at the

 match if there was reason to believe that there was danger

 and he had had further reason to believe that the Club or

 the Police were not dealing with it adequately.        This would

appear to imply %o KlrteofPfelt that his own opinion as a

representative of the FA would carry some weight in

circumstances such as occurred at the match.



Areas of conflict between     ■ ; /    ■   . statement and < . - .

           statements.   In his submissions                  states

that he had no conversation with                about numbers

either inside or outside the ground.       Specifically he says

"I can recall a conversation I had Sir                      which

is in my statement round about 2.50 mark Sir but I do not

recall the conversation to which              , refers.       ' i

on the other hand in his submission states that at around

2.40 on the day                ad told him that there were

still some 20,000 people to come into the ground and when he

pointed to the KOP and said the KOP looks pretty full to me

he asserts that MS?* MsofeveeMI replied that you would be

surprised with the packing of the terrace there are still a

lot of people to come on there.    Furthermore in his
 submissions to                             asserted that he had
 said to                  "in view of the fact that there are a

 large number of people outside are the Police going to ask

 for a delay in the kick-off” and his response was 11no they

are not".                    denied categorically in his

submissions to the enquiry that this conversation ever took

place.     ' -    ■■   witness statement to the Hillsborough

enquiry corresponds closely to his answers to

questions.       In it he asserts that               had told him

that there were 20,000 still outside.         That he had asked M x f

           _ whether on this occasion the Police wanted a delay.

That              had replied that they did not because putting

back the kick-off produced all sorts of organisational

problems at the end of the game.         He does however qualify

this description by saying that                    had not been

informed at that time of any danger to spectators.



The points at issue are therefore:



1.     Whether there was a conversation between

         fat 2.40 p.m.



2.     Whether that conversation concerned the numbers of

people outside the ground.



3.     Whether              ad been consulted by the Police about

delaying the kick-off.

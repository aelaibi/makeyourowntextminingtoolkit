I was very concerned also to read the articles that appeared recently in
the Guardian and I know that Mervyn Jones has the matter in hand.

It was interesting that only one newspaper ran the story and it was not
developed otherwise in the aedia after the first appearance.

Lord Justice Taylor’s Enquiry will be aware of the situation when
the Inquiry opens on 15 May 1989.

With all best regards.

                    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

My Staff Officer Superintendent Hewitt has drawn to the
attention of ACC Mervyn Jones the articles that appeared in
today's Guardian newspaper which quote at some length from
the ACPO Guide to Policing Football.

I am most concerned that this document should now finds its
way into the hands of the press, containing as it does such
sensitive information about intelligence      gathering  and
resource   deployment.    This   disclosure  has   not  been
authorised by me as Chairman or any member of the ACPO
Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events, to the best
of my knowledge.

Moreover,  its   style  and  context   seem  to   me to be
deliberately calculated to prejudice the work of your
Inquiry team as well as that of Lord Justice Taylor.

The document was circulated to all Chief Constables in
England and Wales, and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan
Police, on the 21st October, 1987 as an update to the
Football Section of the 1982 General Guidance on Public
Order for Senior Police Officers.     Copies have also been
given to each Force's Football Liaison Officer who attended
the annual meeting of 1st and 2nd Division representatives
at the end of the last football season.




                                                             Continued/2
For your information I enclose copies of the Guardian
newspaper, the ACPO Guide to Policing Football and the
letter signed by the Secretary of the ACPO Sub-Committee
which accompanied its circulation.  I should be obliged if
you would bring this matter to the attention of His Honour
Lord Justice Taylor.

      Dear S i r ,

                 I write in my capacity as Secretary to the ACPO Sub-Committee
      on Hooliganism a t Sporting Events.

                  Some time ago t h i s Sub-Committee was tasked with updating the
  Section on policing football contained in the 1982 General Guidance for
  Senior Police O fficers on Public Order. I t was o r i g in a l ly intended t h a t
  the Section would be included in the 'mini-manual' .                However t h i s has
  proved not to be possible a t t h i s time. At a recent meeting of the
  Hooliganism Sub-Committee i t was decided t o issue the document on a stand
  alone basis fo r th e information of those o f f ic e r s with a r e s p o n s i b i li t y
  f o r p o licin g f o o t b a l l . In addition the Sub-Committee has conmrissioned a
  s e r ie s of f iv e videos to complement the document.

                   I enclose a copy of the f i r s t of these videos which deals with
  the use of CCTV t o g e th e r with a copy of 'P olicing F o o t b a l l '. These items
  are supplied f r e e of charge but f u r t h e r copies of th e document are
  a v a ila b le a t a cost of £1 each. Should you require any additional copies,
  please contact Inspector Harrison (061-855-2028) who will make the
  necessary arrangements. I will of course c i r c u l a t e information regarding
  the additional videos as and when they are av a ila b le .




                                     Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,




                            „ A s sista n t Chief Constable

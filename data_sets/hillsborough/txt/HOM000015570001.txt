 Dear Mr. Whalley,
     I have pleasure in enclosing herewith an invitation to Lord
 Justice Taylor and Guest to attend the 1989 F. A. Cup Final Tie.
     I shall be grateful if you will forward this invitation to Lord
 Justice Taylor and let us know, initially by telephone, and then
 confirm by writing if he is able to accept the invitation.
      I appreciate that if Lord Justice Taylor attends it may be his

 helpful therefore if we could have an early response to this
 invitation.

             With kind regards.

    Following my statement in the House on 17 April about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, you raised a question about the
effectiveness of the emergency telephone number (col. 37), and
I promised to look into the point.

    May I first say how much I sympathise with those who rang the
emergency telephone number but were unable to get through. I can
well understand the distress that this must have caused and the
anxiety of being unable to find out whether a friend or relative
was affected.

    Setting up and running a casualty bureau is the operational
responsibility of the Chief Constable concerned. Following the
Zeebrugge tragedy - when the entire Maidstone exchange was
jammed by the volume of incoming calls - the Association of
Police Officers (ACPO) has been addressing the technical problems
involved in ensuring that the flood of calls generated by a major
disaster can be handled effectively.

    ACPO have been working closely with British Telecom and the
Home Office to find a solution. In January a major Home Office
funded exercise (COMTEST 89) was held to test the ability of the
Telephone Marketing Services (TMS) exchange at Bristol to handle
5,000 calls over a four hour period. The exercise needed to test
both the ability of the exchange to receive the calls, and the
effectiveness of using TMS operators as intermediaries between
the public and the police casualty bureau.

    ACPO is now analysing the results of the exercise and I
understand a report is expected shortly. But at the same time
new advanced technological developments are being explored
between ACPO, BT and the Home Office which could allow calls to
be answered in a variety of locations.

of the response to emergencies carried out by the Home Office in

hope to be in a position to announce the conclusions of that
review shortly, but I can assure you that we are as concerned as
the public and the police to see the most effective response
possible to casualty enquiries following a major disaster.

HILLSBOROUGH STATEMENT - EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBERS


During Monday's statement, Mr George Howarth MP (at column 37,
attached) raised a query about the use of the emergency telephone
numbers given for public enquiries, saying that the system had
not worked satisfactorily and referring to an exercise recently
held in Bristol.

2.     All police forces have arrangements to set up a casualty
bureau to deal with public enquiries following major civil
emergencies. How the casualty bureau is organised is essentially
an operational decision for individual Chief Constables. But no
matter how well organised the sheer volume of incoming calls may
swamp the local exchange irrespective of the number of lines
available in the casualty bureau. The pressure relates not to
the actual number of casualties, but to the number of people who
might have been involved and whose relatives may make inquiries.

3.     The Association of Chief Police Officers have been
studying the problems closely with British Telecom and Networks
Branch of the Home Office to meet both the technical and
operational requirements imposed by these major incidents. ACPO
organised COMTEST 89 in January (funded by the Home Office) to
test a major facility at Bristol which is normally used for share
flotations and other commercial events generating large numbers
of calls requiring a relatively simple response. A report on the
exercise will be available shortly for ACPO to consider.
4.     In the course of the review of civil emergencies the
problems associated with casualty bureaux were well ventilated
and this is one area we would want the new Civil Emergencies
Adviser to pursue urgently. But ACPO are already exploring with
BT and Networks Branch more advanced systems which have just
become available, including the use of an 0800 number through a
'Linkline' facility, allowing calls to be answered at a variety
of locations.


5.      A draft reply to Mr Howarth is attached, setting out the
position fairly fully.

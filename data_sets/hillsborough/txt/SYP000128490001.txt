             I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, presently

             stationed at Maltley.

             On this date I was designated to work as a uniform serial. My serial

             commander was Police Inspector CHARLES and my serial Sergeant was

             Police Sergeant CARTER. My working partner was Police Constable

             and we performed our duties together prior to the game. Those duties,

             in brief, were to do foot patrol along Herries Rd with other Officers

             While performing those duties there was only two incidents of note.

             The first being a skirmish between Liverpool and Notts. Forest fans o

             Herries Rd. Due to two mounted Officers and foot patrol Officers beig

             present, this problem was quickly dealt with and no-one was arrested.

             The second incident was a convoy of coaches which stopped and allowed

             the majority of their passengers to alight from the vehicles onto

             Herries Rd. Although a total de-busing of all the coaches was
                                                                  PAGE 2


prevented by myself and other Officers. The majority of fans did get

off the buses into Herries Rd. I would estimate there were between 13

15 coaches. From what I saw of these fans getting off the coaches the

large majority were the worst for drink. I gained the impression that

all of the coaches had been carrying Notts. Forest fans. At 2.50pm

(1450) our serial formed up and started to go towards Claywheels Ln

for lunch. Just as our serial had entered Claywheels Ln we heard via

our commanders radio that there were crowd problems at the Leppings

Ln end. Inspector CHARLES contacted ground control and informed them

he had a number of serials at his disposal. He was instructed to take

the serials to Leppingc Ln and wait for further instructions.

At 3.07pm (1507) the order was given to enter the ground, but prior t)

this being given I heard ground control state all serials had been

committed at this point Inspector CHARLES informed them his serials

were still not committed.   It was at this point the command to enter

was given.

On entering the ground and looking towards the tunnel leading into

Leppings Ln I could see fans coming out of the ground, some carrying

people. My immediate impression was that there had been some kind of

accident, like someone falling down and breaking their legs. The more

and more people began to be brought out and placed in the area

immediately outside the rear of the tunnel, I, along with other

Officers then began to examine these people, some were obviously dead

From this point it became one constant stream of dead and injured
                                                             r
people being brought out of the tunnel. At this point I was joined by

DC HILL, Cl CID and DC DAVIS Cl CID, they too were helping the

casualties. At this point we were joined by Dr         and he asked us

to help him move the injured and dead actually onto the land outside

the area leading to the tunnel. This we did, placing people who were

obviously dead on one side and the injured on another.
                                                                          PAGE 3


        Dr _______during this time was categorising the injured and telling

        us who required treatment most urgently. As there being identified we

        were placing them in the first available ambulances. This was hard,

        as people trying to help were placing dead bodies in Ambulances rathe

        than living people.    I requested to Police Inspector MILLETT to have a

        many Police transits brought round as soon as possible, but he could

        not get through on his radio. He must have got a message through to

        ground control somehow, as shortly after this Police transits did

        arrive and assisted in the removal of the casualties.    I remained at

        these duties with the sick and dead for the rest of that duty. When

        all the living sick had been removed I assisted to remove the dead

        from the Ln. I would estimate at anyone time during that day there

        also about 20 dead laid in the Ln. After the incident Dr          came to

        speak to me and DC DAVIS, he stated at the time his intention to

        publically speak out against the Police stating they had no

        contingency plans for such a disaster.

        Throughout the whole of this incident Liverpool fans were shouting,

        swearing and being very aggressive towards the Police.

        Some were spitting on Police Officers who were giving first aid to tfe

        injured. One in particular was a young boy who I and an unknwon Polie

        Woman was trying to revive. I was disgusted with the majority

        of the fans, most of which were the worst for drink.

        After we had finished at the Leppings Ln end, in company with WPC

                   C3 Maltley we made our way back towards Claywheels Ln. En

        route we passed a pub which had been used by the Liverpool supporters

        This pub was festooned with empty beer cans, bottles and pint pots ot

        the premises on tables, walls and the ground.

             I am a qualified doctor with qualifications of MBCHB which is a

             Batchelor of Medicine and Batchelor of Surgery,                  I am at present

             working at the Weston Park Hospital.

             On Saturday 15th April      1989 (150489),       I met D    r     D    r           and
X
             Dr              at Hanarans bar at about       1.40pm (1340).         We then made our

             way to Sheffield Wednesdays football ground.               We arrived at the ground

             at about 2.40pm (1440) and entered the ground.               There was no queues

             outside the Spion Kop end and we all went            into the Spion Kop end.

             When we were standing      in the Spion Kop I could see to the opposite

             side of the ground where the Liverpool            supporters were in the West

             Stand.    At about 2.50pm    (1450)   I noticed a surge forward from the

             Liverpool, supporters in the centre of the West Stand terracing.                   The

             end pens on both sides of the centre pen was quite empty.                    In the side

             pens you could see complete bodies standing up,                 but in the centre pens
                                                                         PAGE


all you could see was a mass of heads.         After the kick off and just

before the game was stopped,       Nottingham Forrest were attacking down

the right and the whole of the Liver pool supporters       in the centre of

the stand seemed to surge forward.         The next thing was a Liverpool

supporter    running onto the pitch and a Police Officer then went to the

referee and he took the players off the pitch.         About   10 minutes after

the game had been stopped,       we saw a supporter being stretchered off

the pitch and taken between the North Stand and the Spion Hop.            When

we saw this we realised that       it was not a pitch invasion and that

people were    injured and it was more serious than we thought.         Myself

and the doctors            and           then made our way from the Spion

Hop terracing and we went to a Police Officer and told him we were

doctors and could we give any assistance to the injured.          We were then

taken by Police Officers out of the rear of the Spion Kop and escorted

around to the gymnasium area.         When we got to the open area near to

the gym we saw eight or nine people lying outside the gym.          All of

these people at this time were injured.         We then found out and

attended to these injured people.         There was two persons who I saw

injured and from their     injuries    I could see they needed immediate

hospital    treatment.   I then went and tried to find an ambulance to

ferry them to hospital.      I found a man who I believe was a senior

ambulance man and I informed him of the seriously injured and he said

he would get them away to hospital next.         I then returned to assist

other   injured persons.    More and more bodies were being brought       into

this area.     Some of them were already dead and we attempted to revive

them,   but they had been dead for quite a period of time and we could

not do anything more for them.         We eventually moved into the gym and I

was asked if I would confirm who was dead by a senior Police Officer.

I confirmed this to him,     but I never certified any deaths.       I then

assisted the injured, who had been taken into the gym.          When the Fire
                                                                                  PAGE


            Service attended we then obtained some basic equipment which we used

            to render mouth to mouth.       Local   doctors then started to arrive and at

            about 4.45pm    (1645) we decided that we could leave,     so we left the

            ground and made our way back to the car.

Thank you for your letter of 18 November about the problems
Southampton Football Club are facing in meeting the
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor. As you appreciate the
matters you raise are the responsibility of Treasury Ministers,
but I understand the position to be as outlined below.

You are concerned that the sale of certain assets do not enjoy
"rollover relief" for capital gains purposes. Where business
assets are sold and the proceeds reinvested in replacement
assets, gains arising on the sale can be deferred ("rolled over")
until the replacement assets are sold and no further reinvestment
takes place. This enables businesses to re-equip themselves
without incurring immediate capital gains charges. Rollover
relief ie available only on major assets used in a trade such as
land, buildings and goodwill. It does not cover, for example,
moveable plant and machinery, which would be difficult to keep
track of, nor assets which in practice would not give rise to any
chargeable gains.

Land and buildings only qualify to the extent that they are both
occupied and used for the purposes of a trade. Although it is
not entirely clear from your letter, it may be that it is this
restriction which prevents some of the Club's land and houses
from qualifying for relief. But the restriction is in line with
the broad approach of the legislation, which is to give relief to
assets which are of central importance to the vitality of the
business and not, for example, assets held as investments.
You would also like to see the cost of land and buildings to
replace existing football stadia wholly allowable against trading
profits for tax purposes. Relief is not, however, generally
available for capital expenditure on land and commercial
buildings and structures such as football stadia. This is
because land is regarded as an enduring asset, which does not
normally depreciate in value, and most commercial buildings and
structures, including football stadia, do not depreciate in the
short or medium term. It would be difficult to limit relief for
land and such buildings to football. Furthermore, the cost of a
general allowance for land and commercial buildings would be very
large.

However, as you are no doubt aware, to help football implement
the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor, the Government have
reduced the pool betting duty from 42.5 per cent to 40 per cent
for an initial period of 5 years. The pools promoters have
agreed that amounts equal to the reduction will be paid to the
trustees of the Football Trust 1990, who in turn have resolved to
spend the money on capital works to improve the safety and
comfort of spectators at football grounds in accordance with Lord
Justice Taylor's recommendations. The reduction will be worth
about £100 million over the initial period, and the Government
have also legislated to ensure that football gets the whole
benefit on the reduction.

The Government believes that this cash injection of £100 million
over 5 years is a better way of helping football clubs carry out
the improvement recommended by Lord Justice Taylor than by giving
more generous tax relief for expenditure on football grounds,
which would only benefit those clubs which actually pay tax.
Furthermore the then Chancellor made it clear that an early
decision would be taken on whether to extend the concession for a
further 5 years provided there is firm evidence that the football
authorities and clubs have plans in place for the Taylor
timetable on all seating to be achieved.

Thank    you    for   your      letter    of    18    November          abut       the   problems

                  Dear Minister,


                  You will be aware that   "The Taylor Report" recommendations
                  impose on as sociation Foo tb al l clubs the ob ligation to make
                  stadiums all seater within a given period.

                  At South am pt on we have a particular problem arising from the
                  shape and size of the site, the problem can be best dealt
                  with by the acquiring of a suitable al te rnative site and the
                  building of a new comm un it y stadium.

                  I would wis h to make representa ti on to you relating to the
                  financing of such a project and the taxation implications.

                  The profit on sale of the exist in g site can for corporation
                  t^x purposes be "rolled over" against the cost of a new
                  stadium and no t a x a t i o n ’a r i s e s . However the sale of other
                  assets i.e. land, houses etc., and for that matter revenue
                  assets such as players under contract do not enjoy "Roll
                  over relief" even though the proceeds realised be applied
                  against the new stadium costs.




                                                                                                                              cont/d,



     Directors: .F.G.L. Askham, FCA (Chairman), K. St. J. Wiseman (Vice Chairman)
                 John Corbett, E.T. Bates, I.L. Gordon, B.H.D. Hunt, M.R. Richards, FCA

It would be of material assis ta nc e to the clubs who are
planning Area Com mu ni ty stadiums, or re constructing
existing stadiums, if to finance the project taxation relief
could be allowed on the cost of the land and build in gs as if
these were wh olly allowable against Tr ading and Capital
Gains profits.   It would of course imply that any
subsequent disposal of the stadium in part or in whole
would be subject to taxation on the full proceeds.

I would be obliged if you w ould raise this with the Treasury
and trust it may have your support.

Your sincerely,

     Where business assets are sold and the proceeds reinvested

     in replacement- assets,             g ain s       arising on the sale can be

     deferred      /'Tolled o v e r ” ) until            the replacement aasste are

    sold and no further rei nv es tm en t tikes p l a c e . This enables

    businesses to reequip themselves wir.hcvt incurring lamed iate

    capital gains chargee.              Rollover relief is available only on

    ootn occuplnd and used for the purposes of a trade.                                      Although

    it   s-. not entirely clear from your letter,                                it may he that it

    is this restriction which prevents acme of the Club's land

    and hour.    - frc.T. qualifying for relief.                        But the restriction
o
      is in lane with m e            oroad approach of the legislation,- which

      is to give relief to assets whi ch are                . : central    importance

      to the vitality ox the business and not,                 £e>    example,    assets

     an enduring asset-, which does not normally depreciate in

     V a i u © , and mosc commercial buildings and structures,

     inducting tootba! i           stadia,   do not depreciate in the short

     to m ed iu m term.      It would be difficult to l i t r . i t    relief for

     land and such buildings to football.                Furthermore,      the cost

     of a general allowance            for land and commercial buildings

    would be very l a r g e .

    However,    *© you are no doubt aware,              to help football

     implement the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor,                       the

    Government have reduced the pool betting duty frora 42.5 per­

    cent to 40 per cent for an initial period of 5 y e a r s . The

    pools promoters have agreed that amounts e^ocU to the

    reduction w m       be paid to the trustees of the Football Trust

    19y0, who in turn have resolved to spend the money on

    capital worss to improve- the safety and comfort of

    spectators at football grounds in accordance with Lord

    Justice Taylor's r & o o m m e n d a t i o n s . The reduction will be

    worth about jtlOC rr.iilion over the initial period,                  and the

    Government have also legislated to                           -•:. ^ .. t r «    tootbaU      gets

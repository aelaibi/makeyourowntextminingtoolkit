           At 8.45 am cm Saturday, 15 April 1989 I paraded for football duty at

           Woodseats Police Station and joined a serial with Police Sergeant 752 Batty

           as supervising officer.         We were transported by police vehicle to

           Hillsborough and subsequently joined the mass briefing in the North Stand.



           My serial was given duties at the kop end of the ground with a very general

           brief to observe the Nottingham Forest supporters for potential trouble as

           the kop began to fill.         Our instructions were that as the numbers began to

           swell then we should take up positions on the north side of the kop where

           any Liverpool supporters who had gained access to the kop by either design

       or accident would be directed and protected fran the opposing fans.



       During the early part of the duty I was party to a conversation with a

           family of Nottingham Forest supporters who were questioning the actions of a

  a particular turnstile operator.        We were told they presented three

  tickets to the turnstile operator who tore off two stubs and returned the

  tvo used tickets.     The third ticket he retained complete saying that sane

  tickets were being scrutinised for potential forgeries.                I believe that it

 was said that the turnstile was number 77 but at about that time I was

  then directed to our second position on the kop and as far as I am aware

 the matter was not pursued.



 My serial was positioned alongside the railings at the north end of the

  kop and a constant stream of Liverpool supporters were admitted to this

 protected area.      I saw a small number of Nottingham Forest supporters who

 were attempting to 'bait' these Liverpool supporters removed from the

 ground by otter officers but generally the crowd was good natured and the

 only problem was of space.       From the relatively uncrowded area we were

 protecting it was possible to see that there was space at the very front

 of the kop and my main duty, placed at the entrance to the protected area,

 vras preventing Nottingham Forest supporters who were attempting to find a

 more open space in which to stand from entering the protected area.                   As

 the kick-off time approached this became more and more difficult as fans

 found that because of the lack of 'crowd packing' they could not reach the

 less crowded areas at the front of the kop.                 Eventually the access to the

 protected area became totally blocked and apart from the odd heated

 argument from Nottingham fans wanting access to the protected area and

 objections to the relative comfort of the Liverpool fans movement stopped

and the crowd waited for the kick-off.



Shortly after the kick-off we saw that a number of fans had spilled onto

the pitch at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and it was assumed by

everyone that it was merely a pitch invasion by Liverpool fans.                   I was not

in possession of a personal radio and was not irrmediately aware of the

gravity of the situation. The crowd remained relatively good natured.

Almost as soon as it became apparent that a serious disaster had occurred

I was approached by three Nottingham fans who stated that they were

doctors and that if they could be of any assistance they would like to

volunteer their services.        I informed Police Sergeant Batty of the doctors

offer and told him that I would escort them through the crowd to the first

aid area beneath the north stand.           This was agreed and together with

Police Constable Mogul and the doctors I went to the first aid area.                    When

we reached this area the enormity of the disaster was very apparent and so

each time I vas approached by someone with seme sort of medical training

which included doctors, nurses and first aid workers together with Police

Constable Mogul and Police Constable Thornton I escorted them through the

crowds to the first aid area.         The number of volunteers was large and this

duty covered a considerable period of tine.                   I never returned to my serial

on the kop.



By the tine this flew of volunteers had more or less stopped I felt it was

obvious that the game would not be restarted and I took up a position on

the steps leading from the kop to the ramp which gave access into

Fenistcne Road where I was joined by Police Constable Gillott.                  We then

spent the remainder of our duty advising the Nottingham fans to remain in

the ground until an official decision on the game had been made.                  Our main

objective was to keep the stairs clear and to dissuade the fans from

leaving the ground.      We remained in this position until after the

          abandonment of the game and the kop had more or less cleared.                 We then

          rejoined our serial on the virtually empty kop.



          When the kop was finally clear we returned as a serial to the north stand

          for debriefing and were stood down at approximately 6.30 pm.              I ended my

          tour of duty at E2 sub-division at 7.00 pm.

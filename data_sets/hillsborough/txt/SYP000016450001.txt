interest and found your mmmta of help.

to you for writing.

                         Please       find        inclosed a copy of a letter that I have
written to the Editor of the Daily News.                              I very much         doubt      if     it
will    get        published even in part!                 However since it makes a mention
of Police,         I inclose a copy for you.


                         The letter is pure fact as                      I     remember    the       various
incidents.          They are just a few of many.                        A lot of the trouble seems
to     me     to    be    the       way that people think that it is fine to remove
anything, or do what damage they wish,                             as        the   ’Insurance        People'
will make things good.                    So if the insurance people make things good,
then it is in order to do what damage they wish!                                   If they had to pay
or even pay part, then I think that things would be different.


                         I     am     in     no    way     trying to influence you with your
inquiry.           What I have tried to do with the letter to the Press                                   is to
point out that               whilst        most    people       are      good,      it    is   the        small
percentage that are otherwise.


                         I     wish        you all the very best with the inquiry,                         and
know that you will be fair.                       I might say exceptionally fair.

The Editor,. The Daily News.


Dear Sir,


                       I    have been reading about the disbelief over
the looting of the dead and injured. Obviously some one does
not know human nature!            To    99%       of    the    people        looting         is
taboo, alas the other 1%               regard it as a legitimate                  'sport'.
 Some     comes from the old childhood beliefs that                          'finding is
keeping'.      Many of us were brought to that                     one       handed         the
found     items to the Police.            Then after a time,             if they were
not claimed       one       got   them.       I    have       belonged       to    several
voluntary      organisations           over       the     last 50 years. Starting
with A.R.P.      and Home Guard after I was                   invaleded out of              the
Army     in    1941.       So I can remember the London Blitz,                     and how
steps had to be taken even then.


                       Later as a Member of Civil                Defence I attended
many accidents, and one of the first things that I                                learned,
and     now as a Member of the British Red Cross Society,                              still
teach,    is to look after your first aid                      equipment.         Many        is
the     time    I have had my first aid bag looted. The excuse is
always the same,            'You get it for nothing, we have to buy it,
any way I need it for the car!''                    It is no use trying to tell
these people that all too often ones equipment comes out                                      of
one's     own pocket and dealing with a small                     road accident can
 often set one back £5 to £10 in dressings.                        Again          if    items
 are    stolen,       then     they    are        not   available        for       the next
 incident that has to be dealt with.                    The     best     thing         is     to
 take    the    car        number,     and tell the driver that unless the
 items are returned at once, a report over the                           looting            will
 be     handed to the Police for action. Ofcourse one can expect
 to get sworn at, but then one never expects                           and     only         very




                                              1
very        rarely          gets      thanks.      More often blamed for looting,
because some one has                    had     their       pocket      picked       or     wallet
removed.


                              This     trouble        can delay the casualty getting
to Hospital, whilst things are held back                                until       the     Police
arrive           and        perhaps     search        the     various helpers.            No doubt
watched by the thief!
                              On one occasion,          I saw a young lad splattered
over the road,                I pulled my car onto              the     grass       verge,        and
went        to        see     what     if     anything I could do.              The lad was a
mess. Unconscious,                   both arms and legs              obviously       broken        by
their        unnatural              position.         There     is     little       one can do,
except see that the casualty                      can       breathe.        Certainly            they
must not be moved.                   I ran to     my car and drove it sideways on
across           the        road.    The     Police     and     the     Ambulance          people
arrived, and I handed over a went off.


                              A few days later,             I had the Police after               me.
Some one calling them selves an eye witness, described how I
had     been going very fast in the opposite direction to which
I had been travelling,                      seen the lad run out of his drive                      to
get     to        an        icecream        van. He ran straight out of his drive
onto a Pedestrian Crossing. Most of the story was                                     accurate.
I     had        not arrived until after the accident, and I doubt if
the woman witness has seen the incident,                               only heard about it
from other people.                   That was     embarrassing to             me,     and       also
wasted           a lot of Police time.                 I was lucky as at that time I
was well known to the Police for both my Red Cross and Civil
Defence Work.


                                 In another case, a           man     was    laying        at     the
bottom           of     some        steps     leading       down to a pedestrian under
pass.       From the distance I had seen two men                            going     down        the
steps.           When        I    got to them, one was on the ground, and the
other was just trying to see what he                                could    do.     His        first
words were             'I've just passed my St. John's First Aid Course,




                                                  2
and now I'm landed with this I am not sure what to d o . ”


                             I     replied          that     I     was a Red Cross Training
Officer,       but as he was first on the scene,                               he was     in charge,
and I would give him all                         the assistance he needed.                     Between
us,     we     did       what we could when some lads arrived.                             For some
reason they were all carrying long sticks. One asked                                            if     he
could         help,              and         I   replied,         "Yes,     telephone          for     an
a m b u l a n c e ” . They         went off, and gradually a crowd arrived. A
Bus Inspector                used        his       walkie-talkie          to      check,       by     the
Services were on their wa y by then.


                             The Police arrived,                 and one of the females in
the     crowd,       stared             to       shout     that     the boys with the long
sticks should be arrested as they had beaten up the                                            man     on
the     ground!          I        told       the     Police that the lads and been no
trouble and actually one of them had called the                                         Police        and
Ambulance.              But the woman kept on and on, until                             some of the
bystanders started to ask the Police when they were going to
arrest the lads.                   The Police,             Ambulance        men     and    the        two
first        aiders          just ignored things and got on with they job.
Finally the casualty was driver off, and the Police                                            started
to    ask questions.                   The first First Aider,               told them that the
man was walking very unsteadily down the steps when he                                               lost
his footing and fell.                     The casualty smelt like a brewery?


                         On a number of occasions,                        whilst attending to
casualties           from               Road        Traffic         Accidents,          items        have
'disappeared'            from the site.                   One accident is          was     a        lorry
with bottles of beer. Cars and buses were loaded up with the
bottles!           It    was           'Oh well, the Insurance Company will meet"
the loss'.           Tools and car equipment                        are     regarded       as        some
people        as     fair          gain!           Look     at     how    many cars have been
damaged in accidents of an evening or night,                                      and left       until
the     morning,             then        the       owner     has     come      back to find the
battery missing along with various other items including the
wheels?




                                                      3
                   So can you        tell           me          that    that    very        small
percentage    of     people     will           alter in alarger incident? I
doubt if it   is 1% of the people,                 but 1%          of 30,000         is     still
300!   0.1%   is 30 and they can still do                          a lot of looting and
cause a lot   of trouble!


                   Any way what benefit                         would    it    be     for     the
Police   to   make     up     such        stories that                  many    of        us have
experienced   over the years?

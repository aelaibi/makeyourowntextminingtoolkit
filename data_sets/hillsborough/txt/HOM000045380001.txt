TONY EDWARDS, AMBULANCEMAN


You asked for advice on the attached letter from Tony Edwards.

2.     He drove the ambulance that went on to the pitch at 1535, while PC Bruder was trying
to help Kevin Williams. He says that

        a)      this was well known to Inspector Layton and Inspector Sawers, the two West
                 Midlands officers who interviewed him, but that they did not include any
                 material about his ambulance in the evidence they gave to the Coroner at
                 Kevin’s inquest; and

        b)      the alleged non-existence of his ambulance was used to discredit Mr Bruder,
                 who had mentioned it in his statement.

3.      He suggests that he might come to see you.

4.     Mr Edwards now lives                        Whether we need to get him down from
there at public expense depends upon the extent to which we think that he may be able to cast
light on

        a)      the Kevin Williams case;
        b)      possible malpractice by the Coroner or West Midlands police; or
        c)      anything else (he says he wants to ‘discuss my role in greater detail’).

5.     I do not see a case for bringing him down to talk about Kevin Williams. He had no
dealings with him. The issue is that it is alleged that the Coroner had ruled that everybody
was dead by 1515, that Mr Bruder’s intervention with Kevin Williams at 1535 or so showed
that this ruling was wrong, and that the Coroner, or the police, or both had tried to discredit
what Mr Bruder was saying by casting doubt on his evidence about Mr Edwards’s
ambulance.

6.     It is clear that this allegation is wrong, because

       a)      the Coroner made no such ruling over 1515; and

       b)      there is other evidence in the Kevin Williams inquest about the time at which
                he was taken over the pitch to the place where Mr Bruder and others treated
                him which means that the Coroner and his jury would have recognised that
                Mr Bruder was doing so, under the impression that he was still alive, at 1530
                or so. The Coroner was not trying to discredit Mr Bruder, either as regards
                timings or more generally.

7.       I do not think that a meeting with Mr Edwards would shed light on any of this.       As
far as the police malpractice issue is concerned, it is clear that Inspector Sawers’ evidence to
the Coroner was based on the assumption that there was no 1535 ambulance. He was wrong.
But it is difficult to see what motive he or other officers could have had for deliberately
suppressing the evidence about Mr Edwards’s ambulance, given that they were not on a
mission to prove that everybody was dead by 1515 and that the timing of Bruder’s
intervention with Kevin Williams was not in dispute.

8.      I have spoken about this to Superintendent Foster, who supervised the West Midlands
investigation. His view is that it was up to the Coroner to decide what went in as evidence
at the Inquest and that we should be adressing ourselves to the Coroner, not Mr Edwards or
Inspectors Layton and Sawers. I am not sure that I go along with that. Whatever the
background, Mr Edwards is actually making an allegation of either incompetence or
deliberate suppression of evidence, or both, against two West Midlands officers.

9.      It seems to me that if we see anybody at all about what Edwards has said in his letter
it should be the two West Midlands officers. The key questions are probably to Mr Sawers
- does he agree that he saw Tony Edwards as described in his letter? Did he show him
videos of his ambulance? How could he then have talked at the Inquest as if there had been
no 1535 ambulance?

10.     I do not see any reason to see Mr Edwards to ‘discuss his role more generally’.

11.     I attach suggested letters to Mr Edwards and to the West Midlands police.

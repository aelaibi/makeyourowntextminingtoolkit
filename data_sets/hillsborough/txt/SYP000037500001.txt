The Lord Justice Taylor Enquiry,
c/o the West Midlands Police                          Tel:
Birmingham.

12th. August 1989
I write as a contributor to the original enquiry and my experience
is that of the designer and installer of spectator j^nitox^hg j^st^s^^^:
at several football grounds including Aberdeen, Glasgow Rangers,
Tottenham Hotspur and many others. The system at Villa Park is one
of our company's 1988 design and includes the feature of showing the
Flow per minute per zone , used to anticipate the time until all
spectators a r e s a f e l y i n the ground.                    _____

My comments on the preliminary report are as follows*

As The report in its final form should include some reference to
   the "End of game" time where an incident may take
   match causing an "Ibrox" like shift in the flow of the
   spectators.
B: The report should stress the need for full height turnstiles as
   now insisted upon in various parts of Scotland. The use of older
   low pattern turnstiles is still all too common in England and
   these turnstiles do not present a proper barrier to enable the
   safety limits to be adhered to.

                                                                          *




                      ^ continued......   *        vv" r ~ V " ^              ~J
Gs A clear formula for the numbering of seats should be introduced
   as a standard to enable clear signposting outside the ground. At
   the new St. Johnstone ground (Where we have actually done the
   seat numbering) careful planning has enabled entrances to be
   signed by seat number range. Even there the first attempts at
   the signs were not as logical as they could have been.

Hs The "All seater" factor should be better explained in terms of
   persons per square metre. It has been my experience (Including
   Aberdeen for 10 years) that the reduction in capacity due to
   all seater areas is the main factor in reducing incidents of
   crowd unrest. The difficulty in moving quickly through a seated
   area is to be balanced against the use of seats as missiles. The
   main reason for introducing seats seems to be to increase the
   admission prices to compensate for the lower numbers.

I: Whilst it is not simple to introduce unique entrances for "Pens”
   so that one can guarantee an even distribution of spectators in
   individual safety zones or partitions therein, it is possible to
   use Stewards/Police quite effectively to "Dress" the stadium and
   ensure that the first supporters fill the first Zones before any
   access is allowed to other zones. This technique would ensure that
   those wishing to get the best positions came early, however at
   Hillsborough the central tunnel would have required angled gates
   to divert late spectators to the wing areas.

Js Police in England should follow the procedures used north of the
   border where officers outside the ground actually assist in the
   control of the crowd into orderly queues. I have never seen this
   in England, but it is the norm in Scotland.

Since the Hillsborough tradgedy I have spoken twice to the football
league about providing "State of the Art" crowd counting systems at
half the current price. My argument has been that I do not wish to
make more money, but can produce more systems and supply then at less
than the authorities currently contribute in grants. No reply has
been received, in spite of the leagues awareness of the effectiveness
of the system installed at Villa Park. I have seen many V.I.P. guests
including more than one sports minister viewing control facilities at
leading and lesser football grounds, but at ten to three when the
action is at the turnstiles , they can always be seen in the
hospitality areas. Most club secretaries and directors also prefer to
be involved in the hospitality at this time.
Whilst I would like to spend more time compiling this letter (and
checking the spelling), I am currently installing Systems at Spurs,
St. Johnstone, Dunfermline and Wolverhampton Wanderers as well as
pre-season checks for all existing customers.

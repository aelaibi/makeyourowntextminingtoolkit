KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS



1.   Kevin Daniel Williams the son     of the Applicants James

      Stephen and Anne Williams was born on 27th May, 1973,

     and was 15 years old when he died at Hillsborough

     football ground on 15th April,    1989.



2.   He went to the stadium with friends but became

     separated from all but one, Andrew Duncan.     Together

     they took up positions in enclosure 4 at 1.30 p.m.,

     but some time before 2.4 5 p.m.   they moved into

     enclosure 3.



3.   During the course of Kevin's mini inquest on 2 n d -May, 1990,

     the following evidence was put before the jury through

     the witnesses Detective Sergeant John Killoch,

     Dr. David Slater, Detective Inspector Michael Layton,

     and Andrew Duncan:-    Andrew Duncan lost sight of Kevin

     Williams immediately after the first surge in

     enclosure 3.    At about 3.28 p.m., P.C. Michael Craighill

     went into enclosure 3 and carried Kevin onto the pitch

     where he attempted unsuccessfully to resuscitate him.

     Derek Bruder, an off duty Police Constable saw Kevin

     lying on the pitch near the Spion Kop, North stand of the

     ground.   He stated that Kevin was having convulsions.

     Mr. Bruder, on seeing Kevin went on to the pitch

     where he gave mouth to mouth resuscitation and an

     ambulanceman carried out cardiac massage.     They were

     later joined by an ambulance woman who took over from

     Mr. Bruder.    After a short time the St. Johns Ambulanceman
 Some time later special Constable Debra Martin assisted

 in carrying Kevin from the pitch to the temporary

 mortuary.      She claimed that when they reached the

 mortuary he stopped breathing.      She then gave him

 mouth to mouth resuscitation and did some heart massage,

 after which he opened his eyes,     said the word "mum" and

then died.      At 4.06 p.m. Dr. Curpen examined Kevin and

certified him dead.



Dr. David Slater,     stated in evidence that Kevin died of

traumatic asphyxia.      His case was one of the worst of

those he dealt with from the Hillsborough incident.         In

his opinion Kevin would have fallen unconscious within

3 to 5 seconds of being crushed.      He stated that persons

suffering from asphyxia can have fits.      He was not of

the view, however,     as SC Martin had suggested, that

Kevin could have spoken.      The autopsy showed that Kevin

had four fractures of his voice box and irreversible

brain damage, both of which he believed, would on their

own have prohibited communication.      Any sound that might

have emerged he put down to the expulsion of air from

Kevin's stomach but stated that this would not explain

the opening of Kevin's eyes.      He believed that because

of the seriousness of Kevin's case, he would have suffered

irrecoverable brain damage and brain death within 3 to 6

m inu t e s .
The mini inquest into Kevin was then adjourned until

a date to be fixed.



On 3rd May, 1990, an officer from the West Midlands

Police Force, visited the Applicants at their home.

The officer stated that Mr. Bruder had now changed his

statement as he realised he must have been mistaken.

Mr. Bruder was now saying that there was no vomit near

to Kevin that it could have been mucous.    Mr. Bruder

was also saying that Kevin wasn't convulsing when he

attended him, that it must have been body twitches.

The police officer told Kevin's parents that it would

be better if the family did not speak to Mr. Bruder.

He said that Special Constable Martin was still

sticking to her original statement but that she was

young and inexperienced and that she had undergone a

traumatic experience.    In the circumstances, he said

her statement would be discounted.    He then stated

that there would be another inquest into Kevin the

following day but that the Applicants need not attend,

as the purpose of the inquest was to prove to the jury

that Kevin could not have been alive.



On 4th May,   1990, the coroner returned to Kevin's mini

inquest and further evidence was put to the jury by

Sergeant John Killoch,   Inspector Matthew Robert Sawers,

Dr. David Slater and Doctor Ernest John Wallace Gumpert,
                                - 4 -



         which, when taken together produced the following account

         of events:   When Mr. bruder made his first statement he

         stated that he came across Kevin at the Spion Kop end

         having convulsions.    This happened after 3.32.      He also

         said he could feel a pulse.      He referred to Kevin vomiting

         and being sick.    Mr. Bruder gave mouth to mouth resuscitation

         and an ambulanceman carried out cardiac massage.           After 7

         minutes they swapped roles.      About 6 minutes later an

         ambulancewoman took over from Mr. Bruder.      Whilst

         Mr. Bruder was attempting to resuscitate Kevin he observed

         an ambulance entering the stadium.      He asked the St. Johns

         Ambulance colleague who was assisting him to stop the

         ambulance as he was considering utilising it.

         During resuscitation efforts he noticed Kevin's face

         going grey and withdrawn.



    9.   In his evidence Inspector Matthew Robert Sawers of the

         West Midlands Police confirmed that he had visited

         m r . Bruder the previous day.   He stated that Mr. Bruder

         on reflection thought that the word 'convulsions' was

         not applicable,   that twitching was a more appropriate

         term to describe Kevin's condition and that if he had
3

         seen any part of the body move,    it was the head.        He

         reported that Mr. Bruder said that he may well have been

         mistaken about feeling a pulse.     He added that,    in

         contrast to his original statement,    he could no longer

         say that he definitely saw Kevin's skin colour change
                          - 5 -



      from normal to grey;    nor did he now think Kevin had

      vomited, but that the fluid he saw coming from Kevin's

      mouth might have been spittle or phlegm.     Mr. Bruder

      had confirmed that he attempted to resuscitate Kevin

      for a period of time of between 10 and 15 minutes and

      that the ambulance he- saw was definitely entering the

      stadium and not exiting.



10.   In his further evidence Dr. Slater stated that Kevin

      would have suffered irrecoverable brain damage and

      death within 3 to 6 minutes, that is, by the time

      Mr. Bruder reached him, and that although he was brain

      dead his heart may have gone on beating for a short

      while longer,, and his nerves may have lived on thus

      causing the twitching.     He brain had died near to the

      time of the crushing,    but his whole body died at the

      time that P.C. Bruder was with him and saw him turn

      grey.



11.   Dr. Ernest Gumpert was of the view that Kevin was

      probably dead before he was even removed from enclosure 4,

      in the sense that he was brain dead and was going to die.

      He also thought it conceivable that his heart continued

      to operate for a time as did his peripheral nervous

      system.   But after Kevin had suffered brain death the

      only way to keep him alive would have been by artificial

      means.

12.   On 15th December,    1991, the Applicant Ann Williams met

      with mr. Bruder.     A note of this meeting is exhibited

      at Page/^*r.”'/.<^7appended hereto.   From those notes

      it7 would appear that Mr. Bruder refutes the interpretation

      placed by D.I.     Robert Sawers upon the statement made by

      Mr. Bruder on 3rd May,    1990.



13.   From November 1991 the Applicants made repeated requests

      to South Yorkshire Police to release copies of the statements

      made by Special Constable Martin and Mr. Bruder.

      The Applicants eventually received the said statements

      from the Coroner's office on 19th February,      1992.   In

      relation to Mr. B r u d e r 's initial statement made on 2?th

      April,   1989, the following matter caused grave concern

      to the Applicants

      (a)   Mr. Bruder describes seeing a police cordon in front

            of the North stand.      Kevin was lying on the ground

            behind the police cordon having convulsions.       None

            of the police officers left the cordon to assist

            people who were, lying on the pitch.     (See Page-2 ^5").


      (b)   Shortly after Mr. Bruder began resuscitation attempts

            on Kevin an ambulance entered the ground and drove

            towards the Lapping Lane end.      He told the St. Johns

            man to try and stop it.      He tried to flage it down

            but it continued on as if it had been ordered not

            to stop.   (See Page




                               \ ? o
                                       - 7 -


          Details of the aforementioned matters were not referred

          to in the police summary of evidence presented at the

          inquest.        The Applicants feel that such omissions
                                           °F
          illustrate the shortcomings^'presenting evidence in
                                           A
          summary form.       A copy of Mr. Brud e r 's first statement

          and the West Midland's Police Summary of Evidence is

          annexed hereto.



#   14-   In relation to mr. B r u d e r 's second statement made on

          3rd May, 1990, he states in the first paragraph thereof

          that he had "been asked to think about a number of points

          which are raised in the statement I made nearly a

          fortnight after the Hillsborough Stadium disaster".

          See P a g e ^     hereof).   In the Applicants' view, this

          remark, taken together with the notes of the meeting held

          with Mr. Bruder on 15th December,         1991, indicate that

          improper pressure was indeed exerted upon Mr. Bruder

          to retract or qualify in part his previous statement.

          Further,    since receiving the copy statements the

          Applicants have viewed a BBC video of events as they

          unfolded on the day of the disaster.          It is evident from

          the video that a SYMAS Ambulance entered the Spion Kop

          end of the pitch at 3.36 p.m.         at which time it has been

          established that Mr. Bruder was attempting to resuscitate

          Kevin.     The Applicants are concerned that despite its

          availability this evidence was not put before the jury.

          Rather, Mr. Bruder was asked to consider whether the

          ambulance he had originally referred to as enter ing the

          stadium was in fact exiting.

                                       \

15.   At the same time as efforts were being made to

      secure copies of witness statements attempts were made to

      contact Special Constable Martin.     On 20th February 1992

      the Applicant Ann Williams received a phone call from

      the Special Constable which culminated in a meeting

      at the Applicants home on 22nd February 1992.     At that

      meeting Special Constable Martin confirmed the contents

      of her first statement made on 8th May 1989 wherein she

      described the events set out in paragraph 4 hereof.

      She stated that this statement was made up from notes which

      she had made in her pocketbook immediately after the disaste

      She explained that her later statement dated 17th March

      1990 was compiled by an officer from the West Midlands

      Police Force who visited her at her home.     This officer

      tried to convince Special Constable Martin that her

      original statement was untrue.     The Special Constable

      signed the statement prepared by this officer without

      reading it.   She was unable to read it due to the state

      of distress brought on b y ’ the officer's behaviour.   She

      signed the statement because of the pressure exerted by the

      officer and because she wanted to put Hillsborough behind

      her.



      Special Constable Martin has now signed a statement,       in

      the presence of a solicitor, confirming the truth of her

      original statement dated 8th May 1989,    and explaining the

      circumstances relating to the compilation of the later

      statement dated 17th March 1990.
A copy of this statement is appended hereto at Page     3 S 8


The Applicants firmly believe that the statement dated

17th March 1990 led to the undermining of Special

Constable Martin's statement at the mini inquest on 2nd

May 1990 (see in particular page 7, para D.E. of transcrip:

proceedings).


Subsequent to the meeting with Special Constable Martin

the Applicants sought the advice of their general

practitioner as to the contents of Kevin's autopsy report.


In his view the injuries to Kevins larynx would not have

prevented him from speaking.   A copy of this opinion

is appended hereto at page


Now in receipt of most of the evidence relating to

Kevin's death, the Applicants contend that the inquest

proceedings into Kevin's death and the result and verdict

of accidental death are highly unsatisfactory by reascr.

of the following matters

(a)   The jury never heard from Mr.Bruder himself,

      nor did they hear from Special Constable

      Debra Martin.   The jury were merely presented

      with excerpts from their respective statements.

      The Applicants contend that the evidence

      relating to Kevin was presented to the jury

      in a confusing and incoherent fashion.

(b)   They are particulary concerned at the inactivity

      of the police officers in the cordon whilst
      Kevin was convulsing_and the unsuccessful attempt
                             - 10 -


              to flag down an ambulance.       In their view both

              these matters indicate a lack of response on the

             part of the emergency services.

       (c)   Notwithstanding the evidence of Dr.David Slater

             and Dr.Ernest Gumpert they believe that Kevin

             was alive for some time after 3.32 and hence

             for some time after the 3.15 p.m, cut off time.

             This belief is heightened by a recent article in

             the British Medical        Journal dated 30th November 1991

             This article     states that the accident and emergency

             departments of the Northern General and Royal

             Hallamshire Hospitals,      Sheffield, were never

             formally told to implement the major disaster

             plan.     Further,   the article states that most of

             the seriously injured arrived at hospital between

             3.30 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.       Nine of those injured were

             convulsing upon admission.       A further 6 were confused

             upon arrival and then began having severe convulsions

             It is known that some of these people survived with

             no long term physical effects.

       (d)   The further evidence which has come to light since

             the inquest indicates in particular a suppression

             of evidence,    irregularity of proceedings and

             discovery of new evidence.



19 .   The Applicants submit that in the light of these matters

       and had Mr.Bruder and Debra Martin been called as

       witnesses there may have been sufficient evidence for
       the jury to conclude that Kevin's death was due to or

       aggravated    by lack of care.
   MEETING BETWEEN ANNE WTT.T.TAMS AND P.C. BRUDER -

    15TH DECEMBER. 1991



   P.C. Bruder            made his original statement            'approximately ten

   days after the disaster.



   At that time he asked the West Midlands Police for the name

   of    the boy      he had        attempted to       resuscitate (i.e.        Kevin

^^illiams) .         This was refused.



  At the meeting with P.C.                 Bruder on 15th December,          1991, he

   stated that        he came          across Kevin     on the     pitch and     that

  Kevin      was either           convulsing or       twitching.      Kevin had     a

  pulse and there was vomit in Kevin's mouth.                      As he tried to

  resuscitate Kevin an ambulance approached going towards the

  Leppings       Lane end         of    the   ground.      He    shouted for      the

  ambulance to stop in order to put                   Kevin in it, but it went

^ ^ t r a i g h t past.



  On 3rd May, 1990, P.C. Bruder was                   visited in his heme by a

  West Midlands Police Officer                who asked him to 'reconsider'

  his statement.             He    was asked if       he was mistaken        when he

  stated that        Kevin was          convulsing and had        a pulse.      P.C.

  Bruder stated that he was not mistaken.




 ANNAAJ
  N .B .     It     was only at this         time (i.e. 3rd May,         1990) that

  P.C.       Hrucer learnt         for the      first    time the     name of    the

  person he had -cried to help.



  At     the      same    time      as    the    West    Midlands     Officer    was

  interviewing him in his                home, the Coroner rang P.C. Bruder

  and tried to           persuade him that the facts            of his statement

 were incorrect in               particular that the ambulance            could not

  have       been    driving onto         the    pitch   but might       have   been

 driving off it.            Again, P.C. Bruder refused               to admit that

 he had been mistaken and was adamant that the ambulance had

 been driving onto the pitch.



 The       West     Midlands      Officer       was   with    P.C.   Bruder     from

 approximately 10.00 a.m. - 4.00 p.m. on 3rd May.



 P.C. Bruder          tcld the      Officer that he          didn't want      to see

^^evi n ' s parents but if they wished to meet with him then he

 would be         prepared to meet          them anywhere.       fN.B.     When the

 West Midlands           Officer visited          Mr, and    Mrs. Williams       the

 same day         he informed them          that P.C. Bruder would          not see

 the m ) .



 P.C. Bruder          stated the         reasons behind       the West     Midlands

 Officer visiting him              when he stated "when he           came down to

 see me it was with a brief - to get me to change my mind."

  In response to whether or not           he would be prepared to make

  another statement,     P.C. Bruder        replied that   he would     be

  prepared to     stand up     in Court     and state   that Kevin    was
    /

  convulsing,     that there    was    a pulse    and   that there    was

  vomit in his mouth.



  Asked whether    or not Kevin was         alive when he got   to him,

^^P.C. Eruder replied "there was a pulse and if that means he

  was alive then he was alive."



 When P.C.   Bruder left       Kevin   he    was certain that he      was

 dead.    He himself vomited and       then went home. He destroyed

  all the clothes he was wearing on that day.           He stated that

 he has   never received any       counselling and has      dealt with

 the disaster "in his own way."

         INQUEST INTO TH E DEAT H OF KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS

       MR. FRASER:       Sir, you will now hear evidence re la t in g
  to Kevin Daniel Williams-           K ev in' s mum and dad are in Court
  with the social w o r k e r from M er se ys ide who has been
  assisting them-     The s o l i c i t o r s for Kevin's mum and dad are
  members of my G r o u p a n d I there for e appear in the usual
  guise as their agent to the St ee r in g Committee.

        THE CORONER:           G o o d morning, Mr. and Mrs. Williams-
   Before we begin I am go in g to e xp la in to you the general
   format of the Inquest becau se you weren't here a fortnight
  ago, were you, a nd eve n if you were you might have
  forgotten-     We will start in a moment or two by me readi ng
  to you what was s a i d . o n 18th April 1989 which is wh e n I
  opened the Inquest in th is very room.              Then if there are any
  amen dm ent s whi ch n e e d to be made, if we have got s o m e of the
  facts wrong, we will sort that out.               I will then tell you
  what the blood alcohol levels were, as measured by
  Dr- Forrest, and then we will turn to Dr. Slater, wh o is the
  Pathologist s i t t i n g up there be hi nd you-       He will gi v e us
  the pathological evidence.              I think I can safely say that
  if, after this Inquest over, you feel you would like to talk
  to Dr. S lat er p r i v a t e l y he is quite happy to do that if it
  would be of any help to you.              When Dr. Slater has finished
  the West M i d la nd s Po li c e Off ic e rs have prepared a summary
  for me and he will deal with that and tell me about it.

      Then we will he a r from Inspector Layton, a n o t h e r West
 Midlands P oli ce Officer, whc will deal with the visual
 evidence.     He will first of all tell me all about the plans
 and so on and that is s om e t i m e s a bit confu sin g becau se
 there are a lot of r e f e r e n c e s given but when he has finished
 talking about it he c o m e s over and shows us on these big
 plans so that all of us, that is me, you, the Jury and
 everybody else can fo llo w it.             The n when that is do ne we
 conclude and take no further e vi de nc e at this stage.             Is
 that r ea so nab ly c l e a r ?     I like to tell you so that y ou know
 what to expect.       O t h e r w i s e you don't know what is coining.

      This then is the re su me d Inquest which was o pe ne d on
 18th April 1989 and on that o cc as io n Neil Anthony Parkin,
 Acting Cor o ne r' s Officer, said:

       "The body which is the subject of this Inquest has beer
       i d e n t i f i e d .to PC 1269 Glave of the South Yorkshire
       Police as that of Kevin Daniel Williams by James
       Stephen Williams, his father.            He was 15 years of age
       having been bo r n on 27th May 1973 at Southport-            He
       lived at \                                                  [

            Saturday, 15th April 1989.           PC Glave caused the body to
            be r em ov ed to the Medic o Legal Centre and th ere he
            identified it to Det ec ti ve Co nst abl e Simon Weigold w h o

Q. Dr. Slater. - A. Sir, my name is Dr. Da vi d Neil Slater-       I
   am a Consultant Hi sto pat ho log is t and a Fellow of the Royil

          THE CORONER:     B efo re     I go on, Mr.        Williams,   you are

           MR.   WILLIAMS:     Stepfather.

           THE CORONER:       Thank you very much.   You are mum, y es -
     Mr- Fraser, so that we get the re co rd right.      Is this an
     informal or a p r o p e r ado ption because obviously the lad
     carr ie s the same su rna me ?

          MR. FRASER:        There   is no formal        adoption but    it is a
     twelve years plus-

           THE CORONER:       Pardon?

          MR. FRASER:    There has been no formal a d o p t i o n by
     Mr. Wil liams as such but the r e l a t i o n s h i p is mo re than
     twelve years old.

Q-        THE CORONER:      I am very sorry, Dr. Slater, to have
     interrupted you-     Just remind us of you r name because I h a v e
     forgotten whe r e. we were up to?  Just start ag ain? - A. My

       Kevin Daniel Wi l l i a m s who was also identified as No.         51,      is
       that right? - A. That is correct, sir.

 Q.    Ident i-ficat ion w a s done by Inspector Timms so far as y o u are
       c o n ce rn ed ? - A- That was the initial identification.

 Q. But there       is no doubt    in your mind about the       identity? -
 A. No.

 Q. There were v a r i o u s mar ks on the body itself to identify it?
 A-- Sir, Kevin was cl e a r l y labelled both by number and by name.

 Q. Dr. Slater, w o u l d you be kind enough then to take me thro ugh
    the post m o r t e m ? - A. Ply ex ami na tio n of Kevin showed that
    the main finding was that of asphyxia.                 This opinion w as
    formed through the ex te nsi ve bl uen es s on the face and u p p e r
    part of the chest.              In ad dit io n there were small
    h a emo rr hag es in both the face and internal organs i n c l u d i n g
    the brain, heart and lungs.                This asphyxia had clea rly
    resulted from c o m p r e s s i o n o f the neck and chest and this
    opinion was s u p p o r t e d by the presence of three smail
    scrat che s over t h e left side of the neck and also ov e r t h e
    front of the vo i ce box-            This had also resulted in four
    fractures to the s m a l 1 bone s in the actual voice box.             In
    addition there was evi dence of bruisi ng to the lungs, a g a i n
    supp ort ing c o m p r e s s i o n of the chest.

            My aut op sy sh o w e d that Kevin was a normally deve lo ped ,
      fit, healthy, y o u n g male with no evidence of any natural
      disease which co u ld have c on tr ib ut ed towards death and it
      was my opinion that Kevin had a normal life expectancy-                  In
      ter ms of the mode of death the co mpr ess io n of the neck or
      chest has occ ur re d here and u nc ons cio us nes s occurs very
      rapidly, ce rta in ly w ith in a few seconds, a n d there is one
      report ed case of it o cc ur rin g a pp ar ent ly instantaneously.
      Follo win g u nc o n s c i o u s n e s s then there is no discomfort an d nc
      pain.   Death then occurs after a pp ro xi mat ely three to five
      minutes, sir-

Q- So because when we say as phyxia people think of agony for
   ages and ages.        What you are sa ying is that the person
   hi m sel f would very rapidly not know anything at all about
   what was ha p p e n i n g ? - A. I s hou ld say the word "asphyxia" is
   un for tu na te in that sc ie n ti fic al ly it partly includes s i m p l y
   that there is not enough ox ygen in the blood.           It doesn't
   imply actual su ffo c at io n and prolonged death.

Q. Did you say there were four fractures to the voice box?                   -
A- Yes, there are two bones in the voice box, as you know,                   sir,
   and both these showe d two fractures each.

Q.    Now the reason why I asked you was this, and I want to p-t
      this to you beca use I would like to get your view on it, one
      Offi cer will be dealing with the value of this ev ide nc e in a

      moment but she says that at a point when this lad was in the
      gymnasium, in o th er words he had al re ady been movsd across
      the pitch, she sa y s she he l p e d him into the gym from the
      pitch, p r e s um a bl y she c a r r i e d him- He stopped breathing.
      She gave him the kiss of life, d i d some heart massage, he
      opened his eyes sa id a wor d and died.             Now in the light of
      your pathological findings, is that in fact a possibility,
     do you think? - A. Well, sir, I was awar e of this statement
     and therefore I ha ve c le arl y gi v e n this matter considerable
     thought, sir.         I think there are several com me nts to make
     but the mo d er at el y large n um be r of autopsies I d i d from this
      incident, sir, this was c e r t a i n l y the most se ve re case of
     traumatic a sp h y x i a that I a c t u a l l y dealt with.    This was
     both in terms of bl ueness o f the face and also the area of
     pallor of w h i te ne ss ar oun d the mouth.         Sir, it w as a very
     very severe form of as p h y x i a and I do not think that
     unconscio usn ess w o u l d have be e n q u i c k e r than 'hree or five
     seconds.     I hav e no reason to a l t e r what I have already said
     on that a s p e c t .

          The other v e r y signif ica nt thing about           this, and it alsc
     supports the s e v e r i t y of this case, is         that ag ai n of the
     autopsies I did a p p r o x i m a t e l y 15 per cent had s o m e sort of
     fracture to the vo ic e box, the larynx.             This case was highly
     unusual in that in fact it had four fractures to the larynx.
     It was by far the most se ve re case of voice box fractures-
     Not only does th is indicate the s e ve ri ty of the traumatic
     asphyxia at the time but it also in fact makes it virtually
     impossible for the person to have sp ok en by vi r tu e of the
     fact that there w e r e fract ure s to the voice box, sir-              So
     all I can say, sir, that s c i e n t i f i c a l l y and medically I find
     that inconceivable that the p er so n co u l d have spoken-

Q. The other thing I notice is that you show in th is particular
   case extensive co n g e s t i o n of the cerebral veins and
   cereballum and cortical c o n i n g and if a person speaks his
   neurons are working, aren't they'? - A.          That is right.

Q. That evidence w o u l d indicate there had      been e xt en siv e brain
    damage and he co uld n't re al ly communicate.     W o u l d that be
    right?  I don't want to put words in your mouth but I want
    to be sure about that ? - A- The co ni ng indicates the
    severity of the as ph y xi a an d again that would ha ve resulted
    in irreversible br a i n    damage whic h   ag ai n would totally
  / prohibit any form of communication.

Q.   I have thought about this comment as well, of course, and
     there are several e x p l a na ti on s (1) that it didn't occur and
     that the obs er ver is mis taken but a n ot he r possibility that
     has occurred to me and I want to put it to you and please
     disagree if it is not either          right or you don't accept it;
     it is possible,     is it not, that if a person ha vin g cied is
     moved air or s t o m a c h con te nts might be expelled and might
     make a sound as it escapes, so to sp e a k ?       Is that a

  po s s i b i l i t y ? - A- It is an itineresting comment, sir, b ec au s
  it is a p o s s i b i l i t y I c o n s i d e r e d also m y s e l f and that is
  c e r t a i n l y an e x p l a n a t i o n to the noise w h i c h could have bee n

      MR. FRASER:            No que stions, sir, but thank             you very

            MR.   FRASER:        No,   thank you,           sir.

            THE CORONER:           I will     recall Dr.           Slater.

                      DR.    DA VI D NEIL SLATER - Rec alled

                                    Bv THE C O R O N E R :
                                                                                           /
 Q. Dr. Slater, the point that is be ing made, of course, you
     have got to r em e m b e r that Mr. B ru de r w as at the S p i o n Kop
     end, the b ott om en d and not the top, a nd he says, "I saw
     this man lying on the floor h av in g convulsions".                   Ca n you
    help us about th a t ?              What does that ad d or not to your
    pa t hol ogi ca l o p i n i o n ? - A. It is o b v i o u s l y very di s tr es si ng .
    U n f o r t u n a t e l y w h e n people have not got enough o x y g e n in the
    brain, as I said in my earli er evidence, which is really
    what the word ‘'asphyxia" means, in dividuals can in fact h a v e
    fits.        This is on e of the mec han is ms that leads t o wa rd s
    dea th and makes the a s p hy xi a worse-           T h i s does, however,
    only occ ur when the individual is t ot al ly unconscious-                      It
    does not me a n there will 'be any pain or discomfort.                      The
    pe r so n will not know they are fit tin g a n d actually I have to
    accept that some individuals do have co nvulsions a nd ic is
    one of the m e c h a ni sn ^ leading to death in traumatic
    asphyxia, sir-

Q. Does it make you feel the other ev ide nce about the lad
   br e a t h i n g and s p e a k i n g either more or less likely because
   o b v i o u s l y this would' be much cl oser in time to Special
   Co n s t a b l e Mar tin's ev idence than what had happened on the
   t e rr ac e? - A. Yes.           For so meb od y to have convulsions, this
   would imply that the amount of as p h y x i a is such that there
   must be virtu all y irreversible brain da mage present and
   agai n this would ful ly support the co nc ept that t h e e v i de nc e
   of o p e n i n g eyes a nd s p ea ki n g is not r ea ll y conceivable, sir.

           THE CORONER:          Does that help,            Mr.     Fraser.

                       C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by MR.   FRASER:

          MR. FRASER:     I am sure it does, Dr. Slater.    It is
     difficult to find the ph rase to sum the situation up.     Kevin
     at that stag e w as be yo nd help. He w as as good as dead? - A-
     Yes, that is right, absolutely.

Q. And would feel no t h i n g and know not hi n g?                  - A. Absolutely.
   He wo u ld know nothing.

          Sir, -an e x a m i n a t i o n has been made of video filn and
  p hot o gr a ph ic e v i d e n c e and Kevin has been identified in
  Enclosure No. 3, also, sir, being carried a c r o s s the pit ch
  and at T h e Sp io n Kop end of the ground.

       On a p h o t o g r a p h re fe re nc ed DAC3/1 Kevin is shown
 appare nt ly u n c o n s c i o u s near the pe ri m et e r fe n ci n g in
 E nclosure No- 3-          On a E E C video tape, r e f e r e n c e d NA P 7,
 timed at 1 52 8 :3 3: 22 t his shows hi m being r em o ve d fr om the
 t erraces v i a G at e No. 3-

        FC Craig hi ll has s ig ne d a plan of the pitch sh ow in g
where he first c a m e into contact with Kevin and where in
fact he laid hirn on the ground and that plan, sir, is
re fe renced MJC2.       T h e O ff ic e r has identified h i m s e l f on
video, again a B BC vi de o tape, MAP 7, timed at 15 28:43:24
c a rr yi ng a y o ut h who he knows to be Kevin - that is a t y p in g
eiTor there.        It s a y s Keith In the s ummary but it sho ul d be
Kevin - from Gate 3 and on to the pitch.               The O f f i c e r did
not know the ide nt it y of the youth and at first in fact
believed it, to be a n o t h e r of the de ceased but that has been
c 1ari f I e d -

       Ph o to g ra ph r e f e r e n c e d PR5/32 an d PR5/33 which are both
timed at 1532 s h o w K ev i n being c ar ri ed a cr os s the pitch on a
temporary s t r e t c h e r by a number of s p e c t at o rs and two P ol ic e
Officers.        PC H a y e s has confirmed his ident if ic at io n on
those ph otographs.            The O ff ic er assi st ed to c ar ry two p e o p l e
on t em po ra ry s tr et ch er s, both of w ho m were d e c e a s e d , but he
couldn't recall any o th er details and he didn't know the
identity of the p e r s o n s he carried.             He m e r e l y ^ as it were,
ass is te d in CArrjying.            We have mentioned that before-           It is
not an unuouai f ea t ur e that people's r e c o l l ec ti o ns weren't
<=* A c l O   t   -



        A n u m be r of photographs, including a p h ot ogr aph
referenced T T 1 / 3 G show K ev in being given mouth to mouth
r e su sc it at io n on the pitch by PC Brud er who c o n f i r m e d his
identification.         Sir, you mentioned this O f f i c er earlier.
In fact, it is true to say Mr- and Mrs. W il l ia ms have
previo us ly s ee n visual evidence.       They have in fact s een
some of that visual e v ide nc e again today an d I think I am
right in s a y i n g t hey have c onf ir med that Ke v in is s ho w n on
that p h o t og r ap h so, as it were, PC Bruder is co nf i rm ed as
having given m ou th to mo ut h res us ci tat io n to Kevin.

The reason I a s k e d is because it refers to a friend and
there doesn't s e e m to be any other evid en ce of that? -
No, that is r i g h t ’
                      . It is true to say the initial
identification w a s from c lothing but it has su bs eq u en t ly
been confirmed.

      S i x , can I xefei- you to a plan which has been given                 the
riifercnct: M W J L 4 0 which is a plan of the terraces?

                                    Q-    Yes    C 2O !•. - And NWJL41     wh ic h   is a plan of the pitch-

                                    Q-   M JC are they the same m a r k i n g s ? - A- I would say, sir, that
                                         in fact al th ou gh there ar e two m a r k i n g s the r eference to MAP

                                         on that occasion.

                                   Q. So MUJL41 we make C202 - Let us include that one as well
                              B|      MJC2 will be C203. - A. Which is PC Craighill's plan.
                                      (moved to v Ia n ) Sir, if we can deal with the p la n MWJL40,
                                      which is the plan of the terraces, the first photogr ap h
                                      DAC3/1 referred to in t his s u m m a r y indicates the pos iti on
                                      here (.ind icat- in g ) and t h i s i ndi ca te s Enclosure No- 3 and it
                                      is at this point here (i n d i c a t i n g ) that Kevin is s h o w n quite
                                      close to the p e r i m e t e r fence.

                                              The seco nd identification, MA P 7, the BBC tape, refers
                                         to the ident if ic at io n b y PC Craig hi ll and the point at which
                                         we see Kevin is a p p r o x i m a t e l y h er e ( ind icat in g ) a n d it is
                                         prior to his removal via G ate 3.

                                                 Then, sir, in respect of PC C r ai g hi l l' s plan, WJC2, it
                                         is a terrace plan he re fe r s to but he actually indicates a
                                         p o sit io n here ( i n d i c a t i n g ) in front of Gate 3 and a further
                          D              position which is s h o w n just off the plan but it is here-
                                         It is just on to the pitch.

                                         It is d i a g r a m ma ti c ? - A'. Yes.

                                   Q. C ert ai nl y the s e co nd loc at io n can't be taken a s - gi v in g us
                                      any sense of d i s t a n c e ? - A. No, but factually the next plar.
                                      w i 11 do that.     I think, sir, just to correct myse lf I should
                                      have been poi nt in g there.

                                   Q. Yes. - A. Sir, in r es pect of M W J L 4 1 , the video r e f er e nc e o~
                                      BBC tape, MAP 7, indica te s a p o s i t i o n here (indi cat i n s )

                                      r eferred to is there ( indicat- ing ) .

                   C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by HR.   CATCHPOLE:

Q , Andre w Duncan, did h e s h o w an y visual e vidence or did he
    give a plan s h o w i n g w h e r e he last saw Kevin, when they
    part ed c o mp an y ? - A. 1 d o n ’t b e l i e v e so- Can you just give
    me a moment?        The a n s w e r is we don't have a. plan from
    Mr- Duncan.

         THE CORONER:          If I can h e l p you a little bit on that
  ont, what Andrew D u n c a n s ays is, "We st oo d up and were
  standing about two to tw o and a q u a r t e r yards from the
  p eri me te r fence a r o u n d th e pitch.      We were waiting for the
  game to start.      At about 1445 or so a g r o u p of friends were
  s tanding behind me, S t ua rt T h o m p s o n and T ony Grier-      I was
  s tanding with Kev in Williams".           T h e n he d escribes the people
  coming out and he says, "When t he game k ic ke d off I was
  pushed forward down th e te r ra c e about two yards.            After this
  push I lost Kevin and did not s e e him again".               His final
  remark is that he s aw K e v i n for the last time on the terrace
  just before the crush started.             "The last time I saw Kevin
  was on the t er race just b ef or e th e crush started.           After
  this I did not s e e hi m again".          That is hi s statement, just
  so that we know what it is which on e we a r e talking about,
  dated 17.5.89.      A n y t h i n g else, Mr. Fraser, you want tc ask?

         HR.   FRASER:       No,   sir.

           THE CORONER:          Hr. and Mrs. Williams, that is the
  evidence we are g oi ng to take.                   As I said to you in the
  middle of the h e a r in g we spent q u i t e a lot of time wondering
  what we should do for th e best.                     O bv iou sl y we knew Kevin
  lost his life and we w e r e w o r r i e d about upsetting you in
  Court but I think on b a l a n c e we ha ve done the right thing
  because you h ave h e a r d w i th i n t h e limits of what we are
  doi ng and s u m m a r i s i n g t h e e v i d e n c e what happened an d what
  went on.       Fortunately, Dr. S l a t e r has b een able tc be here
  and he has been able to g ive you his op in io n as to what
  happened in his view a n d what in his view is possible and I
  think I arn s ure that will h elp y o u - not to corr.e to terms
  with the loss of yo ur s o n but it is very difficult to come
  to terms with that loss at all but just to app re ci at e in the
  stress s itu a ti o n in w h i c h p eo pl e found themselves
  r eco ll ec t io ns tend s o m e t i m e s to be m is ta ke n and indeed there
  are lots of m i st ak e n r e c o 11e c t i o n s not o n l y in relation to
  Kevin but also in r e l a t i o n to many of the other people of
  which we have heard.             That is not at all uncom-on and occurs
  in normal fatal i n c id e nt s as well.                  It is exceedingly
  d i f f icu 1t when you are s ud de n 1y c on f ront ed wit':', a sit uat ion

                                very sorry we are that he s h o u l d have lost his life at s u c h

                       THE    I N Q U E S T INTO T H E DEATH OF
B
                             K EV IN    D A NI EL W I LL I A M S


           THE CORONER:    No w y ou m a y r em em be r on W e d n es da y I
      kept you late.    I said I had to go out and do a little
      bit of thinking, and that is what we are going to deal
      with this afternoon.

            What we were thinking about was that one of the
      inquests which we had done related to Kevin Daniel
      Williams.    I will r e m in d you of this inquest.        This
      was the case of a n o t h e r yo un g man, in fact he was only
      15.    The pro b le m in that case was that the evidence
      was difficult to u n r a v e l as to when he died and what
      had happened when lie was being taken across the pitch
D     and had he said s o m e t h i n g in the temporary m or tuary and
      so on.

            After the inqu es t was c o n c l u d e d my attention was
      cirawn by some of rny legal c o ll ea g ue s, and very
      rightlybecause they were re al i se d it was a sensitive
      problem and did not want to u p s e t the family, so they
      brought it to my a t t e n t i o n p r i v a t e l y first.      T h e point
      which they were b r i n g i n g to my a t t e n t i o n was that one
      of the witnesses a p p e a r e d to say that when he came to
      this young man at the Sp io n K o p end, mor e or less,, of
      the ground, he had c o n v u l s i o n s and he also said he
      could feel a pulse.             We kne w from the visual evidence
      - we are going to r e p ea t all the r el evant evidence in a
      moment - we k new that he w a s be i n g taken across the
      pitch and we h.id a timing at 1532.                  As s uming that was
      right, this c o n v u l s i o n or w h a t e v e r it was, was
      happening after that point of time.                   T he q u estion was:
      what on earth was g o i n g on?

          I agreed          that this was a valid point. I think          we
     were so concerned a b o u t the event w h i c h happened after
     that, namely,         what h a p p e n e d in the gymnasium, did he
     speak or did he not speak -                this was the lad with the
     fractured voice box - that we may not have put quite
     enough co n ce n t r a t i o n and thought into the earlier
     evidence, but we are going to do it now.                We are going
     to sort it out so that we know, as far as we are able,
     so that we underst an d, if we can, what happened.

              I think if S e r g e a n t    Kil lo ch could come back.

        the gate in the p e r i m e t e r fencing of e n c l o s u r e 3 and on
        to the pitch.

        The officer a t t e m p t e d       r es us c i t a t i o n but without
        success.

         Derek W i l l ia m Br uder is a Police C o n s t a b l e with                  the
    D   M e r s e y s i d e Police who was of f- d ut y at the match                    that
        day.          He was a s p e c t a t o r in the North Stand.                    He

        as having c o n v u l s i o n s -.

        Mr. Bruder went on to the pitch and gav e mouth to mouth
        resuscitation, aided by a St. J ohn's A m b u l a n c e m a n who
    E   carried out c a r d i a c massage.           Mr. B r u d e r recalls that
        a friend of the c a s u a l t y was with him on the pitch.
        R e s u s ci ta t io n was continued" and cney w er e joined by a
        St. John*s A m b u l a n c e w o m a n who took over from Mr. Bruder
        and after a short time by a St. John 's A mb ulanceman.

        The St. Jo hn's A m b u l a n c e m a n said the c a s u a l t y was dead
        and Mr. Bruder then left the scene.

A             "We continued to work on the man hut after ab ou t
              five minutes he went grey and his face was
              withdrawn."

      - A. That    is right,    sir.

  i}. He talks about the man vomiting and being sick and
      havin g a peculiar smell - at least, the breath...
B     Well, his mouth had a peculiar smell? - A. Yes.

    ). He also noticed there was something unu su a l about his
      rib cage:

              "As I did heart massage his ribs were unnaturally
              p r o m i n e n t ."

      - A. Yes.

      -Then eventually a n o th er St. John's A m b u l a n c e person
      came and he left the man? - A. That is right.

      This whole thing took quite a few mi n utes? - A. Yes,
      obviously the off i ce r had no c on ception of time.
D ). Can you remind me about the visual evidence?              It is
     ‘just to make sure I have got it right that there is
      visual evidence, bot h of Mr. Bruder... - A. One
      photographic print was mentioned, sir, and was given
      the reference number TT.1/30.         That is a photograph
      which shows Kevin lying on the pitch.           T h e person has
      been identified by Kevin's parents.          Sh ow n about to
E     give m ou t h to m o ut h resuscitation of K e vi n is a man who
      has been identified as Police Cons ta b le Bruder.          PC
      Bruder has identified himself on that photograph.

      Then there is another timed print, is it P R . 5/32 or
      P R . 5/33, showing Kevin being carried across, pa r a g r a p h
      18? - A. There are two photographs, sir:       PR.5/A/32,
      which is timed at 1532 and PR.5/A/33.      T h a t is also
      timed at 1532.

              THE CORONER:   Inspector Layton,       just show us
      where    those photographs are.

           INSPECTOR LAYTON:     Yes, sir.     T h e y are referred
      to in the plan MWJL.42.     PR .5/32 is ap proximately at
      this position here, on the pitch.      That is the timed
      photograph, sir.    TT .130 is not timed, but I believe
      it is somewhere in this area h e r e .   From recollection
      1 think I did that actually from what Mr. Bruder says
      in his statement, about the positioning on the pitcn.

      THE CORONER:   Now Inspe ct or Sawers wen t to see
 Mr. Bruder because we wanted to be sure we had the
 facts.

           INSPECTOR MAT TH EW R OB ER T S AWERS C al l ed

                           By THE C O R O N E R :

      T H E WITNESS: M a t t h e w Robert Sawers,             Inspector,
 West Midlands Police.

 I believe you went to see him yesterdav.7 - A. Yes,                     sir.

In fact it was Mr. Bruder's day off but he very
w i l l in gl y gave his time? - A. He did.

Now can you summarise for me what he says? - A. Yes,
sir.     He starts off by referring and identi fy i ng his
two previous         statements to us, sir, the first of w h i c h
was a p pr ox im a te ly a fortnight ajLtjex the d i s a s t e r
itself, arid n ocuunti s tatement in A u g u s t of last year
was a very short statement in w hi ch he m e r e l y
identifies himself on the ph ot o gr ap hs that you have
heard reference to, sir.

He goes on to say that I had shown him a n u m b e r of
docu m en ts and plans, from wh ic h he was able to refresh
his memory.        He refers to the fact he had made some
notes on the     day after the d i s a s t e r but that they did
not refer specifically to his d e a l i n g s with this
casualty.

He refers, sir, to joining M e r s e y s i d e C o n st ab u la ry in
1987 and receiving basic first-aid i n s t r u c t i o n duri n g
his initial training.                That was b o t h in theory and
p ractical application.                He refers, sir, following the
incident and his dealings with this youth, to feeling
he was inadequately trained in his own confidence,
although it is also true to say that he is absolutely
satisfied that the first aid he rende r ed on the day was
the very best he could do and he felt he c o u l d do no
more.          He goes on to say as a result of feeling
d ep r e s s e d about the incident he applied of his own
volition for /further first - ai d training w i t h i n
M e r s e ys i de Police.        Indeed, he at te n d e d a full week,
Monday to Friday course, leading to a fur t he r
q u a l i fi ca t io n a n d .much g r e a te r c o n f i d e n c e in his own
ability.           However, with the benefit of that training,
sir, he is able to reflect on his actions of the day
and he is still absolutely s a t is fi ed that the first aid
he rendered in terms of mo ut h to m o u t h and heart
massage were correct and he could have done no more for
Kevin.

                                 normal pallor, or colo ur , to grey.          He mentioned it in
                                 his statement, sir, in the sequence that it occurred to
                                 him that he was now n o t i c i n g that he was grey.     He may
                                 have been grey as he a p p r o a c h e d him before he mentioned
                                 it, or it may have o c c u r r e d as he noticed it.

                                 In his original s t a t e m e n t he referred to vomiting and
                                 thinking that Kevin h a d been sick.         Ele has given this
                            B    matter some further thought and he is absolutely
                                 satisfied that Kevin was not sick.           He did not see
                                 Kevin vomiting and he did not see vomit on the ground
                                 or on his clothing.

                                Does he still c o n f i rm that there was a distinctive
                                smell? - A. Yes, he does, sir.

                                To finish with the v o m i t i n g aspect of his original
                                statement, he does h av e a cl ea r impression in his mind,
                                sir, of a fluid of some sort in the mouth, but he
                                cannot disco un t that that could be spittle or phlegm of
                                some sort.

                                He referred in his o r i g i n a l statement to the original
                        D       resuscitation attempts w h e r e b y he gave mouth to mouth
                                resuscitation and the St. John's A m bu l a n c e m a n commenced
                                heart compressions.       His original thought, sir, was
                                that that was for a p p r o x i m a t e l y seven minutes and, give
                                or take, he is happy w i t h that time and thinks it is
                                reasonably accurate.          He then later referred to
                                swopping over with the St. John's A m bu lanceman and PC
                                Derek Bruder was then in volved in external heart

                                un buttoning his shirt, I believe.               He referred to
                                unzipping his trousers and n ot icing some striped boxer
                                shorts that you will see in the photographs that have
                                been referred to, T T . 1 / 3 1 and 32 respectively.

A"). The point is that the ambulances were known to a rr i ve
        at about 1515 and 1517 or thereabouts?          - A. Yes,   sir.

     I. And the photograph, PR.5/ A /3 2 and so on,       is timed at
        1532? - A. That is correct, sir.

     ). We are saying he was dea l in g with this young boy af te r
_       that? - A. That is correct.
IS
     ). In fact I put the w r o n g times to you.     It is 1515 on
        the pitch for the St. John 's A m bu l an ce and 1520 for the
        first S o u t h Yorkshire... - A. That is correct, sir,
        irrespective of which...

       It is still earlier... - A. It is still earlier than
       1532, sir, and that point has been put specifically to
       Mr. Bruder and try as he may he is simply ur, .ble to
       reconcile those differences.       I have put to him, sir,
       was it for instance a qu es ti o n of one of those
       ambulances actual l y exiting the sta di um across the
       pitch rather than e nt ering the stadium.     He has
       considered that point and try as he may his
       recollection is still of it being an ambulance that
£)     entered the stadium.

       He refers then to being joined by the woman St. J o h n ' s
       Ambulance Officer, w h o he refers to pushing him out of
       the way to become involved as a trained first aider and
       recollects this was a p p r o xi ma te l y six minutes after he
       changed places w i t h the male ambu l an ce officer.       for
       that reason, with the o ri ginal seven minutes m o u t h to
       mouth r esuscitation, PC Bruder feels          that that total of
       thirteen minutes he could amend to a period of time of
       between ten and fif te en minutes of sustained at t empts
       to resuscitate Kevin.

       It was at this point, sir, that after approximately two
       minutes of the i n v o l v e m e n t of the woman St. John's
       Ambulance Officer, that the male St. John's A m b u la nc e
       Officer stood up a nd said, "He's gone."             He r ef e rr ed
       to the expression being co mp le te l y grey and would seek
       to reaffirm that c h o i c e of words as his d e scription of
       Kevin at that p a r t i c u l a r moment in time.    He says,
       sir, and I quote:

             "There is a b s o l u t e l y no doubt in my mind, both now
             and with the benefit of further training, that
             then at the m o m e n t the youth I had tried to save
             was dead, c e r t a i n l y dead, and beyond any further
             help.   I and St. John's Ambu la nc e personnel would
             not have s t o p p e d if there had been any glimmer of
             hope at all.         There was none."

He refers to the p er s o n a l d e s c r i pt io n of Kevin again,
sir, and refers to the fact he is absolutely satisfied
it was Kevin Wi l liams that he was attempting to
resuscitate.

     THE CORONER:    I just want to make it crystal
clear that there is no s u g g e s t i o n in any of this of any
criticism of PC Bruder.      I think he did a b s o l u t e l y
valiantly and did his best.          Not only did he do his
best on the day. he is d oi n g his best today as well,
through Inspector Sawers, to try and help us understand
what he remembers and I want that c learly u nd erstood by
everybody.    I don't w an t you to think we are knocki ng
him.  We are not.   All I am trying to do is finding out
what happened.

      Mr. Fraser, any q u e s t i o n s of this officer on this
part?    I had better tell you who else I am g o i n g to be
calling.    Dr. S la te r and Dr. Gurnpert, whom I wi l l tell
you about w hen he comes.         He is a neuro physiologist,
a clinician, and an expert on this sort of thing.

     MR. FRASER:    No, sir, I have no specific
questions, save to say that I understand, Officer, you
have spoken to Mr. and Mrs. Williams, having s p o k e n to
the officer?    I rise b e c a u s e I ap pear for Mr. and Mrs.
Williams and obvio us l y ha v e their interests at heart.

     THE WITNESS:       I did go and visit Mr. and Mrs.
Williams, sir, y e st e r d a y evening, having seen PC Bruder
and I have o u tlined b r i e f l y to them the contents of PC
Bruder's further thoughts and re collections for Kevin
on the day.

     MR. FRASER:   Sir, I u n d e r st an d they are
appreciative, both of the efforts the officer has made
and of his visit and they have no questions.            The y
have decided not to come today, sir, for reasons which
I am sure you will u n d e r s t a n d but they are fully aware
of exactly what is go in g on on their behalf.

      THE CORONER:         T h a n k you.   Have you got any
ques t ions?

     MR. LIMB:       No,    thank you.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:           No,   thank you,   sir.

     THE CORONER:       When we have heard the rest of the
evidence I atn quite p r ep ar ed to recall any of these
officers, or, indeed, any of these witnesses be c au se I
want us to und er s ta nd it.

     Dr. Slater.

                                                          By THE C O R O N E R :

                              3. Dr. Slater, you have, of course, already dealt with
                                  this case a coup le of days ago.         If I remember r i g h tl y
                                 you said, among o t h e r things, that (a) this lad had a
                           n     broken voice box.          It was broken in four places.
                           **    Also (b) he was, of all the cases you dealt with,
                                 perhaps the mos t asp hy xi a te d, if one can judge that by
                                 cyanosis and so on.          Wou ld that be a correct
                                 recollection? - A. T h a t is absolutely correct, sir.           Of
                                 all the cases I d e a l t wi t h Kevin showed really the
                                 worst injuries to the neck in that there were four
                                 fractures to the v o i c e box.       In addition there were
                                 three very large scratches; to the neck.          In addition
                                 to cne normal signs ot asphyxia, the blueness and the
                                 hemorrhages w h i c h w e r e very marked, there is no doubt
                                 this was a very, ve r y severe case of asphyxia and
                                 probably the w o rs t one I dealt with, sir.

                              -Q. We establ i sh ed to e v e r y b o d y ' s satisfaction what had
                                  happened in the g y m n a s i u m and che account, we dealt
                           £)     with that as to w h e t h e r this lad could have spoken and
                                  so on, so we don't need to be concerned about that.
                                  What we are i n t e r e s t e d in this afternoon is t h e -
                                  evidence relati ng to Mr. Bruder.               I will also remind
                                  you that in g e n e r a l that what has been said is that a
                                  person becomes u n c o n s c i o u s in an asphyxial situation
                                  within a ny t h i n g from zero to twenty to thirty seconds.
                                  There is a slight v a r i a t i o n amongst pathologists, but
                                  quickly.       Th e n that dea th usual supervenes within four
                                  to six m i n u t e s or thereabouts.          The problem is, as you
                                  have already heard, that whichever way you look at it,
                                  Mr. Bruder was d e a l i n g w ith this young man quite a few
                                  minutes after he had been taken out from the Leppings
                                  Lane terraces.

                                   In the light of the e v id en ce can you help us as to what
                                   you think was goi ng on on? - A. Yes, sir.      I will deal
                                   with this in three g e n er al areas and then Dr. G u m pe r t
                                   certainly will co m e and enlarge on these and help us
                                   out further.

                                   Firstly, and I a p o l o g i s e if this is an emotive area, I
                                   think I need just to spend thirty seconds in ex pl aining
                                   what d ea t h i s. - - D e a t h is a sequence of events.   It is
                                   not one set event and the sequence I will put to you is
                                   an individua 1 b e co m i n g unconscious;     whilst they are
                                   unconscious they q u i c k l y lose all sensation of pain arid
                                   d i s c o m f o r t ; then there is a period of various tissues
                                   in the body w hich are susceptible to a lack of oxygen,
                                   dying.           The most important one of these is, of course,
                                   the brain, a nd after about three to six minutes the
                           H                                 - 10 -
                                                                                                     1032

brain undergoes i r r e v e r s i b l e brain damage.    Th er e is
then a point which we cal l brain death.              This is a
difficult concept, but by this I am implying that the
brain is irr e ve rs ib l y damaged.        The brain is no longer
able to control r e s p i r a t i o n and in fact that person,
for effective purposes, is dead, irreversibly.                 That
is a medico legal de fi n i t i o n , at least one medico legal
definition, of death.

The problem now comes that I have not mentioned other
tissues in the body.     For example, the heart, a very
emotive organ.   W hen s om ebody is brain dead it is
quite possible that the heart is still alive and still
beating and this can go on for a few minutes or longer,
perhaps even half an hour.

Then we come to the p oi nt w he r e the brain is dead, not
controlling re sp iration, and finally the heart stops
and that is really the point of whole body de a t h and
that is really w hat the lay pers on understands by
death.  A d o c to r going up, putting the st ethoscope on
the chest, no heart beat, no respiration, then that
person is u n e q u i v o c a l l y dead.

I hasten to add there that a lt h o u g h the person is truly
medico legally dead, in fact even then there are
tissues in the body that are still alive.           The skin is
still living.    The k i d n e y s are still living.    This is
how we can then t r a n sp l an t them.     In fact it is an
emotive area and a l t h o u g h that person is dead, there
are still tissues living.           It then takes another six
to twelve hours for all the tissues in the body to die.

Really, when we use the word "death" we have to be
very, very car ef ul we are not talking about one set
event at one point in time.       We are talking about a
whole c ontinuum of e ve n ts that go on.

I mentioned that some tissues do not die as rapidly as
the brain and this i nc ludes both nerves and muscle.
In fact one can have a situation of somebody being
brain dead but the m u s c l e s and the nerves in what we
call the pe r i p h e r a l n e r vo us system - not the brain -
are still living and in fact these can o cc asionally
function in some way.

Sir,   that is a -general c omment on death.

In relation to the H i l l s b o r o u g h incident, the sequence
that myself has given, and al though I have not heard
the other p a t h o l o g i s t s I u nd e rstand they have given a
very similar s eq u en ce of events, has been a rapid loss
of consciousness, p e r h a ps five to ten seconds.            I
understand I have been the nearest by quoting a paper
 where u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s can be i n st an t an eo us ,     That   is
 the rapid loss of c on sc iousness.

As soon as that p e r s o n becomes u n c o n s c i o u s I have said
s everal times that pain m o d a l i t i e s , d is co mf o rt , again
d i s a p p e a r very, very quickly, p e r ha ps w i t h i n a second
or five seconds.

In very g e n e r a l terms, ce rt a i n l y m y s e l f - and I have
tried to keep it g e n e r a l - I then said that death - and
I have used the w or d very broadly, as y o u will
a p p r e c i a t e in my pr ev i ou s e v i d e n c e - that dea th occurs
five, ten perhaps f ifteen m i n u t e s after.                   I purposely
kept that very open because hu m a n beings are very
variable.            Y o u c a n n o t say that s o m e b o d y is going to
die in f ifteen minutes, and not in fift ee n minutes.

I am trying to put the con ce p t that a l t h o u g h I have
talked about averages, very o c c a s i o n a l l y y ou are goi ng
to have a d d i t i o n a l extremes.     I think K e v i n was one of
these ex tr e me s that did not fall into this five, ten or
fifteen m i n u t e s e qu e n c e of somatic death, whole body
death, but in fact this was extended.

.Having said that, Kevin had e x t r e m e l y s e v e r e asphyxia.
 I have no do ub t in my own mind that he h a d suffered
 i r r e c ov e ra bl e brain da mage and d e a t h w i t h i n the three
 to six m i n u te s that I said.        T h e r e fo re , I am quite
 c onf id en t at that cime cnat Kevin was d e a d and there is
 n o t hi ng that a n y b o d y on this ea r t h c ou ld have done for
 him af t er that time, including PC B r ud e r and any
 a m b u la nc e p e op le w ho arrived.

Again, you wil l a p p r e c i a t e from wh a t I h av e said to you
that a l t h o u g h Kevin was brain dea d I have not said that
other tissues in the body tnay not have be e n living -
the heart, muscles, nerves.                In fact _I k n o w Dr-
G umoert will e x p l a i n in a m i n u t e that in fact there are
m ec h a n i s m s w h e re b y when oomeDody is b r a i n dead in fact
the musc le s in the body can twitch.                 T h i s will come as
a surprise, and I a p o l o g i s e if it is emotive, this can
even h a pp en to so m eb od y who h a s n' t got a head.           That
person is c l e ar l y dead, they h a v en 't got a head, but
those persons can ac tu al l y have t wi tches in their
muscles.           Th i s is what happened to Kevin.            He died
early - brain d e a t h - but u n f o r t u n a t e l y in this
p ar ticular in s t a n c e we are talking ab ou t an extreme
case where perhaps the heort beating went on for a bit
longer and we not ic ed these twitches, at least PC.
Bruder n o t i ce d these twitches in the body.

 I feel    this    is w h a t   happened     in   the c a s e   of   Kevin.

     yon       had a word with PC B ru de r because you were
     concerned, you wanted to be qu it e sure that you
     understood his evidence personally, so to speak? - A.
     Yes, sir.

0.   In the light of what you heard and what we have heard
     now, do you feel that this lad died, if you like, in
     the totality sense, I don't me a nt that- his skin was
     dead, but in lay terms at the point in time when Mr.
     B ruder was with him? - A. Yes, sir, I am quite
     c onf id en t of that.    When one speaks to lay people who
     h ave experienced people dying, a word w h i c h is
     recurrent in these d es c r i p t i o n s of d e a t h is the way
     that individuals turn grey.             In fact I was very
     impressed by the content in PC B ru der's statement of
     the word "grey", recurring seve ra l times.               To me as a
     d o c t o r that implied that that was the point of whole
     body death.        In fact I feel that it was probably
     around that time that Kevin's w h o l e body died.             His
     brain had died twentv/twenty five min ut es before that
     at the time of' the crusning, but his whole body died at
     the time PC Bruder was w i t h him.

Q. We have menti on e d     these twitches and I think sometimes
  •'they are referred       to as spinal r eflexes? - A. that is
   correct, sir.

          THE CORONER:         Now,   Mr.   Fraser,   is that reasonably
     clear?

          MR. FRASER:   Even to me, sir, thank you,                and I am
     sure it will be clear to the family.

           THE CORONER:        Any questions?

                     Cross-Exa.nined by MR.         LIMB:

Q.    Doctor, it is an emotive subject.                I re member in your
     e v idence about Kevin you d e s c r i b e d    d e a t h in terms of a
     process rather than as a moment? -             A. Yes.

Q.   I would like to ask you a few q u e s t i o n s about the
     process following u n co ns ciousness.      As I understand
     it, in the cases of these victims, u nc onsciousness has
     come ten to twenty seconds after c o m p r e s s i o n of the
     chest? - A. Yes —

Q. That is as a result of oxygen to blood mix leading to
   unconsciousness? - A. Yes.    T h e r e are various...  We
   are now not talking about the a c tu al cause of death,
   but mechanisms.   One very profound vie w that has been
   put forward of crush asphyxia, tr aumatic asphyxia, it
   is not simply only the r eduction of oxygen going to the


                                                                               103
brain, but the fact that in fact there c a nn o t be
circu la t io n through the brain.           The pr e ss ur e from the
chest is reflected up into the brain so in fact
effectively the ce r eb ra l c i r c u l a t i o n stops, so it comes
up against a dead end and it c a nn ot c i r c u l a t e round.
But, yes, your concept then is right.

Following uncons ci o us ne ss , that is to say, twentv
seconds^ say, after the start of the c r u s h becoming^
          is the body c a p a b l e of facial expressions or
cioes it have a neutral e xp re ss i on ? - A. First of all
the word "uncon s ci ou s" itself is a very vague term, as
you probably appreciate.               Th er e are var yi n g degrees of
u n co nsciousness - s u p e r f i c i a l uncons c io us ne s s, perhaps
a sort of sleeping...            You are unconscious, really,
when you are sleeping, and then, of course,
unconsciousness becomes d e e pe r and d e e p e r and deeper.
The deeper bit is when one truly loses pain sensations
and in fact in this p a r t i c u l a r in stance having spoken
both to Dr. Gumpert and, indeed, a co ns ul t an t
anaesthetist, e verybody I have spoken to is confident
that pain mo d alities have d i s a p p e a r e d ver y quickly,
perhaps within one or two seconds, five seconds is the
longest I have heard somebody express.

As I understand your evidence, following that short
period of five, ten, twenty seconds at the most, there
is profound u nc on sc i o u s n e s s rathe r than, say, the
unconsciousness of sleep.              Is the face then of the
unconscious person, the p r o f o u n d l y u nconscious person,
capable of exp re ss i on of any sort, or is there a
neutral expression? - A. I think I prefer to leave that
to Dr. Gumpert bec au s e you are into a c l i n i c a l area
there of what we call reflexes.               I am not trying to
avoid the question.           I think he will be able to give
you a very expert p r o f e s s i o n a l witness reply to that.
Would that be r e a s o n a b l e to you?

       MR. LIMB:    Certainly.          Sir, may I pursue       that
matt e r with Mr. G um pert?

      THE CORONER:       Certainly.       I want to be as
helpful as I can.        It is a d i f fi cu lt subject and in a
sense we are s l o t t i n g it into the inquest of. this poor
boy, but it is a m o r e general topic and it wilij^ot
cuui.se, anply in a sense to everybody* but i don t see
how we can av o id d o i n g it.    Please do pu rsue it with
Dr. Gumpert.

      Thank you,     Dr.   Slater.
           DR.   ERNES T JOHN WALLACE G U M P E R T Sworn

                         By THE C O R O N E R :

 Dr. Gumpert, could you first of all give us your full
 names, qu al i f i c a t i o n s and .appointment? - A. Ernest John
 W a l la ce Gumpert.         I am a Bachelor of M e dicine of the
 U n iv ersity at Cambridge, Bachelor of Surgery of the
 U ni versity of Cambridge.            A Me mber of the Royal
 C ollege of Surgeons and a Fellow of the Royal College
 of Physicians of London.              I am c o n s u l t i n g clinical
 neuro ph y si ologist and consulting ne ur o lo gi st to the
 S h ef fi e ld Area H e a l t h Authority, Teaching.

Dr. Gumpert, a lt h o u g h you are a Shef f ie ld man
professionally, I dragged you bacK. rrom Cambridge
today? - A. Yes, sir.

 W here I tracked you down!            I very m u c h ap p reciate the
 fact you dropped all your other arra ng e me nt s in order
 to be here.         T h a n k you very much.     Dr. Gumpert, you,
 of course, had nothing whatever to do with this case.
 I think you dealt with quite a lot of the injured
 following. HilJ.sborou_gh ana m u e e a you may well know one
'or two people I will be referring to later, but'this
 p a rt icular case was not one you came across.               You have
 heard the evidence which has been put regarding this
 young man.        What I would like you to do now is to give
 us a short explanation, as you see death, in the first
 instance and then we will try and relate it to this
 young man and particularly Mr. Bruder's evidence
 relating to him. - A. In about 1979 or 1980 when it
 became possible to carry out renal transplantations or
 kidney transplantations, it became very important that
 the supply of kidneys of people who had died acutely,
 usually in accidents, could be increased because the
 life of a patient who has had a kidney transplant is
comp le te l y d i f fe re nt to the life of a patient who has
 to have dialysis three times a week.                They can go back
 to normal life.

A hypothesis of brain death was then discussed, agreed
and published.         Thi s consisted of certain examinations
of the back part of the brain, the part we call the
brain stem.         If you imagine the brain as being like a
walnut, and it is, it is like having a carrot stuck
u n d e rn ea th the walnut, and it is the carrot that
matters.         This is where blood pressure, pulse,
respiration and a whole variety of other functions are
controlled.         Once this part of the brain is dead, and
this death occurs, as you heard from Dr. Slater, in
between four and six minutes after depri v at io n of
oxygen, then the person is going to die.          They can be
        /




                              kept alive by ar ti f ic ia l means and some of you may
                              remember the case in A m e ri ca which was kept alive for
                              thirteen and a half years.

                             Some of us were c o n c e r n e d that the gu id elines that were
                             drawn up were not st rict enough and that there was no
                             call for them to be re p e a t e d after a passage of time.
                             Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted in a
                        B    BBC "Panorama" p ro g ra mm e one night at ten o'clock when
                             the medical pr of ession for once ac t ua l l y debated it,
                             eight of us.    As a result of that d e b a t e the
                             regulations were hardened.           They had to be carried out
                             by senior people who wer e used to d o i n g it and they had
                             to be repeated.     A sati sf ac t or y outcome from my
                             personal point of view, a lt ho u g h I don't know whet he r
                             the anguish was w o r t h it really.

                             As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
                             years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
                             procedure many times.        It was part of my professional
                             duty but still to this day I cannot cer ti f y someone
                             dead without being d i s t u r b e d by it still.

                    D        From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
                             experience of brain de a t h and brain damage.              It seems
                             •clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
                             grobablv dead before he was .got out of. th_e area in
                             which he was standing.              I would agree w it h Dr. Slater.
                             I would think c o n s c i o u s n e s s was lost probab l y w i t hi n
                             ten seconds.    I w o u l d say loss of pain would be a lmost
                             instantaneous - not quite, but almost.
                    E
                             I cannot explain the Liverpool Police Constable's term
                             "convulsion" bec a us e to me a c o n v u l s i o n is a major
                             epileptic attack and he has quite clea rl y said he does
                             not mean that, so I don't know what he does mean.              I
                             think it would be w r o n g for me to try and guess what he
                             means.   I think we could accept that he does not me a n
                             any significant movement.

                             Unfortunate ly, after people are brain stem dead, they
                             can tv/itch and very u nnerving it is too.         This is
                             really due to a spina 1 reflex.         What we think happens
                             in anoxia - lack of o xygen - is that the brain stem
                             dies first,    The cor tex, that is the thinking part of
                             the brain, your w a l n u t, probably goes on quite a bit
                             longer and the -p-eriph eral nervous system probably quite
                             a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
                             what has be en d e s c r i b ed by the Liverpool officer.

                        o.   I k now the L i v e r p o o l o f f i c e r in his s u p p l e m e n t a l

        pulse when he ap p r o a c h e d this young man on the pitch,
        would that fit in wit h your understanding...                    Is that
        a possibility? - A. It Is a...pqssibility, sir,                   I would
        like just to observe that feeling the carotid p ul se is
        quite d i f f ic ul t in so m eb od y who has got a low blood
        pressure, as would have been here.                     In fact it can be
        so d i ff ic ul t it is imp os si b le and you have to put an
        e l e c t r o c a r d i o g r a m on to know whet h er the heart has
B       stopped or not.

        I would also like to say something about resuscitation.
        I was very f ortunate whe n I qualified that I b ecame
       house sur g eo n of a famous heart surgeon called Lord
       Brock at Guy's Hospital.           That was in the days when we
       did open c a r d ia c m as sage.    In other words, if somebody
       died you o p e ne d their chest and you massaged their
       heart b e t w ee n your hands.      A terrifying experience.
       It was wh i le I was w o r k i n g for him that one day three
       of us were doing it one m o r n i n g , that he s t o pp ed it,
       and that was the start of external cardiac massage.
       Even to somebody like me who has been doing it for
       twenty-five years, it is still very difficult.              The
       last time I tried to do it I failed completely.              Even
D      to a trained person it is difficult.           Indeed, when
       junior doct or s are ex am in e d for this now, as they are,
       a si gnificant n um be r fail rather than pass.          It is
       quite d i ff i cu lt and for the lay person it must be
       incredibly difficult.

    0. You heard Dr. S l a t e r ' s account of death, shall we say.
       Uould you go along w it h that? - A. I thought it was
       eloquent.   I felt qu i t e nervous!

    0. You m e n t i o n e d this point about unconsciousness and the
       loss of pain and I think you d is t in gu is h slightly
       there.        Can you g i v e me any idea that if a p erson
       becomes u n co nscious, can he feel pain, and for how long
       can he feel pain, in your judgment? - A. Again, Dr.
       Slater put it very clearly.                You all read in the
       newspapers about p a t i e n t s - particularly when they have
       had c a e s a r e a n sections, the ladies as usual - being
       able to tell wha t the doctors were talking about during
       the operation.            A g a i n I have experienced this at first
       hand when I was d o i n g heart surgery because then it was
       often very i m p o rt an t not to depress the state of
       c o n s c io us n es s too far beca u se things were pretty tricky
       anyhow.           When- we used to resuscitate the p a ti en ts we
       used to give them an e le ctric shock.              Lord B r o c k used
       to always shout, " G i v e it two fast ones."            The patient
       would then ask you the following morning two fast ones
       were.         T h e n you wo ul d ask, "Did you hear a n yt hi ng
       else?" and they d idn't, so it is all very much a
       question of degree.

        I think slipping from slight unconsci ou sn es s to d e e p
        u nc onsciousness in this circumstance, one, because of
        the c om pr e ss io n and two b e c a u s e of the asphyxia and
        three because as Dr. S l a t e r again explained ev er yt h in g
        is shoved up into the head and so there is nothing
        moving around, it w o u l d hav e been very quick, a lmost as
        quick as a rabbit p u n c h I wo ul d have thought.

B             T H E CORONER:         Mr.    Fraser?

              MR. FRASER:          No questions,              sir.

                         C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by MR.    LIMB:

    0. Dr. Gumpert you have spoke n in terms of passing in a
       very quick space of time from slight unconscio us ne s s to
       deep un consciousness.       Fo llowing deep unconsciousness,
       do the eyelids remain o pen or are they closed? - A.
       Either may occur.   T h e r e is no pa rt ic ul a r rule. T he
       thing we all see on the cinema of the person going to
       close the dead person's eyes.         I don't think I have
       had to do that more than two or three times in my life.
       Most of the people I h ave seen die have died with their
D      eyes shut.

    0. Deep u n c on s ci ou sn e ss is a s s o ci at e d wi t h no longer
       feeling any pain or discomfort;.                  Is then the face of
       the person who is p r o f o u n d l y unconscious capable of
       grimaces or e x p r e s s i o n s w h i c h might be taken as showing-
       pain or discomfort? - A. Not in my view, sir.

    0. Is it in fact c a p a bl e of any facial expression?                     - A.
       Not in tny view.

    0. Following profound un c o n s c i o u s n e s s , is it right that
       the face will become d i s c o l o u r e d towards the next stage
       of the sequence of events, namely, brain damage and
       thereafter brain death?

             THE CORONER:           C o u l d you repeat             that question?

                MR. LIMB:               I am re f e r r i n g back to the process, or
       the s equences of e v e nt s as outlined by Dr. Slater, sir.
       Firstly, u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s , thereafter brain damage and
       thereafter again br ai n death.                        The nature of my
       inquiry was as to w h e t h e r following profound
       u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s r. a 1 t h o ug h there may be no outward
       expressions there is this chan ge that the face bec om es
       d iscoloured?

              THE CORONER:          T he greyness you are driving at?

              MR.   LIMB:       Sir,    that     is right.

                                                                                        10 4 C
     THE WITNESS:   Are you asking me to say when I
think the greyness came on or just the way it changed?I
cannot tell you when it came on.   I think probably j.t
came on duning the unconscious stage and I don't think
the Face would change when the moment of de at h came,
total somatic death, I don't think there would be any
change.

     MR. LIMB:   Doctor, I am asking whet he r it happens
following the entry into un c o n s c i o u s n e s s towards the
next stage in the sequence, namely, brain damage? - A.
I don't think there is a ch ange of facial ex pr ession at
the time of brain d amage necessarily.               This change of
expression will be a g radually evolving process from
the minute the crush started.

        MR.   LIMB:      T h a n k you,   sir.

     THE WITNESS:   Sir, you cannot tell by looking at
a person that they are dead or unconscious, at least I
can't.   You can by feeling them but you can't by
looking at them.

                      Further by T HE C O R O N E R :

If a person has been, shall we say, s o m a t i c a l l y ‘dead
for long enough, would you accept or would you agree
that sometimes the   face goes paler? - A. Oh, it goes
paler, and becomes   rigid and takes on a stare.            Yes,
that is quite different.

        THE CORONER:           Anything else you wanted        to ask on
that?

        MR.   LIMB:      No,    thank you,       sir.

        MR. CATCHPOLE:           No questions,          sir.

     THE CORONER:           Is        there anything else we want   to
ask Dr. Slater?           (No)

     Ladies and gentlemen, I will give you a chance.
It is emotive but it is also very interesting.   Is
there anything else while we have two experts here?
You have understood it as far as one is able to
understand it?

        THE FOREMAN:'          Yes.

     THE CORONER:     Dr.Gumpert and Dr. Slater,    may I
say to both of you, you have done remarkably well in
explaining what is clearly a very (a) emotive and (b)
difficult subject, succinctly and c l e ar ly to all of us
and I very much a pp reciate your help.     Dr. Slater has
had to come as well, but not quite so far, and I am
very grateful to you for taking the trouble and the
time to come and I am sure it will be of benefit not
just to Kevin's family, but to other pe ople who of
course are involved in this tragedy as well.    Thank
you very mu c h indeed.

     MR. FRASER:    Sir, I will c er t a i n l y make sure that
Kevin's family have the o p p o r t u n i t y to see the
transcript of what the doct or s have said and I am sure
they will feel some b e n e fi t from that when they feel
able to look at it.    T h a n k you, sir.

 0. You were just    talking   and w a i t i n g    for    the m a t c h   to start?
    — A . X5 5 «

   the fact that L iverpool shouldn't lose? - A. Yes.

Q. It happened that you actually saw two of your friends,
   Stuart Thompson and Tony Grier, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. I know what time you said in your statement, but do you
   remember about what time you saw them? -A. well, it was
   pretty full then so we didn't speak to them, we just saw
   them.   They were further up.

0. They were behind you, were they?                - A. Yes.

0. when you saw them can you remember Tony climbing up on to
   a barrier? - A. No.

Q. You don't re member    that?    - A. No.

0. It d o e s n ’t matter, you may not hav e been watching him at
   that particular moment.        Do you remember a beach ball
   being knocked about? - A. Yes.

   Was that at about the same time as you saw Tony- or was                         it
   earlier or later? - A. I can't remember.

Q. Can you remember the players coming on to the pitch,
   pre kick-off? - A. Yes.

0. Were you still in     the same     position?           - A. Yes.

0. At that point, w h a t was it like? - A. Just like a normal
   game, really.    A bit of pushing and that but net bad.

0. Nothing that c o n c e r n e d you at that stage?           - A. No.

0. You of course wer e excited, the match w a s ^ g o m g to^ oegin
   soon, you hoped.      Did you see the kick-orr? - A. Tnev
   were about to k i c k - o f f - I didn't actually^see it because
   of people p u s hi ng about.      You we r e sort or moving round
   everywhere.

0. So when the p l a y er s came out pre kick-off, it was still
   like a normal m a t c h as far as you were concerned? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Just before k i c k - o f f something had happened.   Tell me
   what had h a p p e n e d in that period between the players
   coming out and ki ck-off? - A. Well, there was a bit or
   pushing and m o v i n g round and that, then I don't know.     I
   just don't r e m e m b e r actually seeing any of the game, so I
   obviously can't r e me m b e r seeing the kick-off.
                                                                            A.    DUNCAN


 You say vcu ccr,': remember the game at all?                        - A.    Not
 really.

 Whan the players came cut. which you do remember,                               was
 Kevin still with you? - A. Yes.

What happened to Kevin?   when did you last catch a
glimpse of him? - A. Well, there was a big push forward
and he went off to the right a   bit. He said something,
"It's a bit packad, isn't it?"  Then I didn't see him
after that.

Are you saying vcu            felt a big push then?            - A. Yes.

Where did that push take you?         Did it leave you_ in the
position that you were in,        but more squashed, or did it
move you? - A . It moved you forward anc you were
squashed, but n or m a l l y what would h appen is it w o u l d go
back.   You know, people would         push back.

That's what didn' t happen?                - A. No.

We have tended to use the word "surge", but you can use
"push", it doe sn ' t matter. How many of these pushes did
you feel, just the one or more than one? - A. Well, tnere
was the first one and then it didn't m o v e back and then
another one came, a bigger one.

There was a bigger one after the first one.      Die                         the
first one move b a c k or not? - A. It did slightly.                          It
eased off slightly.

Not as much as you would expect?                    - A. No.

Then the second one was m uch stronger?                      - A.   *es.

But you d o n ' t k n o w w h a t w a s h a c D e n i n g   with    tne game?      - A.
No.

You were fairly n e a r the front.                   Had you seen tr.e gate
which is in the fence? - A. Yes.




fence, for them to open it because they vers getting
crushed.   N o- o ne opened it and then i think some 0 1 -ne
crowd who were in front of it started pushing on it to
get it open and it came open.       Then a few Poli c em en ran
over and shut it again and were leaning on it.        Alter
about five minu t es or so - I think they got it loekee
again, and then a f t e r about five minutes or so one or
them opened it.

To whom it may concern


Dear Sir/Madam

Re Mrs Anne Williams,


I have been asked by my patient, Mrs Anne Williams, to
give my opinion concerning the death of her son Kevin at
the Hillsbrough disaster in 1989.   I can confirm that I
have read the report of the autopsy dated 16 April 1989
and have counselled Mrs Williams regularly since that date.
Mrs Williams has been able to interview witnesses at the scene
of Kevin's death only two weeks ago and was able co discuss with
a Mrs Deborah Martin in decail ahe. final few minutes of Kevin's
life.  I have been asked to give my opinion on whether or not
Kevin was able to utter the word "Mum" following attempted
resuscitation by Mrs Martin of Kevin.   It is. my opinion that from
the given information from Mrs Williams and the detailed report o
the autopsy, it would not be impossible for Kevin to have uttersc
word "Mum" and I have informed Mrs Williams accordingly.


Yours faithfully

         I am a serving Police Officer with Merseyside Police, on Saturday 15th

        April 1989 (150489) I was off duty and went to support Liverpool in

        the match against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Football Ground.

        I want to the game in my own car with my friend

                                    He had bought our tickets for seats in the

        North Stand for #14.00, from Liverpool football club supporters club I

        think.

        We drove to the ground via Huddersfield where I dropped rny sister off

            Polytechnic and then carried on to Hillsborcugh;       On the way to the

        ground there was a short delay at the Manchester Interchange on the

        M52 with rcachvorks-

        Aftar we arrived at Sheffield I went with                   to the Gateway

        store on the continuation of Halifax Road.       This being were we parked

        the car at about 1.10cm (1310).       At the Gateway store there were

        betveen 200-300 Liverpool fans.       We stayed with them and were allowed

        into the store in small numbers to buy drinks. I
                                                       _____ Iand I bought

        four cans of lager between us and then went outside and sat on a

        grass verge together with the other 200-300 fans and we drank t*o cans
 BRUDER                  DEREK    WlLLXAZ-l                                    :


 each.    The group of fans was well behaved and I didn't see any

 drunkeness.     We wsre supervised by a Merseyside and South Yorkshire

 Foiice Officer who were sat on tv»o horses outside the Ccmet

 Superstore.

 Whilst I was sat on this verge everyone was happy and amenable and at

 one point I saw a uniform Superintendent and Chief Inspector WALK past

 us.   Between 1.45pm and 2pm (1345) (1400) the two mounted police

 officers     came over and told us it was getting on and time to make our

 way to the ground.    The whole crowd moved on without any problems at

^^1 . I remenber it was the Merseyside Officer who actually spoke to

 the crowd.

We .valked to the ground and when we got into Leppings Lane itself it

was packed with people even half a mile from the ground itself .

Because of the crowd my friend asked a policenan for directions to

the ground, he was manning a junction either tr*o or three roads up

from the ground off Leppings Lane.        Ke then directed us to go back the

way we had cane and round to the Spion Kcp end.        I didn't think that

was right but followed his directions and walked back the way we had

       and to the Scion Kcp.     This was abcut 2.20pm (1420).

Tte then went to the Spion Kcp but three quarters of the way round on

Fenistene Read I realised we were going totally the wrong way and we

walked back.

The time was getting on new and the walk round was long because a let

of the connecting reads between Leppings Lane and Fenistone Read were

biccxed fcv Police.    Eecause of the time I approached a police officer

on :ne of the barriers and he allowed us to take this short cut when I

explained what had happened and shewed him my police warrant card.        We

arrived back at Leppings Lane at 2.30pm (1430).       When       and I

arrived back at the turnstiles there were no cueues whatsoever and a
   EPCSER                 DEREK   WILLIAM


   large mass of people all trying to gee through the turnstiles and into

  the ground-     It had reached the point of every man for themselves in

  crcar to get to the turnstiles.

  I made for and entered the far left hand side turnstile of turnstiles

  1-15.     There was no police officer by nry turnstile.   Cver to my far

  right I saw a number of police officers on horses.        I could not see

  any police officers on foot but could not say whether this was

  because there were none or they were blocked from my view by the

  crowd.

^^utside the ground my friend had both our tickets and to try and stay

  tocather I had hold of his jeans - ■However, the pushing of the

  people was that much that we were pushed apart and separated.

  Cnca we were apart I decided to make for the turnstile on my cwn.

 David had got in before me and once I reached the turnstile he handed

 my ticket out to me and I was allowed inside.      I handed my ticket into

 the turnstile operator and retained the stub of the ticket.

 I had difficulty in finding the entry point only by the misdirection

 of the police officer, but once I got back into Leppir.cs Lar.e, I found

^j^he turnstile but had difficulties getting in because of the sheer

 nurr.esr of pecple.   At the time of mv entry I saw no gatas cpen other

 than, the turnstiles.    I did not see any of the gates cpen.

 As I was trying to get to the turnstiles I saw about five or si_x

 teenagers climb over a concertina gate immediately to the left of. the

 turnstiles.    After the first five or six vent ever I saw a number of

 cthsrs climb to the tcp of this gate but then drop back into the crowd

 outside as if there was someone in authority cn the inside telling

 the.-n to get back.

 Cnca |       [
              and I had got into the ground I saw a police sergeant and

 four constables irnnediately behind the concertina gate where I had
                            DEEEK   WILLIAM                                        l




  «*--n the teenagers climb over.       I approached   the sergeant and said

 ,=e r r   aching along the lines of "I am a Police Officer from Merseyside,

 the res a huge crowd outside and they're pushing to get in, can ycu do

 southing about it or get semething done?”.            At this time, I was with

             [but I did not produce my warrant card or formally identify

 mysslf. He made no reply to me and by this time it was close to

 kick off time so I left it at that.

 One2 inside the ground I saw no direction signs to my seat in the

 North stand and had difficulty in finding it because the sections of

Seating were given letters of the alphabet, however, the letters did

 not follow alphabetical order ie ABFDGCM, though I can't remember the

exert order.

I entered the North Stand through a tunnel, there was no crowd within

this tunnel and no problens at all.           I saw no Police within the

tunnel and only a few stewards right at the beginning.

Once inside the ground I saw no alcohol being drunk at all.

I trok mv seat along with              just as the two teams came out onto

the pitch.        This was about 2.57 pm (1457).     Once through the

^tur.nel and up the stairs, I went to the section of my seats where two

ste.vards directed us to our particular seats. These were right by the

entrance to this section of seating.           People continued to enter after

me and after abcut ten minutes between ten and twenty people arrived

at this entrance and didn't appear to have tickets for this stand.             I

actually saw tAO people holding tickets which were for the West

Stand.        This was after the incident in pens 3 and 4 and people had

started to come cut onto the pitch.           Everyone started to discuss what

was going cn and these two men said that they should be in these pens

anc shewed the tickets which were complete without the countertoil

being removed.

   -r .=i-rperier.csd   no personal crowd crush within the ground only that

  cuc5ice    which was about 2.45 pm (1445) . I did not see any crowd

  surge within the ground and was not injured.

  At about the time these men had appeared at the entrance to my section

  of seating which was three quarters of the way along the Ndrth Stand
  nearest to the Spion Kop about ten rows fron the front, I saw people

  cli.ubing ever the fences frcm pens three and four of the Leppings Lane

  stand frcm kick off but initially they rere directed behind hoardings

       sat near to the pitch.         I   could not see whether they vrere directed
 by stewards or Police.

 Aftar about five minutes a Police officer ran on to the pitch and

 stepped the game.         People then began to climb over the front fencing

 onto the pitch at will and I could also see people pulled up into the

 seating area above.         At   no point did I see any gates opened to allow

 escape frcm the pens.

 Cnee play had been stopped the Nottingham Forest fans in the Spion Kcp

 began to taunt the Liverpool Supporters.

 A fan then ran onto the pitch and then ran up to the Spicn Kcp and

J ^ c a n shouting and iraking 'V' signs with tvvo fingers at the Forest

 supporters. Myself and other fans in the North stand began to shcut

 telling him to co away because we could see there was something wrong

 in the Leppincs Lane end.          This man who was in his early twenties with

 long hair and a black capped sleeve T shirt was then turned back by

either st^vards or Police and ran back towards Leppincs Lane but was

detained by Police before he got back.

Another older man then ran up to the Spicn Kcp and then began to wave

his hands at the Forest fans.             He wasn't taunting, he was signalling

for them to calm down and tryinc to tell them there was seme thing

wrcng. Shortly after this the Police formed a cordon across the
                        DEREK WILLIAM                                         6


  -.■-.■av line.   I'm not sure if this was after the first cr second man.

 P^-cle in the Leppincs Lane end then ripped dcwn advertising hoardings

 ar.c fcecan to carry people cn them up towards the c o m e r formed by the

 Scion Kcp and the North Stand.    I could see that sane of then were

 presumed dead as they had coats over their faces and one man in

 particular had a jumner pulled back to cover his face.     These people

wera then rolled onto the pitch and the carriers went back for more

pecole or bodies.

The police then formed a further cordon in front of the North stand.

Around the same time a number of people wearing tracksuit trousers arid

sweatshirts came frcm the direction of the players tunnel and went to

the Spion Kcp end.     They then pulled dcwn more hoardings here and went

to help carry more people up from Leppings Lane.

A number of people v«re also carried up to the c o m e r in front of me

bccily. 'There were a large number of people in this c o m e r either

laid out behind the police on the pitch or sitting with their heads in

their hands.

I cid not see any of the Folice in the cordon in front, of the North

Stand break ranks to assist these people.

I saw one person cn the pitch about a quarter of the pitch length away

frc.n the Spion Kcp abcut twenty feet frcm the hoardings in front of

the Ndrth stand.     I distinctly remenber this because later cn as I

will describe an ambulance drove directly past us and a St John's

Ambulance man who was with me tried to flag it dcwn but it carried cn.

I am not sure if this man had been carried on a hoarding or by his

friand who was with him.    I saw this man lying cn the floor having

convulsions.

The Folice cordon in front of the North Stand appeared unconcerned and

'smarmy', this agitated the supporters in the stand who were shouting

 -for then to go and help the people on the pitch.    None of the Police

 officers left the cordon.

 I w=s very close to the pitch so I -went dcwn the aisle, over a small

 fiva foot wall with hoaniings cn, I walked through the cordcn without

 being challenged at all and then went to the man having convulsions.

 Alirost imnediately I was joined by a St John's Ambulance man.     I

 identified myself to the St Johns man as an off duty Police Officer.

 He then said to me " You do mouth to mouth and I'll do heart massage".

 I then took his pulse in his neck.     I could feel a slight pulse.     I

bien ccntnenced mouth to mouth resuscitation and the St John's man

started heart massage.     I undid two buttons on the top of the man's

shirt.     If I remember rightly the bottom of the shirt appeared

ripped.

We continued to work on the man but after about five minutes he went

grey and his face was withdrawn.     As I had approached the man his head

hac moved as if he was being sick.     When I got to him I cleared his

rrcuth and the beck of his threat of vcmit before ccrrmencing mcuth to

mouth resuscitation. There was no bleed in the ^vemrtrr^Aftsr abcut

^fiva minutes when the man went grey, a ^yery distinctij&--sinell came

frc.Ti his mcuth.   I can still rsnerber it new but. cculd net describe

it.

Aftar abcut seven minutes I swapped places with the St John's

Ambulance man and he ccirmenced mcuth to mcuth and I heart massage.          As

I cid heart massage his ribs were unnaturally prominent in the whcle

of his rib cage even thcuch he was cnly thinly built.     His stomach

was depressed and abnormal!1/ lev.er than his ribcace.

Aftar a short time I undid the button cn his trousers and ripped cpen

the zip.    I then continued heart massage.

Shortly afterwards an ambular.ee entered the ground.     It appeared to be
   BFLOEH                  DEREK WILLIAM


   a Haalth Authority ambulance as opposed to St Johns.      It began to-

   drive dcwn towards Leppings Lane.     I then told the St John's man to

   try and stop it.     He tried to flag it dcwn but it continued on as if

   it had been ordered not to stop in the top corner but to go to the

   Leppings Lane end.

  The St John's man then rejoined me and continued to give mouth to

  mouth resuscitation.

  Shcrtly after this we were joined by one of the men I described

  earlier in the tracksuit trousers and I think green sweatshirt.       He

^P^skad me if I was all right and knew what I was doing.                     *-

  I said "I'm an off duty bobby, i'm all right", with that he left as if

  to go somewhere where he could be of more use with other injured

  persons.

  Shcrtly after this man, which must have been about six minutes since I

  hac chanced places with the St Johns man, a fstale St Johns Ambulance

  officer came over and pushed me out of the way and took over frcm me.

  I then steed up and watched as she was obviously better trained in

  First Aid than me.

 ^1 then steed by the injured man together with his friend who had been

  there all along, telling us to keep going and not to let his mate die.

  Within two minutes of this, the St Johns Ambulance man told the St

  Johns Ambulance v^man, "He's gone", and steed up.     I looked at the

 man's friend who was standing by his head, he was completely grey.

 By this time, I felt ill mvself and just turned away as there was

 nothing else I could do.

 I would describe the man who died as:- between 17 and       20 years of age,

 approx 5'8 - 5'9 tall, short sandy cr reddish coloured hair, slim

 build, no facial hair, white eurcpean, I cculd see no cuts cr

 abrasions cn him.      I seem to remenber freckles cn his   cheeks, but I'm
                      DEREK    WILLIAM                                        -

 rcc sure if it could have been vcmit, I'm almost positive it was

 freckles.   As I said previously he had an unusually prominent rib cace

anc depressed stomach.

Ke was wearing a light, possibly white button up shirt, light grey or

beige cotton trousers, light coloured boxer shorts.       I noticed no

jewellery cr footwear.

His friend I would describe as 21 or 22 years of age, dark brcwn hair,

shortish hair, about 5'9 tall.     I cannot remember much of his clothing

but he appeared quite plump with a slight beer belly.        He had no

^facial hair nor glasses.                                                ..

The St John's man was in uniform, 'the only thing I can rsnenber was

that he had dark hair and was thirty plus years of ace.

The St John's wcman was in uniform again very slimly built and no

older than 18 years of ace/
                          7
After the St John's man had said the man was dead I'd seen enough,

I felt ill and had to get out of the ground.    I knew         H would have

stayed where he was because he knows no First Aid.       I went ever to the

wall where I had climbed in.    As I got there I saw a photographer

knee line dcwn with an orance tabard he was taking pnctccraphs of the

injured ana evmg.

A fan who was already on the pitch went over to him and said "Fuck

off, you're taking pictures of my injured mates".

The photographer carried cn taking pictures so the fan started pushing

him.   The photographer steed up and the fan then pushed him back to

the wail and tried to take the camera from him.     The camera then swung

anc smashed into the wall.     I then climbed over the wall using the

photographers case as a step.    I then rejoined         I

Ke said to me "Cane on we're going", and we both then left.        I cannot

sav what time this was.

   WhlLsz at Hillsborough the only criminal offences were of a minor

   pubiic order nature ie, the fans climbing over the gates etc.      After

   the disaster within the stand, I saw a number of instances such as

   the photographer's camera and sausage rolls thrown at the cordon in

   front of the North Stand and one old man who threw a cup of tea at an

   officer in the cordon.

   This was caused purely by agitation amongst the crowd by the apparent

   callousness of the photographer and apparent inactivity of the police

   with regard to the injured and dying.

^ ^ 1 witnessed no serious offences.                                     ..

  There were a number of factors which I believe contributed to the

  nurrber of deaths and injuries.

  Outside the ground there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

  between the mounted and foot police officers.       The approach roads to

  the around were well manned with Police officers at junctions and

  outside pubs and off licences.       However, I made a caiment about being

  misdirected by the police officer to another officer and he said it

  was understandable because a let of the officers were drafted in frcm

^outside stations and had pocr local knowledge of the area.       This may

  have contributed to the build up outside the ground which caused the

  initial crush outside.

  Insice the ground once the disaster had occurred there appeared a lack

  of rc-ordination between sender police officers and lower ranks cn the

  pitch.   The actual scale of the incident wasn't appreciated

  iirirediately which resulted in a delay in the response and personnel

  being despatched to deal with it.

  Frcrt my own personal experience I and most Folice officers have only

  basic First Aid knowledge.       When I administered first aid to the man I

  felt totally inadequate cn reflection. However with that particular




                                                                                    4

          rras., I don't think mere knowledge would have helped tut it micnt have

          in others.

          I   would also like to add that though the Folice in the cordon did not

          assist the injured and dying I saw a number of other officers who did.

          In particular two small policewomen who tried to help a very large man

          but couldn't carry him until helped by fans.

  I am a single man and joined Merseyside Police on 27 October *957.                                                                   Cur

  initial training at Bruche District: Training Centre, Wcrringtcn, I rec = ived

  basic first aid resuscitation in both theoretical and practical

  application.           I obtained a pass and was issued with an identifying cart

  qualifying me for, I think, 2 or 3 years.                                            Cn 15 April 1989 I had recei v ec

  no further instruction or refresher training in basic first aid.                                                                Hcwev

  as a direct result of the situation I found myself in on the day of the

  disaster I personally felt inadequately equipped in either thecry-cr

 practise of first aid.                    I am absolutely satisfied that the first aid I

 rendered in terms of mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage wer

 correct and that I could have done no more, but, nevertheless,                                                                I felt I

 didn't know enough and regretted not having taken that aspect c: initia

 I will now deal with a nunber of specific points from my criminal state

 (27.^ -S9 ) using the page numcers cf that statement.                                                I understand that

refer to him being "on the fleer", meaning the pitch surface, and "havi.

convulsions".           I have thought accut this carefully today and with the a

benefit cf my training T can say that this was net a process that laste-

for any time.           It certianly w a s n ’t anything similar to an epileptic fit

for example.          It was an impression that 1 had which I originally asscci;

with the lad vomitting.                    I will say that I did net see the casualty vemi

nor did I see any sick cn the body cr grassed area around him.                                                             I will

 I car.r.cc reconcile the time secuer.ces and I am still sure that I die see

 ameulance, distinguish in my own mind that it was nos cf St Johns but

Health Authority and that I told the St Johns man with me tc step the

ambulance.                     I have considered that what I referred to may have been this

ambulance exiting from the stadium but I don't think it was.                                                                             My

recollection is still that it was entering the stadium.




I refer to being joined by a woman St Johns Ambulance Officer who pushed me

out cf the way.                             I recollected this to have been abcut 6 minutes after I

had changed places'with the male St Johns Officer.                                                                  That makes a total,

from recollection, of 13 minutes joint resuscitation with the St J o h n s

male.           I would standby these estimates only in as much as I feel we

attempted resuscitation for between 10 and 15 minutes. Within a further two

minutes cf both St Johns people working together the man declared " H e ’s

gene" and steec up.                                 I referred te anc re-affirm that he was "completely

grey" and there is absolutely nc ccubt in my mine, both new with the

benefit of further training,                                       and then at that moment.                           that tr .e youth a hat

I                 traffic outside the main entrance gates for the NCTTS FCREST fans.

■far. 3 and Notts Forest, who v^rs obviously drunk, although at this

 stage they were behaving reasonably.

 At about 2.45pm (1445) I started to make my way to the LEPPING3 LANE

 entrance, as I passed what I think is the main entrance to ^the SPICN

KOF, the turnstiles were shut dcwn.

At about 2.50pm (1450) there was trouble at these turnstiles when the

Notts Forest fans, realising they were being locked out, were trying

any way they could to get in, this included paying money to the

turnstiles stewards and trying to buy tickets fran the touts.        The

crc-vd became very abusive and angry and I had to assist in the

removal of fans from the ground.. . I was cn the read side and the

police inside were passing fans back out over the turnstiles and

there was a very large number of fans trying to get in still, so much

that mounted officers and their horses were being pushed up against

the wall.   The next thing I knew is a large blue gate was opened and

a large majority of the crowd pushed their way into the ground.           I

found myself being carried along with the crowd unable to resist.             A

mounted officer grabbed my collar but had to let go, because he wculd

have been pulled from his horse.     I got pushed to the floor, but I

managed to cet back to my feet by pulling myself up a man's back.             I

then remaxber opening my eyes and finding myself inside the ground,

at the bottom of the Spion Kcp and the Gates had been shut behind____

me.   I asked the steward on the gate to let me out. but at first he

refused, it was only when a mounted officer, the   Scire?   one who hac

triad to help me a few moments earlier, put his horse up against the

gata, he opened it a short way and let me out.

Cnee cuts ide I found myself surrounded by drunken fans, screaming

abuse, and the area covered by police.    An officer used my radio to

try and call for back ud but to no avail because the cnannel was

      full cf static.    My radio was handed back to me and I ran to the

      Let nines Lane end of the ground.    Ambulances and police cars were

      rushing tc that end of the ground.    When I get to the Leppings Lane

      enc of the grcund I saw a vast crowd outside the turnstiles trying

      to get in, it must have been abcut four times larger than the crcwri

      I laft at the other end, so that would mean the crowd at the Spicn

      Kcp end numbered abcut 1000 plus and I would estimate about 4000

      outside Leppings Lane end.

      I can't really remember hew, but scmehow I got inside the ground,          I
                                                                                 i
      throuch the laroe blue gate which was open, and I ended      ud   on the   j .

     pitch.     I did not go through the tunnel.

     One a cn the pitch I saw a lot of people who were obviously injured

     and I can rensnber a man coning up to me shouting, "THERE'S 1WD DEAD

     YOU BASTARD".    I then saw people who appeared to be dead.        People

     wera screaming and shouting and ambulances were driving onto the pitch

     I assisted ether police officers with dead and injured people and

     helced to take them on stretchers to the gym, and I can rsnerber

     seeing officers frcm E2 (WXDSEATS) everywhere.

     I tcck abcut 6 dead to the gym, as well as many injured and whilst I

^    was trying to revive a ycung bey I rerember something hitting me cn

     the back cf mv head, but I didn't really notice until much later when

     I ftunc a larce swellinc.     I cculd see many bodies being put cn the

     pitch, seme cf them appeared to be dying.     I lost count of the number

     cf bodies I helped carry into the gym.

     I helced carry a ycung bey into the gym frcm the pitch nearry. He

     stccced breathing so I cave him the kiss of life, and heart massage             j

 would describe him as white male, 5 '6-5 '7, 14-15 .yrs, slim build and

 brcvn hair, with a cut under his chin.     He had slightly crooked

 teeth, there were no other marks cn the body.     He was wearing a white

shirt, green sweat shirt, beige trousers, white seeks, white Reetcks

and green and white bcxer shorts.      He had a gold metal chain with a

gold horn, a bus ticket, a train ticket and an entrance ticket.       He

had no identification or money.      I later found cut the number given

to this boy was 51.

I stayed with the bedy and at 5.20am (0520) Sunday 16 April

(160489) an ambulance arrived and I went with the bedy together with -

      PCNT and GRIFFITHS to the Medico Legal Centre, WATER LANE,

Sheffield.     I stayed with the body until he was stripped and details

taksn frcm ire.   I finally went off duty at 6-30 (0630) cn Sunday

16 April 1989 (160489).

At about 6.30pm (1830) Monday 8 May 1989 (080589) I saw

anc           frcm West Midlands Police at my heme.   PC ? shewed to me a

partially carpleted report of death form that I identified as being

the form I filled in whilst in charge of the fccdv, details of name

anc other personal details are missing because there had teen no

identification mace by the time I went heme.     All I can say is this

fcr.Ti relates to tcdy 51.   I new knew this is Kevin David WILLIAMS,

b. 27.5.73 (27051973) cf 4 Whitehcuse Avenue, Formbv, Merseyside.

     _n _ r was in a state of shock.       I didn't knew whan to do but irry

 nat-irai instinct,   whs   to help these people in the best way that I could.

 I can't describe to you in any detail my exact movements over the next

 half an hour cr so.        I know that I approached several people lying cn

 the pitch and assisted if possible.       I did not give any of these

 people mouth-to—mouth or heart massace.

 I dacided that there were enough people dealing with the situation

at the Leppincs Lane end of the ground and made my way to the Spicn

Kcp end of the ground.

I could see that bodies were being carried from the Lecpings Lane end

   the Spion Kcp end of the ground and then being placed on the pitch.

I assisted to carry a number of dead and injured people fron the Spicn

Koc end of the pitch, into the gymnasium where a temporary mortuary

had been set up.      I was talking to seme of these people, comforting
                                                                 *
them and trying to reassure then.        I am unable to describe any of

the~e people in the detail.

By this time I really was in a state of shock, I couldn't believe what

I vias seeing.   I sesned to te on automatic pilot.      My memories are

very confused and distorted.

  can recall carrying a youth who I now knew to te, Kevin Daniel

WILLIAMS frcm the pitch to the gymnasium.        He was the last person that

I assisted in carrying.        I first saw Kevin WILLIAMS lying cn the pitch

near to the goal area at the Spion Kcp end of the ground.         At that

stage he wasn't on a hoarding or a stretcher.

I ramenber that there were several people around where he was lying.

I can't recall anyone giving him mouth to mcuth.        With the help of

othar people, who I can't recall, Kevin WILLIAMS was placed cnto a

hoarding and carried into the gymnasium.        Someone instructed me to

stay with the body.




                                                                                   5
 I didn't knew what to do.    I didn't want to believe the boy was dead.

 I didn't knew if he was dead or not but I decided that I had gotto

 atsennt to revive him.    I started to give him mouth-to-routh but

 scir.acne, I don't knew who, tcuched me cn the shoulder and told me he

was dead.     By this time my head had gone,   I wasn't awareof what I was

doing or what was really happening.

At 16.06 hours {1606) Dectcr CURPEN examined Kevin WILLIAMS and

certified him dead.

I remember a detective officer,                     helping me to

ccrrolete the GEN 18 form (sudden death form).

I stayed with the bedy until the early hours of Sunday 16th April

(160489) when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not

been identified, to the Medico Legal Centre.

I identified the body by the number allocated, which in the case was

Nurrcer 51.   I had no further dealings with Kevin WILLIAMS.

This statement is made to the best of my recollection and I believe it

to be the truth.    However, under the circumstances I cannot be

positive that the details are accurate.    I have been quite badly

aff acted by the whole incident and I am trying to erase it frcm rrtv

merory.

I have marked cn a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M. 1) the

acrroximate location where I first came into contact with the

deceased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS.

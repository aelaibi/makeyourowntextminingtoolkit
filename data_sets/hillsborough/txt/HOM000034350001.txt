   I am currently working as a Senior House Officer in Anaesthetics. I qualified in Medicine in 1986,

   and since August of 1988, I have been on the Trent Regional Health Authority anaesthetics

   rotation.



   At the time of the incident in question I was employed as an Anaesthetist at Rotherham District

   General Hospital.



   On the afternoon of Saturday April 15th, I was off duty. I returned home from walking the dog at

   around 3.00 pm           I turned on the television to see crowd disturbance at the Hillsborough Football

   Ground. The match appeared to have been abandoned, and the television coverage ceased. I

   listened briefly to a local radio station, who were also reporting a disturbance at the ground



   As I am familiar with the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, I decided to make my way there

    in case I could be of assistance in the event of casualties being received.



    Due to the location of my house, I almost immediately encountered an ambulance, which I

    assume was on its way to the ground.                        It had its lights & siren on, and I followed immediately

    behind it, with my headlights on.

        Continuation of Statement /Interview Of DR EDW ARD C WALKER



         As it passed the Herries Rd. entrance, I turned off into the Northern General Hospital.



         I entered the Accident & Emergency Department to be told that a Paediatric "cardiac arrest" was

         expected (via Ambulance Control), and that there was an incident of some kind at the

         Hillsborough stadium. No-one in the department was aware that these two pieces of information

         were related.




  ♦
         The first casualty arrived within two or three minutes. I believe this patient to be a boy I know

         only as "Lee”, who I believe was declared “Brain dead" on the Intensive Care Unit (ITU) the

         following Monday.



          He was in Cardiopulmonary arrest, with fixed, dilated pupils. I intubated him, established venous

          access, and instigated routine resuscitative measures.           His heart had stopped beating, but we

          managed to re-establish him in normal rhythm



          Whilst I and another doctor were treating Lee, the second victim arrived             He was of similar age

          (around 1 2 - 1 4 years), with blond hair. He was also in Cardiopulmonary arrest. I intubated him.

          and noticed evidence of gross inhalation of stomach contents.                He also had marked gaseous

          abdominal distension, possibly indicating that he had had "mouttvto-mouth" resuscitation at some

          time.



          I also established venous access, and gave appropriate drugs. This boy was also established in

          a normal sinus heart rhythm, but his pupils were fixed and dilated throughout, and I believe he

          has since died.



          These two boys had taken up the space immediately available in the resuscitation area, and the

           next patient I dealt with was in the A & £ Department Theatre.

           This patient was aged around twenty, with fair hair, of slim build. He was cerebrally irritable, but

            not actually fitting,   l was able to intubate him without any drugs, and left him in the care of

           another doctor,



            I next saw another unconscious, cerebrally irritable patient, with shoulder-length brown hdir. and

            aged around twenty.       I judged his airway to be adequate, and left him in the care of a non­

            medical member of staff.


      »     The next patient I dealt with was in Cardio-Pulmonary arrest.                   He was aged around twenty, of

            stocky build, with ginger hair. I intubated him, and gave appropriate drugs down the endotracheal

            tube, as he did not have any venous access. I was assisted by a doctor of around my own age

           from the football ground       I never discovered his name.



            I resorted to a central venous line via the Right subclavian route in this patient. W e got his heart

            beating in a normal rhythm, and he was ventilated adequately.



            However, he re-arrested on two distinct occaisions, and developed brzzare E.C.G. complexes,

            with a very poor output At this stage I took the decision to abandon resuscitative measures on

            this patient.



            I next saw a patient of around forty, with thinning hair and of heavy build                      He was having

            Cardiopulmonary resuscitation from another doctor. I intubated the patient to help with this.



            I then was asked to see a boy of around fifteen with black hair, who had already had resuscitative

            treatment.       He was however fitting, and had a poor airway.                   I gave this boy appropriate

            anaesthetic drugs to sedate and paralyse him, intubated him, and transferred him to the I T U                           I

            believe he has since made a good recovery

   f then performed a virtually identical procedure on a boy of similar age with light brown hair.

   I transferred him to the I.T.U. also. I do not know what has happened to this boy.



   I was then briefly involved with a male of around thirty in the resuscitation room. He had already

   had considerable effort put into his resuscitation, but was still asystoiic (ie his heart was not

   beating). I placed a central venous line on this patient. I believe resuscitative measures on this

   patient were abandoned.



 ^ t h e n went to Ward 60, and performed rapid sequence inductions and intubations on two

   patients who had deteriorated neurologicaliy. I transferred these patients to the Cardiac Intensive

   Therapy Unit.



   I later dealt with a female patient who came into the A & E department having "arrested".                 She

   was not from the Hillsborough ground. She was transferred to the l.T.U.



   This, I believe, covers the bulk of the work I did on the day of the disaster



    I left the Northern General hospital at around 9 00 p.m.

               resuscitation.               There is definite oost mortem evidence of intensive resuscitation
               attempts.
               99.       PHILIP STEELS
                         There is no evidence in the medical record nor any evidence from the post
                         morterc findings that Mr. Steele received any resuscitation.                                                                                    I think .it
                         likely that he was triaged                             as dead.


               119.      ARTHUR HOBBOCKS
      I)                 There is no evidence in the -nedical record of any resuscitation attempts
                         and there is no evidence in the post mortem findings of any resuscitation
                         attempts-            I therefore think it likely that Mr. Horrocks was triaged as
                         dead.


               In summary. there is definite evidence both from the hospital records and post
               norten reports that six patients received resuscitation attempts.                                                                                      In a further
               three patients there us some evidence that the patients nay have received some
               resuscitation attempts.                         In f or patients there is no evidence of resuscitation
               and it is likely that these oatients were triaged to the mortuary on arrival
               at the Accident and Emergency Deoartment.


                I feel it may be helpful to stive a brief summary of our exDerience of traumatic
               asphyxia.            Traumatic asohy^i?. is a fairly uncommon condition, normally occurring
                in sporadic cases, either in car accidents, or heavy injury.                                                                                There are a
               number of well documented ins;tances where large numbers of people have died
                in crowds as a result of traumatic asphyxia.                                                        Such events are fortunately
                rare.           The Northern General Hospital Accident and Emergency Department
                admitted           fifteen cases of severe traumaticasphyxia within a space of one

                hour on the 15th April. and. .t;his.is. in additi.Qn .tp. the. P&Uftftts .mentioned, .ab-ove.

^J^ignature E C W alker..................................




  I am currently working as a Senior House Officer in Anaesthetics, i qualified in Medicine in 1986,

  and since August of 1988, I have been on the Trent Regional Health Authority anaesthetics

   rotation.



   At the time of the incident in question I was employed as an Anaesthetist at Rotherham District

   General Hospital.



   On the afternoon of Saturday April 15th, I was off duty. I returned home from walking the dog at

   around 3.00 pm           I turned on the television to see crowd disturbance at the Hillsborough Football

   Ground       The match appeared to have been abandoned, and the television coverage teased                                              I

   listened briefly to a local radio station, who were also reporting a disturbance at the ground



   As l am familiar with the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, I decided to make my way there

   in case I could be of assistance in the event of casualties being received.



   Due to the location of my house, I almost immediately encountered an ambulance, which I

   assume was on its way to the ground.                       It had its lights & siren on, and I followed immediately

   behind it, with my headlights on.

           As it passed the Herries Rd, entrance, I turned off into the Northern General Hospital.



           I entered the Accident & Emergency Department to be told that a Paediatric "cardiac arrest" was

           expected (via Ambulance Control), and that there was an incident of some kind at the

           Hillsborough stadium. No-one in the department was aware that these two pieces of information

           were related.



  ^ ^ T h e first casualty arrived within two or three minutes. I believe this patient to be a boy 1 know

    y only as "Lee", who 1 believe was declared "Brain dead" on the Intensive Care Unit (ITU) the

           following Monday.



           He was in Cardiopulmonary arrest, with fixed, dilated pupils. 1 intubated him, established venous

           access, and instigated routine resuscitative measures.          His heart had stopped beating, but we

           managed to re-establish him in norma! rhythm.



           Whilst I and another doctor were treating Lee, the second victim arrived            He was of similar age

           (around 1 2 - 1 4 years), with blond hair. He was also in Cardiopulmonary arrest. I intubated him.

           and noticed evidence of gross inhalation of stomach contents.               He also had marked gaseous

           abdominal distension, possibly indicating that he had had "mouttvto-mouth” resuscitation at some

           time.



           I also established venous access, and gave appropriate drugs. This boy was also established in

           a norma! sinus heart rhythm, but his pupils were fixed and dilated throughout, and i believe he

           has since died.



           These two boys had taken up the space immediately available in the resuscitation area, and the

            next patient I dealt with was in the A & E Department Theatre.

  This patient was aged around twenty, with fair hair, of slim build. He was cerebrally irritable, but

  not actually fitting.   I was able to intubate him without any drugs, and left him in the care of

  another doctor.



  I next saw another unconscious, cerebrally irritable patient, with shoulder-length brown hair, and

  aged around twenty.       I judged his airway to be adequate, and left him in the care of a non­

  medical member of staff.



^ ^ h e next patient I dealt with was in Cardio-Pulmonary arrest.      He was aged around twenty, of

  stocky build, with ginger hair. I intubated him, and gave appropriate drugs down the endotracheal

  tube, as he did not have any venous access        I was assisted by a doctor of around my own age

  from the football ground    I never discovered his name.



   t resorted to a central venous line via the Right subclavian route in this patient. W e got his heart

   beating in a normal rhythm, and he was ventilated adequately.



   However, he re-arrested on two distinct occaisions, and developed bizzare E.C.G. complexes,

   with a very poor output. At this stage I took the decision to abandon resuscitative measures on

   this patient.



   I next saw a patient of around forty, with thinning hair and of heavy buiid           He was having

   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation from another doctor. I intubated the patient to help with this.



   i then was asked to see a boy of around fifteen with black hair, who had already had resuscitative

   treatment.      He was however fitting, and had a poor airway.          I gave this boy appropriate

   anaesthetic drugs to sedate and paralyse him, intubated him, and transferred him to the I T (J      I

   believe he has since made a good recovery

       I then performed a virtually identical procedure on a boy of similar age with light brown hair.

       I transferred him to the I.T.U. also. I do not know what has happened to this boy.



       I was then briefly involved with a male of around thirty in the resuscitation room. He had already

       had considerable effort put into his resuscitation, but was still a systolic (ie his heart was not

       beating). I placed a central venous line on this patient. I believe resuscitative measures on this

       patient were abandoned



         then went to Wand 60, and performed rapid sequence inductions and intubations on two

       patients who had deteriorated neuroiogicaiiy. I transferred these patients to the Cardiac Intensive

       Therapy Unit.



        I later dealt with a female patient who came into the A & E department having "arrested". She

       was not from the Hillsborough ground. She was transferred to the I.T.U.



        This, I believe, covers the bulk of the work I did on the day of the disaster



        I left the Northern General hospital at around 9 00 p.m.

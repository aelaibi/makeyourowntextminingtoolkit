            COMPARED WITH OTHER FOOTBALL TEAM SUPPORTERS



            I've had no problems with Liverpool      or Forest fans.   Even the

            Forest fans we turned away were O.K. about      it.   The only team we

            shut for is Newcastle because they have caused trouble       in the

            past,   before   I took over this pub.

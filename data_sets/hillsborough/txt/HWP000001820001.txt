     Dear Colin

     Hillsborough Disaster W orking Party Meeting

     ThatUt you for your letter dated 23 February 1998 inviting me to the meeting of the Working
     Party on Friday.
      Unfortunately, due to the short notice and long standing commitments I have, I am unable to
      attend the meeting.

      As you are aware, I was at Hillsborough on that terrible day and I am bitterly disappointed at
      the decision not to have a further Public Inquiry.

      I will continue to do what I can to support the families in their campaign for justice. I would
      be happy to have a meeting with representatives of the families and the Working Party tn
      discuss what I can do to help.

      Please pass on my apologies.

      Yours sincerely,




      oÂ§)             dt      .

^^     Derek Twigg

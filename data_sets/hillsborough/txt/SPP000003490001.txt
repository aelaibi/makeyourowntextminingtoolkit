Dear M i s s . Steel,

Re: Release of Witness Statements.

Thank you for your letter of the 5th of November.                   I am sorry about the delay
in replying.

I note that you are restricting your request to witness statements of your
clients together with thoso statements of witnesses who have given a signed
authority for release to a particular solicitor.

Speaking for myself, I do not have any particular objection to copy
statements of this nature being released to the solicitor concerned, though I
must say that just at the moment, we may be physically unable to comply with
any requests.

I suggest that if you can write to the West Midlands Police with the names of
the people who you have in mind.  They will then look into the matter, and no
doubt will deal with it as far as they can.


Yours sincerely,




S .L .Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

P.S. dated 14.11.90.
I have just noticed that the date shown above is incorrect and should of
course have read 13.11.90.  I am very sorry about the mistake.  Please
correct your copy.

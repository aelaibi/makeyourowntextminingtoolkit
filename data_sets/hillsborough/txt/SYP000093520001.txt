                       At 3=25 pm (1325)        on Saturday 15th April      1989 (15041989)   I attended at

                       the Leppings Lane end ofyni/1 Isborough Football Ground in company with

                       other members of my u n / t ,



                                 rival*! entered the gates and saw about 6 bodies laid on the
                                    yf
                                     th clothing wrapped around their h e a d s , numerous people

                       appeare'd to be injured.



                       There were a number of people walking around in the area behind the

                       turnstiles r the majori ty of which appeared the worse for drink and

                       were acting extremely aggressively towards u s , being abusive and

                       threatening violence towards us.




                                                                                              &

                                                                                               S3778

         I then assisted other officers                  c !rry the body of a male outside      into

         Leppings Lane to the fleet                        balances.



         A t 3 . 4 0 pm ( 1 5 4 0 ) we were   instructed to go into the main Leppings Lane

         Stand d u e to a r e p o r t   of t rouble in the stand.



            ce inside the stand and amongst the crowd,                  I   noticed that the

                      appeared very distresed and concerned,                however there was an

         elem ent    of t h e   crowd which conti n u e d to be threatening and abusive.

         Th e   crowd w e r e   extrem ely    v o l a t i1 e .



         After    leaving the Leppings Lane Stand we engaged in a general                  public

         order patrol       in D1 Sub-Division.

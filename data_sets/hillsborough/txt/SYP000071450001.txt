            a w a y on a regular        basis and generally travel alone.

            I usua l l y board the         coach at the Ho 1 iday                       Inn in Lei c e s t e r .           There are

was    c ol le c t e d as usual               from the H o l i d a y       Inn,       Leicester.

Du r i n g       the    three y e a r s          that     I have    been a member             of the     club      I have

come to          recognise Carl               and N i c h o l a s Hewitt,            who are also        regular

s u p p o rt er s      and use         the same          pick up point as me.                 I do not know the

two    boys       p e r s o na ll y and as          far as        I can    recall,          I have never          even

sp o ke n to them.

On that          particular m or ni ng               I a rr i v e d at     the       pick    up point at about

•10.20 am.             Carl   and N i c h ol as           were a l r e a d y waiting,          together wit h 5/6

other        supporters.               I do not          recall what        clothing         the two brothers were

w e ar i n g     on that       occasion.

H a vi ng       boarded       the      coach      I sat     in the mi d d l e         of the     rear seat.              Carl

and N i c h o l a s were            s e a t ed    in the      next seat        forward of me on the                 left­

side       of the       coach facing              the     driver.

The    two       brothers were               in a happy moo d and were                  chatting       together           all

the way          to Sheff i e 1d .            Our    journey was          u n i n t e r r u p t e d and we did           not

stop e n route.

The    coach was          eventually              parked about          1/2 mile        from the ground at                 1.40

pm.        We    parked wit h all                of the other         coaches         that    had a r r i v e d    carrying

L iv er p o o l     S upporters.

H a vi ng arrived,             we all         got off       the    coach,      including Carl a n d N i c holas

Hewitt.           E v e r yo ne     then split            into    their    own       particular       parties and

made       their way towards                  the    ground,       fol l o w i n g    the flow of other

supporters„

I do       not    recall       a n y o ne     re maining with           the    coach and due to the                 fact

that       I was       on my own         I w al k e d alone.

D u r in g my walk            to the         gro u n d    I passed      by one        public     house,     about 200
                                                                                                            ^ 1 1, i,„    ■I-.---

y ards       away      from the s ta di um               several    s u p p o r t e r s who    I assume were              part

of the L i v erpool               f o l lo wi ng were drink i n g             outside.         At no time          did     I

w it n e s s     fighting         or    incidents          of drunkeness.

At    no     time      between         the    coach and the           ground,         did    I receive any Police
                                                                                                          PAGE

Once     we had        left the         coach an d split             into our     own groups    I did      not see

w h ic h wa y Carl          and N i c h ol as went.            The     last   time    I saw them was        upon

leaving        the     coach.

At    1.55     pm I a r r i v e d at my turnst ile at the L e p p i n g s Lane                     end.     There

w ere    no queues,            I had no d i f f i c u l t y find i n g         it and ente r e d    the ground

quite        e asily having         ha n d e d my ticket             in.   I did not      receive    either

P ol ic e     or S t e w a r d d ir e c t i o n s   at the t urnstiles.

I did not witn e s s             any u n a u t h o r i s e d    entry to the ground a l t h o u g h         the

p erson       in front         of me did try to            pay £5 but was            turned a way fay the

t ur ns ti l e     operator.

At    the ground           I did not        witness      the opening of any              gates and do not

recall        seeing any open.

H a vi ng     ente r e d    via the turnstile              I did not          see any signs     directing me

to my m at c h         viewing       point,       I entered          the   terraces via the nearest

a cc e s s    point w hi c h was           the    central       tunnel     to Pens 3 and 4.

The     tunnel was          clear and          1' had clear          passage along       it.

As    I em erged from             the    tunnel     onto       the    terraces    I saw two m a t c h

S t e w a r d s an one Pol i c e ma n they just a p p e a r e d                  to be obs e r v i n g    the

g r ou nd an d supporters.

I did not w i tn es s any                incidents       of d i s order       w i t h i n the ground      nor did

I witn e s s       the     c o n su mp ti on     of alcohol.

At 2 . 0 5      pm I took up my             match viewing             point i n Pen      4 six yards       from

the     perimeter          f e n c e and    five yards a e w a y from the              segregating        fence

b et we en Pens 3 and 4.                   It was quite          crowded at       this    time but       it was

comf o r t a b l e .

I was        not s t a nding w ith anyone              I recognised.

The     crowd was          getting       larger and more              compact as the kick          off

ap p r o a c h e d .     The    s u p p o rt er s were     in good m o o d singing and             swaying as

At 2 . 5 0      pm I first           became aware        that       I was        uncomfortable.              This    is not

itself an unusual                   event as L i verpool            have a large            following         I have

e x p e r i e n c e d a large         tight    crowd before.

H ow ev er      on this        o cc a s i o n the    pressure        did not          remain at a constant,                   it

inc r e a s e d s t e a di ly as        the minu t e s        passed by.              I began to feel              pain    in

my    legs.

Just      before 3          pm the     teams     came    out,       I was        very u n c o m f o r t a b l e    now and

d e c id ed     to     push my way         towards a crush barrier.                        At 3.0 5      pm I had

managed         to get a l o n g s id e a barrier,               whe n a terrific               surge     came      from

the      rear    of the        terrace.        I was     forced        forward,          towards       the    perimeter

fence.          The     crush was       unbearable.            Pe o p l e     began to scream ar o u n d me,                    I

h eard     someone          shout,     "He's     broken his an k l e "                I could not         see who         they

were      referring          to.     Other     people were          s h o uting at the             Policeman

who hd g a t he re d at              the     p e rimeter     fence, they were pleading with them

to open         the     gate    leading       to the     pitch.

The Po l i c e         did not       react     to these        pleas for about one                 to one and a

half      minutes.           After     this     time had        passed,          the gate was          finally

o p e n e d , I believe y a Po l i c e w oman,                   and     c h i ldren at         the    front were

being      he l p e d out.           I was     not too far way from this                   gate an d       I was

f o r t u n a t e l y one      of    the first ten           out.     I was        d i r ected by the Police

down      the    touchline           towards     Pens 6 and 7.

W he n    1 a rr i v e d there         it became        obvious        that       things      had gone

d r a s t i c a l l y wrong         in the    centre     pens 3 & 4.                People were         being       hauled

over      the    p e r imeter        fence    onto   the      pitch by Police S t e wards                    and other

s u p p o rt e r s .

I went        towards        the     S pi o n Ko p end       and a s s i s t e d       in the removal             of some

advertising            boards        that were being           used      to      carry off       the growing

numbers         of     injured suppor ters.              I   did not a c t u a l l y assist any                    injured

person nor            did    I w it n e s s anyone       die.        I did see what               I a s s u m e d were

dead      people,        lying       covered     on the       p i tch,      at    the time        I only thought

             that a -Few people                had died      in the      tragedy.         It was     not until muc h

             later      that       I r e a l i s e d the    full    extent      of   it all.

             I could not            see a readily a va i l a b l e          exit     point    so    I remained       in the

             g r o u n d until        about 6 pm.           X left     via the L e p p i n g s Lane      end terrace and

             returned         to the       coach at about 6 . 2 0           pm.

             U p o n my      return      1 was made aware             that we were         two     passengers    short,       I

             could see            that Carl      a n d N i ch ol as were m i s s i n g       but    no one knew their

             actual         fate.

             Two P o l i c e m e n      came    to the      coach.       I did not        hear what was said and              the

             coach      left       shor t l y a ft er w a r d s    with o u t   the Hewitt         brothers.

             It was         not    until a few days            later     that     I was    informed that Carl           and

             Nicholas         had     in fact        lost   their     lives     in the     tragedy.      It    is my

             c o n s i de r e d    opinion      that    the delay        in opening        the     perimeter    fence     gates

             a nd     the    lack     of them was a factor               in the deaths and

             injuries.

             Once      the s e v e r i t y of the           incident was        realised      I believe       that    it was

             h a nd le d well         by all     those      concerned.

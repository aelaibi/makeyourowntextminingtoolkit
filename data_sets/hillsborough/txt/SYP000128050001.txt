               I am a single woman and                  I live on my own at              the above address*

               I am    pre s e n t l y a Special          C o n s t a b l e w ith the S ou t h Yor k s h i r e Police

              Sheffield-            I joined the Special               Constabulary           in Janu a r y    1989.

              On S a t u r d a y    15 April       1989    (150489)        I reported for          duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h

              at the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y football            ground at 09.45hrsv               I made my way

               to the N or t h S t a n d at P e n is t o n e Rd end for                 the    briefing.           There was a

               large    amount       of Special         Constables         present      together w ith a large

               number       of    regular     police      officers*          I had never        been e n g a g e d before         in

              any football           match duties          until     that day.

              The     briefing was           taken    by a Police          Inspector       I think*      He    informed us

               that    no    persons were          to be a l l o w e d     into   the    ground without a ticket.

              P e o p l e were      to be s e a r c h e d before entering               the    ground*        No    small
                                                                                                            PAGE


dangerous       objects       were      to be      let    thro u g h and     no alcohol        and no cans            or

glass     bottles were          to be       let through either.

My mai n duty for           the m at c h was,            together wit h three other Special

Constables >                                        s t a tioned at H a c k e n t h o r p                  I don't

know his       surname      but    he     is s t a t i o n e d at H e e l e y P o l i c e S t a t i o n

and a S e c t i o n Offi c e r         from A l t e r c l i f f e   Police Station.            His    name       is

               I d o n ’t know his           surname       either.

The    four    of us were         to    patrol H e r r i e s Rd S o u t h and P e n i s o n e Rd area.

There was       only one        radio      between the four             of us and the S e c t i o n

Off i cer,                   had that.           We were        given our duties at a second

briefing       in the gym at P e n i s t o n e Rd end of the g r o u n d by the

Commandant,                               and S t a n STAFFORD.            This    briefing        took     place

at about       10*3 0am      (1030)       a nd    I went    on patrol at about              10*5 0am       (1050)*

To g e t h e r wit h the      three       other     officers        I made    my way to H a r r i e s Rd

South*        There was a         lot of         regular    police officers            in the a rea and a

large     number       of N o t t i n g h a m Forest S u p p o r t e r s were        a r r i v i n g at    the

ground*        The S e c t i o n Officer           deci d e d    it w ould    be better        if we split up

into    pairs     to    patrol     our areas.             I paired up w i t h                and

          paired        up w ith                    the S e c t i o n Officer*          Neither                  pr

my s e l f were     in poss e s s i o n of a radio whilst                  patrolling wit h




              .During my time             on patrol        I saw a couple          of small        groups        of

N o t t i n g h a m Forest S u p p o r t e r s    sitting about          on walls       drinking          from    cans

of    lager and some          others were           just    carrying       them as they w a l k e d along.

        and    I had not       been       in the     force      long*      I have a c t u a l l y done 6 7

hours     in total,        that    includes my training.                   I d o n ’t know how many

hours             las done,        but we were           both not       sure as     to our      powers       over

the drinking           of alcohol,         was     concerned and we thought                 it best as there
                                                                                                           PAGE


was    no trouble       being     caused,       to    leave        them wit h     it*

E v er y o n e we saw was       just happy,           there was        no Public Order            offences

committed*        They were        just ma k i n g      their w a y to the gr o u n d or waiting

to get       inside.

At    the    briefing w i t h the         police      inspector        we were also         told of the

emergency       plans     should the gr o u n d need to be evacuated*                            I cannot

remember       what    I should have done              should these          have       taken    place.

                                  I made my way straight                   home    by bus,       w hich    T.

caught       outside    the ground         in P e n i s t o n e Rd.        The    bus went along W o d s l e y

Bri d g e and    passed a public             house     called the Owl*              I was       sat downs t a i r s

 on the       bus and as      I went       past the          pub I could see            it was    packed full

of s u pporters and there was at                     least     fifty s upporters as well                  outside

the    pub d r i nking     beer    from glasses              but    there was      no trouble.            1 don't

The    bus    I was    trave l l i n g    on a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d City Centre at about

1 * 10pm     (1310)*      I got    off     the bus and made my way to                     catch my second

bus home.        Whilst      in the C ity Centre,                  I saw   rows and       rows of

supporters,       there was        hundreds          of them,        even some      on double        decker

buses,       all making      their w ay from the City Centre                       to H i l l sborough.           I

c o u l d n ’t see any     police        officers      with them.

I    live   at                                           Liverpool              My date of birth is

__________|and I am employed as a driver bj
|                                                                                       I am a man of no

criminal     convictions          and have supported          Liverpool     Football     Club   for many

years.



I am a season ticket holder at Liverpool F.C. and obtained a ticket for the

semi final game at Hillsborough between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                                The

ticket I obtained, and which I still have in full# was for the Leppings Lane

end of the ground.



Five of us went to the game, in my brother-in-law's car.                            I was the driver#

we   set    out    from    Liverpool       at    about   11.30am.          We   drove    on   the M62    to

Manchester and then took an A Road to Sheffield.                       There was a slight traffic

jam just outside Manchester# which probably held us up for 15 or 20 minutes:

In addition# my nephew was a little travel sick, but the jam was nothing to

cause concern.          After the major roundabout into Sheffield, all the traffic

converged and formed a single line.                      There were Police,        but they were not

directing us, they were just parked up.                      I just followed the line of traffic.

I parked the vehicle at about 2.15pm.                        I parked on a main road leading to

Hillsborough, I suppose about a quarter of a mile away.                           It was roughly were

I had parked the previous year.                  We walked from the car to a chip shop, which

is quite close to the ground.                   Got some chips, ate them.           I did not finish

mine, I threw them away because time was getting on and we wanted to get in.

We joined the queue at about 2.35pm.                      I threw the chips away because the

crowd was so dense that I could not possibly eat them.                            Myself and my group

were headed for turnstile B.                    It took a good five minutes to get from the

road through the perimeter gates.                    I could only see one mounted Policeman

controlling       the     crowd    and    in    my   view,    he   could    not   control     the   horse

properly.         The horse was circling and seemed to me to be panicking.                              The

Officer was screaming and shouting, he also seemed to be panicking, and did

not seem to be in control.               He was not directing people.



It seemed to me that the Officer on the horse somehow was trying to make the
queue    into a curve to relieve some of the pressure, but people were coming

from behind him and he could not cope.                    I don't know whether he had a radio

on him.        At    this stage#      ie.     2.35pm,    I cannot recollect seeing any other

Police.    Outside the turnstiles into the ground there are railings, so there

is some sort of channelling but it was inpossible to define lines of people

at different turnstiles.              By the time I was in the queue for my particular

turn, I had lost two of the group, although this was not significant, because

it has happened before, there was alot of crushing but nothing which caused

any undue concern.           It was a big crowd and a big game.             I normally stand on

the KOP at Liverpool in any event.



I    remember       the   Officer    on   the    horse   seemed   to   be trying   to close the

perimeter gate and there was one Officer on foot, on a different part of the

gate.     They were both trying to close the gate but could not because of the

pressure of people.           Myself, my mate and sane others turned round and helped

the Policeman to close the gate and we were shouting at others to get back.

This would be at about 2.40pm.                  I remember the Tanyo saying something to the

effect that Liverpool supporters should not panic because there was plenty of

roan and they would all get in.                 My mate said to me that we should get out of

the crowd and wait for a bit, since I had my niece with me.                   We pulled out of

the main body of the crowd and waited by a little bit of wire mesh.                         The

gates by this time had been forced open again, they were not locked, and the

pressure of the weight of people had forced them open.                     The turnstiles were

on our left as we walked across the back of the ground and there was a gate

on our inmediate left,              just behind the turnstiles, which was open.           There

were three stewards and two or three Policemen on it.                       We just walked in.

Before this, I can say that two or three more mounted Police appeared on the

scene.     Nobody asked for our tickets.                 I still have my ticket, including the

counterfoil.         As X walked in, I said to one of the stewards that he, or they,

should get outside to sort things out.                   The steward said "We were told just

to stay inside the ground."



We    walked    through      the    central     tunnel onto the terracing.         There was no
                                         - 3-

difficulty walking through the tunnel, we got past one or two people, went to

the left.   Suddenly there was a surge of people from behind, one of my mates

got lost.   I tried to take my niece as far over as I could.       I sensed that it

could be an awkward afternoon.       The previous year there had been crushing,

but I had been in one of the outside side terraces at the Leppings Lane end.

My brother-in-law had agreed that we should go in the central terrace to see

if   the crushing was   not as severe.      I got to a wall at the back of the

terracing but the crushing was bad.        A lad, I don't know who he was, said

that we would not be able to see anything.        My niece by this stage was white

and I said to this lad that I wanted to get her out.        By this time the match

had just kicked off.    It took at least five minutes to get the short distance

from where I was originally standing back to near where this wall was.         The

wall is probably only about four feet long and is by the tunnel where people

came into the Leppings Lane end.



There were Police in the stands looking over and we tried to pass her up to

them.   One of the Officers was a P.C., the other was clearly a higher rank,

because the P.C. look at him and the higher ranked Officer looked down and

said "No, you'll have to stay where you are."        Alot of people around me were

saying "Take her up will you," and I cannot recall my exact words, but I am

sure that I was abusive to the Officer.         I managed to get my niece on this

wall.   I cannot recall anybody else being passed up at this stage.           ____

(aged 11) was scared and asked me to stand by the wall.          People were still

coming in and we were getting pushed.      I got back to the wall and I looked up

and saw a lad and I said to him just take her will you.       This fella looked at

me and said I can't because the coppers won't let us and I said just "fuck

the coppers,   take her will you."       This lad took her up.     The lad who had

helped me then pushed me onto the wall.         I looked up, a Police Officer - the

Police Constable I mentioned earlier said "You're not conning up."         The lad

told him I was with the little girl, and I then said said just fuck him pull

me up, and I got up.      The Police Officer had walked away.       By this stage,

alot of people were climbing       up.    I then began to help other people up.

Eventually I made my way back to the car.
In my view the blame is with the Police.   They failed properly to provide any

crowd control/ adequate to   suit the      circumstances:   I didn't see any evidence

of drunkeness,   or violence outside the ground.   Obviously there were people

who had had a drink/ but it was only to improve the spirits as they went to

see a game of football.



Additionally/ after we got into the ground/ before going through the tunnel/

there was nobody inside directing people either side of the central terrace.

I also think that the penning at the end is a contributory factor because

there was not roan for people to fan either side, if there was a crush.   I am

not certain whether the perimeter fencing did any real damage/ because in my

view, the crushing was too severe for anybody to be able to climb out at the

front.    The pressure from the back       would have had   to be relieved toenable

people to have the space to get over       at the front.



If I can be of any assistance, I am prepared to attend an Enquiry.

            I am a single w o m a n               living wit h my         parents.        I am a V ,D ,U O p e rator

            employed        by

            I am a L i verpool                F.C.    Supporter     and on S a t u r d a y     15041989      1 travelled

            to S h e f f i e l d w ith my boyfriend,                D avid Lane,        his    brother)_______________

                                 ind his g i r l f r i e n d                  We t r a v e l l e d   by car and      parked

            in a side         street*

           We did not have               tickets         for    the football       m a t c h and we went       to the

           P e n i s t o n e Rd N o r t h end of the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m where we

            pur c h a s e d 5 c o n s e c u t i v e l y numbered          tickets     from a ticket          tout.     I

           have      the stubs         from 3 of the             tickets     (Ex No             ) (REF NO                  >,

           The ticket            tout was a whi te male,               late 2 0 ’s early 30* s , 5*7" - 5*8",

           stocky      build,         brou/n hair,         straight w ith        perhaps a side           parting.      He

           was       casually dressed                 in a ski    jacket     type anorak.            We   paid him    20

for each ticket*

We a r r i v e d       in S h e f f i e l d at about- 1100 am and after               parking the      car

went     to a pub,            I think    it    is   called the W H I T E HORSE,          The    pub got

busy about             1230 onM^ards and became             packed w i t h Liverpool

supporters,              Dave    had about 3 pints            and a bottle       of   beer because

the     pub      ran out of glasses.                          had half a lager and then

orange        juice,              >as driving and only had s h a n d y .                I w a s n ’t

d r i nk i ng .

At about           1330 pm we went            to the ground.       The    tickets we had          purchased

were     for the S p i o n H o p end an d so we went                 to a Police         kiosh,

so m e t h i n g    like a Portacabin,              outside    the ground,       in the area to the

S o u t h Stand,          We e x p l a i n e d to an officer       that we were Liverpool

S u p p o r t e r s and he a d v i s e d       us to see a steward at the West Stand

ent r a n e e ,

We went          to the       entrance     to the West Stand and              spoke   to a steward.

This was man             in his    early 3 0 ’s an d        I think he had a beard.               We spoke

to him about             the tickets          and he d i r ected us

turnstile.             W hen we got        to the turnstile        the man there          refused to let

us    in.      We then went         back to the Stew a r d and he d i r e c t e d us

                    turnstile.          W h e n the S t e w a r d sent   us   there he       commented       "HE’

BEEN LETTING PEOPLE                IN."        At   this   turnstile we were a l l o w e d        into the

ground,          the    turnstile       operator      looked at    our    tickets      and     retained the

one half.

Once     inside         the    ground    it was      not   crowded at that stage and we

e nte r e d    throuh the         tunnel      to e n c losure 4    (as m a r k e d    on the map).         We

wen t    towards         the    left hand side         of the enclosure and sat slightly more

than half way back from the front,

It was        not      crowded but there were              quite a few people          there.      There

was     room to move about a n d to sit                    on the steps-        We sat       for about       ten

mi n u t e s .
                                                                                                                    PAGE             3


At about          1430 - 1440 we s t a r t e d to move                  forward.           Not       n ecessarily

beca u s e we w a n t e d           to,    but because       of the         numbers       of    people       behind

us.      We      reached a          barrier and        because         of    the   pressure          from behind me

ducked        underneath            it.     At this stage          I w a s n ’t apprehensive,                 it was

just     typical        of a normal            football      m a t c h filling         up.

At a bout         1450 - 1455                       and D a v i d and        I got     s e p arated         from

an d                   I think                    had got    f r i g h t e n e d and      they had gone

towa r d s a gate at the front to try and get out.                                                      David and            I

fi n i s h e d    up against           the    fencing at          the front.         Whe n we first            got

pushed up to the                   fence               finished up in front                    of me and       facing

me     I think his            back was agai n s t          the fencing.            This        was    the    point when

the     pressure        started to hurt and                 I got frightened.                   The game had             I

think        s t a r t e d but      I c o u l d n ’t see    the    pitch.                       s h o u t e d for

people to move                back     but    it was obvious that               they w e r e n ’t going to.

Pe o p l e    then started             climbing      over    the fence,            onto    the       pitch.        There

were     pople       climbing         both sides        of me and           I think       someone       close to

              ma n a g e d    to    climb out.        Pe o p l e were       s h o uting    to be let out,                 and

c h i ldren were             being    passed over          the    fence.

I think          people       close       to me    could have d ied but              I didn't          realise          that

at this time.                 The    pressure was so great that you                        c o u l d n ’t turn around

and    c o u l d n ’t even          look around.        I was      telling D a v i d that              it was

hurt i n g and to hold me and not                       let me go down.                He was shouting,                  and

swearing,          to try and get me                lifted out.

To the        left of us was a bout 3 lads and then the side                                     fencing.           People

were     trying        to get        the females       and       children out,            an d these        lads

he l p e d me up onto the top of the fencing                                by the     corner        of the        pen.          I

was    he 1ped down onto                  the pitch a r e a .      I    could talk             to David and

th r o u g h the       railings           and I could touch them               but you just            c o u l d n ’t     do

anything.           After about 5 minutes                               was    he l p e d out        over     the

railings.            D avid was           still    in there       for       what   seemed        like ages and I
                                                                                                      PAGE         4


could see his         face   going a funny          colour.       This was       because       he c o u l d n ’t

breathe.        He then saw a gap behind him and                     faught    his way to the

side    fencing a n d got out,          over     the fencing.

W h e n this all      star t e d    I saw girls and         c h i ldren getting         to the     front

a n d trying       to climb out,       or being      passed or        pulled out,           and the

P o l i c e were    tryng to       push them back        into the      pens.      When the Police            did

realize what was          happening      there      seemed to be no o r g a n i s a t i o n and

they d i d n ’t seem to know           M/hat   to do.       The Po l i c e    even seemed to be

pulling     the     people   off     the fences      that were       trying      to help other

people get         out.

It also     seemed to take a long time                 before     the a m b u l a n c e s    came onto

the    pitch.      We got       out    of the ground as soon as we could.

As a result         of the         incident    Is u f f e r e d b r u ising   to my    ribs,    arms and

legs.

I am 24 years         of age,       5 ’3" tall,     slim,     long    blond hair w hich was

tied up with a red              scarf    in abow.        I was w e a r i n g a white          sweat

shirt and navy blue            tight t r o users with a thin              red stripe.

Whilst    in the      pub a n d     in the a r e a of the ground,             we were a s k e d on

several     occasions,       a dozen or so times,              if we had any spare              tickets

to sell.        This was m a i n l y    from Liverpool          supporters.

I am a keen Liverpool               s u p porter and go as        regular as          I can.

trouble          of any        sort      they were          just       singing.            About        1*30      pm the

D ri v er    took       us     closer      to the Ground,                 and drop pe d            us as        close as             he

could..          We a r r a n g e d      to meet at the Pub after                          the match.              There         was

no Po 1 i c:e di r e c.t i ng f ans              to t he Gr ound .                  There        was    no s i gn of

T he re was           no queues as such just a huge                              crowd       right       outside         the

Perimiter             M/a’
                         ll by the Wraught                  Iron Gates.              After about              5 minu te s            I

managed          to get thro ug h the Gates                       into      the      outer C o u r t y a r d          for

two P o l i c e m e n        on Horses          and one        on Foot           on a wall             by the turnstiles.

P eople      were       shouting at             them to get             people         into       queues,        they were

T u r n st i le s      there was a bad crush.                          The m o u n t e d P o l i c e m a n         near me

s ee me d    to be w o r r i e d He             backed the Horse                    away and m oved away fro m the

crowd.       I didn't           see any other Police                      or S te wards            by the        turnstiles.

I d i d n ’t h av e          any    difficulty             finding        my w a y        in.      Itjust        took       30

minutes          to    get     through       the      turnstiles.                The      c r u s h was       getting        so          bad,

as    I handed          my     ticket      o ve r     I was       pushed         forward          I d i d n ’t e v e n get

half    my       ticket        b a ck    I was       just    pushed         through.             Just        after     I got

through          the    turnstiles           my B r o t h e r      in L a w w a s          still        with     me.        I wa s

walking          across        towards       the      t u n n e l 1.      I heard a              rush    of     p e ople,        I

looked       b a ck     an d    saw      that    an E x i t       Gate      as      I looked           back     the    ga t e        is to

the    left       of    the     turnstiles.                This    gate        had     opened and             people        were

streaming             in.      I d i d n ’t see        anyone          actualy         open       the    gate.         I saw             one

person       try       to    climb       over    a    fence       to    get      in.      Bu t    there       must     have          been

someone          the    o t her     side     and      he    dropped         back       a g ain.         As    I a p p r o a >:::he d

the    tunnel!          I didn't          see a n y P o l i c e         or S t e w a r d s        nearby.          I d i d n ’t see

any    signs          directing          fans.        I headed          straight           for     the       central        tunnell

to    get    in b e f o r e        the    rush       coming       through           the    gate.         Th e    tunnell          was

clear       as    we    walked          through       it the       back        of    the     Pens       looked        quite          full,
there was        no Police           or S te wa rd s    in that area.           I didn't        see anyone

drinking        in the ground.,               There was       no dissorder.           I went        to the    left

at    the    end of the         tunnell        into Pen 4 I took          up a viewing              position at

L.4 on the map,.              I had just        took    up this     viewing        position w hen the

players       came out         to war m up..          Although    it had been          packed at        this

time*       There      was a sud de n surge            from behind and          I was       pushed forward

towards L.3.            There were        no barriers          in my way,          I was      pushed    right       up

against       the      fence,        I think     it was about 2,37             pm w hen this          happened.

I lost       sight      of my B r o th er       in Law when       the    crush       came.,     I didn't       see

a ny d i ss or de r      in the       crowd,.        My face was       forced against           the    crowd

per im it er     pitch fencing,. My head, was                    facing       left    I just, couldn't

move     I could        hardly       breath,         1 was we dg ed against           the     fence w ith my

right arm out and my                  left arm        by my side.        I was       pinned there        for

about 30 to 40 m i n u t e s .                I couldn't       see anyone       other       than the     person

i m m e d ia t el y    next    to me.         About 5 to       10 minutes       after       that     innitial

surge       the Stewa rds           and Police        seemed to be trying             to help us they

s eemed      to take       some minutes          before       they realised what              had happened...

I saw P olice           and S te w a r d s     get    on to the     fence      above me,        they were

trying       to pull       people over          the    top.

The    crush seemed            to be getting worse and worse.                        I gradualy        became

a w a r e a f p e o p 1e g e 11 i n g o n t h e p i t c h .       W h e n t h e c r u. s h e a s e d I w a s

pulled out over               the    top of the        fence    onto    the    pitch by a Policeman,

Just    before         getting       pulled out,        I had m a n a g e d   to     pull myself        up the

fence,,       I had      looked       back    then and there was about 20 people                        lying       on

dead othrs            a ro u nd them seemed           to keep them upright.                 Whe n   I got     onto

the    pitch a St Johns A m b u la nc e m an helped me away,,                          onto the        pitch    I

was    later     lead out of           the Kop End of the              pitch and was           taken to

Hos pi ta l     in a Police           van,.     I was    taken to the N o r t h e r n General                Hospital

           ,Jaut I don't           know        what time.       I d i d n ’t     see any criminal        offences       at    the

            Ground,.         W he n we         were being crushed           it seemed      to take a while         .before

            anything         con st ru ct iv e         happened,.      Also      some   of the P o l i c e m e n were    on the

             fence      h elping       people       out,    but others        seemed to be walking          around       but

             not    helping.          The M o u n t e d P o l i c e m a n   earlier      told us to      ’Pus h B a c k ’ and

             he also        said      not    to w orry we would all              get    in as the Game would            be

             d el ay e d    so all       the   fans     could get       in.      If they had delayed the            kick       off

             this m ight          have      helped,.       I went    to the      same ground      last year      to a Semi

            Final,         it was      o r g a n i s e d different      then..     The Pol ic ei ng      seemed to       be

            more     eficient,.             People were       queuing       order ley and      it was     easier    to get

             in.,    I went        into      this    ground    from the        same     direct ion last year arid it,

            was a l l r i g h t . T h e r e    should       have    been Police         at the entrances       to the

             tunnell        a ft er    that    side     gate was      opened to get         the   fans    to move       to

             either        side    of the      stands      as well     as     through the      centre     tunnell.           I saw

            Po l ic e      st op ping       fans    from    pulling    down the a d v e r t i s i n g    boardings,          fans

            were     going        to use them as stretchers.

               meal     break when a packed                 lunch was         co n s u m e d . .

               one or       two      fans    on this      terracing.

               At    12,, 10 p m       (12105     that    day as a ser i a l            we were         deployed           to the
turnstiles        on Penis Ions Road,          On arrival at that         location we were

told to supervise             entry of the Nottingham Forest fans into the

ground.        On arrival        into Penis tone Road,      several Nottingham fans

were gaining entry i nto the ground                  (East terracing           Spion Kop>„

The    turnstiles m e         were to supervise entry to were at this time

closed.        1 was on duty at this time with PC 24-96 W E S T and we worked

together       initially.,            During this    period several       fans were seen

carrying       ’4 packs'' of alcohol           and when informed of the facts that

entry would not be allowed they either emptied the cans or returned

thsm to t he i r vehi c 1 e s ,

The turnstiles which we worked were not pa r t i c u 3.a r 1y busy and whilst

speaking to fans            it was evident       that some youths        from L i v e r o o l   had

come to the ground without tickets w h e n asked why they haa come to

the ground they said they w a n t e d to buy tickets from                      ’t o u t s 5 ,

At about 2,.53 pm (1455) as a serial we were told to leave the

turnstiles        on Penis tone Road and go to the gymnasium.                     At this time

there were very few supporters trying to gain access                           into the Spion

Hop and the P e n i s t o n e Road end was clear,

0 n ar r iva 1 at      t he gy m n as iu m , we were di r e cted    to   t h e L.e ppi n gs L ane

end of the ground.               We went   there    by walking     in front of the North

stand     towards      the Lappings Lane end.           As we approached that end of

the ground,         i saw people climbing over the fencing and sitting on the

edge of the pitch,.              It appeared to be a ’pitch invasion''.                  X was not

in possession of a radio and did not know what was                          being said o ve r

t h e radio,.

The football match was still                in play but as       I got to the terracing

end,    we were told to form a cordon on the goal                    line to prevent            fans

s p i 11 i n g o n t o t h e p i t c h .

During this time,             the football     match was stopped and as more and more

fa n s c 1 i m bed over t he f e n c i n g ,   it wa s a ppa rent t ha t s o me thi n g m o r e
serious than a pitch invasion was ta?ang                       place.

The fans who were         coming onto the          pitch appeared slightly              injured,

some were      limping others holding their bodies.                      The    injured persons

were directed to an area onto the pitch in front of the North stand

w h ere   the f i r s t a id p e a pla were-

At this time,        we were stood       in front of pen 4 and then assistance was

given to people climbing over the fence and through the gate in the

fencing near to this          pen.

As the crowd cleared it was apparent that some                          people had collapsed

and I saw one male in the             'we 11" of the terracing,                several officers

were giving artificial            respiration to him and              in an effort to get the

body out of the terracing with other officers                         I commenced to kick
down the fencing.

As this was nearly complete an ambulance arrived and I with another

officer went to the ambulance and got a stretcher.                             The male       person

was dead and could not be resuscitated,.                       He was placed on the

s tr etc he r a n d ta k en ba ck t a    the a m b u 1a n c e ,

I returned to the fencing and saw several                         other bodies on the

terracing      in pen 3,      By this time the crowd had either come onto the

pitch or moved back up the terracing,,                     Officers and civilians were

bringing the bodies onto the pitch.                      Some were oeing resuscitated and

when it was apparent that they were dead;                         I assisted with other

officers and fans to carry the dead bodies to the gymnasium,

0 n retur n » whe n     i t was   a p p arent    that    no f urthe r help was         needed or

required as      the    pitch was     clear     of bodies,        1 w a l k e d amongst      the   fans

on the     pitch giving     help when       needed       but   due   to the    shock    of    people

there was      not   very much any       person     could do.

After     the match was abandoned,              I took    some     property    to the     kiosk     on

the S pion Hop,        a bottle    of spirits       I had taken         from a Nottingham?*

fan on his entry to the            ground,,
              On return,     again with the         s e r i a l , 2 went to the area behind           the       West

              stand wi 1 1"! c ther of f i cs rs

              We were then told to return to our vehicle anti went on mobile

              patrol.     My initial      thoughts      on the m a t t e r were       that by the time o u r

              serial    had attended at the Leppings Lane end,                     the incident had

              happened and the a s s i s t a n c e    we gave was what we thought was                  right.

              After the first order to make a cordon there was no supervisory

              orders given,      everyone did what he thought was                   right.     The shock of

              seeing dead bodies at a football match was overwhelming but as                                1    have

              said,    after the initial        shock,     everyone got on with giving what

              assistance     one c o u l d u

              As a post s c r i pt,    I have watched f oo t ba 11 on 30 f oot ba 11 1eague

              grounds    in this      country and in 3 pain.             In this    country we treat

              football    fans like animals,.           Being    a Policeman, I always try and

              treat the public         in a manner      1 would        like to be      treated mnyself.           In

              the    past at other football          grounds,     the feeling you get is of being

              led from place to place and just as the m i n o r ity have changed life

              for everyone,      the football        fan appears to nave suffered the m ost.

              There was very little trouble at the Spion Hop and                          everyone appeared

                  At   11,
                         ,13am       (1113)      in company with POL PC 174 WELCH,                     I was deployed on

                  F e n i s t o n e Rd at    its junction with Leppings Ln adjacent                        to the Swan

                  Shell Petrol        8 tn„      This    location is at the                 roundabout at the end of

                  Leppings Ln, wal kin g away from the stadium towards Wads ley Bridge,

                  Our duty was to assist supporters ana direct them to their                                   particular

                  e n d a f t h e g ro u n d ,

                  To begin with,            a steady trickle of fans walked past us and from the
outset    tans were snquiring               with other tan?; if they had           any tickets

spare,.     The fans that were              asking for tickets appeared            to oe mainly

L.iverpoo 1 supporters ,

we were     constantly asked,            once again mainly by Liverpool              supporters,

di rect ions to local           p ufalic h oa ses-

As the number of fans began to increase,                          I saw more and more fans with

cans of beer and lager.,

W h i 1st standing       close to an Officer who was                 in possession of a radio,

I heard a transmission to the effect                       that a pub that had been used by

Liverpool      supporters had been wrecked,                     but this    I cannot confirm.

I saw some fans, more than                  ones,     walking up and d o w n , obviously not

w a n t i n g t o get   i n t o t h e g ro u n d e 3 r 3.y ,

As the :<ick off time of 3.00pm                   ("1500 5 approached,        the build up of fans

increasea considerably.                 The fans that           1 saw were mainly Liverpool

supporters,       as most of the Nottingham Forrest                    supporters were

alighting      from buses and coaches at a nearby bus depot and were

directed to the ground on a route that would bypass my location,

although there were a few Nottingham Forrest supporters,.

During the last 30 minutes                 before      kick off,     the number of Liverpool

s up po r 1 ers g o ing dow n Le p p in g s         L n i ncreased at w haI I w ouId s a y w a sa n

alarming     rate.       I have performed duty at football matches on Leppings
Ln on a number of occasions and I nave never seen so many supporters

walking down Leppings Ln to go                      to the football' match.        There was a

very   large and constant stream                    of supporters which seemed to stretch

as far as the eye could see and I remember thinking to myself and

commenting to POL PC WELCH,                  the Officers at the Leppings Ln turnstiles

were going to have their work                   cut out        containing and controlling       the

number of fans that were                pouring      into that location.

At approximately 3.00pm               (1500 5 we were           instructed via a radio message

to attend at the Leppings Ln turnstiles area.                              We went down as a
Serial with POL PS ASHTON in charge and an arrival at the Leppings

turnstile area we were         instructed to form a cordon across            the entrance

in order to prevent supporters           gaining a c c e s s ,

I was not       in possession of a radio and did not know what had happened

inside the ground,         although    it was obvious some sort of crowd disorder

or crowd problem had occurred,.            We were just     instructed to stop people

entering the ground for the time being,,

The supporters outside with tickets were obviously very angry about

t Siis ,

After a short while,         we were    informed that an ambulance would be

attending to convey some         injured people out of the ground,              A short

time       later the ambulance arrived and was allowed through a large gate.

A short      time after that some Liverpool         supporters     began walking from

i nside the Le ppi ngs Ln end and seemed to be ve ry upset and ve ry ang ry

They were saying things to us to the effect,                "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,

YOU SHOULD BE INSIDE,.         THERE ARE     BODIES IN THERE,,"

A short      time later,    it appeared that we       had received a m e s s a g e ,

although I did not hear         it, that we should attend          inside the ground,

entering by the Leppings Ln end.            As we walked through the gate,                  on

the right hand side and into what            I would call the open area behind

the West Stand,        I. saw an ambulance and ambulancemen treating someone
inside the ambulance.          At the side of the ambulance          I saw a man laid

on the floor,        his body was blue,      no one was attending to him.              It

became obvious that this man was dead.

We carried on walking and into the open space behind the West Stand,

There w e re peopIe a 11 ove r the p 1 ace.        Liver p o o 1 supporter s were very

angry      indeed,   they were shouting abuse at us and there were several

bodies lying on the ground.

We made our way past these and into the central                  tunnel which runs           into

the terracing on the West Stand,            Once    I came out of the tunnel and
stepped on to the terracing                     I could see      large numbers of fans on the

pitch and the noise was deafenings

I then looked down the terracing towards                         the bottom where the fencing

was and saw bodies,              some of wnich were             laid on top of each other > in a

heap..       Pol ice Officers and supporters were frantically                      removing bodies

and placing them on the pitch at the rear of the goal,,

I imrnediately went on to the pitch and began assisting with the

removal       of bodies.         After helping to remove several                of these bodies,      I

went     back and got hold of another man whose skin was still                         pink and

his body was warm.

I got this man to the pitch at the side of the goal and commenced

mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.,                          while    I was doing

this,     several      supporters snouted abuse towards m e .

After a few minutes                   I don't know how long -- a fireman attended and

said he would take over as he had special                         equipment,     oxygen,   etc.   1


left this man with the fireman and returned to help with more bodies.,

All the time fans were shouting abuse towards Police Officers.                                They

were obviously angry.

Police Officers and supporters were                         ripping the wire fencing down to

make     r e mo va 1 of tha bodies s impler and q u i c k e r ,

After a while,           supporters were getting so angry I feared there may be

a major       crowd control           problem.       We were    instructed to form a cordon

across the centre of the pitch as it was feared rival                            supporters might

start fighting.

As more and more bodies were                     removed from the      pitch,   the tension

seemed to ease and things                  returned to normal.,        We were then directed

to our original           points on Peru stone Rd and remained there until most

o f    "!e
      11     s u,p po r t e r s had   1 ef t   t Ine ar aa .,

we were then taken to Claywheels l...n and from there back to Division.

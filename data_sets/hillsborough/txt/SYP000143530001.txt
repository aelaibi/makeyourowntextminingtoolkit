On the 13th April         1989 we arrived at Hillsborough football    ground,

With                                    we went to the first aid room where we

signed the book to show who was at the ground.             Then we went out onto

the pitch and sat down at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                   We had

a stretcher at this end.          It was about 2 minutes    into the game when

Liverpool      fans    in the central    terraces started to try and climb over

the f e n c e s .   As they did this the police helped them over.         The    police

took them out of the central terraces and put some of them in the

turnstile terraces.          Some them walked over to us and asked if we could

help them.          We sat them down and reasurred them that everything would

be alright.         We then asked an adult who was a member of St John if we

could go round the back to the first aid room to help out there yes

was the answer.         On our way we got stopped by the police and asked if
                                                                            PAGE     6
                                                                            D700

         we could do anything with a casualty we took the casualty to the

         first aid room.   When we were   in the first aid room an adult asked us

         to go out side and reassure some of the casualties.     We then got asked

         if we would go and wait   in the police vehicle.    Later on we came out

         of vehicle and carried on reassuring people and fetching water and

         wet sponges for people who need these things.      We waited until the

         roads were clear of fans and then                             rought us

         home .

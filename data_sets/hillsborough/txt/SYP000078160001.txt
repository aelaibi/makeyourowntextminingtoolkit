About 3 .Q Q p m that day we were                 on H er r ie s Road,       Sheffield,        a bout       one

A bo ut 3. 10pm we______________ the g ro un d a nd went                     in via the gates               on

supp or te rs at the L e p p i n g s Lane            end trying       to    pull    people     from the

terraces.         Other      s u pp or te rs were    pulling down a d v e r t i s i n g      boards         to

make     into stretchers.             I was    not aware at this            time as to the exact

u n c o n s ci ou s   but    I did not know that            some   people had been f at a ll y

in j u r e d .

A D octor        came to the gate          in the fence        b e hi n d the goal at          the S p i on

H o p a nd a s k e d    if he       could be of a ss is t an c e.      I caused the gate               to be

o pe ne d and d irected the D oc to r towards                  the F irst A id Room.



A few m in u t e w      later       I was a ware     of large      numbers        of s u pp or te rs m o vi n g
along     the       playing a re a of the           pitch towards          the S p i o n Hop.         Some were

very d is tr e s s e d and others were shou ti ng                     o b s ce n it i es w h i c h were

d i r e ct ed either at the P ol ic e               or the N o t t i n g h a m S u pp o r t e r s     in the

S p i o n Hop,       I am not sure which.              Tog et h er w i t h other offi ce rs              I

a p p r o a c h e d these     supp or te rs a nd t alked to them a nd by either                          verbal

p e r su as io n or by placing my a r m a r o u n d them                   in comfort,          was a bl e to

move     them back towards             the Le pp i ng s Lane end.             It was one of the

s up po r t e r s    that           me some       people      had died.       Some of the            people      I

s poke to s melled of              intiH^i cants       but    1 am unable         to say w he t he r         those

a c t i n g a g g r e s s i v e l y were    in\act      drunk or e x t r e m e l y d i st r e s s e d or both.



An   i n s tr uc ti on was       s houted to form a cordon a cr os s the w i d t h of the

g r o u n d to move         the s u pp or te rs     back from the S p i o n Kop end towards                          the

centre      circle.         At this    point      I s e r i o us l y t h ro u g h the     crowd viol en ce

was a bo ut         to break out.          M an y of the s up po r te r s       in front of me were

acting      in an a g g r e s s i v e manner,          s ho u ti n g a n d g e s t i c ul a ti n g    towards         the

S p i o n Kop.        They did h owever           start      to move     back     towards       the     centre of

the ground.          A fixed      c ordon was e s t a b l i 1 shed and only brok en

to a l l o w t hrough         injured       persons a nd helpers.             I remained on the                cordon

w i t h other officers.             D ur in g    the time on the           c or dodn    I h eard a radio

that     there were          fatalities.



W he n   the ground s tarted to empty of supporters,                              the    i n st r us c t i 6 i n / w a s

G a rn e r a nd the transit            van were missing.              We were      then d i r e c te d       back

into     the ground and onto                the N o r t h Stand.        It was only then,              talk in g       to

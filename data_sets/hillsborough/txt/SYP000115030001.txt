             At    about     8.30       am       on Saturday,           15th April            1989,        I commenced         an    extra

             tour     of    duty       at    Hackenthorpe            Police       Station,           during       which        I was      to    be

             employed        in    crowd          control        duty   at    Hillsborough                 football      ground,

             Sheffield,           for       the    match        between      Liverpool           and       Nottingham          Forest      FC

             as     part    of    serial          16 u n d e r    the     supervision            of P o l i c e      Sergeant          12 8 8

             Payne.

             Following           the    arrival           of     all o f f i c e r s     at    the          ground       we    were      briefed

              in t h e     North       Stand       by     senior        officers.

              At    about       11.15 am Serial                   16, w h i c h    consisted                of P S      1288Payne,          PC's

              607    Taylor,       2980          Wright,         115 H u c k s t e p p ,      3066          H u c k s t e p p , 1715 Best,

              620    Yates,       963       Evans,        Duffy     and    Cerrone         and    myself,           commenced          d u t y at

              the    turnstiles             at    t he    Leppings        Lane     entrance           to    the     ground.          Myself,

              2980,       115 a n d     607       were     supervising            turnstiles           ABC .

              Initially          the    flow       of     fans    through         this     turnstile           was      slow and

              orderly,          consisting           of    mainly       families         or    singles         or      pairs    of

              predominantly             males        in t h e i r      early      twenties.            The     mood      of    these      fans

              was    very       good    natured           and    from     talking          to a    number         of    these     fans      it

              became       apparent          that        they    had    had    not      trouble        in t r a v e l l i n g     to

              Sheffield          or    reaching           the    ground.          It w a s     also        apparent        that      while       a

              number       of    these       fans        had    been    drinking         alcohol           none     were      d runk     and
                                                                                                                                       PAGE       2
                                                                                                                                       R430

their       behaviour             was    jovial         but     socially             acceptable.

However,             I was    approached                numerous          times       by N o t t i n g a h m          Forest           f an s

who    had       knowingly          purchased             tickets             for    th e L e p p i n g s       Lane       (Liverpool)

end    of    the          ground.

Due    to    the          capacity       crowd          expected          all       were    advised           that        they would

be a l l o w e d          entry    to    the       section          of    the       ground        to w h i c h      the     tickets

applied.

At    this       time       I also       saw       large      numbers           of y o u t h s         gathering           beyond           the

bounds       of       the    ground,          consuming             drinks          from    tins         prior       to    entering

the    ground.

At    this       time       most    fans       entering             the       ground       were        searched           f or    pohibited

articles.

At    about          2*00    pm     (14 00>        the    v o l u m e of        fans       entering           the    ground

through          these       turnstiles              increased dramatically                            to a   point       at     which

only    small             numbers       of    fans       were       searched,             a n d at       this       time       I noticed

that    a    far          greater       proportion            of     these          fans    had        consumed           alcohol           and

that    as       a    result       some       were       advised          regarding           their           behaviour.               On

three       separate          occasions              I heard         abuse          shouted        by       fans     at    myself           and

other       officers          at    times          when    searching                was    being         carried          out.         On

none    of       these       occasions             was     I a b l e to         identify           the        offender.               It w a s

apparent             that    once       at     the      turnstiles              the    fans       were        now    i m p a t i e n t to

enter       the       ground.           The    fans       were       also       by     now m ore            vociferous,

although             their    was       still       a    joviality             about       th e    mood        of   most.

At    2.26       pm       (1426)    in       company with                PC    620    Yates        while        supervising

fans    passing             through          turnstile          B    I had          occasion           to     search

                                                                                                                                  and       in

doing       so       I recovered             two    cannabis             reefers          from a         cigarette           packet          in

his    possession.                 I arrested                                  and    with        PC    Yates       took         him    to

the    police             room,    where       after       documentation                   he w a s         detained.             I

remained             to    complete          and   submit           the       file.       (Gen     104)

At    about        2.58           pm     (1458)        I resumed                                    from             th e     police       room and while

walking           along           the     walkway           to            the                   rear a n d                  below      the      West           Stand         I saw

numerous             (thirty             plus)       males               urinating against                                           the       fence        which       runs

alongside                  the    walkway         to    the               stand                           side.             The     penises           of    many       of    the

males       and            the    streams         of    urine                       on              th e            floor       were      clearly           visible          to

all    of        the        pedestrian            traffic                      travelling                                 along      that       walkway.

Due    to       the         large        number        of     offenders                                           an arrest          was       not     the

appropriate                  action,           but     on      remonstrating                                             with       these       males          some     became

abusive,           shouting               obscenities                         s u c h ass

"This       is y o u r            fuckers         fault".                           "You                      should          be    fucking           over       there

where       you're               wanted,        not     pissing                               about                  here       doing      nothing."

After       clearing                the    area        of     offenders                                           I continued             to    t he       turnstiles,

arriving           there            at    about        3.02              pm              (1502).                         At     this      time        the      turnstile

area       was     occupied               solely        by         uniformed Police                                                Officers,           there          being

about       five,            al l      from     serial              16.

We    remained               at     that       place        awaiting                                     late            comers      or    further             instruction

as    to    deployment,                   but    after            about                            four             minutes          I heard           a    police          radio

message          ordering                all    officers                      onto                      the          pitch area.                In     company with

my    colleagues                  I entered            the         pitch                           via a w a l k w a y                 which          r un s     around        the

rear       of    the         Police        box       then          opens                           onto             the       pitch       through           an     opening

which       is       in      the       stand,        when            looking                                      from    the      pitch,        to     the       l ef t of

the    North               Stand.         On    e n t e r i n g the                            pitch                 area       I had      a     clear            v i e w of

Pen    3.        I could             see       Police        Officers,                                            scaling       and       at   the         top    of    the

safety          fence.              Fans       were     in a                similar                                position          to    the       rear        of    the

fence.           I could             also       see    bodies                          lying                       in a l l        places      to a d e p t h           of

about       7*       being          forced           against                                   the                 fence and         concrete              barrier          by the

pressure             of      supporters               behind                                    some                were obv io us ly             dead.

Officers          were            trying        to    pull            fans                       over               the       fence,       while        others          were

encouraging                 fans       which         remained                         standing                           to   move        back    up       th e       stand    to

relieve          the         pressure           on    those                at              the                    front.

                                                                                                                                                   R430

I moved          immediately                to    the          gate        of P e n     3,       which        I could              see       to    be

open.        Officers                were       trying          to     p ull      the       dead       and        injured             out       through

this    gate,             and    assisted             a    fan whose              leg w a s           trapped           between              the    crush

of    bodies          and       the       concrete             gate        step.        His          ankle        was       obviously

broke.           I also          prevented                fans       which        were          falling           through             the       upper

half    of       the          gate    from       falling             onto        him    by       kneeling              across           him       and              1

allowing          them          to    land       on m y         back        and    roll          off.

After       about             2 minutes          t he      pressure              from       the       fans        above          was       eased and

I pulled          him          from       the    gate          and     laid       him       on       the     pitch.              He     was       thus    in

no    danger          and       I returned                to    the        pen    to a s s i s t .

Due    to    a    number             of    bodies          having           been       cleared             from        the       area        of    the

gate    I climbed                through          the          gate        and    where          necessary              by       walking           on    the

bodies,          I moved             to    the    rear          of     the       pen    from          there         I assisted                  in the

removal          of       a    number       of    bodies,              initially                to    th e    rear          of     the       pen,       and

finally,          when          clear       enough             to    th e       gate    to       pen 3 and              a    vent          in     the

fence       between             the       pen    and       t he       pitch.

I can       remember             a    number          of       bodies           which       I handled:

1.                    A youth,             approx.             23 years,           who          I carried              with another                 fan

                      to       the    rear       of       the       pen.         I felt          no    heartbeat                 and       detected

                      no       responses.             I rendered                 cardiac             massage           and       this        alone

                      appeared             to    revive             th e    youth,          who       I later           saw        being          assisted

                      away.

2.                    A       girl,       about       16 y e a r s          old,       who       I helped              carry          to     the    ga te
                                                                                                                                                                   I
                                                                                                                                                                   I
                      She       was       clearly          wearing              only    a       shirt        to    her       upper           body ,

                      but       I heard          no       comments              made    to m y s e l f            or    the        other          officers

                      regarding             this          fact.            I believed                she     was       dead.

3.                    A youth,             approx.             20 years,           who          I lifted           by       hi s      upper        body

                      to       remove       from          the       crush.         His          head       was     hanging              to    one       side

                  and           I believe             him       to    have        had       a    broken           n e ck .         As      I lifted

                      him       another          male          fan,        of    the    same          age,        who    was          standing
                                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                                               R430

                    facing          me     from       the      other       side           of    the        bo d y ,        lifted        his        fists

                    to       chest       height         and     shouted:             "You        bastards,                 you        fucking

                    bastards."                  I said         something             to        the     fan       then           ignored        him,

                    moving          the       body      to     the    gate       of        p e n 3.

                    A    fat       male,       approx.          25    years,          wearing               a    tee       shirt         and       jeans

                    who       I assisted              to m o v e      to       the    gate.               As     the       body         was    being

                    manoeuvred                through         the     gate       I fell              in     the        gateway           onto       my

                    left          side     and      the      stomach        area           of    the        man        fell       onto        my     face

                    This       was       only       very      brief        as    the           other        officers              pulled           the

                    body          off    and     clear.

Whilst       in     the       pen       and    on     th e    pitch        I can           remember              that           I assisted

with     other          bodies          but    I can         remember           no    details               of       t h e m.

During       the        entire          operation            I was        aware       of        fans        to       the        r ear    of    the

pen a n d      in       the    stand          above       shouting          abuse              such       as     "Fucking               murderers.

At   the    same         time       I was        assisted            by    other          fans        in        removing              bodies.

These      fans         did    as       they     were        told     without             complaint                  or    comment.

Shortly        after          entering           the      pen    I had          seen       a     small           group           of     youths,

from     the      rear        of    the       pen    throw       what       I recognised                        to    be    the         upper       bar

of   a   barrier.              The       projectile             hit       the    top       of        th e       fence       and         officers

on   the    fence         and       below were               caused        to    raise           their           arms       in        protection.

I did      not      see       where       the       barrier          landed and                 I could              see    no        reason        for

throwing         the      bar       other       than      to     injure          officers.

At   about       3.AO         pm    (1540)          I l e ft    the        pen       to    join        a       line        formed         by

officers         across            the    pitch.          As    one       we     walked          first               towards           the N o t t s .

Forest      supporters,                  in d o i n g     so    redirecting                    Liverpool                  fans        back     to    the

enclosures          allocated              to       them.       We    encountered                     no     resistance                 from        f an s

on   the   pitch.

At   about       4.00        pm     (1600)          I was      further           directed              to       assist            in the

supervising             of    a    number        of     bodies        which          had        been         laid          to    the     r ear       of

barriers         near        the    Leppings            Lane     entrance,                 on    the        service              road        next      to

             the    river.     I had   not    handled any      of    these   bodies       on the    pitch   or    in

       '     the    pen.

             Following       the   removal    of    the   bodies    with   other    officers       I went   to    the

             North    Stand    where   we    were    debriefed.       We   were    then    released    from      duty.

                   Initially          the    flow        of      fans     through       t his     t u rnst ile was           slow              and

                   orderly,       consisting               of      mainly        families         or    s i n g l e s or    pairs              of

                   predominantly males                     in      their      early twenties.                 The m o o d        of       these                        f an s

                   was    very    good       natured             and    from talking             to a     number        of       these               f ans                it

                   became       apparent          that        they      had     had   not    trouble          in t r a v e l l i n g                 to

                   Sheffield          or    reaching             the    ground.         It w a s       also      apparent          that                   while                a

number          of     these     fans          had    been      drinking           alcohol          none     were         drunk     and

their        behaviour           was       jovial         but    socially              acceptable.

However,              I was     approached               numerous          times        by N o t t i n g a h m        Forest        fans

who     had       knowingly           purchased             tickets         for        the    Leppings          Lane        (Liverpool)

end     of      the     ground.

Due     to      t he    capacity           crowd         expected          al l    were       advised         that        they would

be a l l o w e d        entry        to    th e      section         of    th e    ground          to w h i c h      t he    tickets

applied.

At     t his      time        I also       saw       large      numbers           of y o u t h s      gathering             beyond       the

bounds          of     the     ground,          consuming            drinks        From       tins       p r i or    to     entering

t he    ground.

At     t hi s     time        most    fans        entering           the    ground were               searched            for    pohibited

articles.

At     about          1.15     pm     (1315)         the     v o l u m e of       fans     entering          the     ground

through           these        turnstiles                increased dramatically                      to a       p o i n t at w h i c h

only      small         numbers           of    fans      were       searched,            a n d at       this       time     I noticed

t hat     a far         greater           proportion            of    these        fan s      had     consumed            alcohol        and

that      as      a    result        some       were      advised          regarding            their       behaviour.              On

three        separate           occasions             I heard         abuse        shouted          by     fa ns    at      myself       and

other        officers           at    times          when    searching             w as      being       carried          out.      On

none      of      these        occasions             was     I a b l e to         identify         the     offender.              It     wa s

apparent              t hat    once        at     the    turnstiles               the     f an s W e r e n o w      impatient            to

enter        the       ground.            The     fan/were            also        by    now m o r e        vociferous,

although              their     was       s t il l   L    joviality           about          the    mood      of m o s t .

At     2.26       pm    (1426)        in       co/pany       w i t h PC       620 Yates             while       supervising

fans      passing             through          ^Lrnstile         B    I had        occasion           to    search

                                                                                                                                 and     in

doing        so       I reco              r
                                          d two       cannabis            reefers         from a c igarette                  packet        in

his     possession.                  I arrested                               and       w i t h PC Y a t e s        took        h i m to

the     police          room,        where        after      documentation                   he w a s      detained,
remained           to   complete             and    submit          th e    fi le,      < G en     104)

At     about       2.58     pm     (1458)          I resumed             from     the       police        room a nd while

walking           along     th e    walkway             to    the       rear     and    below          the    North Stand                I saw

numerdus           (thirty         plus)          males       urinating           against          the       fence       which          r un s r

alongside           the     w a l k ’w a y    to    the       stand        side.        The       penises          of m a n y       of       the

males        and    the     streams           of    urine          on    the     floor       were       clearly visible                      to

al l    of    the       pedestrian            traffic          travelling              along       t h at     walkway.

Due     to    the       large      number          of     offenders            an arrest           was       riot the

appropriate             action,          but       on     remonstrating                with       these       males       some          became

abusive,           shouting         obscenities                s u c h ass

"This        is y o u r     fuckers           fault".              "You     should          be    fucking          over       there

where        you're       wanted,            not    pissing             about     here       doing        nothing,"

After        clearing         the     area         of     offenders            I continued              to    the       turnstiles,

arriving           there      at    about          3.02       pm    ( 1 502).          At    t hi s     time       the    turnstile

are a was          occupied         solely          by u n i f o r m e d P o l i c e             Officers,          there          b e i ng

about        five,      all      from        serial          16.

We     r e m a i n e d at     that       place          awaiting           late    comers          or     further         instruction

as     to    deployment,            but       after          about       four     minute?          I heard          a    police          radio

message           ordering         all       officers          onto        the    pitch          are a.       In    company with

my     colle/gues           I entered              th e      pitch       via a walkway                 which       runs       around          the

r ear       ojf t he    Police        box         then       opens       onto     the       pitch       through          an    opening

whi ch/i s in the                stand,           when       looking        from       the       pitch,       to    th%       left       of

the JNorth S t a n d .              On       entering          the       pitch are a             I had a        clear         view       of

P e y 3.          I could        see P o l i c e          Officers,            scaling           and    at    the       top    of       the

Wfety         fence.          Fans       were       in a s i m i l a r           position          to     the      rear       of    the

fe n c e .        I could        also        see    bodies          lying        in all          places       to    a depth             of

about        7"    being      forced          against          the       fence     and       concrete           barrier            by    the

pressure           of   supporters                behind       some        were    obviously              dead.

allowing        them           to    land       ori m y      back a n d            roll     off.

Aftir     about           2 minutes             the       pressure           from      the       f a ns a b o v e       was       eased and

no    danger         and       I returned             to     the       pen    to a s s i s t .

I can      remember             a    number          of    bodies        which         I handleds

1.                   A youth,             approx.         23      years,           who      I c a r r i e d w i t h a n o t h e r fan

                     to     th e     rear       of    t he      pen.         I felt         no    heartbeat             and       detected

                     no     responses.               I rendered              cardiac           massage          and     this        alone

                     appeared             to    revive          th e y o u t h ,      who        I later         saw     being           assisted

                     away.

2.                   A    g ir l ,       about       16 y e a r s       old,       who      I helped            carry        to     the    g at e

                     She       was       clearly          wearing        only        a shirt            to K g r       upper        body,

                     but       I heard          no    comments           made        to m y s e l f        or    t he    other           officers

                     regarding             t h is     fact.            I believed              she w a s        dead.

3.             . A youth,                 approx.          20 years,           who        I lifted          by     his       upper        body

                     to    remove          from       th e      cr ush .       His        head       was    hanging           to     one       side

                     and       I believe             him     to    have       had a         broken         neck.         As       I lifted

                     to    chest         height           and       shouted!            "You        bastards,              you    fucking

                     who      I assisted               to m o v e          to t h e       gat e .         As      the      body was          b e i ng

                     manoeuvred                 through          the       gate      I fell          in the          gateway           onto       my

                     This      was       only         very       brief        as     t he      other         officers            pulled       the

                     body      off       and         clear.

Whilst       in th e          pen a n d          art the         pitch        I can          remember             t ha t    I assisted

During       the       entire           operation              I was         aware        of      f ans      to    the      rear       of    the

on   the     fence         and      below were                 caused         to     raise          their         arms      in    protection.

I    did    not      see w h ere            the       barrier           landed and                I could          see      no    reason          for

At   about        3.40        pm         (1540)           I left the           pen        to      j o i n a line           farmed       by

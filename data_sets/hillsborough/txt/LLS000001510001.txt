FILE NO I




On 15th April 1989, I travelled down to Hillsbocugh with my two brothers         |
                                                                                 and

       and alsol       by sen.



We left Liverpool at 10.15a.m. and arrived in Sheffield at about 12,00 O'clocJ



Cnee v*e arrived v*e decided to go for a cup of coffee and then onto a pub further

up that road called the 'FOX'.



We sat outside the pub having a cpup&e of pints until it was time to leave for

the ground.



We arrived at the ground at about 20 past 2.00 and it was just a mass of people

around'trying to get in.



On entering the ground        ind      went into the stands whilst         and

myself went into the Leppings Lane at about 25 to 3.00



It was quite pancked in the ground and as v*e entered we were pushed towards the

fence at the front were a young lad who was caught in front of us just passed out



I shouted at a policeman to open the Ijates to release us the policeman told me

to *F Off* I was only a scouser.



Eventually the gate was opened and        zliinbed out I tried this but I got

 trapped and my a m was caught against the fence



Mter     a couple of minutes of struggling and trying to escape to free my am,

eventual iy dragged me out.
Vfe stayed birch on the fence helping people out of the cnnsh I was leaning into

the ground grabbing hold of hands and bodies whilst people    and       had hold of

ny feet.



At onfe point I had hold of a roan's hand but due to the crush his hand slipped

away.



As the ground cleared slightly I could see this man l#ing with his toe sticking out

and he had purple lips and he was blue in the face. A si^jporter jinped dcwn back

into the crush to try and give him the kiss of life this proved to be useless

he was already deadfc



We then started using the boardings in relation to be used in advertising to

ferry fans across the pitch to the Medicssctfwb to the Nottingham Forest end.



Ok   chap who we were trying to get to safety tiieobn the way.   We did not realise

this until a policeman said there was no usa in giving resusciftfafeion as it was

already too late.



Whilst carrying fans into the area the Nottingham Forest end I fell over a nurber

of bodies which had been laid out in straight lines.



Eventually at about quater past twenty past four I left the pitch to find ny brother

and ny sen and wiiilst we were walking we heard shouting frcm the stand and realseoa

that it was my brother who was on the pitch.



At about 4*30 left the ground and made our way back to the car.     Whilst we ware

on our way we met a friend followed him to his car vere W 2 used his car phone to

ring hone to let my wife know that we sere all ok.



We arrived back in Liverpodil at abcut 5 past 7.00 and I dropped my son off at the

house and told my wife that 1 was going over to the pub to seeeif     my friends were
ok and they had returned saffely.



It was pointed out to me thatmy face was covered in foot parks I can only imagine

that this must have been caused by me pulling people out of the ground.



I was very shocked all the following week and didn't realised how nuch until

last Monday 24th April 1989.



I went down to see ny G.P. Dr. |     of |
                                        _____________ [ who gave me sleeping tablets

and advised Be to see a Counsellor which I intend to do.



I still febve nightmares relating to the pepole that I couldn't save and I have now he

to cancel all ny driving lessons due to nynervouses.



1 have been getting nervous twiches in ny eyes since the incident and 1 cannot

stand in confiad        and blame these incidents.

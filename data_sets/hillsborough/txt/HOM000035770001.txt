 Thank you for your letter of 8 December to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

2.      The Judge has asked me to tell you that he found your letter very helpful. In relation
to the video evidence, you say (point 6 at the bottom of your second page) that you do not
recall watching tape TB1 or TB2. You kindly offered to view these to see if that clarifies
your memory.

3.     We would like to take you up on that. There is no need for you to trouble yourself
with tape TB 1, whose contents are not crucial (they are confined for the critical period up to
1500 hours to scenes at the Penistone Road end of the ground where the N o ttin g h a m Forest
supporters were standing). But I enclose a copy of tape TB2 for you to see (this is of course
only a copy - we have the original here).

4.     As you will see the scenes on this tape are timed. I suggest that you watch from
about 1415 up to the end of the tape at 1520. The scenes at 1418 to 1423 are of the Leppings
Lane terrace - thereafter there is footage of the situation at the turnstiles at Leppings Lane
until 1502, when the tape picks up the terrace again as people began to spill over the fence in
numbers.

5.     Is this sequence familiar to you?

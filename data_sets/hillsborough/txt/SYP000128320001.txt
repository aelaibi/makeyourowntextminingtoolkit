I have had the attached letter from Mrs McBrien typed so that it is
easier for you to read.        I would suggest that the content of the letter
deserves a response from you.          As a matter of interest Mr and Mrs McBrien
had not been approached for the purpose of showing any video evidence as
it was thought by Social Services that it was inappropriate at this
time.   You will see at her postscript that they would like to see the
video and you can tell her that a senior officer will be making contact
with her direct to make arrangements.

Dear Mr Dear


I do hope you don't mind my writing to you but I feel by being able to
do this will help me a great deal.     You see iike many, many other
people, our family is seriously affected by events at Hillsborough on the
15 April where our son, John, was killed.     Luckily, my husband has been
able to continue with his work but I am finding that it is not possible
for me to live life as I knew it before.     Before the tragedy, I felt
life was pretty good.     I was employed as a school-teacher and was able
to drive and generally had a pleasant and positive attitude to life.
But most of all my husband and I were proud to be John's parents as he
was a good-looking young man who was very healthy with a wonderful
personality and who was doing well at school and taking three 'A' levels
- Maths, Politics and Economics.     We were looking forward to seeing him
attending Liverpool University this Autumn.    He had chosen Liverpool out
of the four acceptances he had
received.    On the morning of the beutiful April day, life was so full of

promise.




I know the FA made a number of mistakes viz; holding the match at
Hillsborough instead of Manchester and allocating less tickets to

Liverpool fans.


But it was a real blunder for the police to insist on accommodating the
Liverpool fans at the Leppings Lane end and then not exercising strict
control at the main entrance.    Only ticket-holders should have been
allowed through those gates and only a manageable number at a given time
with proper queues at the turnstiles.    I feel the police gave the fans
far too much freedom to exert pressure which led to an uncontrollable
situation.    They allowed anyone, fans with or without tickets, to get far
too close to the scene of action and it seemed inevitable that certain
individuals would take advantage of such a position.
The situation should never have been allowed to develop to such an extent
that fans could actually gain access by climbing walls into the ground.
It was a grave error to open the large concertina Gate C to eject one fan
who had invaded the ground.    It would have been sensible to have kept
him inside and put him out later when the crowds had dispersed.


But of course the crucial mistake was the request and then the order to
open Gate C again and leave it open for anyone to walk in so close to
kick-off.


In my opinion, there was only one sensible decision to be made at
that time and that was to have the game delayed and use the turnstiles
only for entry.   That way people would move in at a much slower pace and
the crowd would be less dense.    That way they would be able to see for
themselves where to go.   It was the sheer volume of people coming in
through Gate C and then down the tunnel that caused the disaster.     It is
no wonder that on-one had admitted to doing this as it was indeed an
extremely foolish procedure.


I, myself, would certainly not have liked to have been faced with a
request from a senior officer to open the exit
                                    -   4   -




gates to allow anyone in as that to me sounds a very unusual request
indeed and is undoubtedly a recipe for disaster.   If I had been faced
with such a request, I would have felt that I had no alternative to
having the game post-poned or even abandoned as that to me would seem the
only right decision to make.   The other decision was entirely wrong as
beyond that gate on the outside there was the space of the whole world
but within the stadium there was a limited space only and it was indeed a
very dangerous thing to exceed that capacity at any time.


I feel generally that the police in this country are doing a fine job on
all Saturdays throughout the football season as their job Is indeed a
difficult one.   I also feel that the police operation adopted on the 15th
April was a well-thought out plan that had worked at Hillsborough
previously as John had attended the same match last year.   But it did
appear quite obviously from 2.30 pm that there were difficulties in the
Leppings Lane area and it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain
control.   I think the situation then should have been assessed and some
positive action should
have been taken at that time.   Strict control was definitely needed at
the turnstiles from 2.30.


I cannot criticize the police for not having officers directing the fans
to various pens.   I feel many fans choose the standing area because they
feel less restricted there in some ways.   They are not tied to one
particular spot as with seating; in other words, they have free choice to
go to any pen where they see room and if need be can move from one pen to
another by means of the gates at the top of the pens.   I suppose this is
what usually happened.   I don't think the fans would actually want the
police to tell them where to go under normal circumstances.   But what
happened on the 15th April 1989 was a different set of circumstances
altogether.   People, who were legitimate ticket-holders were not coming
in as usual through the turnstiles and finding their positions in the
pens.   It appeared suddenly that anybody and everybody had been allowed
in, indiscriminately, without warning, in such large numbers to create
overcrowding on a very large scale.


It was noted by the police at 2.AO pm that there was room on the
                                   -6-



terraces for another 3,000 fans only and at that time it appeared that a
very similar number were waiting to come in, outside the turnstile area.
However, within minutes, the 3,000 outside turned into about 5,000.     This
was clearly seen so it was extremely foolish to think that 5,000 could
fit into a place for 3,000 and throw the gates open.   It couldn't be done
and it shouldn't have been done.


It was wrong to allow ticketless fans in and it was posing a security
risk, too, as a large mob like that could have missiles or the like.     In
any case, no-one is allowed into any other place of entertainment without
producing a ticket first and that is the purpose of the turnstiles.     No
steward was told of the police decision to open the gates as I'm sure any
steward would have objected because surely it was against Club Rules.


I will now give you the information relating to our son, John.


John left home on the 15th April 1989 just in time to catch the Deeside
Liverpool Supporters' coach from outside the Victoria Hotel at Holywell,
Clwyd.


He travelled to the match with a ticket and consumed no alcohol on that

day.
The coach arrived at Sheffield at approximately 2 pm and John and a
number of other young supporters made their way to the ground.


I was told that the organisation this year was totally different to that
of last year when there were a number of control points to check for
tickets before the fans arrived at the main gate and turnstiles.     In fact
on a number of occasions in the past, ticketless fans were taken to a
specified area where they listened to the match on a transistor radio and
so did not pose a problem.


This year there appeared to be no plan whatsoever operating at the
Leppings Lane end and widespread chaos developed when the road was
closed, following Mr Marshall's request, at 2.30.   It was a very foolish
move as fans were then able to spread out in all directions and checks on
them became impossible.   Fans with tickets were being pestered all the
time by fans without tickets asking if they had any spare tickets.     It
appeared that the police didn't understand what 'spares' meant!


By the time John and his friends managed to get through the maingate
there was utter confusion with fans
                                    -8 -



being helped over the turnstiles and walls by policemen and one
policeman on the roof of the turnstiles.   Also, ticketless fans were
attempting to bribe the turnstile operators and so were hindering the
flow through the turnstiles.   Added to this was the fact that the tickets
themselves were incorrectly numbered or lettered.


John and his friends were being pushed and crushed at the turnstile area
at about 2.45.   As one of his friends suffers with asthma and started to
have an attack, they quickly moved out of the crush at the turnstiles and
went as far away as possible to stand outside the exit Gate C where there
were not too many people at the time.   They went there because they felt
safer and at that point they weren't even bothered about seeing the
beginning of the match.   They were concerned only with their own safety.


To their amazement, Gate C suddenly opened to eject a fan and police
officers there at the time mistakenly thought that the gate had been
opened in response to Mr Marshall's request and so they told John and his
friends along with other fans, totalling about
200 to go in.   John and his friends looked back and saw the gate closing
behind them and felt safe so they went to the lavatories and then quickly,
made their way down the tunnel and took up their positions in Pen 3.


No sooner had John     and his friends got into their places    inPen 3,then
thousands of people came following down the      tunnel after   GateC wasopened
again and left open.


We know nothing more about John and are still trying to find the
following information and should be grateful if you/could help with this
matter.


1)   What time John was found dead or injured?

                                          v
2)   Who found him?


3)   Was he taken to hospital?    'J


A)   Did he receive    any medical attention at any time?


5)   Did anyone try to help him in any way?


It may help you to know that John was wearing a red and white scarf.


The facts clearly indicate complete wrecklessness on the part of those
put in responsible positions on that day.     Power can indeed be a very
dangerous tool if put in the hands of
irresponsible individuals!    John should never have died at 18 - this was
completely and easily avoidable!    We can all recover from mistakes made
connected with the Economy; we cannot recover from the mistakes made by
imcompetent people who were in a position of responsibility on the 15th
April 1989.     The price all the bereaved families have had to face is a
colossal one.     This is something that no-one can put right but we do hope
that at least justice is done!


If only Police Constable Buxton's request to have the kick-off post-posed
had not been rejected by Mr Duckenfield, I am sure there would not have
been that terrible tragedy.     Instead, Mr Marshall, in more authority,
requested that the exit gates should be opened to get rid of the crowd
surging around him.     That was not just a serious mistake, but a fatal one
where John was concerned!     I'm sure he would not expect that gate where
he was standing to suddenly open and allow him in - in to his death!        It
was utterly wreckless!


Mr Jack Stone, a gate-man at Gate A pleaded with the police not
to open the exit gates as it was against Club Rules and said, "all hell
will break loose if you open them,” and it surely did!    He refused to
open his gate and stood firmly by it but was eventually compelled by the
police to do so.   I know he was just a gate-man but he knew his job - he
knew that exit gates were not to be opened until after the match; he knew
what the right decision was - if only the power would have been in his
hands instead of Mr Marshall's and Mr Duckenfield's.     He obviously cared
for the fans and knew the dangers.   It was such a short time after he
pleaded with the police not to open the exit gates, that people died
inside the stadium and that wonderful and intelligent son of ours was
changed from a healthy, happy and lively person into a dead body labelled
No 68.   Although John was carrying a provisional driving licence, I went
through the trauma of not knowing the truth until about A.30 am on Sunday
16th April when I tried to identify him.   He was beyond recognition and I
refused to believe it was him until his clothing was produced.     I would
like a copy
of the photograph that was available for identification purposes, if it
is possible for me to try to comprehend how the most handsome young man
in the world in my eyes could have been turned into something to
grotesque!




                                   I just cannot forgive those policemen.
I feel that the police felt contempt for the Liverpool fans; I feel
contempt now for the South Yorkshire Police, especially as Mr Duckenfield
even lied about the fans and said that they had forced Gate C open.    This
is completely unforgivable!   I just hope that a verdict of unlawful
killing is pronounced as that would be the only thing that would make me
feel better as John was the most wonderful person I have ever known in my
life and the loss of his life is indescribable!


I'm sure neither Mr Marshall nor Mr Duckenfield deliberately caused
John's death, but by their irresponsible actions they certainly caused
it.   It was clear to John and his friends that it was absolute
pandemonium at the turnstiles with fans constantly being
allowed to get over the wall and this is why John and his friends moved
away to relative safety as they thought but instead were actually invited
into that cage by the police; then John was allowed to be crushed by a
terrific force with no police officer in the ground doing a thing about
it.




Nothing can bring John back but I do wish that I could do something to
help to prevent further disasters.


First and foremost I would like to see all-seater stadiums.   I feel when
fans pay £6.00 to be spectators they should be entitled to both comfort
and safety.   They should be treated with the same respect as anyone else
who pays to be entertained.   They should be ushered safely to their
places and high safety standards should be maintained at all times.


They should be allowed refreshments including alcohol, as this is
available at most other places
of entertainment.    Fans should be treated as innocent and decent human
beings and only if they misbehave should they have their photographs
taken and be thrown out.


I am totally against the ID card scheme and do wish that the Bill could
be stopped.    I know I would certainly not wish to   attend a place of
entertainment if I had to produce a photo and details of myself first -
I believe the fact that I had paid for admission should surely be
sufficient.    These young people are already finding it difficult to
manage to pay the £6.00, especially if they are still at school.     Why
should further expense be imposed upon them to cater for the hooligans
once again?


I would like to see all perimeter fences removed.


I would like   to see newspapers and magazines sold   at the ground and maybe
even tapes.


I do, however, feel that ticketless fans should never, never be admitted
but most of all that exit gates remain closed until the end of the match.
I think it would be a good idea to have Rottweillers standing by the
police to deal with any pitch invasions, maybe even teargas or the like.
Photographs should be taken of any offenders and they should not be
allowed to attend further matches.


I am enclosing a few photocopies to illustrate the kind of son we have
lost and why our lives have been totally ruined as a result of such poor
management.     Perhaps it would have been better to have had fewer
policemen but better trained for such an arduous task.     'Quality rather
than quantity' may have made a big difference to the outcome of that
horrible day!


                                  Yours sincerely


                                 Joan McBrien (Mrs)

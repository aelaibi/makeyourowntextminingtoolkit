               From.what                 I    can      remember          of    the    match,            everything                  went        smoothly            on

               the        day,       supporters               from       Liverpool           came         to     the       match           in    good            spirit

               and        in    plenty            of    time       to    take      their      place             in    the          Leppings           Lane         e n d.

               .T. c a n n o t       recall            any    situation            where      the         gates           were        overcrowded

               neither              did       I see         any    attempts          by    Liverpool                 supporters                 to    enter         t he

               ground           by       force         through          the    metal       gates          or     climbing                 the    walls.             The

               majority              of       the      crowd       were       well    behaved            and         there          were        only         a   small

               number          arriving                carrying          intoxicating                  liquor,            who       were        refused            entry

               to     the       ground.

               What        did       strike            me    on    the     day     was     the     fact          that          a    lot     of       the

               supporters                 who       arrived         very       early       wandered             around              for     a    while           and

             because      of   not   knowing     the   area   well,   public   house   wise,   they   went

             into   the    g r o u n d 'early.

FA CUP SEMCSiTNAL   AT HILLSBOROUGH 1988 LIVERPOOL   V   NOTTINGHAM FOREST.

I worked in uniform at above football match* SGT Tissington was serial leader, also in serial
were DC Hobson, DC Shelton, DC Ketton, P.C. Butler WPG Marshall(Nesbit$. Duty was to supervise
Liverpool supporters arriving at the Leppings lane entrance to the ground, then during the match
to remain on standby in the North Stand. Affefermatch to return to Leppings lane supervise MffipaBEI
supporters leaving.

From what I can remember of the match, everything went smoothly on the day, supporters from
Liverpool came to the match in good spirit and in plenty of time to take their place in the
Lepping lane end. I cannot recall any situation where the gates were overcrowded neither did
I see anjr attempts by Liverpool supporters to enter the ground by force through the metal gates
or clinbing the walls. The majority of the crowd were well behaved and there were only a small
 number arriving carrying intoxicating liquor, fflEDElfi who were refused entry to the ground*
What did strike me on the day was the fact that a lot of the supporters who arrived very early
wandered around for a while and because of not knowing the area well, Public housed wise, they
went into the ground early.

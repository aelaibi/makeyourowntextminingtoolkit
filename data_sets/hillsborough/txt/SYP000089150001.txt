                      On Saturday 15th April          1989 <150489), I commenced duty at 8.45am

                      (0845) at Woodseats Pol Stn,             for deployment to Hillsborough for the FA

                      Cup Semi-Final.          We arrived at the/ground at 9.30am (0930) for a
m    ,
                      briefing in the N Sffand at IQ.OQafo (1000).               Following the briefing, we

                      were deployed to / h e Penistone Rd enc/losure, where we A/ere given a

                      potential      problems on both the turnstiles and on the Kop.             I w4s then

                       eployed as part of Serial 9, with responsibilities for turn/tiles^

           ^        ^nuinber 43 and 44.           We remained at those turnstiles,        searching

               ,^ N o t t i n g h a m Forest supporters entering the ground, and preventing

                      dangerous arti cles being taken in.               At that t ime we were constantly

                                                                         S3341

throughout,    and periodically by both the POL INS and POL S U P T .



We remained at the Penistone Rd end of the ground until around 3 . 1 0 ^ 1

(15-10) .   Shortly prior to leaving that location,     I heard a message

passed via the tannoy system, asking spectators X q leave the pitch,
                             M S 9 30
We were then told by POL SGT JESSQP to leave/the turnstiles, and as

we did so, several supporters jumped over/the turnstiles and the

groundstaff were instructed to close the gates to prevent further
                        /             /
problems.     We then followed the Sergeant around the back of the

Kop,   through the crowd,   to the perimeter fence and we were allowed

through a gate directly behind the goals.        The crowd was not

densely packed at this end of the ground and we were able to walk

easily to that fencing.     (The queuing at the turnstiles had been light

throughout the morning,     with numbers building only to around a

maximum of twenty,    though there was a constant flow of Nottingham

supporters from early morning).



On entering the playing ar#a I could see there were a nupmer of

supporters on the pitcfy/and"that others were cl imbing/over the fencing           ,

and others were being pulled intq^ the seats behind/the terracing.           At

first I thought we had been taken from the t u r i 1es because of

fighting ~ problems had been anticipated at that end of the ground

with Liverpool fans being amongst the Forest supporters,        but on

entering the ground ,I formed the opinion that it was merely a pitch

invasion.     The Nottingham Forest supporters must have thought the

same, as there were chants of abuse directed at the Liverpool fans and

also chants of "off the pitch".         In view of the numbers on the pitch I

thought     it would take some time to clear the playing area and the

start of the game had obviously been delayed.        There seemed less

urgency to get to that end of the ground in view of the situation and
                                                                              PAGE     3
                                                                              S3341

most of the Serial slowed to a normal walking pace across the pitch.

At that stage I was unaware of the nature of the incident or that the

game had actually started, and then been stopped.             We crossed the

pitch and on getting towards the Leppings/Ln end I could see a number

of officers stood on the perimeter fence,          shouting and waving at the

crowd,    trying to get them to move hajck , but they seemed to             taking

no notice.     As I got to the fencing 'I could then see t h a t      those

supporters nearest to the fencing were being c r u s h e / a g a i n s t the mesh.

I realised immediately that quite a large number w e r e X l ready

apparently dead.      I immediately climbed on the fencing and began

shouting for people to move backwards,          but they /were just shpiiting

back,    obviously unaware of the seriousness of the situation.            A gate

directly behind the goal was opened and a crowd of poJn.ee officers

were around that g a t e , pulling people t h r o u g h .   I Realised,   because of

the density of both the crowd and police around ^That g a t e , that I

would be unable to get onto the terracing to assist, / l            went to the

next gate along towards the S Stand, which was operife4, and there was a

steady stream of supporters emerging from that cjj&tsr which opens             into

the southern section of the Leppings Ln t e r r a c e . / After the pressure

of fans had been reduced, a number of off icers /we re able to get onto

the tsrracina and make their way to the centN^e section.             There was a

problem around the gate, with unjured people trying to get out,                thus

impeding the removal of the dead and injured persons from the centre

section,     I remained close to thatgate, along with          a number of other

officers,    leaving a corridor along       the front of the terracing,       to

allow the removal of injured persons over the fencing and out onto the

pitch.     The crowd in this section was very agitated,          some bordering on

hysterical, as apparently dead persons were removed from the centre

section.     As the movement of bodies stopped,         I left the t e r racing and

went back    onto the pitch..    By this    time most of the dead and injured
                                                                         PAGE    4.
                                                                         S33V1

had been removed from the terracing and there were a large number of

persons lying out on the pitch.       gome were obviously dead a nd had

their heads covered with coats etc.       Those that were injured were

being seen to j each person seemed to have several around them

ass ist i n g .



Many of the injured were receiving numth to moj/th and heart massaae.

There was one ambulance on the pitch and I expected others to follow,

though they didn't.      The removal of the deed and injured was underway,

though there were no stretchers       in evidence and people were breaking

up the hoardings to use.       I assisted/an the removal of one young man

who was still alive who was taken Vo the back of the N Stand where he

was   left with an ambulance   crew./ I then returned to the pitch a nd as

I approached the halfway line, a group of Liverpool supporters

numbering around a hundred,     set off running towards the Kop end,

shouting and screaming abuse.      They seemed intent on attacking the
                                                                   /
Forest supporters.      There was a real danger of a serious public order

problem which I honestly found inconceivable on top of the da.'j" s

events.      There were a number of officers on the pitch,     trying to calm

this situation,     pulling people back and trying to get them t«j> return

to the other end of the pitch.        I recall a banner being unfurled on

the Kop,     referring to Bill SHANKLEY, which seemed to further infuriate

this section of the crowd.      The group were moved back to the tfther end

of the pitch and instructions were given to form a cordon jpnanq the

halfway line to prevent any further       problems.   There w e j w , however,

sporadic bursts of fighting between small numbers all around the

ground.      After a short period,   the dead and injured had all been

removed, and the ground was becoming very quiet as people began to

realise just what had happened.       We remained in the cofiflon until a

message was passed via the tannoy that the game was           f and the ground
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S3341

emptied.    At this time we were unaware of the numbers        involved,     though

opinion gave the number of dead at around fifteen.           We were also

totally unaware of how or why it had happened.



The Serial had regrouped on the halfway line and as the ground became

empty we were directed to resume the duties we had been given, which

was supervision of bus q u e u e s .   This was unnecessary as most of the

crowds had left and those that remained were quiet and stunned.



We were then directed back to the ground for a debriygfing.           The

numbers dead were now rumoured to be around thirty;           By the time we

left the ground that number had become seventy.          There was still no

explanation of what had caused it.



We returned to Woodseats and went off duty at 7.15pm (1915).



The mood of the Liverpool supporters        ranged from anger to a stunned

silence.   There was a number on the pitch whose actions were bordering

on hysterical.



There was a problem with radio communications         in tftat only Sergeants

and above had radios,     so there was an obvious difficulty in directing

officers to specific points.       When confronted with that situation,

remaining in a Serial     is difficult,    if not\ impossible, as all o n e ’s

attention is directed to assisting as best as you can.           There was no

time to be spent on looking around for the rest of your Serial.



In fact on the day I did not see any other member of my Serial              between

reaching the Leppings Ln end of the ground and being formed

into a cordon on the halfway line.         It was only then that Serials
                                                                           PAGE     6.
                                                                           S3341     ,

began to regroup.



The public address s y s t e m was either under-utilised or ineffective, as

it was impossible to hear         it, wh§m it would seem to have been a

suitable method of communi cat j\or»s, for both police officers and for

directing the public.          The only times I recall   it being used was prior

to the incident and to inform supporters that the game/was abandoned.

I cannot   recall seeing a steward at any time during/the         incident.



Some supporters were extremely helpful and doing all they could to

assist the injured and remove bodies.          Others, however,   were a

hindrance, wanting to voice their opinions on ticket allocation and

the uselessness of the Police, and in the extreme wanting to fight

with the Forest supporters.



I was not involved in the removal of any dejtd person,          only one injtired

y o u t h , and I can recall    little regarding/his description,   other than

being a white male,     early twenties wiVn dark h a i r .



I can only describe my feelings on the day as deep shock,           in fact

the scale of the disaster really d i d n ’t start to sink in until the

following day.     I don't think anyone on the Serial was prepared for

what we were faced with on our arrival at that end of the ground,

and the shock at seeing such deaths when we thought we were dealing

with a pitch invasion cannot be described.          However,   no amount of

preparation or training could prepare you for what we were

confronted with on that day.

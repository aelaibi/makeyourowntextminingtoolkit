                Dear Sirs

                ADLINGTON-V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

                This letter is written following Mr Manning’s telephone call to Ms Adlington this morning.
                We have both separately spoken to Mr Croston of the Crown Prosecution Service. He has
                told us that he expects his report to leave his desk in the next day or so. He presents the
                report to the Chief Crown Prosecutor. He anticipates that she will need a few days to
                consider it before she presents it to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Thus there can
                be no decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions by 30 October.

                 Our understanding is that the Chief Crown Prosecutor intends to talk to the new Director
                 of Public Prosecutions (who takes office on Monday) to seek to establish within what
                 period of time the Director feels that a decision will be able to be made. That information
                 will be communicated to the various interested parties as quickly as possible and hopefully
                 before Friday.
                 When he adjourned the matter on the last occasion the Learned Stipendiary Magistrate
                 intended that if the matter had to come back before the Court on 30 October, the decision
                 of the Director of Public Prosecutions would be known. We have suggested to you that
                 it is appropriate to make a joint application to adjourn the case to a late- date when the
                 decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions will have been made. Such application, if
                 made by consent, could have been dealt with in the absence of the parties and respective
                 legal representatives. You have said that you do not agree to an application to adjourn and
                 that you intend to make representations to continue to list the matter for committal. We
                 regret that decision and therefore have to put you on notice that the question of costs may
                 have to be canvassed in the event that the Stipendiary Magistrate takes the view that an
                 adjournment by consent should have been agreed and the costs of and incidental to
                 attendance been avoided.

                                                                                                       T?c

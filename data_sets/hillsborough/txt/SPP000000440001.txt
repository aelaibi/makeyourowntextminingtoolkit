Thank you for your letter of 3 December. In Section 4 of your letter you refer to certain papers
in the interim inquest and refer to them by page numbers. Unfortunately we only have copies of
 mini-inquest transcripts which are individually named and dated but are only paged for that
inquest and are not paged sequentially for all of them. Is it possible for you to assist us by
reference to the documents which we hold?

I am also interested in a letter, dated 3 January 1991, from the Steering Committee. This refers
to a letter, dated 13 November 1990, from Mr Hicks which relates to his daughter, Victoria.
There is part of a letter on file from Mr Hicks (signed pp Tracey Robinson) which is not dated
because I think part of it is missing. It would help me if you could confirm that this is the letter
or else send me what it referred to.

My apologies for troubling you with these requests. I look forward to hearing from you.




  ORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH

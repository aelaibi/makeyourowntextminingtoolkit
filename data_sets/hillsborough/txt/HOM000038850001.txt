Dear Sir,


Re:   Graham John Roberts killed at Hillsborough


Further to our letter sent 16 July 1997 we would like to add that
Graham was certified dead at 4.25pm by Dr Ashton. We sent
questions to the Coroner regarding first aid. At the Mini
Inquest the Coroner refused them but promised they would be
allowed at the Main Inquest,, this was not so. However we now
realise that the statements were not referring to Graham, but
obviously were two of the other victims. We are now left with no
knowledge of what happened to Graham.

We cannot accept that 96 healthy people were killed by merely
going to watch a football match and yet a verdict of Accidental
Death was decided upon. We strongly urge you to consider re­
opening the inquest and allowing the truth to be told at last.


Yours sincerely,




Mr S Roberts          Mrs D J Roberts        Miss S E Roberts
Graham's father       Graham's mother        Graham's sister

     Dear Mr. Whalley,

      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry

      Following your visit to The Belfry during the Ryder Cup
      matches and my promise to provide full details for
      Lord Justice Taylor I regret that the detailed information
      is not presently available concerning all aspects of the
      attendance.

      I am sorry for the delay but will communicate such
      information to you immediately it is at hand.

      With very best wishes.

      Yours sincerely,



     \>ALAN

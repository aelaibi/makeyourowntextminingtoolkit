           I am a Policewoman in the South Yorkshire Police Force,                    stationed at

           Doncaste r .



           At -1300 hours on Saturday              15 April   1989 (150489),    I was on duty in

           Doncaster town centre, when I received information that Operation

           Support had been implemented.                I returned to Doncaster Police Station,

           where,       at 1515 hours, along with other Officers,              I was deployed to

           Sheffield,         arriving at Hammerton Rd Police Station, Sheffield,            at

           1540 hours,         that day.



           At.   1615    h o iif i/ along   with
                                                                           "MloS /

           POL Insp BENNETT (South Yorkshire Police) at the Northern General
                                                                               PAGE     S
                                                                               S3317

Hos pi t a l .



At about         1630 hours we were asked to assist with the stripping of

b o d i e s , which were being    ’h o u s e d ’ in the Plaster Room.   This duty was

undertaken by                 , PC S N O W D E N ,

I was delegated to stand outside the room to prevent any unauthorised

entry of persons.



                 completed Casualty Enquiry Record Forms, which contained as

detailed a description as was possibles-

Lists of clothing,         lists of individual *s property.

Once completed,        the Casualty Enquiry Record Forms were passed to

myself and I took them into the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.



After each body had been dealt with,                 it was removed from the Plaster

Room by hospital staff.



After    completion of this task, we generally acted as liaision between

hospital staff and the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.



At about 2045 hours that date,             I left the Northern General Hospital.

I was stood down from Operation at 2130 hours and returned to

Doncaster Police Station.

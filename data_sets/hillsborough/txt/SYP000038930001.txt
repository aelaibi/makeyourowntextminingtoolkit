                              this interview I will give you a

                              notice explaining what will happen to

                              the tapes.    Do you understand.

                              (No reply)

01.16     CC SHARP            On the 15th of April 1989 (150489) a

                             disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                             Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                             Following a Public Inquiry and report

                             the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire

                             Police consulted with the Director of

                             Public Prosections and as a result

                             West Midlands Police Officers were

                             requested to do a criminal investiga­

                             tion.    This investigation came at the

                             same time that certain members of the

                             public decided to make specific

                             allegations against named police

                             officers.     You are one of those

                             officers Mr DUCKENFIELD and you've

01.50                        already been served with Regulation 7

                             Notices detailing those specific

                             complaints. The nature of those

                             complaints and the particular duty you

                             were performing at Hillsborough on the




                                                                           1392
DUCKENFIELD         DAVID GODFREY                                     4


                            15th of April 1989 (150489) suggest

                            that you may have contributed to the

                            deaths of some of those that died.

                            Also that you may have failed to

                            perform your lawful duty as a police

                            officer on the 15th of April 1989

                            (150489) at Hillsborough.   Now I will

                            explain the specific allegations to

                            you in interview, but they raise

                           matters of both a criminal and

                           disciplinary nature so before you

                            answer I need to formally caution you.

02.27                      You do not need to say anything unless

                           you wish to do so but what you say may

                           be given, given in evidence.      Do you

                           understand the caution?

         DGD                I do.

         CC SHARP          Thank you.   I will remind you that you

                           are not under arrest and that you need

                           not remain here.   In addition, you are

                           entitled to legal representation and

                           I'm aware that your solicitor is

                           present.   You gave in evidence

                           initially at the Inquiry held by Lord

                           Justice TAYLOR - I have here a

                           transcript of your evidence which it

                           may be necesary to refer to.   Are you

                           content that the transcript which I

                           have a copy is a transcript of the,




                                                                          1 393
DOCKENFIELD           DAVID GODFREY


                              the evidence?    Have you got the

                              transcript please?

03.16    C COUGHLIN           I think for the avoidance of doubt,

                              Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and

                              certainly myself, giving him advice,

                              would not wish to become involved and

                              sit here beneath such a transcript at

                              this time.

         CC SHARP            Thank you.    You also submitted a

                             written statement or recollection

                             concerning the duties in relation to

                              the Semi-Final match on the 15th of

                             April (150489).    I have here that

                             document which it may be necessary to

                             refer to.

03.41    C COUGHLIN          Well again I I, we would reserve our

                             position and we don't wish to consider

                             any documents at this time.

         CC SHARP            Thank you.    I have cautioned you.   It

                             is my wish to ask you certain

                             questions which arise from that

                             transcript of evidence, from the other

                             evidence which has been massed during

                             this inquiry and from your statanent

                             of recollection.    Are you willing to

                             answer any of my questions?

04.09    C COUGHLIN          Well on the advice of both myself as

                             his solicitor and, and other legal

                             advisers, Chief Superintendent
DUCKENFIELD           DAVID GODFREY


                              DUCKENFIELD will not be answering the

                              questions today.

         CC SHARP             In that case from what you've just

                              said, there doesn't seen to be any

                              point in me putting any further

                              questions to you.

         C COUGHLIN           I think that's correct.

04.32    CC SHARP             Now is there a notice about the tapes?

                              This is the notice which I told you

                              about at the start of this interview.

                             A file of evidence is with the

                              Director of Public Prosecutions and a

                             copy of this interview will be

                              forwarded to his office.   The Director

                             of Public Prosecutions will consider

                              if the evidence justifies any criminal

                             proceedings against you for the

                             offences I outlined at the start, that

                             is for Manslaughter or for Culpable

                             Malfeasance, which is for failing to

                             do your duty.   Do you understand?

         DGD                 Yes.

         CC SHARP            I'm now switching off the recorder and

                             this interview is terminated at 10.41

                              (1041) and 30 seconds on the 3rd of

05.17                        July 1990 (030790).

                            same time that certain members of the

                            public decided to make specific

                            allegations against named police

                            officers.     You are one of those

                            officers Mr DUCKENFIELD.    And I now

                            intend to deal with the discipline

                            aspects of this inquiry and I know

                            that Mr COUGHLIN your solicitor is

                            present.     You will recall that you

01.45                      were served with Regulation 7 Notices

                            under the Police Discipline Regula­

                            tions 1985 (000085).     These are the

                            notices.    Would you just cast your

                            eyes over them and let me know if you

                            recall them.

01.58                      (Pause). (Background talk)

02.50    CC SHARP           Do you wish me to read out those

                            notices in full.     I notice that you




                                                                             3397
DUCKENFIELD           DAVID GODFREY


                              have same copies there and before you

                              say anything can I just draw your

                              attention to the formal caution which

                              is at the bottom of the form, which

                              says you're not obliged to say

                              anything unless you wish to do so but

                              anything you say may be used in any

                              disciplinary proceedings.

         DGD                 I understand that.

         CC SHARP            You understand that.    Now it is my

                              intention to ask you seme questions

                              about those forms.    Have you any

                              objection to answering any questions

                              on the form?

03.21    C COUGHLIN          Well I think the position on the

                              discipline aspects of the case were

                             made clear in our letter to you Mr

                              SHARP of the 25th of June 1990

                              (250690), which essentially is that

                              David has been advised by myself and

                              his legal advisers that whilst there's

                              any possibility of prosecution for any

                              criminal matters then he would wish to

                              reserve his position in relation to

                              the discipline notices.     However, once

                              the discipline, the criminal aspects

                              have been dealt with then Chief Sup...

                              Superintendent DUCKENFIELD would wish

                             to, to assist as far as he can with
DUCKENFIELD         DAVID GODFREY


                            regard to the discipline matters.

04.05    CC SHARP           In that case if you don't intend to

                            answer any of my questions I don't

                            intend to put any further questions to

                            you.    The facts will be reported to

                            your Chief Constable and it will be

                            for your Force, in consult         in

                            consultation with the Police

                            Complaints Authority to determine if

                            you should face any discipline

                            offences.    Do you understand?

                            (No reply)

         CC SHARP           I'm now terminating the interview at

                            10.47 (1047) and 30 seconds.      Please

04.34                       switch off the recorder.

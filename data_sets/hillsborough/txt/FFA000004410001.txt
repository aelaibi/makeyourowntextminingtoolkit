 Dear Jo,

                                                F. A. Cup Semi-Final

      During our meeting on Wednesday, 19th April, reference was made
 to   the possible payment to the St. John's Ambulance Brigade for
 attending Football League matches.

       The Football League have advised me that they have no
 Regulation that says that the St. John's Ambulance Brigade must be
 there.    Not all Clubs use the St. John's Ambulance Brigade; some
 use the Red Cross.    In 197 7 The Football League wrote to all
 Football League Clubs and issued a recommendation that the
 St. John's Ambulance Brigade should be paid at the rate of £2. 00 per
 1, 000 spectators present.

      For your information I attach herewith a note of the
 contributions made to the St. John's Ambulance Brigade from The
 Football Association Charity Shield Match between 1982 and 1988.

             Kind regards.

                                                    Yours sincerely




                                             Administration Manager

 TDC 570 Stoker F2 C I D - Duties In Connection With Semi Final At SWFC 15«^.89*                      f



At 9axn on Saturday 15 April 1989 I paraded for duty at E c d e s f i e l d Police Station# Duties
in connection with the semi final at Hillsborough,
Transport was provided to the ground where I attended the briefing at approximately 10am,
I* was engaged in CID duties at the ground# My particular duties that day were to take up
position within the gymnasium at the ground and take reports of crime related matters from
persons attending and in the vicinity of the stadium.
Detective Sergeant Lindley was the supervisory officer responsible for me that day. Other
officers in my serial were DC's Hall a n d Blake,
After the briefing I toured the area of the ground with DC Blake prior to standing by within
the gymnasium.
Took report of theft from a young Liverpool supporter who- had £10,00 stolen from him by a
supposed ticket tout.
Shortly after kick off and whilst in the gymnasium I saw that about 20 uniformed officers
hurriedly left that building,        v o o v ‘S.v n c Tw j —           .
With DC Hall I went to the ground floor tunnel at the end of the North Stand (Farthest
from Leppings Lane) - I could see the playing area from this point at the end of the tunnel
and most of the area occupied by supporters,
I could see that play was not in progress and numerous supporters were congregated around
the Leppings Lane goal area,
DC Blake came to this point shortly after this and he had a radio as I recall but I could
not hear transmissions due to loud jeering from all around.
Most of the    fans in the North stand were standing up out    of         their seats.
As far as I   was concerned simply another pitch invasion had             occurred,
I saw 2 fans believed Liverpool run up from Leppings lane End - up the pitch and gesticulate
towards Notts Forest fans in the new covered stand* First a y ou n g man then an elderly man
both of whom were arrested on the pitch. These two people seemed to cause more shouting and
abuse from both where I was stood and the new stand.
An ambulance drove onto the pitch and drove to the Leppings Lane end. Police reinforcements
went onto the pitch and formed a cordon down the centre.
I started to walk down the pitch with DC Hall and passed        DS        Lindley walking down the other way.
I heard him   say that about 20 people had died. I lost DC      Hall amongst the crowd at Leppings
Lane end. I could see at least 5 fans lying on the pitch being attended to by Police/Ambulance
crew and members of the public.                      (N?                _
I was not aware that many more people were dead just a few yards farther on. Many supporters
were milling around, crying and shouting abuse. I started to assist with one apparently
dead young man by helping with cardiac massage. This was taken over by persons already
around him including a uniformed male officer. I rendered assistance in moving this person
away from the pitch but again this was taken over by people who x^ere already with him.
I returned to the gymnasium to ascertain what further action was to be taken re this
incident and speak with DS Lindley.
I was not aware of the scale of casualties at that time before returning to the gym.
At the gym bodies were being brought in one after another. I assisted in removing all
furniture from the floor space then started laying out bodies. The atmosphere at that time
was dreadful and chaotic.
Ch/Supt Addis attended at the gym within a short time and instructed myself and other
officers there. This was mainly that the officer who brought the body in to remain there
until further notice and CID officers to assist with establishing identities.
With DS Lindley and other officers I assisted in this process and placed bodies into
body bags.
There were not sufficient bags at that time. About 70 bodies were in the gym at that time
although I did not physically count them.
Throughout all this DS Lindley was carrying out the same duties and rendering help and
support all around. I personally benefited from this as I found this situation distressing
and upsetting however I found that I was able to perform these necessary functions and for
the time being supress my own feelings.
                                                                           z
 At about ?pm I attended at Hammerton Road Police Station and assisted DS Lindley in
 the compilation of a witness list.
 D/Supt MCKay gave a briefing there and explained that ID procedures with relatives were
- to follow.
 Between 9»30pm and 11pm I took missing person reports from relatives at Hammerton Road,
 Shortly after 11pm I attended back in the gymnasium with DS Lindley, DC Hall and DC's
 Blake and Lindsay.
 There I teamed up with DC O'Brian and began the identification process with relatives.
 This was basically to obtain a CJA from the respective relative once he/she had
  identified a body to the uniformed officer completing the Gen 18,
 I carried on with this until shortly after 5am. When I returned toEcclesfield   with
 DS Lindley and other collegues.


This is the first time I have worked a semi final match at Hillsborough whilst in CID,
I have worked at that ground many times since July 1980. Policing there has always been
of a very high standard and the safety record was excellent.
I recall a Sunday Newspaper some years ago doing a large spread with pictures showing
the high standard of Policing carried out at" this stadium.
I have attended many briefings at this stadium and all the semi finals. Nothing seemed to
have been done diiferently this year and yet all the other previous matches passed without
incident .        \ V0o
The last semi finalfcprior to this was last year. I worked in the South Stand seating
■area. The only thing I recall was that some Liverpool fans invaded the pitch at some ptotn
I did not witness any of the incident or its build up.

                         HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



              The Home Secretary was grateful for your
        minute of 31 May reporting the latest information
        on the progress of Sir Peter Taylor's inquiry.

        2.    The Home Secretary took the view that there
        were not enough fresh developments for it to be
        worth my writing to No 10 at this stage.  No doubt
        Mr Turney will keep officials in other Departments
        informed as necessary.
